37493265	plays and puritans 1  by charles kingsley     the british isles have been ringing for the last few years with the word art in its german sense with high art symbolic art ecclesiastical art dramatic art tragic art and so forth and every welleducated person is expected nowadays to know something about art  yet in spite of all translations of german aesthetic treatises and kunstnovellen the mass of the british people cares very little about the matter and sits contented under the imputation of bad taste  our stage long since dead does not revive our poetry is dying our music like our architecture only reproduces the past our painting is only firstrate when it handles landscapes and animals and seems likely so to remain but meanwhile nobody cares  some of the deepest and most earnest minds vote the question in general a sham and a snare and whisper to each other confidentially that gothic art is beginning to be a bore and that sir christopher wren was a very good fellow after all while the middle classes look on the art movement half amused as with a pretty toy half sulkily suspicious of popery and paganism and think apparently that art is very well when it means nothing and is merely used to beautify drawingrooms and shawl patterns not to mention that if there were no painters mr smith could not hand down to posterity likenesses of himself mrs smith and family  but when art dares to be in earnest and to mean something much more to connect itself with religion smiths tone alters  he will teach art to keep in what he considers its place and if it refuses take the law of it and put it into the ecclesiastical court  so he says and what is more he means what he says and as all the world from hindostan to canada knows by most practical proof what he means he sooner or later does perhaps not always in the wisest way but still he does it  thus in fact the temper of the british nation toward art is simply that of the old puritans softened no doubt and widened but only enough so as to permit art not to encourage it  some mens thoughts on this curious fact would probably take the form of some aesthetic a priori disquisition beginning with the tendency of the infinite to reveal itself in the finite and endingwho can tell where  but as we cannot honestly arrogate to ourselves any skill in the scientia scientiarum or say the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old  when he prepared the heavens i was there when he set a compass upon the face of the deep we shall leave aesthetic science to those who think that they comprehend it we shall as simple disciples of bacon deal with facts and with history as the will of god revealed in facts  we will leave those who choose to settle what ought to be and ourselves look patiently at that which actually was once and which may be again that so out of the conduct of our old puritan forefathers right or wrong and their long war against art we may learn a wholesome lesson as we doubtless shall if we believe firmly that our history is neither more nor less than what the old hebrew prophets called gods gracious dealings with his people and not say in our hearts like some sentimental girl who sings jacobite ballads written forty years ago by men who cared no more for the stuarts than for the ptolemies and were ready to kiss the dust off george the fourths feet at his visit to edinburghvictrix causa diis placuit sed victa puellis  the historian of a time of change has always a difficult and invidious task  for revolutions in the great majority of cases arise not merely from the crimes of a few great men but from a general viciousness and decay of the whole or the majority of the nation and that viciousness is certain to be made up in great part of a loosening of domestic ties of breaches of the seventh commandment and of sins connected with them which a writer is now hardly permitted to mention  an evil and adulterous generation has been in all ages and countries the one marked out for intestine and internecine strife  that description is always applicable to a revolutionary generation whether or not it also comes under the class of a superstitious one seeking after a sign from heaven only half believing its own creed and therefore on tiptoe for miraculous confirmations of it at the same time that it fiercely persecutes any one who by attempting innovation or reform seems about to snatch from weak faith the last plank which keeps it from sinking into the abyss  in describing such an age the historian lies under this paradoxical disadvantage that his case is actually too strong for him to state it  if he tells the whole truth the easygoing and respectable multitude in easygoing and respectable days like these will either shut their ears prudishly to his painful facts or reject them as incredible unaccustomed as they are to find similar horrors and abominations among people of their own rank of whom they are naturally inclined to judge by their own standard of civilisation  thus if any one in justification of the reformation and the british hatred of popery during the sixteenth century should dare to detail the undoubted facts of the inquisition and to comment on them dramatically enough to make his readers feel about them what men who witnessed them felt he would be accused of a morbid love of horrors  if any one in order to show how the french revolution of 1793 was really gods judgment on the profligacy of the ancien regirne were to paint that profligacy as the men of the ancien regime unblushingly painted it themselves respectability would have a right to demand how dare you sir drag such disgusting facts from their merited oblivion  those again who are really acquainted with the history of henry the eighths marriages are well aware of facts which prove him to have been not a man of violent and lawless passions but of a cold temperament and a scrupulous conscience but which cannot be stated in print save in the most delicate and passing hints to be taken only by those who at once understand such matters and really wish to know the truth while young ladies in general will still look on henry as a monster in human form because no one dares or indeed ought to undeceive them by anything beyond bare assertion without proof  but what does it matter some one may say what young ladies think about history  this it matters that these young ladies will some day be mothers and as such will teach their children their own notions of modern history and that as long as men confine themselves to the teaching of roman and greek history and leave the history of their own country to be handled exclusively by their unmarried sisters so long will slanders superstitions and false political principles be perpetuated in the minds of our boys and girls  but a still worse evil arises from the fact that the historians case is often too strong to be stated  there is always a reactionary party or one at least which lingers sentimentally over the dream of past golden ages such as that of which cowley says with a sort of naive blasphemy at which one knows not whether to smile or sigh    when god the cause to me and men unknown forsook the royal houses and his own   these have full liberty to say all they can in praise of the defeated system but the historian has no such liberty to state the case against it  if he even asserts that he has counterfacts but dare not state them he is at once met with a praejudicium  the mere fact of his having ascertained the truth is imputed as a blame to him in a sort of prudish cant  what a very improper person he must be to like to dabble in such improper books that they must not even be quoted  if in selfdefence he desperately gives his facts he only increases the feeling against him whilst the reactionists hiding their blushing faces find in their modesty an excuse for avoiding the truth if on the other hand he content himself with bare assertion and with indicating the sources from whence his conclusions are drawn what care the reactionists  they know well that the public will not take the trouble to consult manuscripts state papers pamphlets rare biographies but will content themselves with readymade history and they therefore go on unblushing to republish their old romance leaving poor truth after she has been painfully haled up to the wells mouth to tumble miserably to the bottom of it again   in the face of this danger we will go on to say as much as we dare of the great cause puritans v players before our readers trusting to find some of them at least sufficiently unacquainted with the common notions on the point to form a fair decision   what those notions are is well known  very many of her majestys subjects are of opinion that the first half of the seventeenth century if the puritans had not interfered and spoilt all was the most beautiful period of the english nations life that in it the chivalry and ardent piety of the middle age were happily combined with modern art and civilisation that the puritan hatred of the court of stageplays of the fashions of the time was only a scrupulous and fantastical niceness barbaric and tasteless if sincere if insincere the basest hypocrisy that the stageplays though coarse were no worse than shakspeare whom everybody reads and that if the stuarts patronised the stage they also raised it and exercised a purifying censorship  and many more who do not go all these lengths with the reactionists and cannot make up their mind to look to the stuart reigns either for model churchmen or model courtiers are still inclined to sneer at the puritan preciseness and to say lazily that though of course something may have been wrong yet there was no need to make such a fuss about the matter and that at all events the puritans were men of very bad taste  mr gifford in his introduction to massingers plays 1813 was probably the spokesman of his own generation certainly of a great part of this generation also when he informs us that with massinger terminated the triumph of dramatic poetry indeed the stage itself survived him but a short time  the nation was convulsed to its centre by contending factions and a set of austere and gloomy fanatics enemies to every elegant amusement and every social relaxation rose upon the ruins of the state  exasperated by the ridicule with which they had long been covered by the stage they persecuted the actors with unrelenting severity and consigned them together with the writers to hopeless obscurity and wretchedness taylor died in the extreme of poverty shirley opened a little school at brentford and downe the boast of the stage kept an alehouse at brentford  others and those the far greater number joined the royal standard and exerted themselves with more gallantry than good fortune in the service of their old and indulgent master  we have not yet perhaps fully estimated and certainly not yet fully recovered what was lost in that unfortunate struggle  the arts were rapidly advancing to perfection under the fostering wing of a monarch who united in himself taste to feel spirit to undertake and munificence to reward  architecture painting and poetry were by turns the objects of his paternal care  shakspeare was his closet companion jonson his poet and in conjunction with inigo jones his favoured architect produced those magnificent entertainments etc      he then goes on to account for the supposed sudden fall of dramatic art at the restoration by the somewhat farfetched theory that    such was the horror created in the general mind by the perverse and unsocial government from which they had so fortunately escaped that the people appear to have anxiously avoided all retrospect and with prynne and vicars to have lost sight of shakspeare and his fellows  instead therefore of taking up dramatic poetry where it abruptly ceased in the labours of massinger they elicited as it were a manner of their own or fetched it from the heavy monotony of their continental neighbours   so is history written and what is more believed  the amount of misrepresentation in this passage which would probably pass current with most readers in the present day is quite ludicrous  in the first place it will hardly be believed that these words occur in an essay which after extolling massinger as one of the greatest poets of his age second indeed only to shakspeare also informs us and it seems quite truly that so far from having been really appreciated or patronised he maintained a constant struggle with adversitythat even the bounty of his particular friends on which he chiefly relied left him in a state of absolute dependencethat while other writers for the stage had their periods of good fortune massinger seems to have enjoyed no gleam of sunshine his life was all one misty day and shadows clouds and darkness rested on it  so much for charless patronage of a really great poet  what sort of men he did patronise practically and in earnest we shall see hereafter when we come to speak of mr shirley  but mr gifford must needs give an instance to prove that charles was not inattentive to the success of massinger and a curious one it is of the same class unfortunately as that with the man in the old story who recorded with pride that the king had spoken to him and had told him to get out of the way  massinger in his king and the subject had introduced don pedro of spain thus speaking    monies  well raise supplies which way we please and force you to subscribe to blanks in which well mulct you as we shall think fit  the caesars in rome were wise acknowledging no law but what their swords did ratify the wives and daughters of the senators bowing to their will as deities etc   against which passage charles reading over the play before he allowed of it had written this is too insolent and not to be printed  too insolent it certainly was considering the state of public matters in the year 1638  it would be interesting enough to analyse the reasons which made charles dislike in the mouth of pedro sentiments so very like his own but we must proceed only pointing out the way in which men determined to repeat the traditional clap trap about the stuarts are actually blind to the meaning of the very facts which they themselves quote  where then do the facts of history contradict mr gifford  we believe that so far from the triumph of dramatic poetry terminating with massinger dramatic art had been steadily growing worse from the first years of james that instead of the arts advancing to perfection under charles the first they steadily deteriorated in quality though the supply became more abundant that so far from there having been a sudden change for the worse in the drama after the restoration the taste of the courts of charles the first and of charles the second are indistinguishable that the court poets and probably the actors also of the early part of charles the seconds reign had many of them belonged to the court of charles the first as did davenant the duke and duchess of newcastle fanshaw and shirley himself that the common notion of a new manner having been introduced from france after the restoration or indeed having come in at all is not founded on fact the only change being that the plays of charles the seconds time were somewhat more stupid and that while five of the seven deadly sins had always had free licence on the stage blasphemy and profane swearing were now enfranchised to fill up the seven  as for the assertion that the new manner supposing it to have existed was imported from france there is far more reason to believe that the french copied us than we them and that if they did not learn from charles the firsts poets the superstition of the three unities they at least learnt to make ancient kings and heroes talk and act like seventeenth century courtiers and to exchange their old clumsy masques and translations of italian and spanish farces for a comedy depicting native scoundrelism  probably enough indeed the great and sudden development of the french stage which took place in the middle of the seventeenth century under corneille and moliere was excited by the english cavalier playwrights who took refuge in france  no doubt as mr gifford says the puritans were exasperated against the stageplayers by the insults heaped on them but the cause of quarrel lay far deeper than any such personal soreness  the puritans had attacked the players before the players meddled with them and that on principle with what justification must be considered hereafter  but the fact is and this seems to have been like many other facts conveniently forgotten that the puritans were by no means alone in their protest against the stage and that the war was not begun exclusively by them  as early as the latter half of the sixteenth century not merely northbrooke gosson stubs and reynolds had lifted up their voices against them but archbishop parker bishop babington bishop hall and the author of the mirror for magistrates  the university of oxford in 1584 had passed a statute forbidding common plays and players in the university on the very same moral grounds on which the puritans objected to them  the city of london in 1580 had obtained from the queen the suppression of plays on sundays and not long after considering that play houses and dicinghouses were traps for young gentlemen and others obtained leave from the queen and privy council to thrust the players out of the city and to pull down the playhouses five in number and paradoxical as it may seem there is little doubt that by the letter of the law stage plays and enterludes were even to the end of charles the firsts reign unlawful pastime being forbidden by 14 eliz 39 eliz 1 jacobi 3 jacobi and 1 caroli and the players subject to severe punishment as rogues and vagabonds  the act of 1 jacobi seems even to have gone so far as to repeal the clauses which in elizabeths reign had allowed companies of players the protection of a baron or honourable person of greater degree who might authorise them to play under his hand and seal of arms  so that the puritans were only demanding of the sovereigns that they should enforce the very laws which they themselves had made and which they and their nobles were setting at defiance  whether the plays ought to have been put down and whether the laws were necessary is a different question but certainly the court and the aristocracy stood in the questionable though too common position of men who made laws which prohibited to the poor amusements in which they themselves indulged without restraint  but were these plays objectionable  as far as the comedies are concerned that will depend on the answer to the question are plays objectionable the staple subject of which is adultery  now we cannot but agree with the puritans that adultery is not a subject for comedy at all  it may be for tragedy but for comedy never  it is a sin not merely theologically but socially one of the very worst sins the parent of seven other sinsof falsehood suspicion hate murder and a whole bevy of devils  the prevalence of adultery in any country has always been a sign and a cause of social insincerity division and revolution where a people has learnt to connive and laugh at it and to treat it as a light thing that people has been always careless base selfish cowardlyripe for slavery  and we must say that either the courtiers and londoners of james and charles the first were in that state or that the poets were doing their best to make them so  we shall not shock our readers by any details on this point we shall only say that there is hardly a comedy of the seventeenth century with the exception of shakspeares in which adultery is not introduced as a subject of laughter and often made the staple of the whole plot  the seducer is if not openly applauded at least let to pass as a handsome gentleman the injured husband is as in that italian literature of which we shall speak shortly the object of every kind of scorn and ridicule  in this latter habit common to most european nations there is a sort of justice  a man can generally retain his wifes affections if he will behave himself like a man and injured husbands have for the most part no one to blame but themselves  but the matter is not a subject for comedy not even in that case which has been always too common in france italy and the romish countries and which seems to have been painfully common in england in the seventeenth century when by a mariage de convenance a young girl is married up to a rich idiot or a decrepit old man  such things are not comedies but tragedies subjects for pity and for silence not for brutal ribaldry  therefore the men who look on them in the light which the stuart dramatists looked are not good men and do no good service to the country especially when they erect adultery into a science and seem to take a perverse pleasure in teaching their audience every possible method accident cause and consequence of it always too when they have an opportunity pointing eastward ho ie to the city of london as the quarter where court gallants can find boundless indulgence for their passions amid the fair wives of dull and cowardly citizens  if the citizens drove the players out of london the playwrights took good care to have their revenge  the citizen is their standard butt  these shallow parasites and their shallower sovereigns seem to have taken a perverse and as it happened a fatal pleasure in insulting them sad it is to see in shirleys gamester charles the firsts favourite play a passage like that in act i scene 1 where old barnacle proclaims unblushing his own shame and that of his fellow merchants  surely if charles ever could have repented of any act of his own he must have repented in many a humiliating afterpassage with that same city of london of having given those base words his royal warrant and approbation  the tragedies of the seventeenth century are on the whole as questionable as the comedies  that there are noble plays among them here and there no one deniesany more than that there are exquisitely amusing plays among the comedies but as the staple interest of the comedies is dirt so the staple interest of the tragedies is crime  revenge hatred villany incest and murder upon murder are their constant themes and with the exception of shakspeare ben jonson in his earlier plays and perhaps massinger they handle these horrors with little or no moral purpose save that of exciting and amusing the audience and of displaying their own power of delineation in a way which makes one but too ready to believe the accusations of the puritans supported as they are by many ugly anecdotes that the playwriters and actors were mostly men of fierce and reckless lives who had but too practical an acquaintance with the dark passions which they sketch  this is notoriously the case with most of the french novelists of the modern literature of horror and the two literatures are morally identical  we do not know of a complaint which can be justly brought against the school of balzac and dumas which will not equally apply to the average tragedy of the whole period preceding the civil wars  this public appetite for horrors for which they catered so greedily tempted them toward another mistake which brought upon them and not undeservedly heavy odium  one of the worst counts against dramatic art as well as against pictorial was the simple fact that it came from italy  we must fairly put ourselves into the position of an honest englishman of the seventeenth century before we can appreciate the huge praejudicium which must needs have arisen in his mind against anything which could claim a transalpine parentage  italy was then not merely the stronghold of popery  that in itself would have been a fair reason for others beside puritans saying if the root be corrupt the fruit will be also  any expression of italian thought and feeling must be probably unwholesome while her vitals are being eaten out by an abominable falsehood only half believed by the masses and not believed at all by the higher classes even those of the priesthood but only kept up for their private aggrandisement  but there was more than hypothesis in favour of the men who might say this there was universal notorious shocking fact  it was a fact that italy was the centre where sins were invented worthy of the doom of the cities of the plain and from whence they spread to all nations who had connection with her  we dare give no proof of this assertion  the italian morals and the italian lighter literature of the sixteenth and of the beginning of the seventeenth century were such that one is almost ashamed to confess that one has looked into them although the painful task is absolutely necessary for one who wishes to understand either the european society of the time or the puritan hatred of the drama  non ragionam di lor  ma guarda e passa  it is equally a fact that these vices were imported into england by the young men who under pretence of learning the italian polish travelled to italy  from the days of gabriel harvey and lord oxford about the middle of elizabeths reign this foul tide had begun to set toward england gaining an additional coarseness and frivolity in passing through the french court then an utter gehenna in its course hitherward till to judge by marstons satires certain members of the higher classes had by the beginning of jamess reign learnt nearly all which the italians had to teach them  marston writes in a rage it is true foaming stamping and vapouring too much to escape the suspicion of exaggeration yet he dared not have published the things which he does had he not fair ground for some at least of his assertions  and marston be it remembered was no puritan but a playwright and ben jonsons friend  bishop hall in his satires describes things bad enough though not so bad as marston does but what is even more to the purpose he wrote and dedicated to james a long dissuasive against the fashion of running abroad  whatever may be thought of the arguments of quo vadisa censure of travel its main drift is clear enough  young gentlemen by going to italy learnt to be fops and profligates and probably papists into the bargain  these assertions there is no denying  since the days of lord oxford most of the ridiculous and expensive fashions in dress had come from italy as well as the newest modes of sin and the playwrights themselves make no secret of the fact  there is no need to quote instances they are innumerable and the most serious are not fit to be quoted scarcely the titles of the plays in which they occur but they justify almost every line of bishop halls questions of which some of the strongest expressions have necessarily been omitted   what mischief have we among us which we have not borrowed  to begin at our skin  who knows not whence we had the variety of our vain disguises  as if we had not wit enough to be foolish unless we were taught it  these dresses being constant in their mutability show us our masters  what is it that we have not learned of our neighbours save only to be proud goodcheap whom would it not vex to see how that the other sex hath learned to make anticks and monsters of themselves  whence come their absurd fashions but the one from some illshaped dame of france the other from the worseminded courtesans of italy  whence else learned they to daub these mudwalls with apothecaries mortar and those high washes which are so cunningly licked on that the wet napkin of phryne should he deceived  whence the frizzled and powdered bushes of their borrowed hair  as if they were ashamed of the head of gods making and proud of the tirewomans  where learned we that devilish art and practice of duel wherein men seek honour in blood and are taught the ambition of being glorious butchers of men  where had we that luxurious delicacy in our feasts in which the nose is no less pleased than the palate and the eye no less than either wherein the piles of dishes make barricadoes against the appetite and with a pleasing encumbrance trouble a hungry guest  where those forms of ceremonious quaffing in which men have learned to make gods of others and beasts of themselves and lose their reason while they pretend to do reason  where the lawlessness miscalled freedom of a wild tongue that runs with reins on the neck through the bedchambers of princes their closets their council tables and spares not the very cabinet of their breasts much less can be barred out of the most retired secrecy of inferior greatness  where the change of noble attendance and hospitality into four wheels and some few butterflies  where the art of dishonesty in practical machiavelism in false equivocations  where the slight account of that filthiness which is but condemned as venial and tolerated as not unnecessary  where the skill of civil and honourable hypocrisy in those formal compliments which do neither expect belief from others nor carry any from ourselves  where and here bishop hall begins to speak concerning things on which we must be silent as of matters notorious and undeniable  where that close atheism which secretly laughs god in the face and thinks it weakness to believe wisdom to profess any religion  where the bloody and tragical science of kingkilling the new divinity of disobedience and rebellion with too many other evils wherewith foreign conversation hath endangered the infection of our peacebishop halls quo vadis or a censure of travel vol xii sect 22   add to these a third plain fact that italy was the mothercountry of the drama where it had thriven with wonderful fertility ever since the beginning of the sixteenth century  however much truth there may be in the common assertion that the old miracle plays and mysteries were the parents of the english drama as they certainly were of the spanish and the italian we have yet to learn how much our stage owed from its first rise under elizabeth to direct importations from italy  this is merely thrown out as a suggestion to establish the fact would require a wide acquaintance with the early italian drama meanwhile let two patent facts have their due weight  the names of the characters in most of our early regular comedies are italian so are the scenes and so one hopes are the manners at least they profess to be so  next the plots of many of the dramas are notoriously taken from the italian novelists and if shakspeare who had a truly divine instinct for finding honey where others found poison went to cinthio for othello and measure for measure to bandello for romeo and juliet and to boccaccio for cymbeline there were plenty of other playwrights who would go to the same sources for worse matter or at least catch from these profligate writers somewhat of their italian morality which exalts adultery into a virtue seduction into a science and revenge into a duty which revels in the horrible as freely as any french novelist of the romantic school and whose only value is its pitiless exposure of the profligacy of the romish priesthood  if an exposure can be valuable which makes a mock equally of things truly and falsely sacred and leaves on the readers mind the fear that the writer saw nothing in heaven or earth worthy of belief respect or self sacrifice save personal enjoyment  now this is the morality of the italian novelists and to judge from their vivid sketches which they do not scruple to assert were drawn from life and for which they give names places and all details which might amuse the noble gentlemen and ladies to whom these stories are dedicated this had been the morality of italy for some centuries past  this also is the general morality of the english stage in the seventeenth century  can we wonder that thinking men should have seen a connection between italy and the stage  certainly the playwrights put themselves between the horns of an ugly dilemma  either the vices which they depicted were those of general english society and of themselves also for they lived in the very heart of town and court foppery or else they were the vices of a foreign country with which the english were comparatively unacquainted  in the first case we can only say that the stuart age in england was one which deserved purgation of the most terrible kind and to get rid of which the severest and most abnormal measures would have been not only justifiable but to judge by the experience of all history necessary for extraordinary diseases never have been and never will be eradicated save by extraordinary medicines in the second case the playwrights were wantonly defiling the minds of the people and instead of holding up a mirror to vice instructing frail virtue in vices which she had not learned and fully justifying old prynnes indignant complaint    the acting of foreign obsolete and long since forgotten villanies on the stage is so far from working a detestation of them in the spectators minds who perchance were utterly ignorant of them till they were acquainted with them at the playhouse and so needed no dehortation from them that it often excites dangerous dunghill spirits who have nothing in them for to make them eminent to reduce them into practice of purpose to perpetuate their spurious ill serving memories to posterity leastwise in some tragic interlude   that prynne spoke herein nought but sober sense our own police reports will sufficiently prove  it is notorious that the representation in our own days of tom and jerry and of jack sheppard did excite dozens of young lads to imitate the heroes of those dramas and such must have been the effect of similar and worse representations in the stuart age  no rational man will need the authority of bishop babington doctor leighton archbishop parker purchas sparkes reynolds white or any one else churchman or puritan prelate or penitent reclaimed playpoet like stephen gosson to convince him that as they assert citizens wives who are generally represented as the proper subjects for seduction have even on their deathbeds with tears confessed that they have received at these spectacles such evil infections as have turned their minds from chaste cogitations and made them of honest women light huswives    have brought their husbands into contempt their children into question    and their souls into the assault of a dangerous state or that the devices of carrying and re carrying letters by laundresses practising with pedlars to transport their tokens by colourable means to sell their merchandise and other kinds of policies to beguile fathers of their children husbands of their wives guardians of their wards and masters of their servants were aptly taught in these schools of abuse 2  the matter is simple enough  we should not allow these plays to be acted in our own day because we know that they would produce their effects  we should call him a madman who allowed his daughters or his servants to see such representations 3  why in all fairness were the puritans wrong in condemning that which we now have absolutely forbidden  we will go no further into the details of the licentiousness of the old playhouses  gosson and his colleague the anonymous penitent assert them as does prynne to have been not only schools but antechambers to houses of a worse kind and that the lessons learned in the pit were only not practised also in the pit  what reason have we to doubt it who know that till mr macready commenced a practical reformation of this abuse for which his name will be ever respected our own comparatively purified stage was just the same  let any one who remembers the saloons of drury lane and covent garden thirty years ago judge for himself what the accessories of the globe or the fortune must have been in days when players were allowed to talk inside as freely as the public behaved outside  not that the poets or the players had any conscious intention of demoralising their hearers any more than they had of correcting them  we will lay on them the blame of no special malus animus but at the same time we must treat their fine words about holding a mirror up to vice and showing the age its own deformity as mere cant which the men themselves must have spoken tongue in cheek it was as much an insincere cant in those days as it was when two generations later jeremy collier exposed its falsehood in the mouth of congreve  if the poets had really intended to show vice its own deformity they would have represented it as shakspeare always does as punished and not as triumphant  it is ridiculous to talk of moral purpose in works in which there is no moral justice  the only condition which can excuse the representation of evil is omitted the simple fact is that the poets wanted to draw a house that this could most easily be done by the coarsest and most violent means and that not being often able to find stories exciting enough in the past records of sober english society they went to italy and spain for the violent passions and wild crimes of southern temperaments excited and yet left lawless by a superstition believed in enough to darken and brutalise but not enough to control its victims those were the countries which just then furnished that strange mixture of inward savagery with outward civilisation which is the immoral playwrights fittest material because while the inward savagery moves the passions of the audience the outward civilisation brings the character near enough to them to give them a likeness of themselves in their worst moments such as no mystery of cain or tragedy of prometheus can give  does this seem too severe in the eyes of those who value the drama for its lessons in human nature  on that special point something must be said hereafter  meanwhile hear one of the sixteenth century poets one who cannot be suspected of any leaning toward puritanism one who had as high notions of his vocation as any man and one who so far fulfilled those notions as to become a dramatist inferior only to shakspeare  let ben jonson himself speak and in his preface to volpone tell us in his own noble prose what he thought of the average morality of his contemporary playwrights   for if men will impartially and not asquint look toward the offices and functions of a poet they will easily conclude to themselves the impossibility of any mans being a good poet without first being a good man  he that is said to be able to inform young men to all good discipline inflame grown men to all great virtues keep old men in their best and supreme state or as they decline to childhood recover them to their first strength that comes forth the interpreter and arbiter of nature a teacher of things divine no less than human a master in manners and can alone or with a few effect the business of mankind this i take him is no subject for pride and ignorance to exercise their railing rhetoric upon  but it will here be hastily answered that the writers of these days are other things that not only their manners but their natures are inverted and nothing remaining of them of the dignity of poet but the abused name which every scribe usurps that now especially in dramatick or as they term it stage poetry nothing but ribaldry profanation blasphemies all licence of offence toward god and man is practised i dare not deny a great part of this and i am sorry i dare not because in some mens abortive features and would god they had never seen the light it is over true but that all are bound on his bold adventure for hell is a most uncharitable thought and uttered a more malicious slander  for every particular i can and from a most clear conscience affirm that i have ever trembled to think toward the least profaneness and have loathed the use of such foul and unwashed    his expression is too strong for quotation as is now made the food of the scene   it is a pity to curtail this splendid passage both for its lofty ideal of poetry and for its corroboration of the puritan complaints against the stage but a few lines on a still stronger sentence occurs   the increase of which lust in liberty together with the present trade of the stage in all their masculine interludes what liberal soul doth not abhor  where nothing but filth of the mire is uttered and that with such impropriety of phrase such plenty of solecisms such dearth of sense so bold prolepses such racked metaphors with indecency able to violate the ear of a pagan and blasphemy to turn the blood of a christian to water   so speaks ben jonson in 1605 not finding it seems playwriting a peaceful trade or playpoets and playhearers improving company after him we should say no further testimony on this unpleasant matter ought to be necessary  he may have been morose fanatical exaggerative but his bitter words suggest at least this dilemma either they are true and the playhouse atmosphere as prynne says it was that of gehenna  or they are untrue and the mere fruits of spite and envy against more successful poets  and what does that latter prove but that the greatest poet of his age after shakspeare has gone was not as much esteemed as some poets whom we know to have been more filthy and more horrible than he which indeed is the main complaint of jonson himself  it will be rejoined of course that he was an altogether envious man that he envied shakspeare girded at his york and lancaster plays at the winters tale and the tempest in the prologue to every man in his humour and indeed jonsons writings and those of many other playwrights leave little doubt that stage rivalry called out the bitterest hatred and the basest vanity and that perhaps shakspeares great soul was giving way to the pettiest passions when in hamlet he had his fling at the aiery of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for t  it may be that he was girding in return at jonson when he complained that their writer did them wrong to make them complain against their own succession ie against themselves when grown to common players be that as it may  great shakspeare may have been unjust to only less great jonson as jonson was to shakspeare  but jonson certainly is not so in all his charges  some of the faults which he attributes to shakspeare are really faults  at all events we know that he was not unjust to the average of his contemporaries by the evidence of the mens own plays  we know that the decadence of the stage of which he complains went on uninterruptedly after his time and in the very direction which he pointed out  on this point there can be no doubt for these hodmen of poetry made a wall in our fathers house and the bricks are alive to testify unto this day  so that we cannot do better than give a few samples thereof at least samples decent enough for modern readers and let us begin not with a hodman but with jonson himself  now ben jonson is worthy of our love and respect for he was a very great genius immaculate or not rare ben with all his faults one can never look without affection on the magnificent manhood of that rich free forehead even though one may sigh over the petulance and pride which brood upon the lip and eyebrow   dowered with the hate of hate the scorn of scorn the love of love   a michael angelo who could laugh which that italian one one fancies never could  one ought to have too a sort of delicacy about saying much against him for he is dead and can make for the time being at least no rejoinder  there are dead men whom one is not much ashamed to upset after their death because one would not have been much afraid of doing so when they were alive  but rare ben had terrible teeth and used them too  a man would have thought twice ere he snapt at him living and therefore it seems somewhat a cowardly trick to bark securely at his ghost  nevertheless it is no unfair question to askdo not his own words justify the puritan complaints  but if so why does he rail at the puritans for making their complaints  his answer would have been that they railed in ignorance not merely at low art as we call it now but at high art and all art  be it so  here was their fault if fault it was in those days  for to discriminate between high art and low art they must have seen both  and for jonsons wrath to be fair and just he must have shown them both  let us see what the pure drama is like which he wishes to substitute for the foul drama of his contemporaries and to bring the matter nearer home let us take one of the plays in which he hits deliberately at the puritans namely the alchemist said to have been first acted in 1610 by the kings majestys servants  look then at this wellknown play and take jonson at his word  allow that ananias and tribulation wholesome are as they very probably are fair portraits of a class among the sectaries of the day  but bear in mind too that if this be allowed the other characters shall be held as fair portraits also otherwise all must he held to be caricature and then the onslaught on the puritans vanishes into nothing or worse  now in either case ananias and tribulation are the best men in the play  they palter with their consciences no doubt  but they have consciences which no one else in the play has except poor surly and he be it remembered comes to shame is made a laughingstock and cheats himself as he complains at last by that same foolish vice of honesty  while in all the rest what have we but every form of human baseness  lovell the master if he is to be considered a negative character as doing no wrong has at all events no more recorded of him than the noble act of marrying by deceit a young widow for the sake of her money the philosophers stone by the bye and highest object of most of the seventeenth century dramatists  if most of the rascals meet with due disgrace none of them is punished and the greatest rascal of all who when escape is impossible turns traitor and after deserving the cart and pillory a dozen times for his last and most utter baseness is rewarded by full pardon and the honour of addressing the audience at the plays end in the most smug and selfsatisfied tone and of putting himself on you that are my country not doubting it seems that there were among them a fair majority who would think him a very smart fellow worthy of all imitation  now is this play a moral or an immoral one  of its coarseness we say nothing  we should not endure it of course nowadays and on that point something must be said hereafter  but if we were to endure plain speaking as the only method of properly exposing vice should we endure the moral which instead of punishing vice rewards it  and meanwhile what sort of a general state of society among the antipuritan party does the play sketch  what but a background of profligacy and frivolity  a proof indeed of the general downward tendencies of the age may be found in the writings of ben jonson himself  howsoever pure and lofty the ideal which he laid down for himself and no doubt honestly in the preface to volpone he found it impossible to keep up to it  nine years afterwards we find him in his bartholomew fair catering to the low tastes of james the first in ribaldry at which if one must needs laughas who that was not more than man could help doing over that scene between rabbi busy and the puppets shallow and untrue as the gist of the humour is one feels the next moment as if one had been indulging in unholy mirth at the expense of some grand old noah who has come to shame in his cups  but lower still does jonson fall in that masque of the gipsies metamorphosed presented to the king in 1621 when jonson was forty seven old enough one would have thought to know better  it is not merely the insincere and all but blasphemous adulation which is shockingthat was but the fashion of the times  but the treating these gipsies and beggars and their thieves latin dialect their filthiness and cunning ignorance and recklessness merely as themes for immoral and inhuman laughter  jonson was by no means the only poet of that day to whom the hordes of profligate and heathen nomads which infested england were only a comical phase of humanity instead of being as they would be now objects of national shame and sorrow of pity and love which would call out in the attempt to redeem them the talents and energies of good men  but jonson certainly sins more in this respect than any of his contemporaries  he takes a low pleasure in parading his intimate acquaintance with these poor creatures foul slang and barbaric laws and is we should say the natural father of that lowest form of all literature which has since amused the herd though in a form greatly purified in the form of beggars operas dick turpins and jack sheppards  everything which is objectionable in such modern publications as these was exhibited in far grosser forms by one of the greatest poets who ever lived for the amusement of a king of england and yet the world still is at a loss to know why sober and godfearing men detested both the poet and the king  and that masque is all the more saddening exhibition of the degradation of a great soul because in it here and there occur passages of the old sweetness and grandeur disjecta membra poetae such as these which even although addressed to james are perfect   3rd gipsy  look how the winds upon the waves grow tame    take up land sounds upon their purple wings and catching each from other bear the same    to every angle of their sacred springs so will we take his praise and hurl his name    about the globe in thousand airy rings       let us pass on  why stay to look upon the fall of such a spirit  there is one point nevertheless which we may as well speak of here and shortly for spoken of it must be as delicately as is possible the laugh raised at zealfortheland busys expense in bartholomew fair turns on the puritan dislike of seeing womens parts acted by boys  jonson shirks the question by making poor busy fall foul of puppets instead of live human beings  but the question is shirked nevertheless  what honest answer he could have given to the puritans is hard to conceive  prynne in his histriomastix may have pushed a little too far the argument drawn from the prohibition in the mosaic law  yet one would fancy that the practice was forbidden by moses law not arbitrarily but because it was a bad practice which did harm as every antiquarian knows that it did and that therefore prynne was but reasonable in supposing that in his day a similar practice would produce a similar evil  our firm conviction is that it did so and that as to the matter of fact prynne was perfectly right and that to make a boy a stageplayer was pretty certainly to send him to the devil  let any man of common sense imagine to himself the effect on a young boys mind which would be produced by representing shamelessly before a public audience not merely the language but the passions of such women as occur in almost every play  we appeal to common sensewould any father allow his own children to personate even in private the basest of mankind  and yet we must beg pardon  for common sense it is to be supposed has decided against us as long as parents allow their sons to act yearly at westminster the stupid low art of terence while grave and reverend prelates and divines look on approving  the westminster play has had no very purifying influence on the minds of the young gentlemen who personate heathen damsels and we only ask what must have been the effect of representing far fouler characters than terences on the minds of uneducated lads of the lower classes prynne and others hint at still darker abominations than the mere defilement of the conscience  we shall say nothing of them but that from collateral evidence we believe every word they say and that when pretty little cupids mother in jonsons christmas masque tells how she could have had money enough for him had she been tempted and have let him out by the week to the kings players and how master burbadge has been about and about with her for him and old mr hemings too she had better have tied a stone round the childs neck and hove him over london bridge than have handed him over to thrifty burbadge that he might make out of his degradation more money to buy land withal and settle comfortably in his native town on the fruits of others sin  honour to old prynne bitter and narrow as he was for his passionate and eloquent appeals to the humanity and christianity of england in behalf of those poor children whom not a bishop on the bench interfered to save but while they were writing and persecuting in behalf of baptismal regeneration left those to perish whom they declared so stoutly to be regenerate in baptism  prynne used that argument too and declared these stageplays to be among the very pomps and vanities which christians renounced at baptism  he may or may not have been wrong in identifying them with the old heathen pantomimes and games of the circus and in burying his adversaries under a mountain of quotations from the fathers and the romish divines for prynnes reading seems to have been quite enormous  those very prelates could express reverence enough for the fathers when they found aught in them which could be made to justify their own system though perhaps it had really even less to do therewith than the roman pantomimes had with the globe theatre  but the church of england had retained in her catechism the old roman word pomps as one of the things which were to be renounced and as pomps confessedly meant at first those very spectacles of the heathen circus and theatre prynne could not be very illogical in believing that as it had been retained it was retained to testify against something and probably against the thing in england most like the pomps of heathen rome meanwhile let churchmen decide whether of the two was the better churchmanprynne who tried to make the baptismal covenant mean something or laud who allowed such a play as the ordinary to be written by his especial protege cartwright the oxford scholar and acted before him probably by oxford scholars certainly by christened boys  we do not pretend to pry into the counsels of the most high but if unfaithfulness to a high and holy trust when combined with lofty professions and pretensions does as all history tells us that it does draw down the vengeance of almighty god then we need look no further than this one neglect of the seventeenth century prelates whether its cause was stupidity insincerity or fear of the monarchs to whose tyranny they pandered to discover full reason why it pleased god to sweep them out awhile with the besom of destruction  there is another feature in the plays of the seventeenth century new as far as we know alike to english literature and manners and that is the apotheosis of rakes  let the faults of the middle age or of the tudors have been what they may that class of person was in their time simply an object of disgust  the word which then signified a rake is in the morte darthur temp ed iv the foulest term of disgrace which can be cast upon a knight whilst even up to the latter years of elizabeth the contempt of parents and elders seems to have been thought a grievous sin  in italy even fountain of all the abominations of the age respect for the fifth commandment seems to have lingered after all the other nine had been forgotten we find castiglione in his corteggiano about 1520 regretting the modest and respectful training of the generation which had preceded him and to judge from facts the puritan method of education stern as it was was neither more nor less than the method which a generation before had been common to romanist and to protestant puritan and churchman  but with the stuart era perhaps at the end of elizabeths reign fathers became gradually personages who are to be disobeyed sucked of their money fooled even now and then robbed and beaten by the young gentlemen of spirit and the most christian kings james and charles with their queens and court sit by to see ruffling and roystering beating the watch and breaking windows dicing drinking duelling and profligacy provided the victim be not a woman of gentle birth set forth not merely as harmless amusements for young gentlemen but as in beaumont and fletchers play of monsieur thomas virtues without which a man is despicable  on this point as on many others those who have for ecclesiastical reasons tried to represent the first half of the seventeenth century as a golden age have been altogether unfair  there is no immorality of the court plays of charles iis time which may not be found in those of charles is  sedley and etherege are not a whit worse but only more stupid than fletcher or shirley and monsieur thomas is the spiritual father of all angry lads rufflers blades bullies mohocks corinthians and dandies down to the last drunken clerk who wrenched off a knocker or robbed his masters till to pay his losses at a bettingoffice  true we of this generation can hardly afford to throw stones  the scapegrace ideal of humanity has enjoyed high patronage within the last half century and if monsieur thomas seemed lovely in the eyes of james and charles so did jerry and corinthian tom in those of some of the first gentlemen of england  better days however have dawned tom and jerry instead of running three hundred nights would be as little endured on the stage as monsieur thomas would be the heroes who aspire toward that ideal are now consigned by public opinion to rhadamanthus and the treadmill while if like monsieur thomas they knocked down their own father they would instead of winning a good wife be cut by braver and finer gentlemen than monsieur thomas himself  but what does this fact prove save that england has at last discovered that the puritan opinion of this matter as of some others was the right one  there is another aspect in which we must look at the stuart patronage of profligate scapegraces on the stage  they would not have been endured on the stage had they not been very common off it and if there had not been too in the hearts of spectators some lurking excuse for them  it requires no great penetration to see what that excuse must have been  if the stuart age aristocracy and court were as perfect as some fancy them such fellows would have been monstrous in it and inexcusable probably impossible  but if it was as it may be proved to have been an utterly deboshed insincere decrepit and decaying age then one cannot but look on monsieur thomas with something of sympathy as well as pity  take him as he stands he is a fellow of infinite kindliness wit spirit and courage but with nothing on which to employ those powers  he would have done his work admirably in an earnest and enterprising age as a hudsons bay company clerk an indian civilian a captain of a man ofwaranything where he could find a purpose and a work  doubt it not  how many a monsieur thomas of our own days whom a few years ago one had rashly fancied capable of nothing higher than coulisses and cigars private theatricals and white kid gloves has been not only fighting and working like a man but meditating and writing homeward like a christian through the dull misery of those trenches at sevastopol and has found amid the crimean snows that merciful fire of god which could burn the chaff out of his heart and thaw the crust of cold frivolity into warm and earnest life  and even at such a youths worst reason and conscience alike forbid us to deal out to him the same measure as we do to the offences of the cool and hoary profligate or to the darker and subtler spiritual sins of the false professor  but if the wrath of god be not unmistakably and practically revealed from heaven against youthful profligacy and disobedience in after sorrow and shame of some kind or other against what sin is it revealed  it was not left for our age to discover that the wages of sin is death  but charles his players and his courtiers refused to see what the very heathen had seen and so had to be taught the truth over again by another and a more literal lesson and what neither stageplays nor sermons could teach them sharp shot and cold steel did  but still the puritans were barbarians for hating art altogether the fact was that they hated what art they saw in england and that this was low art bad art growing ever lower and worse  if it be said that shakspeares is the very highest art the answer is that what they hated in him was not his high art but his low art the foul and horrible elements which he had in common with his brother playwriters  true there is far less of these elements in shakspeare than in any of his compeers  but they are there  and what the puritans hated in him was exactly what we have to expunge before we can now represent his plays  if it be said that they ought to have discerned and appreciated the higher elements in him so ought the rest of their generation  the puritans were surely not bound to see in shakspeare what his patrons and brother poets did not see  and it is surely a matter of fact that the deep spiritual knowledge which makes and will make shakspeares plays and them alone of all the seventeenth century plays a heritage for all men and all ages quite escaped the insight of his contemporaries who probably put him in the same rank which webster writing about 1612 has assigned to him   i have ever cherished a good opinion of other mens witty labours especially of that full and heightened style of master chapman the laboured and understanding works of mr jonson the no less witty composures of the both wittily excellent mr beaumont and mr fletcher and lastly without wrong last to be named the right happy and copious industry of shakspeare mr dekker and mr heywood   while webster then one of the best poets of the time sees nothing in shakspeare beyond the same happy and copious industry which he sees in dekker and heywoodwhile cartwright perhaps the only young poet of real genius in charles the firsts reign places fletchers name twixt jonsons grave and shakspeares lighter sound and tells him that   shakspeare to thee was dull whose best wit lies i th ladies questions and the fools replies      whose wit our nice times would obsceneness call      nature was all his art thy vein was free as his but without his scurrility 4   while even milton who puritan as he was loved art with all his soul only remarks on shakspeares marvellous lyrical sweetness his native woodnotes wild what shame to the puritans if they too did not discover the stork among the cranes  an answer has often been given to arguments of this kind which deserves a few moments consideration  it is said the grossness of the old playwriters was their misfortune not their crime  it was the fashion of the age  it is not our fashion certainly but they meant no harm by it  the age was a freespoken one and perhaps none the worse for that  mr dyce indeed the editor of websters plays seems inclined to exalt this habit into a virtue  after saying that the licentious and debauched are made as odious in representation as they would be if they were actually presentan assertion which must be flatly denied save in the case of shakspeare who seldom or never to our remembrance seems to forget that the wages of sin is death and who however coarse he may be keeps stoutly on the side of virtuemr dyce goes on to say that perhaps the language of the stage is purified in proportion as our morals are deteriorated and we dread the mention of the vices which we are not ashamed to practise while our forefathers under the sway of a less fastidious but a more energetic principle of virtue were careless of words and only considerate of actions  to this clever piece of special pleading we can only answer that the fact is directly contrary that there is a mass of unanimous evidence which cannot be controverted to prove that england in the first half of the seventeenth century was far more immoral than in the nineteenth that the proofs lie patent to any dispassionate reader but that these pages will not be defiled by the details of them  let it be said that coarseness was the fashion of the age  the simple question is was it a good fashion or a bad  it is saidwith little or no proofthat in simple states of society much manly virtue and much female purity have often consisted with very broad language and very coarse manners  but what of that  drunkards may very often be very honest and brave men  does that make drunkenness no sin  or will honesty and courage prevent a mans being the worse for hard drinking  if so why have we given up coarseness of language  and why has it been the better rather than the worse part of the nation the educated and religious rather than the ignorant and wicked who have given it up  why  simply because this nation and all other nations on the continent in proportion to their morality have found out that coarseness of language is to say the least unfit and inexpedient that if it be wrong to do certain things it is also on the whole right not to talk of them that even certain things which are right and blessed and holy lose their sanctity by being dragged cynically to the light of day instead of being left in the mystery in which god has wisely shrouded them  on the whole one is inclined to suspect the defence of coarseness as insincere  certainly in our day it will not hold  if any one wishes to hear coarse language in good society he can hear it i am told in paris  but one questions whether parisian society be now under the sway of a more energetic principle of virtue than our own  the sum total of the matter seems to be that england has found out that on this point again the old puritans were right  and quaintly enough the party in the english church who hold the puritans most in abhorrence are the most scrupulous now upon this very point and in their dread of contaminating the minds of youth are carrying education at school and college to such a more than puritan precision that with the most virtuous and benevolent intentions they are in danger of giving lads merely a conventional educationa hothouse training which will render them incapable hereafter of facing either the temptations or the labour of the world  they themselves republished massingers virgin martyr because it was a pretty popish story probably written by a papist for there is every reason to believe that massinger was onesetting forth how the heroine was attended all through by an angel in the form of a page and hownot to mention the really beautiful ancient fiction about the fruits which dorothea sends back from paradise theophilus overcomes the devil by means of a cross composed of flowers  massingers account of theophilus conversation will we fear make those who know anything of that great crisis of the human spirit suspect that massingers experience thereof was but small but the fact which is most noteworthy is thisthat the virgin martyr is actually one of the foulest plays known  every pains has been taken to prove that the indecent scenes in the play were not written by massinger but by dekker on what grounds we know not  if dekker assisted massinger in the play as he is said to have done we are aware of no canons of internal criticism which will enable us to decide as boldly as mr gifford does that all the indecency is dekkers and all the poetry massingers  he confessesas indeed he is forced to dothat massinger himself is not free from dialogues of low wit and buffoonery and then after calling the scenes in question detestable ribaldry a loathsome sooterkin engendered of filth and dulness recommends them to the readers supreme scorn and contemptwith which feelings the reader will doubtless regard them but he will also if he be a thinking man draw from them the following conclusions  that even if they be dekkersof which there is no proofmassinger was forced in order to the success of his play to pander to the public taste by allowing dekker to interpolate these villanies that the play which above all others of the seventeenth century contains the most supralunar rosepink of piety devotion and purity also contains the stupidest abominations of any extant play and lastly that those who reprinted it as a sample of the christianity of that past golden age of highchurchmanship had to leave out onethird of the play for fear of becoming amenable to the laws against abominable publications  no one denies that there are nobler words than any that we have quoted in jonson in fletcher or in massinger but there is hardly a play perhaps none of theirs in which the immoralities of which we complain do not existfew of which they do not form an integral part and now if this is the judgment which we have to pass on the morality of the greater poets what must the lesser ones be like  look then at websters two masterpieces vittoria corrombona and the duchess of malfi  a few words spent on them will surely not be wasted for they are pretty generally agreed to be the two best tragedies written since shakspeares time  the whole story of vittoria corrombona is one of sin and horror the subjectmatter of the play is altogether made up of the fiercest and the basest passions  but the play is not a study of those passions from which we may gain a great insight into human nature there is no tracenor is there again in the duchess of malfiof that development of human souls for good or evil which is shakspeares especial powerthe power which far more than any accidental beauties makes his plays to this day the delight alike of the simple and the wise while his contemporaries are all but forgotten  the highest aim of dramatic art is to exhibit the development of the human soul to construct dramas in which the conclusion shall depend not on the events but on the characters and in which the characters shall not be mere embodiments of a certain passion or a certain humour  but persons each unlike all others each having a destiny of his own by virtue of his own peculiarities and of his own will and each proceeding toward that destiny as he shall conquer or yield to circumstances unfolding his own strength and weakness before the eyes of the audience and that in such a way that after his first introduction they should be able in proportion to their knowledge of human nature to predict his conduct under those circumstances  this is indeed high art but we find no more of it in webster than in the rest  his characters be they old or young come on the stage readymade full grown and stereotyped and therefore in general they are not characters at all but mere passions or humours in human form  now and then he essays to draw a character  but it is analytically by description not synthetically and dramatically by letting the man exhibit himself in action and in the duchess of mall he falls into the great mistake of telling by antonios mouth more about the duke and the cardinal than he afterwards makes them act  very different is shakspeares method of giving at the outset some single delicate hint about his personages which will serve as a clue to their whole future conduct thus showing the whole in each part and stamping each man with a personality to a degree which no other dramatist has ever approached  but the truth is the study of human nature is not websters aim  he has to arouse terror and pity not thought and he does it in his own way by blood and fury madmen and screechowls not without a rugged power  there are scenes of his certainly like that of vittorias trial which have been praised for their delineation of character but it is one thing to solve the problem which shakspeare has so handled in lear othello and richard the thirdgiven a mixed character to show how he may become criminal and to solve websters given a readymade criminal to show how he commits his crimes  to us the knowledge of character shown in vittorias trial scene is not an insight into vittorias essential heart and brain but a general acquaintance with the conduct of all bold bad women when brought to bay  poor elia who knew the world from books and human nature principally from his own loving and gentle heart talks of vittorias innocenceresembling boldness 5and seeming to see that matchless beauty of her face which inspires such gay confidence in her and so forth  perfectly just and true not of vittoria merely but of the average of bad young women in the presence of a police magistrate  yet amounting in all merely to this that the strength of websters confest masterscene lies simply in intimate acquaintance with vicious nature in general  we will say no more on this matter save to ask cui bono  was the art of which this was the highest manifestation likely to be of much use to mankind much less able to excuse its palpably disgusting and injurious accompaniments  the duchess of malfi is certainly in a purer and loftier strain but in spite of the praise which has been lavished on her we must take the liberty to doubt whether the poor duchess is a person at all  general goodness and beauty intense though pure affection for a man below her in rank and a will to carry out her purpose at all hazards are not enough to distinguish her from thousands of other women  but webster has no such purpose  what he was thinking and writing of was not truth but effect not the duchess but her story not her brothers but their rage not antonio her majordomo and husband but his good and bad fortunes and thus he has made antonio merely insipid the brothers merely unnatural and the duchess in the critical moment of the play merely forward  that curious scene in which she acquaints antonio with her love for him and makes him marry her is on the whole painful  webster himself seems to have felt that it was so and dreading lest he had gone too far to have tried to redeem the duchess at the end by making her break down in two exquisite lines of loving shame  but he has utterly forgotten to explain or justify her love by giving to antonio as shakspeare would probably have done such strong specialties of character as would compel and therefore excuse his mistresss affection  he has plenty of time to do this in the first scenestime which he wastes on irrelevant matter and all that we gather from them is that antonio is a worthy and thoughtful person  if he gives promise of being more he utterly disappoints that promise afterwards  in the scene in which the duchess tells her love he is far smaller rather than greater than the antonio of the opening scene  though as there altogether passive  he hears his mistresss declaration just as any other respectable youth might is exceedingly astonished and a good deal frightened has to be talked out of his fears till one naturally expects a revulsion on the duchesss part into something like scorn or shame which might have given a good opportunity for calling out sudden strength in antonio  but so busy is webster with his business of drawing mere blind love that he leaves antonio to be a mere puppet whose worthiness we are to believe in only from the duchesss assurance to him that he is the perfection of all that a man should be which as all lovers are of the same opinion the day before the wedding is not of much importance  neither in his subsequent misfortunes does antonio make the least struggle to prove himself worthy of his mistresss affection  he is very resigned and loving and so forth  to win renown by great deeds and so prove his wife in the right to her brothers and all the world never crosses his imagination  his highest aim and that only at last is slavishly to entreat pardon from his brothersinlaw for the mere offence of marrying their sister and he dies by an improbable accident the same pious and respectable insipidity which he has livedne valant pas la peine qui se donne pour lui  the prisonscenes between the duchess and her tormentors are painful enough if to give pain be a dramatic virtue and she appears in them really noble and might have appeared far more so had webster taken half as much pains with her as he has with the madmen ruffians ghosts and screechowls in which his heart really delights  the only character really worked out so as to live and grow under his hand is bosola who of course is the villain of the piece and being a rough fabric is easily manufactured with rough tools still webster has his wonderful touches here and there    cariola  hence villains tyrants murderers  alas what will you do with my lady  call for help duchess  to whom to our next neighbours they are mad folk farewell cariola i pray thee look thou givst my little boy some syrup for his cold and let the girl say her prayers ere she sleepnow what you please what death   and so the play ends as does vittoria corrombona with half a dozen murders coram populo howls despair bedlam and the shambles putting the reader marvellously in mind of that wellknown old book of the same era reynoldss gods revenge in which with all due pious horror and bombastic sermonising the national appetite for abominations is duly fed with some fifty unreadable spanish histories french histories italian histories and so forth one or two of which of course are known to have furnished subjects for the playwrights of the day  the next playwriter whom we are bound to notice is james shirley one of the many converts to romanism which those days saw  he appears up to the breaking out of the civil war to have been the queens favourite poet and according to laugbaine he was one of such incomparable parts that he was the chief of the secondrate poets and by some has been thought even equal to fletcher himself  we must entreat the readers attention while we examine shirleys gamester  whether the examination be a pleasant business or not it is somewhat important for says mr dyce the following memorandum respecting it occurs in the officebook of the master of the records on thursday night 6th of february 1633 the gamester was acted at court made by sherley out of a plot of the kings given him by mee and well likte  the king sayd it was the best play he had seen for seven years  this is indeed important  we shall now have an opportunity of fairly testing at the same time the taste of the royal martyr and the average merit at least in the opinion of the caroline court of the dramatists of that day  the plot which charles sent to shirley as a fit subject for his muse is taken from one of those collections of italian novels of which we have already had occasion to speak and occurs in the second part of the ducento novelle of celio malespini and what it is we shall see forthwith  the play opens with a scene between one wilding and his ward penelope in which he attempts to seduce the young lady in language which has certainly the merit of honesty  she refuses him but civilly enough and on her departure mrs wilding enters who it seems is the object of her husbands loathing though young handsome and in all respects charming enough  after a scene of stupid and brutal insults he actually asks her to bring penelope to him at which she naturally goes out in anger and hazard the gamester entersa personage without a character in any sense of the word  there is next some talk against duelling sensible enough which arises out of a byeplotone delamere having been wounded in a duel by one beaumont mortally as is supposed  this byeplot runs through the play giving an opportunity for bringing in a father of the usual playhouse typea sir richard hurry who is of course as stupid covetous proud and tyrannical and unfeeling as play house fathers were then bound to be  but it is a plot of the most commonplace form turning on the stale trick of a man expecting to be hanged for killing some one who turns out after all to have recovered and having no bearing whatsoever on the real plot which is thismrs wilding in order to win back her husbands affections persuades penelope to seem to grant his suit while mrs wilding herself is in reality to supply her nieces place and shame her husband into virtue  wilding tells hazard of the good fortune which he fancies is coming in scenes of which one can only say that if they are not written for the purpose of exciting the passions it is hard to see why they were written at all  but being with hazard in a gamblinghouse at the very hour at which he is to meet penelope and having had a run of bad luck he borrows a hundred pounds of hazard stays at the table to recover his losses and sends hazard to supply his place with the supposed penelope  a few hours before penelope and hazard have met for the first time and penelope considers him as she says to herself aside a handsome gentleman he begins of course talking foully to her and the lady so far from being shocked at the freedom of her new acquaintance pays him back in his own coin in such good earnest that she soon silences him in the battle of dirtthrowing  of this sad scene it is difficult to say whether it indicates a lower standard of purity and courtesy in the poet in the audience who endured it or in the society of which it was of course intended to be a brilliant picture  if the cavaliers and damsels of charles the firsts day were in the habit of talking in that way to each other and if they had not been shirley would not have dared to represent them as doing so one cannot much wonder that the fire of god was needed to burn up though alas only for a while such a state of society and that when needed the fire fell  the rest of the story is equally bad  hazard next day gives wilding descriptions of his guilt and while wilding is in the height of selfreproach at having handed over his victim to another his wife meets him and informs him that she herself and not penelope has been the victim  now comes the crisis of the plot the conception which so delighted the taste of the royal martyr  wilding finds himself as he expresses it fitted with a pair of horns of his own making and his rage shame and base attempts to patch up his own dishonour by marrying penelope to hazard even at the cost of disgorging the half of her portion which he had intended to embezzle furnish amusement to the audience to the end of the play at last on hazard and penelope coming in married wilding is informed that he has been deceived and that his wife is unstained having arranged with hazard to keep up the delusion in order to frighten him into good behaviour whereupon mr wilding promises to be a good husband henceforth and the play ends  throughout the whole of this farrago of improbable iniquity not a single personage has any mark of personal character or even of any moral quality save in mrs wildings case that of patience under injury  hazard the gamester is chosen as the hero for what reason it is impossible to say he is a mere nonentity doing nothing which may distinguish him from any other gamester and blackguard save that he is as we are told   a man careless of wounds and though he have not had the luck to kill so many as another dares fight with all them that have   he nevertheless being in want of money takes a hundred pounds from a foolish old city merchant city merchants are always fools in the seventeenth century to let his nephew young barnacle give him a box on the ear in a tavern and after the young cit has been transformed into an intolerable bully by the fame so acquired takes another hundred pounds from the repentant uncle for kicking the youth back into his native state of peaceful cowardice  with the exception of some little humour in these scenes with young barnacle the whole play is thoroughly stupid  we look in vain for anything like a reflection a sentiment even a novel image  its language like its morality is all but on a level with the laboured vulgarities of the relapse or the provoked wife save that shirley being a confessed copier of the great dramatists of the generation before him there is enough of the manner of fletcher and ben jonson kept up to hide at first sight the utter want of anything like their matter and as one sickens at the rakish swagger and the artificial smartness of his coxcombs one regrets the racy and unaffected blackguardism of the earlier poets men  this forsooth is the best comedy which charles had heard for seven years and the plot which he himself furnished for the occasion fitted to an english audience by a romish convert  and yet there is one dramatist of that fallen generation over whose memory one cannot but linger fancying what he would have become and wondering why so great a spirit was checked suddenly ere half developed by a fever which carried him off with several other oxford worthies in 1643 when he was at most thirtytwo and according to one account only twentyeight years old  let which of the two dates be the true one cartwright must always rank among our wondrous youths by the side of prince henry the admirable crichton and others of whom ones only doubt is whether they were not too wondrous too precociously complete for future development  we find dr fell some time bishop of oxford saying that cartwright was the utmost man could come to we read how his body was as handsome as his soul how he was an expert linguist not only in greek and latin but in french and italian an excellent orator admirable poet how aristotle was no less known to him than cicero and virgil and his metaphysical lectures preferred to those of all his predecessors the bishop of lincoln only excepted and his sermons as much admired as his other composures and how one fitly applied to him that saying of aristotle concerning oeschron the poet that he could not tell what oeschron could not do  we find pages on pages of highflown epitaphs and sonnets on him in which the exceeding bad taste of his admirers makes one inclined to doubt the taste of him whom they so bedaub with praise and certainly in spite of all due admiration for the crichton of oxford one is unable to endorse mr jasper maynes opinion that   in thee ben jonson still held shakspeares style   or that he possest   lucans bold heights matchd to staid virgils care martials quick salt joined to musaeus tongue   this superabundance of eulogy when we remember the men and the age from which it comes tempts one to form such a conception of cartwright as indeed the portrait prefixed to his works ed 1651 gives us the offspring of an overeducated and pedantic age highly stored with everything but strength and simplicity one in whom genius has been rather shaped perhaps cramped than developed  but genius was present without a doubt under whatsoever artificial trappings and ben jonson spoke but truth when he said my son cartwright writes all like a man  it is impossible to open a page of the lady errant the royal slave the ordinary or loves convert without feeling at once that we have to do with a man of a very different stamp from any massinger perhaps alone excepted who was writing between 1630 and 1640  the specific gravity of the poems so to speak is far greater than that of any of his contemporaries everywhere is thought fancy force varied learning he is never weak or dull though he fails often enough is often enough wrongheaded fantastical affected and has never laid bare the deeper arteries of humanity for good or for evil  neither is he altogether an original thinker as one would expect he has overread himself  but then he has done so to good purpose  if he imitates he generally equals  the table of fare in the ordinary smacks of rabelais or aristophanes  but then it is worthy of either and if one cannot help suspecting that the ordinary never would have been written had not ben jonson written the alchemist one confesses that ben jonson need not have been ashamed to have written the play himself  although the plot as all cartwrights are is somewhat confused and inconsequent  if he be platonically sentimental in loves convert his sentiment is of the noblest and the purest and the confest moral of the play is one which that age needed if ever age on earth did      tis the good mans office to serve and reverence woman as it is the fires to burn for as our souls consist of sense and reason so do yours more noble of sense and love which doth as easily calm all your desires as reason quiets ours   love then doth work in you what reason doth in us here only lies the difference  ours wait the lingering steps of age and time but the womans soul is ripe when it is young so that in us what we call learning is divinity in you whose operations impatient of delay do outstrip time   for the sake of such words in the midst of an evil and adulterous generation we will love young cartwright in spite of the suspicion that addressed as the play is to charles and probably acted before his queen the young rogue had been playing the courtier somewhat and racking his brains for pretty sayings which would exhibit as a virtue that very uxoriousness of the poor king which at last cost him his head  the royal slave too is a gallant play righthearted and lofty from beginning to end though enacted in an impossible courtcloudworld akin to that in which the classic heroes and heroines of corneille and racine call each other monsieur and madame  as for his humour he alas can be dirty like the rest when necessary  but humour he has of the highest quality  the ordinary is full of it and moth the antiquary though too much of a lay figure and depending for his amusingness on his quaint antiquated language is such a sketch as mr dickens need not have been ashamed to draw  the royal slave seems to have been considered both by the court and by his contemporaries his masterpiece  and justly so yet our pleasure at charless having shown for once good taste is somewhat marred by langbaines story that the good acting of the oxford scholars stately scenes and richness of the persian habits had as much to do with the success of the play as its stately style and the excellency of the songs which were set by that admirable composer mr henry james  true it is that the songs are excellent as are all cartwrights for grace simplicity and sweetness equal to any save shakspeares which the seventeenth century produced  but curiously enough his lyric faculty seems to have exhausted itself in these halfdozen songs  his minor poems are utterly worthless out cowleying cowley in frigid and fantastic conceits and his varied addresses to the king and queen are as bombastic and stupid and artificial as anything which bedizened the reigns of charles ii or his brother  are we to gather from this fact that cartwright was not really an original genius but only a magnificent imitator that he could write plays well because others had written them well already but only for that reason and that for the same reason when he attempted detached lyrics and addresses he could only follow the abominable models which he saw around him  we know not for surely in jonson and shakspeares minor poems he might have found simpler and sweeter types and even in those of fletcher who appears from his own account to have been his especial pattern  shakspeare however as we have seen he looked down on as did the rest of his generation  cartwright as an oxford scholar is of course a worshipper of charles and a hater of puritans  we do not wish to raise a prejudice against so young a man by quoting any of the ridiculous and often somewhat abject rant with which he addresses their majesties on their return from scotland on the queens delivery on the birth of the duke of york and so forth for in that he did but copy the tone of grave divines and pious prelates but he unfortunately for his fame is given as young geniuses are sometimes to prophecy and two of his prophecies at least have hardly been fulfilled  he was somewhat mistaken when on the birth of the duke of york he informed the world that   the state is now past fear and all that we need wish besides is perpetuity   and after indulging in various explanations of the reason why nature showed no prodigies at the birth of the future patron of judge jeffreys which if he did not believe them are lies and if he did are very like blasphemies declares that the infant is      a son of mirth of peace and friendship tis a quiet birth   nor again if spirits in the other world have knowledge of human affairs can mr cartwright be now altogether satisfied with his rogues augury as to the capacities of the new england puritans when he intends to pick pockets in the new world having made the old too hot to hold him    they are good silly people souls that will be cheated without trouble  one eye is put out with zeal th other with ignorance and yet they think theyre eagles   whatsoever were the faults of the pilgrim fathers and they were many silliness was certainly not among them  but such was the court fashion  any insult however shallow ribald and doggrel and all these terms are just of the mockpuritan ballad which sir christopher sings in the ordinary just after an epithalamium so graceful and melodious though a little warm in tone as to be really out of place in such a fellows mouth passes current against men who were abroad the founders of the united states and the forefathers of the acutest and most enterprising nation on earth and who at home proved themselves by terrible fact not only the physically stronger party but the more cunning  but so it was fated to be  a deep mist of conceit fed by the shallow breath of parasites players and pedants wrapt that unhappy court in blind security till the breaking was as the swelling out of a high wall which cometh suddenly in an instant   but after all what poetry and art there was in that day good or bad all belonged to the royalists  all  there are those who think that if mere concettism be a part of poetry quarles is as great a poet as cowley or george herbert vaughan or withers  on this question and on the real worth of the seventeenth century lyrists a great deal has to be said hereafter meanwhile there are those too who believe john bunyan considered simply as an artist to be the greatest dramatic author whom england has seen since shakspeare and there linger too in the libraries and the ears of men words of one john milton  he was no rigid hater of the beautiful merely because it was heathen and popish no more indeed were many highlyeducated and highlyborn gentlemen of the long parliament  no more was cromwell himself whose delight was if we may trust that double renegade waller to talk over with him the worthies of rome and greece and who is said to have preserved for the nation raphaels cartoons and andrea mantegnas triumph when charless pictures were sold  but milton had steeped his whole soul in romance  he had felt the beauty and glory of the chivalrous middle age as deeply as shakspeare himself  he had as much classical lore as any oxford pedant  he felt to his hearts core for he sang of it and had he not felt it he would only have written of it the magnificence and worth of really high art of the drama when it was worthy of man and of itself   of gorgeous tragedy presenting thebes or pelops line or the tale of troy divine or what though rare of later age ennobled hath the buskind stage   no poet perhaps shows wider and truer sympathy with every form of the really beautiful in art nature and history  and yet he was a puritan  yes milton was a puritan one who instead of trusting himself and his hopes of the universe to secondhand hearsays systems and traditions had looked gods word and his own soul in the face and determined to act on that which he had found  and therefore it is that to open his works at any stray page after these effeminate carolists is like falling asleep in a stifling city drawingroom amid rococo french furniture not without untidy traces of last nights ball and awaking in an alpine valley amid the scent of sweet cyclamens and pine boughs to the music of trickling rivulets and shouting hunters beneath the dark cathedral aisles of mighty trees and here and there above them and beyond the spotless peaks of everlasting snow while far beneath your feet    the hemisphere of earth in clearest ken stretched to the amplest reach of prospect lies   take anythe most hackneyed passage of comus the allegro the penseroso the paradise lost and see the freshness the sweetness the simplicity which is strangely combined with the pomp the selfrestraint the earnestness of every word take him even as an experimentum crucis when he trenches upon ground heathen and questionable and tries the court poets at their own weapons    or whether as some sager sing the frolic wind that breathes the spring zephyr with aurora playing as he met her once amaying there on beds of violets blue and freshblown roses washed in dew   but why quote what all the world knowswhere shall we find such real mirth ease sweetness dance and song of words in anything written for five and twenty years before him  true he was no great dramatist  he never tried to be one but there was no one in his generation who could have written either comus or samson agonistes  and if as is commonly believed and as his countenance seems to indicate he was deficient in humour so were his contemporaries with the sole exception of cartwright  witty he could be and bitter but he did not live in a really humorous age and if he has none of the rollicking fun of the foxhound puppy at least he has none of the obscene gibber of the ape  after all the great fact stands that the only lasting poet of that generation was a puritan one who if he did not write dramas in sport at least acted dramas in earnest  for drama means etymologically action and doing  and of the drama there are and always will be two kinds  one the representative the other the actual and for a world wherein there is no superabundance of good deeds the latter will be always the better kind  it is good to represent heroical action in verse and on the stage  it is good to purify as old aristotle has it the affections by pity and terror  there is an ideal tragedy and an ideal comedy also which one can imagine as an integral part of the highest christian civilisation  but when christian tragedy sinks below the standard of heathen greek tragedy when instead of setting forth heroical deeds it teaches the audience new possibilities of crime and new excuses for those crimes when instead of purifying the affections by pity and terror it confounds the moral sense by exciting pity and terror merely for the sake of excitement careless whether they be well or ill directed  then it is of the devil and the sooner it returns to its father the better for mankind  when again comedy instead of stirring a divine scorn of baseness or even a kindly and indulgent smile at the weaknesses and oddities of humanity learns to make a mock of sinto find excuses for the popular frailties which it pretends to exposethen it also is of the devil and to the devil let it go while honest and earnest men who have no such exceeding love of art that they must needs have bad art rather than none at all do the duty which lies nearest them amid clean whitewash and honest prose  the whole theory of art its dignity and vocation seems to us at times questionable if coarse facts are to be allowed to weigh as we suppose they are against delicate theories  if we are to judge by the example of italy the country which has been most of all devoted to the practice of art then a nation is not necessarily free strong moral or happy because it can represent facts or can understand how other people have represented them  we do not hesitate to go farther and to say that the now past weakness of germany was to be traced in a great degree to that pernicious habit of mind which made her educated men fancy it enough to represent noble thoughts and feelings or to analyse the representations of them  while they did not bestir themselves or dream that there was a moral need for bestirring themselves toward putting these thoughts and feelings into practice  goethe herein was indeed the type of a very large class of germans  god grant that no generation may ever see such a type common in england and that our race remembering ever that the golden age of the english drama was one of private immorality public hypocrisy ecclesiastical pedantry and regal tyranny and ended in the temporary downfall of church and crown may be more ready to do fine things than to write fine books and act in their lives as those old puritans did a drama which their descendants may be glad to put on paper for them long after they are dead  for surely these puritans were dramatic enough poetic enough picturesque enough  we do not speak of such fanatics as balfour of burley or any other extravagant person whom it may have suited walter scott to take as a typical personage  we speak of the average puritan nobleman gentleman merchant or farmer and hold him to have been a picturesque and poetical mana man of higher imagination and deeper feeling than the average of court poets and a man of sound taste also  what is to be said for his opinions about the stage has been seen already  but it seems to have escaped most persons notice that either all england is grown very foolish or the puritan opinions on several matters have been justified by time  on the matter of the stage the world has certainly come over to their way of thinking  few highly educated men now think it worth while to go to see any play and that exactly for the same reasons as the puritans put forward and still fewer highly educated men think it worth while to write plays  finding that since the grosser excitements of the imagination have become forbidden themes there is really very little to write about  but in the matter of dress and of manners the puritan triumph has been complete  even their worst enemies have come over to their side and the whirligig of time has brought about its revenge  most of their canons of taste have become those of all england  high churchmen who still call them roundheads and croppedears go about rounderheaded and closer cropt than they ever went  they held it more rational to cut the hair to a comfortable length than to wear effeminate curls down the back  we cut ours much shorter than they ever did  they held with the spaniards then the finest gentlemen in the world that sad ie dark colours above all black were the fittest for all stately and earnest gentlemen  we all from the tractarian to the anythingarian are exactly of the same opinion they held that lace perfumes and jewellery on a man were marks of unmanly foppishness and vanity  so hold the finest gentlemen in england now  they thought it equally absurd and sinful for a man to carry his income on his back and bedizen himself out in reds blues and greens ribbons knots slashes and treble quadruple daedalian ruffs built up on iron and timber which have more arches in them for pride than london bridge for use  we if we met such a ruffed and ruffled worthy as used to swagger by dozens up and down pauls walk not knowing how to get a dinner much less to pay his tailor should look on him as firstly a fool and secondly a swindler  while if we met an old puritan we should consider him a man gracefully and picturesquely drest but withal in the most perfect sobriety of good taste and when we discovered as we probably should over and above that the harlequin cavalier had a box of salve and a pair of dice in one pocket a pack of cards and a few pawnbrokers duplicates in the other that his thoughts were altogether of citizens wives and their too easy virtue and that he could not open his mouth without a dozen oaths  then we should consider the puritan even though he did quote scripture somewhat through his nose as the gentleman and the courtier as a most offensive specimen of the snob triumphant glorying in his shame  the picture is not ours nor even the puritans  it is bishop halls bishop earles it is beaumonts fletchers jonsons shakspearesthe picture which every dramatist as well as satirist has drawn of the gallant of the seventeenth century  no one can read those writers honestly without seeing that the puritan and not the cavalier conception of what a british gentleman should be is the one accepted by the whole nation at this day  in applying the same canon to the dress of women they were wrong  as in other matters they had hold of one pole of a double truth and erred in applying it exclusively to all cases  but there are two things to be said for them first that the dress of that day was palpably an incentive to the profligacy of that day and therefore had to be protested against while in these more moral times ornaments and fashions may be harmlessly used which then could not be used without harm  next it is undeniable that sober dressing is more and more becoming the fashion among wellbred women and that among them too the puritan canons are gaining ground  we have just said that the puritans held too exclusively to one pole of a double truth  they did so no doubt in their hatred of the drama  their belief that human relations were if not exactly sinful at least altogether carnal and unspiritual prevented their conceiving the possibility of any truly christian drama and led them at times into strange and sad errors like that new england ukase of cotton mathers who is said to have punished the woman who should kiss her infant on the sabbath day  yet their extravagances on this point were but the honest revulsion from other extravagances on the opposite side  if the undistinguishing and immoral autotheism of the playwrights and the luxury and heathendom of the higher classes first in italy and then in england were the natural revolt of the human mind against the manichaeism of monkery  then the severity and exclusiveness of puritanism was a natural and necessary revolt against that luxury and immorality a protest for mans godgiven superiority over nature against that naturalism which threatened to end in sheer animalism  while italian prelates have found an apologist in mr roscoe and english playwrights in mr gifford the old puritans who felt and asserted however extravagantly that there was an eternal law which was above all borgias and machiavels stuarts and fletchers have surely a right to a fair trial  if they went too far in their contempt for humanity certainly no one interfered to set them right  the anglicans of that time who held intrinsically the same anthropologic notions and yet wanted the courage and sincerity to carry them out as honestly neither could nor would throw any light upon the controversy and the only class who sided with the poor playwrights in asserting that there were more things in man and more excuses for man than were dreamt of in prynnes philosophy were the jesuit casuists who by a fatal perverseness used all their little knowledge of human nature to the same undesirable purpose as the playwrights namely to prove how it was possible to commit every conceivable sinful action without sinning  no wonder that in an age in which courtiers and theatre haunters were turning romanists by the dozen and the priestridden queen was the chief patroness of the theatre the puritans should have classed players and jesuits in the same category and deduced the parentage of both alike from the father of lies  but as for these puritans having been merely the sour narrow inhuman persons they are vulgarly supposed to have been credat judaeus  there were sour and narrow men among them so there were in the opposite party  no puritan could have had less poetry in him less taste less feeling than laud himself  but is there no poetry save words  no drama save that which is presented on the stage  is this glorious earth and the souls of living men mere prose as long as carent vate sacro who will forsooth do them the honour to make poetry out of a little of them and of how little by translating them into words which he himself just in proportion as he is a good poet will confess to be clumsy tawdry ineffectual was there no poetry in these puritans because they wrote no poetry we do not mean now the unwritten tragedy of the battlepsalm and the charge but simple idyllic poetry and quiet homedrama lovepoetry of the heart and the hearth and the beauties of everyday human life take the most commonplace of them  was zealfortruth thoresby of thoresby rise in deeping fen because his father had thought fit to give him an ugly and silly name the less of a noble lad  did his name prevent his being six feet high  were his shoulders the less broad for it his cheeks the less ruddy for it  he wore his flaxen hair of the same length that every one now wears theirs instead of letting it hang halfway to his waist in essenced curls but was he therefore the less of a true vikings son boldhearted as his sea roving ancestors who won the danelagh by canutes side and settled there on thoresby rise to grow wheat and breed horses generation succeeding generation in the old moated grange  he carried a bible in his jackboot  but did that prevent him as oliver rode past him with an approving smile on naseby field thinking himself a very handsome fellow with his moustache and imperial and bright red coat and cuirass well polished in spite of many a dint as he sate his fathers great black horse as gracefully and firmly as any long locked and essenced cavalier in front of him  or did it prevent him thinking too for a moment with a throb of the heart that sweet cousin patience far away at home could she but see him might have the same opinion of him as he had of himself  was he the worse for the thought  he was certainly not the worse for checking it the next instant with manly shame for letting such carnal vanities rise in his heart while he was doing the lords work in the teeth of death and hell  but was there no poetry in him then  no poetry in him five minutes later as the long rapier swung round his head redder and redder at every sweep  we are befooled by names  call him crusader instead of roundhead and he seems at once granting him only sincerity which he had and that of a right awful kind as complete a knighterrant as ever watched and prayed ere putting on his spurs in fantastic gothic chapel beneath storied windows richly dight  was there no poetry in him either half an hour afterwards as he lay bleeding across the corpse of the gallant horse waiting for his turn with the surgeon and fumbled for the bible in his boot and tried to hum a psalm and thought of cousin patience and his father and his mother and how they would hear at least that he had played the man in israel that day and resisted unto blood striving against sin and the man of sin  and was there no poetry in him too as he came wearied along thoresby dyke in the quiet autumn eve home to the house of his forefathers and saw afar off the knot of tall poplars rising over the broad misty flat and the one great abele tossing its sheets of silver in the dying gusts and knew that they stood before his fathers door  who can tell all the pretty childmemories which flitted across his brain at that sight and made him forget that he was a wounded cripple  there is the dyke where he and his brothers snared the great pike which stole the ducklingshow many years ago while pretty little patience stood by trembling and shrieked at each snap of the brutes wide jaws and there down that long dark lode ruffling with crimson in the sunset breeze he and his brothers skated home in triumph with patience when his uncle died  what a day that was when in the clear bright winter noon they laid the gate upon the ice and tied the beefbones under the four corners and packed little patience on it  how pretty she looked though her eyes were red with weeping as she peeped out from among the heap of blankets and horsehides and how merrily their long fenrunners whistled along the icelane between the high banks of sighing reed as they towed home their new treasure in triumph at a pace like the racehorses to the dear old home among the poplartrees  and now he was going home to meet her after a mighty victory a deliverance from heaven second only in his eyes to that red sea one  was there no poetry in his heart at that thought  did not the glowing sunset and the reedbeds which it transfigured before him into sheets of golden flame seem tokens that the glory of god was going before him in his path  did not the sweet clamour of the wildfowl gathering for one rich paean ere they sank into rest seem to him as gods bells chiming him home in triumph with peels sweeter and bolder than those of lincoln or peterborough steeplehouse  did not the very lapwing as she tumbled softly wailing before him as she did years ago seem to welcome the wanderer home in the name of heaven  fair patience too though she was a puritan yet did not her cheek flush her eye grow dim like any other girls as she saw far off the red coat like a sliding spark of fire coming slowly along the strait fenbank and fled upstairs into her chamber to pray half that it might be half that it might not be he  was there no happy storm of human tears and human laughter when he entered the courtyard gate  did not the old dog lick his puritan hand as lovingly as if it had been a cavaliers  did not lads and lasses run out shouting did not the old yeoman father hug him weep over him hold him at arms length and hug him again as heartily as any other john bull even though the next moment he called all to kneel down and thank him who had sent his boy home again after bestowing on him the grace to bind kings in chains and nobles with links of iron and contend to death for the faith delivered to the saints  and did not zealfor truth look about as wistfully for patience as any other man would have done longing to see her yet not daring even to ask for her and when she came down at last was she the less lovely in his eyes because she came not flaunting with bare bosom in tawdry finery and paint but shrouded close in coif and pinner hiding from all the world beauty which was there still but was meant for one alone and that only if god willed in gods good time  and was there no faltering of their voices no light in their eyes no trembling pressure of their hands which said more and was more ay and more beautiful in the sight of him who made them than all herricks dianemes wallers saccharissas flames darts posies loveknots anagrams and the rest of the insincere cant of the court  what if zealfortruth had never strung two rhymes together in his life  did not his heart go for inspiration to a loftier helicon when it whispered to itself my love my dove my undefiled is but one than if he had filled pages with sonnets about venuses and cupids lovesick shepherds and cruel nymphs  and was there no poetry true idyllic poetry as of longfellows evangeline itself in that trip round the old farm next morning when zealfortruth after looking over every heifer and peeping into every sty would needs canter down by his fathers side to the horsefen with his arm in a sling while the partridges whirred up before them and the lurchers flashed like gray snakes after the hare and
