                      1905     to nelly van de grift mrs adulfo sanchez of monterey   at last after so many years i have the pleasure of reintroducing you to ‘prince otto’ whom you will remember a very little fellow no bigger in fact than a few sheets of memoranda written for me by your kind hand the sight of his name will carry you back to an old wooden house embowered in creepers a house that was far gone in the respectable stages of antiquity and seemed indissoluble from the green garden in which it stood and that yet was a seatraveller in its younger days and had come round the horn piecemeal in the belly of a ship and might have heard the seamen stamping and shouting and the note of the boatswain’s whistle  it will recall to you the nondescript inhabitants now so widely scattered—the two horses the dog and the four cats some of them still looking in your face as you read these lines—the poor lady so unfortunately married to an author—the china boy by this time perhaps baiting his line by the banks of a river in the flowery land—and in particular the scot who was then sick apparently unto death and whom you did so much to cheer and keep in good behaviour  you may remember that he was full of ambitions and designs so soon as he had his health again completely you may remember the fortune he was to earn the journeys he was to go upon the delights he was to enjoy and confer and among other matters the masterpiece he was to make of ‘prince otto’  well we will not give in that we are finally beaten  we read together in those days the story of braddock and how as he was carried dying from the scene of his defeat he promised himself to do better another time a story that will always touch a brave heart and a dying speech worthy of a more fortunate commander  i try to be of braddock’s mind  i still mean to get my health again i still purpose by hook or crook this book or the next to launch a masterpiece and i still intend—somehow some time or other—to see your face and to hold your hand  meanwhile this little paper traveller goes forth instead crosses the great seas and the long plains and the dark mountains and comes at last to your door in monterey charged with tender greetings  pray you take him in  he comes from a house where even as in your own there are gathered together some of the waifs of our company at oakland a house—for all its outlandish gaelic name and distant station—where you are wellbeloved                                                                    r l s  skerryvore       bournemouth     book i—prince errant   chapter i—in which the prince departs on an adventure   you shall seek in vain upon the map of europe for the bygone state of grünewald  an independent principality an infinitesimal member of the german empire she played for several centuries her part in the discord of europe and at last in the ripeness of time and at the spiriting of several bald diplomatists vanished like a morning ghost  less fortunate than poland she left not a regret behind her and the very memory of her boundaries has faded  it was a patch of hilly country covered with thick wood  many streams took their beginning in the glens of grünewald turning mills for the inhabitants  there was one town mittwalden and many brown wooden hamlets climbing roof above roof along the steep bottom of dells and communicating by covered bridges over the larger of the torrents  the hum of watermills the splash of running water the clean odour of pine sawdust the sound and smell of the pleasant wind among the innumerable army of the mountain pines the dropping fire of huntsmen the dull stroke of the woodaxe intolerable roads fresh trout for supper in the clean bare chamber of an inn and the song of birds and the music of the villagebells—these were the recollections of the grünewald tourist  north and east the foothills of grünewald sank with varying profile into a vast plain  on these sides many small states bordered with the principality gerolstein an extinct grand duchy among the number  on the south it marched with the comparatively powerful kingdom of seaboard bohemia celebrated for its flowers and mountain bears and inhabited by a people of singular simplicity and tenderness of heart  several intermarriages had in the course of centuries united the crowned families of grünewald and maritime bohemia and the last prince of grünewald whose history i purpose to relate drew his descent through perdita the only daughter of king florizel the first of bohemia  that these intermarriages had in some degree mitigated the rough manly stock of the first grünewalds was an opinion widely held within the borders of the principality  the charcoal burner the mountain sawyer the wielder of the broad axe among the congregated pines of grünewald proud of their hard hands proud of their shrewd ignorance and almost savage lore looked with an unfeigned contempt on the soft character and manners of the sovereign race  the precise year of grace in which this tale begins shall be left to the conjecture of the reader  but for the season of the year which in such a story is the more important of the two it was already so far forward in the spring that when mountain people heard horns echoing all day about the northwest corner of the principality they told themselves that prince otto and his hunt were up and out for the last time till the return of autumn  at this point the borders of grünewald descend somewhat steeply here and there breaking into crags and this shaggy and trackless country stands in a bold contrast to the cultivated plain below  it was traversed at that period by two roads alone one the imperial highway bound to brandenau in gerolstein descended the slope obliquely and by the easiest gradients  the other ran like a fillet across the very forehead of the hills dipping into savage gorges and wetted by the spray of tiny waterfalls  once it passed beside a certain tower or castle built sheer upon the margin of a formidable cliff and commanding a vast prospect of the skirts of grünewald and the busy plains of gerolstein  the felsenburg so this tower was called served now as a prison now as a huntingseat and for all it stood so lonesome to the naked eye with the aid of a good glass the burghers of brandenau could count its windows from the limetree terrace where they walked at night  in the wedge of forest hillside enclosed between the roads the horns continued all day long to scatter tumult and at length as the sun began to draw near to the horizon of the plain a rousing triumph announced the slaughter of the quarry  the first and second huntsman had drawn somewhat aside and from the summit of a knoll gazed down before them on the drooping shoulders of the hill and across the expanse of plain  they covered their eyes for the sun was in their faces  the glory of its going down was somewhat pale  through the confused tracery of many thousands of naked poplars the smoke of so many houses and the evening steam ascending from the fields the sails of a windmill on a gentle eminence moved very conspicuously like a donkey’s ears  and hard by like an open gash the imperial highroad ran straight sunward an artery of travel  there is one of nature’s spiritual ditties that has not yet been set to words or human music ‘the invitation to the road’ an air continually sounding in the ears of gipsies and to whose inspiration our nomadic fathers journeyed all their days  the hour the season and the scene all were in delicate accordance  the air was full of birds of passage steering westward and northward over grünewald an army of specks to the uplooking eye  and below the great practicable road was bound for the same quarter  but to the two horsemen on the knoll this spiritual ditty was unheard they were indeed in some concern of mind scanning every fold of the subjacent forest and betraying both anger and dismay in their impatient gestures  ‘i do not see him kuno’ said the first huntsman ‘nowhere—not a trace not a hair of the mare’s tail  no sir he’s off broke cover and got away  why for twopence i would hunt him with the dogs’  ‘mayhap he’s gone home’ said kuno but without conviction  ‘home’ sneered the other  ‘i give him twelve days to get home  no it’s begun again it’s as it was three years ago before he married a disgrace  hereditary prince hereditary fool  there goes the government over the borders on a grey mare  what’s that  no nothing—no i tell you on my word i set more store by a good gelding or an english dog that for your otto’  ‘he’s not my otto’ growled kuno  ‘then i don’t know whose he is’ was the retort  ‘you would put your hand in the fire for him tomorrow’ said kuno facing round  ‘me’ cried the huntsman  ‘i would see him hanged  i’m a grünewald patriot—enrolled and have my medal too and i would help a prince  i’m for liberty and gondremark’  ‘well it’s all one’ said kuno  ‘if anybody said what you said you would have his blood and you know it’  ‘you have him on the brain’ retorted his companion  ‘there he goes’ he cried the next moment  and sure enough about a mile down the mountain a rider on a white horse was seen to flit rapidly across a heathy open and vanish among the trees on the farther side  ‘in ten minutes he’ll be over the border into gerolstein’ said kuno ‘it’s past cure’  ‘well if he founders that mare i’ll never forgive him’ added the other gathering his reins  and as they turned down from the knoll to rejoin their comrades the sun dipped and disappeared and the woods fell instantly into the gravity and greyness of the early night    chapter ii—in which the prince plays harounalraschid   the night fell upon the prince while he was threading green tracks in the lower valleys of the wood and though the stars came out overhead and displayed the interminable order of the pinetree pyramids regular and dark like cypresses their light was of small service to a traveller in such lonely paths and from thenceforth he rode at random  the austere face of nature the uncertain issue of his course the open sky and the free air delighted him like wine and the hoarse chafing of a river on his left sounded in his ears agreeably  it was past eight at night before his toil was rewarded and he issued at last out of the forest on the firm white highroad  it lay downhill before him with a sweeping eastward trend faintly bright between the thickets and otto paused and gazed upon it  so it ran league after league still joining others to the farthest ends of europe there skirting the seasurge here gleaming in the lights of cities and the innumerable army of tramps and travellers moved upon it in all lands as by a common impulse and were now in all places drawing near to the inn door and the night’s rest  the pictures swarmed and vanished in his brain a surge of temptation a beat of all his blood went over him to set spur to the mare and to go on into the unknown for ever  and then it passed away hunger and fatigue and that habit of middling actions which we call common sense resumed their empire and in that changed mood his eye lighted upon two bright windows on his left hand between the road and river  he turned off by a byroad and in a few minutes he was knocking with his whip on the door of a large farmhouse and a chorus of dogs from the farmyard were making angry answer  a very tall old whiteheaded man came shading a candle at the summons  he had been of great strength in his time and of a handsome countenance but now he was fallen away his teeth were quite gone and his voice when he spoke was broken and falsetto  ‘you will pardon me’ said otto  ‘i am a traveller and have entirely lost my way’  ‘sir’ said the old man in a very stately shaky manner ‘you are at the river farm and i am killian gottesheim at your disposal  we are here sir at about an equal distance from mittwalden in grünewald and brandenau in gerolstein six leagues to either and the road excellent but there is not a wine bush not a carter’s alehouse anywhere between you will have to accept my hospitality for the night rough hospitality to which i make you freely welcome for sir’ he added with a bow ‘it is god who sends the guest’  ‘amen  and i most heartily thank you’ replied otto bowing in his turn  ‘fritz’ said the old man turning towards the interior ‘lead round this gentleman’s horse and you sir condescend to enter’  otto entered a chamber occupying the greater part of the groundfloor of the building  it had probably once been divided for the farther end was raised by a long step above the nearer and the blazing fire and the white suppertable seemed to stand upon a daïs  all around were dark brassmounted cabinets and cupboards dark shelves carrying ancient country crockery guns and antlers and broadside ballads on the wall a tall old clock with roses on the dial and down in one corner the comfortable promise of a wine barrel  it was homely elegant and quaint  a powerful youth hurried out to attend on the grey mare and when mr killian gottesheim had presented him to his daughter ottilia otto followed to the stable as became not perhaps the prince but the good horseman  when he returned a smoking omelette and some slices of homecured ham were waiting him these were followed by a ragout and a cheese and it was not until his guest had entirely satisfied his hunger and the whole party drew about the fire over the wine jug that killian gottesheim’s elaborate courtesy permitted him to address a question to the prince  ‘you have perhaps ridden far sir’ he inquired  ‘i have as you say ridden far’ replied otto ‘and as you have seen i was prepared to do justice to your daughters cookery’  ‘possibly sir from the direction of brandenau’ continued killian  ‘precisely and i should have slept tonight had i not wandered in mittwalden’ answered the prince weaving in a patch of truth according to the habit of all liars  ‘business leads you to mittwalden’ was the next question  ‘mere curiosity’ said otto  ‘i have never yet visited the principality of grünewald’  ‘a pleasant state sir’ piped the old man nodding ‘a very pleasant state and a fine race both pines and people  we reckon ourselves part grünewalders here lying so near the borders and the river there is all good grünewald water every drop of it  yes sir a fine state  a man of grünewald now will swing me an axe over his head that many a man of gerolstein could hardly lift and the pines why deary me there must be more pines in that little state sir than people in this whole big world  ’tis twenty years now since i crossed the marshes for we grow homekeepers in old age but i mind it as if it was yesterday  up and down the road keeps right on from here to mittwalden and nothing all the way but the good green pinetrees big and little and waterpower waterpower at every step sir  we once sold a bit of forest up there beside the highroad and the sight of minted money that we got for it has set me ciphering ever since what all the pines in grünewald would amount to’  ‘i suppose you see nothing of the prince’ inquired otto  ‘no’ said the young man speaking for the first time ‘nor want to’  ‘why so is he so much disliked’ asked otto  ‘not what you might call disliked’ replied the old gentleman ‘but despised sir’  ‘indeed’ said the prince somewhat faintly  ‘yes sir despised’ nodded killian filling a long pipe ‘and to my way of thinking justly despised  here is a man with great opportunities and what does he do with them  he hunts and he dresses very prettily—which is a thing to be ashamed of in a man—and he acts plays and if he does aught else the news of it has not come here’  ‘yet these are all innocent’ said otto  ‘what would you have him do—make war’  ‘no sir’ replied the old man  ‘but here it is i have been fifty years upon this river farm and wrought in it day in day out i have ploughed and sowed and reaped and risen early and waked late and this is the upshot that all these years it has supported me and my family and been the best friend that ever i had set aside my wife and now when my time comes i leave it a better farm than when i found it  so it is if a man works hearty in the order of nature he gets bread and he receives comfort and whatever he touches breeds  and it humbly appears to me if that prince was to labour on his throne as i have laboured and wrought in my farm he would find both an increase and a blessing’  ‘i believe with you sir’ otto said ‘and yet the parallel is inexact for the farmer’s life is natural and simple but the prince’s is both artificial and complicated  it is easy to do right in the one and exceedingly difficult not to do wrong in the other  if your crop is blighted you can take off your bonnet and say “god’s will be done” but if the prince meets with a reverse he may have to blame himself for the attempt  and perhaps if all the kings in europe were to confine themselves to innocent amusement the subjects would be the better off’  ‘ay’ said the young man fritz ‘you are in the right of it there  that was a true word spoken  and i see you are like me a good patriot and an enemy to princes’  otto was somewhat abashed at this deduction and he made haste to change his ground  ‘but’ said he ‘you surprise me by what you say of this prince otto  i have heard him i must own more favourably painted  i was told he was in his heart a good fellow and the enemy of no one but himself’  ‘and so he is sir’ said the girl ‘a very handsome pleasant prince and we know some who would shed their blood for him’  ‘o kuno’ said fritz  ‘an ignoramus’  ‘ay kuno to be sure’ quavered the old farmer  ‘well since this gentleman is a stranger to these parts and curious about the prince i do believe that story might divert him  this kuno you must know sir is one of the hunt servants and a most ignorant intemperate man a right grünewalder as we say in gerolstein  we know him well in this house for he has come as far as here after his stray dogs and i make all welcome sir without account of state or nation  and indeed between gerolstein and grünewald the peace has held so long that the roads stand open like my door and a man will make no more of the frontier than the very birds themselves’  ‘ay’ said otto ‘it has been a long peace—a peace of centuries’  ‘centuries as you say’ returned killian ‘the more the pity that it should not be for ever  well sir this kuno was one day in fault and otto who has a quick temper up with his whip and thrashed him they do say soundly  kuno took it as best he could but at last he broke out and dared the prince to throw his whip away and wrestle like a man for we are all great at wrestling in these parts and it’s so that we generally settle our disputes  well sir the prince did so and being a weakly creature found the tables turned for the man whom he had just been thrashing like a negro slave lifted him with a back grip and threw him heels overhead’  ‘he broke his bridlearm’ cried fritz—‘and some say his nose  serve him right say i  man to man which is the better at that’  ‘and then’ asked otto  ‘o then kuno carried him home and they were the best of friends from that day forth  i don’t say it’s a discreditable story you observe’ continued mr gottesheim ‘but it’s droll and that’s the fact  a man should think before he strikes for as my nephew says man to man was the old valuation’  ‘now if you were to ask me’ said otto ‘i should perhaps surprise you i think it was the prince that conquered’  ‘and sir you would be right’ replied killian seriously  ‘in the eyes of god i do not question but you would be right but men sir look at these things differently and they laugh’  ‘they made a song of it’ observed fritz  ‘how does it go  tatumtara   ’  ‘well’ interrupted otto who had no great anxiety to hear the song ‘the prince is young he may yet mend’  ‘not so young by your leave’ cried fritz  ‘a man of forty’  ‘thirtysix’ corrected mr gottesheim  ‘o’ cried ottilia in obvious disillusion ‘a man of middle age  and they said he was so handsome when he was young’  ‘and bald too’ added fritz  otto passed his hand among his locks  at that moment he was far from happy and even the tedious evenings at mittwalden palace began to smile upon him by comparison  ‘o sixandthirty’ he protested  ‘a man is not yet old at sixandthirty  i am that age myself’  ‘i should have taken you for more sir’ piped the old farmer  ‘but if that be so you are of an age with master ottekin as people call him and i would wager a crown have done more service in your time  though it seems young by comparison with men of a great age like me yet it’s some way through life for all that and the mere fools and fiddlers are beginning to grow weary and to look old  yes sir by sixandthirty if a man be a follower of god’s laws he should have made himself a home and a good name to live by he should have got a wife and a blessing on his marriage and his works as the word says should begin to follow him’  ‘ah well the prince is married’ cried fritz with a coarse burst of laughter  ‘that seems to entertain you sir’ said otto  ‘ay’ said the young boor  ‘did you not know that  i thought all europe knew it’  and he added a pantomime of a nature to explain his accusation to the dullest  ‘ah sir’ said mr gottesheim ‘it is very plain that you are not from hereabouts  but the truth is that the whole princely family and court are rips and rascals not one to mend another  they live sir in idleness and—what most commonly follows it—corruption  the princess has a lover—a baron as he calls himself from east prussia and the prince is so little of a man sir that he holds the candle  nor is that the worst of it for this foreigner and his paramour are suffered to transact the state affairs while the prince takes the salary and leaves all things to go to wrack  there will follow upon this some manifest judgment which though i am old i may survive to see’  ‘good man you are in the wrong about gondremark’ said fritz showing a greatly increased animation ‘but for all the rest you speak the god’s truth like a good patriot  as for the prince if he would take and strangle his wife i would forgive him yet’  ‘nay fritz’ said the old man ‘that would be to add iniquity to evil for you perceive sir’ he continued once more addressing himself to the unfortunate prince ‘this otto has himself to thank for these disorders he has his young wife and his principality and he has sworn to cherish both’  ‘sworn at the altar’ echoed fritz  ‘but put your faith in princes’  ‘well sir he leaves them both to an adventurer from east prussia’ pursued the farmer ‘leaves the girl to be seduced and to go on from bad to worse till her name’s become a taproom byword and she not yet twenty leaves the country to be overtaxed and bullied with armaments and jockied into war—’  ‘war’ cried otto  ‘so they say sir those that watch their ongoings say to war’ asseverated killian  ‘well sir that is very sad it is a sad thing for this poor wicked girl to go down to hell with people’s curses it’s a sad thing for a tight little happy country to be misconducted but whoever may complain i humbly conceive sir that this otto cannot what he has worked for that he has got and may god have pity on his soul for a great and a silly sinner’s’  ‘he has broke his oath then he is a perjurer  he takes the money and leaves the work why then plainly he’s a thief  a cuckold he was before and a fool by birth  better me that’ cried fritz and snapped his fingers  ‘and now sir you will see a little’ continued the farmer ‘why we think so poorly of this prince otto  there’s such a thing as a man being pious and honest in the private way and there is such a thing sir as a public virtue but when a man has neither the lord lighten him  even this gondremark that fritz here thinks so much of—’  ‘ay’ interrupted fritz ‘gondremark’s the man for me  i would we had his like in gerolstein’  ‘he is a bad man’ said the old farmer shaking his head ‘and there was never good begun by the breach of god’s commandments  but so far i will go with you he is a man that works for what he has’  ‘i tell you he’s the hope of grünewald’ cried fritz  ‘he doesn’t suit some of your highanddry old ancient ideas but he’s a downright modern man—a man of the new lights and the progress of the age  he does some things wrong so they all do but he has the people’s interests next his heart and you mark me—you sir who are a liberal and the enemy of all their governments you please to mark my words—the day will come in grünewald when they take out that yellowheaded skulk of a prince and that doughfaced messalina of a princess march ’em back foremost over the borders and proclaim the baron gondremark first president  i’ve heard them say it in a speech  i was at a meeting once at brandenau and the mittwalden delegates spoke up for fifteen thousand  fifteen thousand all brigaded and each man with a medal round his neck to rally by  that’s all gondremark’  ‘ay sir you see what it leads to wild talk today and wilder doings tomorrow’ said the old man  ‘for there is one thing certain that this gondremark has one foot in the court backstairs and the other in the masons’ lodges  he gives himself out sir for what nowadays they call a patriot a man from east prussia’  ‘give himself out’ cried fritz  ‘he is  he is to lay by his title as soon as the republic is declared i heard it in a speech’  ‘lay by baron to take up president’ returned killian  ‘king log king stork  but you’ll live longer than i and you will see the fruits of it’  ‘father’ whispered ottilia pulling at the speaker’s coat ‘surely the gentleman is ill’  ‘i beg your pardon’ cried the farmer rewaking to hospitable thoughts ‘can i offer you anything’  ‘i thank you  i am very weary’ answered otto  ‘i have presumed upon my strength  if you would show me to a bed i should be grateful’  ‘ottilia a candle’ said the old man  ‘indeed sir you look paley  a little cordial water  no  then follow me i beseech you and i will bring you to the stranger’s bed  you are not the first by many who has slept well below my roof’ continued the old gentleman mounting the stairs before his guest ‘for good food honest wine a grateful conscience and a little pleasant chat before a man retires are worth all the possets and apothecary’s drugs  see sir’ and here he opened a door and ushered otto into a little whitewashed sleepingroom ‘here you are in port  it is small but it is airy and the sheets are clean and kept in lavender  the window too looks out above the river and there’s no music like a little river’s  it plays the same tune and that’s the favourite over and over again and yet does not weary of it like men fiddlers  it takes the mind out of doors and though we should be grateful for good houses there is after all no house like god’s outofdoors  and lastly sir it quiets a man down like saying his prayers  so here sir i take my kind leave of you until tomorrow and it is my prayerful wish that you may slumber like a prince’  and the old man with the twentieth courteous inclination left his guest alone    chapter iii—in which the prince comforts age and beauty and delivers a lecture on discretion in love   the prince was early abroad in the time of the first chorus of birds of the pure and quiet air of the slanting sunlight and the milelong shadows  to one who had passed a miserable night the freshness of that hour was tonic and reviving to steal a march upon his slumbering fellows to be the adam of the coming day composed and fortified his spirits and the prince breathing deep and pausing as he went walked in the wet fields beside his shadow and was glad  a trellised path led down into the valley of the brook and he turned to follow it  the stream was a breakneck boiling highland river  hard by the farm it leaped a little precipice in a thick greymare’s tail of twisted filaments and then lay and worked and bubbled in a lynn  into the middle of this quaking pool a rock protruded shelving to a cape and thither otto scrambled and sat down to ponder  soon the sun struck through the screen of branches and thin early leaves that made a hanging bower above the fall and the golden lights and flitting shadows fell upon and marbled the surface of that so seething pot and rays plunged deep among the turning waters and a spark as bright as a diamond lit upon the swaying eddy  it began to grow warm where otto lingered warm and heady the lights swam weaving their maze across the shaken pool on the impending rock reflections danced like butterflies and the air was fanned by the waterfall as by a swinging curtain  otto who was weary with tossing and beset with horrid phantoms of remorse and jealousy instantly fell dead in love with that sunchequered echoing corner  holding his feet he stared out of a drowsy trance wondering admiring musing losing his way among uncertain thoughts  there is nothing that so apes the external bearing of free will as that unconscious bustle obscurely following liquid laws with which a river contends among obstructions  it seems the very play of man and destiny and as otto pored on these recurrent changes he grew by equal steps the sleepier and the more profound  eddy and prince were alike jostled in their purpose alike anchored by intangible influences in one corner of the world  eddy and prince were alike useless starkly useless in the cosmology of men  eddy and prince—prince and eddy  it is probable he had been some while asleep when a voice recalled him from oblivion  ‘sir’ it was saying and looking round he saw mr killian’s daughter terrified by her boldness and making bashful signals from the shore  she was a plain honest lass healthy and happy and good and with that sort of beauty that comes of happiness and health but her confusion lent her for the moment an additional charm  ‘goodmorning’ said otto rising and moving towards her  ‘i arose early and was in a dream’  ‘o sir’ she cried ‘i wish to beg of you to spare my father for i assure your highness if he had known who you was he would have bitten his tongue out sooner  and fritz too—how he went on  but i had a notion and this morning i went straight down into the stable and there was your highness’s crown upon the stirrupirons  but o sir i made certain you would spare them for they were as innocent as lambs’  ‘my dear’ said otto both amused and gratified ‘you do not understand it is i who am in the wrong for i had no business to conceal my name and lead on these gentleman to speak of me  and it is i who have to beg of you that you will keep my secret and not betray the discourtesy of which i was guilty  as for any fear of me your friends are safe in gerolstein and even in my own territory you must be well aware i have no power’  ‘o sir’ she said curtsying ‘i would not say that the huntsmen would all die for you’  ‘happy prince’ said otto  ‘but although you are too courteous to avow the knowledge you have had many opportunities of learning that i am a vain show  only last night we heard it very clearly stated  you see the shadow flitting on this hard rock  prince otto i am afraid is but the moving shadow and the name of the rock is gondremark  ah if your friends had fallen foul of gondremark  but happily the younger of the two admires him  and as for the old gentleman your father he is a wise man and an excellent talker and i would take a long wager he is honest’  ‘o for honest your highness that he is’ exclaimed the girl  ‘and fritz is as honest as he  and as for all they said it was just talk and nonsense  when countryfolk get gossiping they go on i do assure you for the fun they don’t as much as think of what they say  if you went to the next farm it’s my belief you would hear as much against my father’  ‘nay nay’ said otto ‘there you go too fast  for all that was said against prince otto—’  ‘o it was shameful’ cried the girl  ‘not shameful—true’ returned otto  ‘o yes—true  i am all they said of me—all that and worse’  ‘i never’ cried ‘ottilia  ‘is that how you do  well you would never be a soldier  now if any one accuses me i get up and give it them  o i defend myself  i wouldn’t take a fault at another person’s hands no not if i had it on my forehead  and that’s what you must do if you mean to live it out  but indeed i never heard such nonsense  i should think you was ashamed of yourself  you’re bald then i suppose’  ‘o no’ said otto fairly laughing  ‘there i acquit myself not bald’  ‘well and good’ pursued the girl  ‘come now you know you are good and i’ll make you say so    your highness i beg your humble pardon but there’s no disrespect intended  and anyhow you know you are’  ‘why now what am i to say’ replied otto  ‘you are a cook and excellently well you do it i embrace the chance of thanking you for the ragout  well now have you not seen good food so bedevilled by unskilful cookery that no one could be brought to eat the pudding  that is me my dear  i am full of good ingredients but the dish is worthless  i am—i give it you in one word—sugar in the salad’  ‘well i don’t care you’re good’ reiterated ottilia a little flushed by having failed to understand  ‘i will tell you one thing’ replied otto ‘you are’  ‘ah well that’s what they all said of you’ moralised the girl ‘such a tongue to come round—such a flattering tongue’  ‘o you forget i am a man of middle age’ the prince chuckled  ‘well to speak to you i should think you was a boy and prince or no prince if you came worrying where i was cooking i would pin a napkin to your tails    and o lord i declare i hope your highness will forgive me’ the girl added  ‘i can’t keep it in my mind’  ‘no more can i’ cried otto  ‘that is just what they complain of’  they made a loverlylooking couple only the heavy pouring of that horsetail of water made them raise their voices above lovers’ pitch but to a jealous onlooker from above their mirth and close proximity might easily give umbrage and a rough voice out of a tuft of brambles began calling on ottilia by name  she changed colour at that  ‘it is fritz’ she said  ‘i must go’  ‘go my dear and i need not bid you go in peace for i think you have discovered that i am not formidable at close quarters’ said the prince and made her a fine gesture of dismissal  so ottilia skipped up the bank and disappeared into the thicket stopping once for a single blushing bob—blushing because she had in the interval once more forgotten and remembered the stranger’s quality  otto returned to his rock promontory but his humour had in the meantime changed  the sun now shone more fairly on the pool and over its brown welling surface the blue of heaven and the golden green of the spring foliage danced in fleeting arabesque  the eddies laughed and brightened with essential colour  and the beauty of the dell began to rankle in the prince’s mind it was so near to his own borders yet without  he had never had much of the joy of possessorship in any of the thousand and one beautiful and curious things that were his and now he was conscious of envy for what was another’s  it was indeed a smiling dilettante sort of envy but yet there it was the passion of ahab for the vineyard done in little and he was relieved when mr killian appeared upon the scene  ‘i hope sir that you have slept well under my plain roof’ said the old farmer  ‘i am admiring this sweet spot that you are privileged to dwell in’ replied otto evading the inquiry  ‘it is rustic’ returned mr gottesheim looking around him with complacency ‘a very rustic corner and some of the land to the west is most excellent fat land excellent deep soil  you should see my wheat in the tenacre field  there is not a farm in grünewald no nor many in gerolstein to match the river farm  some sixty—i keep thinking when i sow—some sixty and some seventy and some an hundredfold and my own place six score  but that sir is partly the farming’  ‘and the stream has fish’ asked otto  ‘a fishpond’ said the farmer  ‘ay it is a pleasant bit  it is pleasant even here if one had time with the brook drumming in that black pool and the green things hanging all about the rocks and dear heart to see the very pebbles all turned to gold and precious stones but you have come to that time of life sir when if you will excuse me you must look to have the rheumatism set in  thirty to forty is as one may say their seedtime  and this is a damp cold corner for the early morning and an empty stomach  if i might humbly advise you sir i would be moving’  ‘with all my heart’ said otto gravely  ‘and so you have lived your life here’ he added as they turned to go  ‘here i was born’ replied the farmer ‘and here i wish i could say i was to die  but fortune sir fortune turns the wheel  they say she is blind but we will hope she only sees a little farther on  my grandfather and my father and i we have all tilled these acres my furrow following theirs  all the three names are on the garden bench two killians and one johann  yes sir good men have prepared themselves for the great change in my old garden  well do i mind my father in a woollen nightcap the good soul going round and round to see the last of it  ‘killian’ said he ‘do you see the smoke of my tobacco  why’ said he ‘that is man’s life’  it was his last pipe and i believe he knew it and it was a strange thing without doubt to leave the trees that he had planted and the son that he had begotten ay sir and even the old pipe with the turk’s head that he had smoked since he was a lad and went acourting  but here we have no continuing city and as for the eternal it’s a comfortable thought that we have other merits than our own  and yet you would hardly think how sore it goes against the grain with me to die in a strange bed’  ‘and must you do so  for what reason’ otto asked  ‘the reason  the place is to be sold three thousand crowns’ replied mr gottesheim  ‘had it been a third of that i may say without boasting that what with my credit and my savings i could have met the sum  but at three thousand unless i have singular good fortune and the new proprietor continues me in office there is nothing left me but to budge’  otto’s fancy for the place redoubled at the news and became joined with other feelings  if all he heard were true grünewald was growing very hot for a sovereign prince it might be well to have a refuge and if so what more delightful hermitage could man imagine  mr gottesheim besides had touched his sympathies  every man loves in his soul to play the part of the stage deity  and to step down to the aid of the old farmer who had so roughly handled him in talk was the ideal of a fair revenge  otto’s thoughts brightened at the prospect and he began to regard himself with a renewed respect  ‘i can find you i believe a purchaser’ he said ‘and one who would continue to avail himself of your skill’  ‘can you sir indeed’ said the old man  ‘well i shall be heartily obliged for i begin to find a man may practise resignation all his days as he takes physic and not come to like it in the end’  ‘if you will have the papers drawn you may even burthen the purchase with your interest’ said otto  ‘let it be assured to you through life’  ‘your friend sir’ insinuated killian ‘would not perhaps care to make the interest reversible  fritz is a good lad’  ‘fritz is young’ said the prince dryly ‘he must earn consideration not inherit’  ‘he has long worked upon the place sir’ insisted mr gottesheim ‘and at my great age for i am seventyeight come harvest it would be a troublesome thought to the proprietor how to fill my shoes  it would be a care spared to assure yourself of fritz  and i believe he might be tempted by a permanency’  ‘the young man has unsettled views’ returned otto  ‘possibly the purchaser—’ began killian  a little spot of anger burned in otto’s cheek  ‘i am the purchaser’ he said  ‘it was what i might have guessed’ replied the farmer bowing with an aged obsequious dignity  ‘you have made an old man very happy and i may say indeed that i have entertained an angel unawares  sir the great people of this world—and by that i mean those who are great in station—if they had only hearts like yours how they would make the fires burn and the poor sing’  ‘i would not judge them hardly sir’ said otto  ‘we all have our frailties’  ‘truly sir’ said mr gottesheim with unction  ‘and by what name sir am i to address my generous landlord’  the double recollection of an english traveller whom he had received the week before at court and of an old english rogue called transome whom he had known in youth came pertinently to the prince’s help ‘transome’ he answered ‘is my name  i am an english traveller  it is today tuesday  on thursday before noon the money shall be ready let us meet if you please in mittwalden at the “morning star”’  ‘i am in all things lawful your servant to command’ replied the farmer  ‘an englishman  you are a great race of travellers  and has your lordship some experience of land’  ‘i have had some interest of the kind before’ returned the prince ‘not in gerolstein indeed  but fortune as you say turns the wheel and i desire to be beforehand with her revolutions’  ‘very right sir i am sure’ said mr killian  they had been strolling with deliberation but they were now drawing near to the farmhouse mounting by the trellised pathway to the level of the meadow  a little before them the sound of voices had been some while audible and now grew louder and more distinct with every step of their advance  presently when they emerged upon the top of the bank they beheld fritz and ottilia some way off he very black and bloodshot emphasising his hoarse speech with the smacking of his fist against his palm she standing a little way off in blowsy voluble distress  ‘dear me’ said mr gottesheim and made as if he would turn aside  but otto went straight towards the lovers in whose dissension he believed himself to have a share  and indeed as soon as he had seen the prince fritz had stood tragic as if awaiting and defying his approach  ‘o here you are’ he cried as soon as they were near enough for easy speech  ‘you are a man at least and must reply  what were you after why were you two skulking in the bush  god’ he broke out turning again upon ottilia ‘to think that i should waste my heart on you’  ‘i beg your pardon’ otto cut in  ‘you were addressing me  in virtue of what circumstance am i to render you an account of this young lady’s conduct  are you her father her brother her husband’  ‘o sir you know as well as i’ returned the peasant  ‘we keep company she and i  i love her and she is by way of loving me but all shall be aboveboard i would have her to know  i have a good pride of my own’  ‘why i perceive i must explain to you what love is’ said otto  ‘its measure is kindness  it is very possible that you are proud but she too may have some selfesteem i do not speak for myself  and perhaps if your own doings were so curiously examined you might find it inconvenient to reply’  ‘these are all setoffs’ said the young man  ‘you know very well that a man is a man and a woman only a woman  that holds good all over up and down  i ask you a question i ask it again and here i stand’  he drew a mark and toed it  ‘when you have studied liberal doctrines somewhat deeper’ said the prince ‘you will perhaps change your note  you are a man of false weights and measures my young friend  you have one scale for women another for men one for princes and one for farmerfolk  on the prince who neglects his wife you can be most severe  but what of the lover who insults his mistress  you use the name of love  i should think this lady might very fairly ask to be delivered from love of such a nature for if i a stranger had been onetenth part so gross and so discourteous you would most righteously have broke my head  it would have been in your part as lover to protect her from such insolence protect her first then from yourself’  ‘ay’ quoth mr gottesheim who had been looking on with his hands behind his tall old back ‘ay that’s scripture truth’  fritz was staggered not only by the prince’s imperturbable superiority of manner but by a glimmering consciousness that he himself was in the wrong  the appeal to liberal doctrines had besides unmanned him  ‘well’ said he ‘if i was rude i’ll own to it  i meant no ill and did nothing out of my just rights but i am above all these old vulgar notions too and if i spoke sharp i’ll ask her pardon’  ‘freely granted fritz’ said ottilia  ‘but all this doesn’t answer me’ cried fritz  ‘i ask what you two spoke about  she says she promised not to tell well then i mean to know civility is civility but i’ll be no man’s gull  i have a right to common justice if i do keep company’  ‘if you will ask mr gottesheim’ replied otto ‘you will find i have not spent my hours in idleness  i have since i arose this morning agreed to buy the farm  so far i will go to satisfy a curiosity which i condemn’  ‘o well if there was business that’s another matter’ returned fritz ‘though it beats me why you could not tell  but of course if the gentleman is to buy the farm i suppose there would naturally be an end’  ‘to be sure’ said mr gottesheim with a strong accent of conviction  but ottilia was much braver  ‘there now’ she cried in triumph  ‘what did i tell you  i told you i was fighting your battles  now you see think shame of your suspicious temper  you should go down upon your bended knees both to that gentleman and me’    chapter iv—in which the prince collects opinions by the way   a little before noon otto by a triumph of manoeuvring effected his escape  he was quit in this way of the ponderous gratitude of mr killian and of the confidential gratitude of poor ottilia but of fritz he was not quit so readily  that young politician brimming with mysterious glances offered to lend his convoy as far as to the highroad and otto in fear of some residuary jealousy and for the girl’s sake had not the courage to gainsay him but he regarded his companion with uneasy glances and devoutly wished the business at an end  for some time fritz walked by the mare in silence and they had already traversed more than half the proposed distance when with something of a blush he looked up and opened fire  ‘are you not’ he asked ‘what they call a socialist’  ‘why no’ returned otto ‘not precisely what they call so  why do you ask’  ‘i will tell you why’ said the young man  ‘i saw from the first that you were a red progressional and nothing but the fear of old killian kept you back  and there sir you were right old men are always cowards  but nowadays you see there are so many groups you can never tell how far the likeliest kind of man may be prepared to go and i was never sure you were one of the strong thinkers till you hinted about women and free love’  ‘indeed’ cried otto ‘i never said a word of such a thing’  ‘not you’ cried fritz  ‘never a word to compromise  you was sowing seed groundbait our president calls it  but it’s hard to deceive me for i know all the agitators and their ways and all the doctrines and between you and me’ lowering his voice ‘i am myself affiliated  o yes i am a secret society man and here is my medal’  and drawing out a green ribbon that he wore about his neck he held up for otto’s inspection a pewter medal bearing the imprint of a phoenix and the legend libertas  ‘and so now you see you may trust me’ added fritz ‘i am none of your alehouse talkers i am a convinced revolutionary’ and he looked meltingly upon otto  ‘i see’ replied the prince ‘that is very gratifying  well sir the great thing for the good of one’s country is first of all to be a good man  all springs from there  for my part although you are right in thinking that i have to do with politics i am unfit by intellect and temper for a leading rôle  i was intended i fear for a subaltern  yet we have all something to command mr fritz if it be only our own temper and a man about to marry must look closely to himself  the husband’s like the prince’s is a very artificial standing and it is hard to be kind in either  do you follow that’  ‘o yes i follow that’ replied the young man sadly chopfallen over the nature of the information he had elicited and then brightening up ‘is it’ he ventured ‘is it for an arsenal that you have bought the farm’  ‘we’ll see about that’ the prince answered laughing  ‘you must not be too zealous  and in the meantime if i were you i would say nothing on the subject’  ‘o trust me sir for that’ cried fritz as he pocketed a crown  ‘and you’ve let nothing out for i suspected—i might say i knew it—from the first  and mind you when a guide is required’ he added ‘i know all the forest paths’  otto rode away chuckling  this talk with fritz had vastly entertained him nor was he altogether discontented with his bearing at the farm men he was able to tell himself had behaved worse under smaller provocation  and to harmonise all the road and the april air were both delightful to his soul  up and down and to and fro ever mounting through the wooded foothills the broad white highroad wound onward into grünewald  on either hand the pines stood coolly rooted—green moss prospering springs welling forth between their knuckled spurs and though some were broad and stalwart and others spiry and slender yet all stood firm in the same attitude and with the same expression like a silent army presenting arms  the road lay all the way apart from towns and villages which it left on either hand  here and there indeed in the bottom of green glens the prince could spy a few congregated roofs or perhaps above him on a shoulder the solitary cabin of a woodman  but the highway was an international undertaking and with its face set for distant cities scorned the little life of grünewald  hence it was exceeding solitary near the frontier otto met a detachment of his own troops marching in the hot dust and he was recognised and somewhat feebly cheered as he rode by  but from that time forth and for a long while he was alone with the great woods  gradually the spell of pleasure relaxed his own thoughts returned like stinging insects in a cloud and the talk of the night before like a shower of buffets fell upon his memory  he looked east and west for any comforter and presently he was aware of a crossroad coming steeply down hill and a horseman cautiously descending  a human voice or presence like a spring in the desert was now welcome in itself and otto drew bridle to await the coming of this stranger  he proved to be a very redfaced thicklipped countryman with a pair of fat saddlebags and a stone bottle at his waist who as soon as the prince hailed him jovially if somewhat thickly answered  at the same time he gave a beery yaw in the saddle  it was clear his bottle was no longer full  ‘do you ride towards mittwalden’ asked the prince  ‘as far as the crossroad to tannenbrunn’ the man replied  ‘will you bear company’  ‘with pleasure  i have even waited for you on the chance’ answered otto  by this time they were close alongside and the man with the countryfolk instinct turned his cloudy vision first of all on his companion’s mount ‘the devil’ he cried  ‘you ride a bonny mare friend’  and then his curiosity being satisfied about the essential he turned his attention to that merely secondary matter his companion’s face  he started  ‘the prince’ he cried saluting with another yaw that came near dismounting him  ‘i beg your pardon your highness not to have recognised you at once’  the prince was vexed out of his selfpossession  ‘since you know me’ he said ‘it is unnecessary we should ride together  i will precede you if you please’  and he was about to set spur to the grey mare when the halfdrunken fellow reaching over laid his hand upon the rein  ‘hark you’ he said ‘prince or no prince that is not how one man should conduct himself with another  what  you’ll ride with me incog and set me talking  but if i know you you’ll preshede me if you please  spy’ and the fellow crimson with drink and injured vanity almost spat the word into the prince’s face  a horrid confusion came over otto  he perceived that he had acted rudely grossly presuming on his station  and perhaps a little shiver of physical alarm mingled with his remorse for the fellow was very powerful and not more than half in the possession of his senses  ‘take your hand from my rein’ he said with a sufficient assumption of command and when the man rather to his wonder had obeyed ‘you should understand sir’ he added ‘that while i might be glad to ride with you as one person of sagacity with another and so receive your true opinions it would amuse me very little to hear the empty compliments you would address to me as prince’  ‘you think i would lie do you’ cried the man with the bottle purpling deeper  ‘i know you would’ returned otto entering entirely into his selfpossession  ‘you would not even show me the medal you wear about your neck’  for he had caught a glimpse of a green ribbon at the fellow’s throat  the change was instantaneous the red face became mottled with yellow a thickfingered tottering hand made a clutch at the telltale ribbon ‘medal’ the man cried wonderfully sobered  ‘i have no medal’  ‘pardon me’ said the prince  ‘i will even tell you what that medal bears a phoenix burning with the word libertas’  the medallist remaining speechless ‘you are a pretty fellow’ continued otto smiling ‘to complain of incivility from the man whom you conspire to murder’  ‘murder’ protested the man  ‘nay never that nothing criminal for me’  ‘you are strangely misinformed’ said otto  ‘conspiracy itself is criminal and ensures the pain of death  nay sir death it is i will guarantee my accuracy  not that you need be so deplorably affected for i am no officer  but those who mingle with politics should look at both sides of the medal’  ‘your highness    ’ began the knight of the bottle  ‘nonsense you are a republican’ cried otto ‘what have you to do with highnesses  but let us continue to ride forward  since you so much desire it i cannot find it in my heart to deprive you of my company and for that matter i have a question to address to you  why being so great a body of men—for you are a great body—fifteen thousand i have heard but that will be understated am i right’  the man gurgled in his throat  ‘why then being so considerable a party’ resumed otto ‘do you not come before me boldly with your wants—what do i say with your commands have i the name of being passionately devoted to my throne  i can scarce suppose it  come then show me your majority and i will instantly resign  tell this to your friends assure them from me of my docility assure them that however they conceive of my deficiencies they cannot suppose me more unfit to be a ruler than i do myself  i am one of the worst princes in europe will they improve on that’  ‘far be it from me   ’ the man began  ‘see now if you will not defend my government’ cried otto  ‘if i were you i would leave conspiracies  you are as little fit to be a conspirator as i to be a king’  ‘one thing i will say out’ said the man  ‘it is not so much you that we complain of it’s your lady’  ‘not a word sir’ said the prince and then after a moment’s pause and in tones of some anger and contempt ‘i once more advise you to have done with politics’ he added ‘and when next i see you let me see you sober a morning drunkard is the last man to sit in judgment even upon the worst of princes’  ‘i have had a drop but i had not been drinking’ the man replied triumphing in a sound distinction  ‘and if i had what then  nobody hangs by me  but my mill is standing idle and i blame it on your wife am i alone in that  go round and ask  where are the mills  where are the young men that should be working  where is the currency  all paralysed  no sir it is not equal for i suffer for your faults—i pay for them by george out of a poor man’s pocket  and what have you to do with mine  drunk or sober i can see my country going to hell and i can see whose fault it is  and so now i’ve said my say and you may drag me to a stinking dungeon what care i  i’ve spoke the truth and so i’ll hold hard and not intrude upon your highness’s society’  and the miller reined up and clumsily enough saluted  ‘you will observe i have not asked your name’ said otto  ‘i wish you a good ride’ and he rode on hard  but let him ride as he pleased this interview with the miller was a chokepear which he could not swallow he had begun by receiving a reproof in manners and ended by sustaining a defeat in logic both from a man whom he despised  all his old thoughts returned with fresher venom  and by three in the afternoon coming to the crossroads for beckstein otto decided to turn aside and dine there leisurely  nothing at least could be worse than to go on as he was going  in the inn at beckstein he remarked immediately upon his entrance an intelligent young gentleman dining with a book in front of him  he had his own place laid close to the reader and with a proper apology broke ground by asking what he read  ‘i am perusing’ answered the young gentleman ‘the last work of the herr doctor hohenstockwitz cousin and librarian of your prince here in grünewald—a man of great erudition and some lambencies of wit’  ‘i am acquainted’ said otto ‘with the herr doctor though not yet with his work’  ‘two privileges that i must envy you’ replied the young man politely ‘an honour in hand a pleasure in the bush’  ‘the herr doctor is a man much respected i believe for his attainments’ asked the prince  ‘he is sir a remarkable instance of the force of intellect’ replied the reader  ‘who of our young men know anything of his cousin all reigning prince although he be  who but has heard of doctor gotthold but intellectual merit alone of all distinctions has its base in nature’  ‘i have the gratification of addressing a student—perhaps an author’ otto suggested  the young man somewhat flushed  ‘i have some claim to both distinctions sir as you suppose’ said he ‘there is my card  i am the licentiate roederer author of several works on the theory and practice of politics’  ‘you immensely interest me’ said the prince ‘the more so as i gather that here in grünewald we are on the brink of revolution  pray since these have been your special studies would you augur hopefully of such a movement’  ‘i perceive’ said the young author with a certain vinegary twitch ‘that you are unacquainted with my opuscula  i am a convinced authoritarian  i share none of those illusory utopian fancies with which empirics blind themselves and exasperate the ignorant  the day of these ideas is believe me past or at least passing’  ‘when i look about me—’ began otto  ‘when you look about you’ interrupted the licentiate ‘you behold the ignorant  but in the laboratory of opinion beside the studious lamp we begin already to discard these figments  we begin to return to nature’s order to what i might call if i were to borrow from the language of therapeutics the expectant treatment of abuses  you will not misunderstand me’ he continued ‘a country in the condition in which we find grünewald a prince such as your prince otto we must explicitly condemn they are behind the age  but i would look for a remedy not to brute convulsions but to the natural supervenience of a more able sovereign  i should amuse you perhaps’ added the licentiate with a smile ‘i think i should amuse you if i were to explain my notion of a prince  we who have studied in the closet no longer in this age propose ourselves for active service  the paths we have perceived are incompatible  i would not have a student on the throne though i would have one near by for an adviser  i would set forward as prince a man of a good medium understanding lively rather than deep a man of courtly manner possessed of the double art to ingratiate and to command receptive accommodating seductive  i have been observing you since your first entrance  well sir were i a subject of grünewald i should pray heaven to set upon the seat of government just such another as yourself’  ‘the devil you would’ exclaimed the prince  the licentiate roederer laughed most heartily  ‘i thought i should astonish you’ he said  ‘these are not the ideas of the masses’  ‘they are not i can assure you’ otto said  ‘or rather’ distinguished the licentiate ‘not today  the time will come however when these ideas shall prevail’  ‘you will permit me sir to doubt it’ said otto  ‘modesty is always admirable’ chuckled the theorist  ‘but yet i assure you a man like you with such a man as say doctor gotthold at your elbow would be for all practical issues my ideal ruler’  at this rate the hours sped pleasantly for otto  but the licentiate unfortunately slept that night at beckstein where he was being dainty in the saddle and given to half stages  and to find a convoy to mittwalden and thus mitigate the company of his own thoughts the prince had to make favour with a certain party of woodmerchants from various states of the empire who had been drinking together somewhat noisily at the far end of the apartment  the night had already fallen when they took the saddle  the merchants were very loud and mirthful each had a face like a nor’west moon and they played pranks with each others’ horses and mingled songs and choruses and alternately remembered and forgot the companion of their ride  otto thus combined society and solitude hearkening now to their chattering and empty talk now to the voices of the encircling forest the starlit dark the faint wood airs the clank of the horseshoes making broken music accorded together and attuned his mind  and he was still in a most equal temper when the party reached the top of that long hill that overlooks mittwalden  down in the bottom of a bowl of forest the lights of the little formal town glittered in a pattern street crossing street away by itself on the right the palace was glowing like a factory  although he knew not otto one of the woodmerchants was a native of the state  ‘there’ said he pointing to the palace with his whip ‘there is jezebel’s inn’  ‘what do you call it that’ cried another laughing  ‘ay that’s what they call it’ returned the grünewalder and he broke into a song which the rest as people well acquainted with the words and air instantly took up in chorus  her serene highness amalia seraphina princess of grünewald was the heroine gondremark the hero of this ballad  shame hissed in otto’s ears  he reined up short and sat stunned in the saddle and the singers continued to descend the hill without him  the song went to a rough swashing popular air and long after the words became inaudible the swing of the music rising and falling echoed insult in the prince’s brain  he fled the sounds  hard by him on his right a road struck towards the palace and he followed it through the thick shadows and branching alleys of the park  it was a busy place on a fine summer’s afternoon when the court and burghers met and saluted but at that hour of the night in the early spring it was deserted to the roosting birds  hares rustled among the covert here and there a statue stood glimmering with its eternal gesture here and there the echo of an imitation temple clattered ghostly to the trampling of the mare  ten minutes brought him to the upper end of his own home garden where the small stables opened over a bridge upon the park  the yard clock was striking the hour of ten so was the big bell in the palace belltower and farther off the belfries of the town  about the stable all else was silent but the stamping of stalled horses and the rattle of halters otto dismounted and as he did so a memory came back to him a whisper of dishonest grooms and stolen corn once heard long forgotten and now recurring in the nick of opportunity  he crossed the bridge and going up to a window knocked six or seven heavy blows in a particular cadence and as he did so smiled  presently a wicket was opened in the gate and a man’s head appeared in the dim starlight  ‘nothing tonight’ said a voice  ‘bring a lantern’ said the prince  ‘dear heart a’ mercy’ cried the groom  ‘who’s that’  ‘it is i the prince’ replied otto  ‘bring a lantern take in the mare and let me through into the garden’  the man remained silent for a while his head still projecting through the wicket  ‘his highness’ he said at last  ‘and why did your highness knock so strange’  ‘it is a superstition in mittwalden’ answered otto ‘that it cheapens corn’  with a sound like a sob the groom fled  he was very white when he returned even by the light of the lantern and his hand trembled as he undid the fastenings and took the mare  ‘your highness’ he began at last ‘for god’s sake    ’  and there he paused oppressed with guilt  ‘for god’s sake what’ asked otto cheerfully  ‘for god’s sake let us have cheaper corn say i  goodnight’  and he strode off into the garden leaving the groom petrified once more  the garden descended by a succession of stone terraces to the level of the fishpond  on the far side the ground rose again and was crowned by the confused roofs and gables of the palace  the modern pillared front the ballroom the great library the princely apartments the busy and illuminated quarters of that great house all faced the town  the garden side was much older and here it was almost dark only a few windows quietly lighted at various elevations  the great square tower rose thinning by stages like a telescope and on the top of all the flag hung motionless  the garden as it now lay in the dusk and glimmer of the starshine breathed of april violets  under night’s cavern arch the shrubs obscurely bustled  through the plotted terraces and down the marble stairs the prince rapidly descended fleeing before uncomfortable thoughts  but alas from these there is no city of refuge  and now when he was about midway of the descent distant strains of music began to fall upon his ear from the ballroom where the court was dancing they reached him faint and broken but they touched the keys of memory and through and above them otto heard the ranting melody of the woodmerchants’ song  mere blackness seized upon his mind  here he was coming home the wife was dancing the husband had been playing a trick upon a lackey and meanwhile all about them they were a byword to their subjects  such a prince such a husband such a man as this otto had become  and he sped the faster onward  some way below he came unexpectedly upon a sentry yet a little farther and he was challenged by a second and as he crossed the bridge over the fishpond an officer making the rounds stopped him once more  the parade of watch was more than usual but curiosity was dead in otto’s mind and he only chafed at the interruption  the porter of the back postern admitted him and started to behold him so disordered  thence hasting by private stairs and passages he came at length unseen to his own chamber tore off his clothes and threw himself upon his bed in the dark  the music of the ballroom still continued to a very lively measure and still behind that he heard in spirit the chorus of the merchants clanking down the hill     book ii—of love and politics   chapter i—what happened in the library   at a quarter before six on the following morning doctor gotthold was already at his desk in the library and with a small cup of black coffee at his elbow and an eye occasionally wandering to the busts and the long array of manycoloured books was quietly reviewing the labours of the day before  he was a man of about forty flaxenhaired with refined features a little worn and bright eyes somewhat faded  early to bed and early to rise his life was devoted to two things erudition and rhine wine  an ancient friendship existed latent between him and otto they rarely met but when they did it was to take up at once the thread of their suspended intimacy  gotthold the virgin priest of knowledge had envied his cousin for half a day when he was married he had never envied him his throne  reading was not a popular diversion at the court of grünewald and that great pleasant sunshiny gallery of books and statues was in practice gotthold’s private cabinet  on this particular wednesday morning however he had not been long about his manuscript when a door opened and the prince stepped into the apartment  the doctor watched him as he drew near receiving from each of the embayed windows in succession a flush of morning sun and otto looked so gay and walked so airily he was so well dressed and brushed and frizzled so pointdevice and of such a sovereign elegance that the heart of his cousin the recluse was rather moved against him  ‘goodmorning gotthold’ said otto dropping in a chair  ‘goodmorning otto’ returned the librarian  ‘you are an early bird is this an accident or do you begin reforming’  ‘it is about time i fancy’ answered the prince  ‘i cannot imagine’ said the doctor  ‘i am too sceptical to be an ethical adviser and as for good resolutions i believed in them when i was young  they are the colours of hope’s rainbow’  ‘if you come to think of it’ said otto ‘i am not a popular sovereign’ and with a look he changed his statement to a question  ‘popular  well there i would distinguish’ answered gotthold leaning back and joining the tips of his fingers  ‘there are various kinds of popularity the bookish which is perfectly impersonal as unreal as the nightmare the politician’s a mixed variety and yours which is the most personal of all  women take to you footmen adore you it is as natural to like you as to pat a dog and were you a sawmiller you would be the most popular citizen in grünewald  as a prince—well you are in the wrong trade  it is perhaps philosophical to recognise it as you do’  ‘perhaps philosophical’ repeated otto  ‘yes perhaps  i would not be dogmatic’ answered gotthold  ‘perhaps philosophical and certainly not virtuous’ otto resumed  ‘not of a roman virtue’ chuckled the recluse  otto drew his chair nearer to the table leaned upon it with his elbow and looked his cousin squarely in the face  ‘in short’ he asked ‘not manly’  ‘well’ gotthold hesitated ‘not manly if you will’  and then with a laugh ‘i did not know that you gave yourself out to be manly’ he added ‘it was one of the points that i inclined to like about you inclined i believe to admire  the names of virtues exercise a charm on most of us we must lay claim to all of them however incompatible we must all be both daring and prudent we must all vaunt our pride and go to the stake for our humility  not so you  without compromise you were yourself a pretty sight  i have always said it none so void of all pretence as otto’  ‘pretence and effort both’ cried otto  ‘a dead dog in a canal is more alive  and the question gotthold the question that i have to face is this can i not with effort and selfdenial can i not become a tolerable sovereign’  ‘never’ replied gotthold  ‘dismiss the notion  and besides dear child you would not try’  ‘nay gotthold i am not to be put by’ said otto  ‘if i am constitutionally unfit to be a sovereign what am i doing with this money with this palace with these guards  and i—a thief—am to execute the law on others’  ‘i admit the difficulty’ said gotthold  ‘well can i not try’ continued otto  ‘am i not bound to try  and with the advice and help of such a man as you—’  ‘me’ cried the librarian  ‘now god forbid’  otto though he was in no very smiling humour could not forbear to smile  ‘yet i was told last night’ he laughed ‘that with a man like me to impersonate and a man like you to touch the springs a very possible government could be composed’  ‘now i wonder in what diseased imagination’ gotthold said ‘that preposterous monster saw the light of day’  ‘it was one of your own trade—a writer one roederer’ said otto  ‘roederer an ignorant puppy’ cried the librarian  ‘you are ungrateful’ said otto  ‘he is one of your professed admirers’  ‘is he’ cried gotthold obviously impressed  ‘come that is a good account of the young man  i must read his stuff again  it is the rather to his credit as our views are opposite  the east and west are not more opposite  can i have converted him  but no the incident belongs to fairyland’  ‘you are not then’ asked the prince ‘an authoritarian’  ‘i  god bless me no’ said gotthold  ‘i am a red dear child’  ‘that brings me then to my next point and by a natural transition  if i am so clearly unfitted for my post’ the prince asked ‘if my friends admit it if my subjects clamour for my downfall if revolution is preparing at this hour must i not go forth to meet the inevitable should i not save these horrors and be done with these absurdities in a word should i not abdicate  o believe me i feel the ridicule the vast abuse of language’ he added wincing ‘but even a principulus like me cannot resign he must make a great gesture and come buskined forth and abdicate’  ‘ay’ said gotthold ‘or else stay where he is  what gnat has bitten you today  do you not know that you are touching with lay hands the very holiest inwards of philosophy where madness dwells  ay otto madness for in the serene temples of the wise the inmost shrine which we carefully keep locked is full of spiders’ webs  all men all are fundamentally useless nature tolerates she does not need she does not use them sterile flowers  all—down to the fellow swinking in a byre whom fools point out for the exception—all are useless all weave ropes of sand or like a child that has breathed on a window write and obliterate write and obliterate idle words  talk of it no more  that way i tell you madness lies’  the speaker rose from his chair and then sat down again  he laughed a little laugh and then changing his tone resumed ‘yes dear child we are not here to do battle with giants we are here to be happy like the flowers if we can be  it is because you could that i have always secretly admired you  cling to that trade believe me it is the right one  be happy be idle be airy  to the devil with all casuistry and leave the state to gondremark as heretofore  he does it well enough they say and his vanity enjoys the situation’  ‘gotthold’ cried otto ‘what is this to me  useless is not the question i cannot rest at uselessness i must be useful or i must be noxious—one or other  i grant you the whole thing prince and principality alike is pure absurdity a stroke of satire and that a banker or the man who keeps an inn has graver duties  but now when i have washed my hands of it three years and left all—labour responsibility and honour and enjoyment too if there be any—to gondremark and to—seraphina—’  he hesitated at the name and gotthold glanced aside  ‘well’ the prince continued ‘what has come of it taxes army cannon—why it’s like a box of lead soldiers  and the people sick at the folly of it and fired with the injustice  and war too—i hear of war—war in this teapot  what a complication of absurdity and disgrace  and when the inevitable end arrives—the revolution—who will be to blame in the sight of god who will be gibbeted in public opinion  i  prince puppet’  ‘i thought you had despised public opinion’ said gotthold  ‘i did’ said otto sombrely ‘but now i do not  i am growing old  and then gotthold there is seraphina  she is loathed in this country that i brought her to and suffered her to spoil  yes i gave it her as a plaything and she has broken it a fine prince an admirable princess even her life—i ask you gotthold is her life safe’  ‘it is safe enough today’ replied the librarian ‘but since you ask me seriously i would not answer for tomorrow  she is illadvised’  ‘and by whom  by this gondremark to whom you counsel me to leave my country’ cried the prince  ‘rare advice  the course that i have been following all these years to come at last to this  o illadvised if that were all  see now there is no sense in beating about the bush between two men you know what scandal says of her’  gotthold with pursed lips silently nodded  ‘well come you are not very cheering as to my conduct as the prince have i even done my duty as a husband’ otto asked  ‘nay nay’ said gotthold earnestly and eagerly ‘this is another chapter  i am an old celibate an old monk  i cannot advise you in your marriage’  ‘nor do i require advice’ said otto rising  ‘all of this must cease’ and he began to walk to and fro with his hands behind his back  ‘well otto may god guide you’ said gotthold after a considerable silence  ‘i cannot’  ‘from what does all this spring’ said the prince stopping in his walk ‘what am i to call it  diffidence  the fear of ridicule  inverted vanity  what matter names if it has brought me to this  i could never bear to be bustling about nothing i was ashamed of this toy kingdom from the first i could not tolerate that people should fancy i believed in a thing so patently absurd  i would do nothing that cannot be done smiling  i have a sense of humour forsooth  i must know better than my maker  and it was the same thing in my marriage’ he added more hoarsely  ‘i did not believe this girl could care for me i must not intrude i must preserve the foppery of my indifference  what an impotent picture’  ‘ay we have the same blood’ moralised gotthold  ‘you are drawing with fine strokes the character of the born sceptic’  ‘sceptic—coward’ cried otto  ‘coward is the word  a springless puttyhearted cowering coward’  and as the prince rapped out the words in tones of unusual vigour a little stout old gentleman opening a door behind gotthold received them fairly in the face  with his parrot’s beak for a nose his pursed mouth his little goggling eyes he was the picture of formality and in ordinary circumstances strutting behind the drum of his corporation he impressed the beholder with a certain air of frozen dignity and wisdom but at the smallest contrariety his trembling hands and disconnected gestures betrayed the weakness at the root  and now when he was thus surprisingly received in that library of mittwalden palace which was the customary haunt of silence his hands went up into the air as if he had been shot and he cried aloud with the scream of an old woman  ‘o’ he gasped recovering ‘your highness  i beg ten thousand pardons but your highness at such an hour in the library—a circumstance so unusual as your highness’s presence was a thing i could not be expected to foresee’  ‘there is no harm done herr cancellarius’ said otto  ‘i came upon the errand of a moment some papers i left overnight with the herr doctor’ said the chancellor of grünewald  ‘herr doctor if you will kindly give me them i will intrude no longer’  gotthold unlocked a drawer and handed a bundle of manuscript to the old gentleman who prepared with fitting salutations to take his departure  ‘herr greisengesang since we have met’ said otto ‘let us talk’  ‘i am honoured by his highness’s commands’ replied the chancellor  ‘all has been quiet since i left’ asked the prince resuming his seat  ‘the usual business your highness’ answered greisengesang ‘punctual trifles huge indeed if neglected but trifles when discharged  your highness is most zealously obeyed’  ‘obeyed herr cancellarius’ returned the prince  ‘and when have i obliged you with an order  replaced let us rather say  but to touch upon these trifles instance me a few’  ‘the routine of government from which your highness has so wisely dissociated his leisure    ’ began greisengesang  ‘we will leave my leisure sir’ said otto  ‘approach the facts’  ‘the routine of business was proceeded with’ replied the official now visibly twittering  ‘it is very strange herr cancellarius that you should so persistently avoid my questions’ said the prince  ‘you tempt me to suppose a purpose in your dulness  i have asked you whether all was quiet do me the pleasure to reply’  ‘perfectly—o perfectly quiet’ jerked the ancient puppet with every signal of untruth  ‘i make a note of these words’ said the prince gravely  ‘you assure me your sovereign that since the date of my departure nothing has occurred of which you owe me an account’  ‘i take your highness i take the herr doctor to witness’ cried greisengesang ‘that i have had no such expression’  ‘halt’ said the prince and then after a pause ‘herr greisengesang you are an old man and you served my father before you served me’ he added  ‘it consists neither with your dignity nor mine that you should babble excuses and stumble possibly upon untruths  collect your thoughts and then categorically inform me of all you have been charged to hide’  gotthold stooping very low over his desk appeared to have resumed his labours but his shoulders heaved with subterranean merriment  the prince waited drawing his handkerchief quietly through his fingers  ‘your highness in this informal manner’ said the old gentleman at last ‘and being unavoidably deprived of documents it would be difficult it would be impossible to do justice to the somewhat grave occurrences which have transpired’  ‘i will not criticise your attitude’ replied the prince  ‘i desire that between you and me all should be done gently for i have not forgotten my old friend that you were kind to me from the first and for a period of years a faithful servant  i will thus dismiss the matters on which you waive immediate inquiry  but you have certain papers actually in your hand  come herr greisengesang there is at least one point for which you have authority  enlighten me on that’  ‘on that’ cried the old gentleman  ‘o that is a trifle a matter your highness of police a detail of a purely administrative order  these are simply a selection of the papers seized upon the english traveller’  ‘seized’ echoed otto  ‘in what sense  explain yourself’  ‘sir john crabtree’ interposed gotthold looking up ‘was arrested yesterday evening’  ‘it this so herr cancellarius’ demanded otto sternly  ‘it was judged right your highness’ protested greisengesang  ‘the decree was in due form invested with your highness’s authority by procuration  i am but an agent i had no status to prevent the measure’  ‘this man my guest has been arrested’ said the prince  ‘on what grounds sir  with what colour of pretence’  the chancellor stammered  ‘your highness will perhaps find the reason in these documents’ said gotthold pointing with the tail of his pen  otto thanked his cousin with a look  ‘give them to me’ he said addressing the chancellor  but that gentleman visibly hesitated to obey  ‘baron von gondremark’ he said ‘has made the affair his own  i am in this case a mere messenger and as such i am not clothed with any capacity to communicate the documents i carry  herr doctor i am convinced you will not fail to bear me out’  ‘i have heard a great deal of nonsense’ said gotthold ‘and most of it from you but this beats all’  ‘come sir’ said otto rising ‘the papers  i command’  herr greisengesang instantly gave way  ‘with your highness’s permission’ he said ‘and laying at his feet my most submiss apologies i will now hasten to attend his further orders in the chancery’  ‘herr cancellarius do you see this chair’ said otto  ‘there is where you shall attend my further orders  o now no more’ he cried with a gesture as the old man opened his lips  ‘you have sufficiently marked your zeal to your employer and i begin to weary of a moderation you abuse’  the chancellor moved to the appointed chair and took his seat in silence  ‘and now’ said otto opening the roll ‘what is all this it looks like the manuscript of a book’  ‘it is’ said gotthold ‘the manuscript of a book of travels’  ‘you have read it doctor hohenstockwitz’ asked the prince  ‘nay i but saw the titlepage’ replied gotthold  ‘but the roll was given to me open and i heard no word of any secrecy’  otto dealt the chancellor an angry glance  ‘i see’ he went on  ‘the papers of an author seized at this date of the world’s history in a state so petty and so ignorant as grünewald here is indeed an ignominious folly  sir’ to the chancellor ‘i marvel to find you in so scurvy an employment  on your conduct to your prince i will not dwell but to descend to be a spy  for what else can it be called  to seize the papers of this gentleman the private papers of a stranger the toil of a life perhaps—to open and to read them  and what have we to do with books  the herr doctor might perhaps be asked for his advice but we have no index expurgatorius in grünewald  had we but that we should be the most absolute parody and farce upon this tawdry earth’  yet even while otto spoke he had continued to unfold the roll and now when it lay fully open his eye rested on the titlepage elaborately written in red ink  it ran thus                                     memoirs                           of a visit to the various                               courts of europe                                       by                          sir john crabtree baronet  below was a list of chapters each bearing the name of one of the european courts and among these the nineteenth and the last upon the list was dedicated to grünewald  ‘ah  the court of grünewald’ said otto ‘that should be droll reading’ and his curiosity itched for it  ‘a methodical dog this english baronet’ said gotthold  ‘each chapter written and finished on the spot  i shall look for his work when it appears’  ‘it would be odd now just to glance at it’ said otto wavering  gotthold’s brow darkened and he looked out of window  but though the prince understood the reproof his weakness prevailed  ‘i will’ he said with an uneasy laugh ‘i will i think just glance at it’  so saying he resumed his seat and spread the traveller’s manuscript upon the table    chapter ii—‘on the court of grÜnewald’ being a portion of the traveller’s manuscript   it may well be asked it was thus the english traveller began his nineteenth chapter why i should have chosen grünewald out of so many other states equally petty formal dull and corrupt  accident indeed decided and not i but i have seen no reason to regret my visit  the spectacle of this small society macerating in its own abuses was not perhaps instructive but i have found it exceedingly diverting  the reigning prince otto johann friedrich a young man of imperfect education questionable valour and no scintilla of capacity has fallen into entire public contempt  it was with difficulty that i obtained an interview for he is frequently absent from a court where his presence is unheeded and where his only rôle is to be a cloak for the amours of his wife  at last however on the third occasion when i visited the palace i found this sovereign in the exercise of his inglorious function with the wife on one hand and the lover on the other  he is not illlooking he has hair of a ruddy gold which naturally curls and his eyes are dark a combination which i always regard as the mark of some congenital deficiency physical or moral his features are irregular but pleasing the nose perhaps a little short and the mouth a little womanish his address is excellent and he can express himself with point  but to pierce below these externals is to come on a vacuity of any sterling quality a deliquescence of the moral nature a frivolity and inconsequence of purpose that mark the nearly perfect fruit of a decadent age  he has a worthless smattering of many subjects but a grasp of none  ‘i soon weary of a pursuit’ he said to me laughing it would almost appear as if he took a pride in his incapacity and lack of moral courage  the results of his dilettanteism are to be seen in every field he is a bad fencer a secondrate horseman dancer shot he sings—i have heard him—and he sings like a child he writes intolerable verses in more than doubtful french he acts like the common amateur and in short there is no end to the number of the things that he does and does badly  his one manly taste is for the chase  in sum he is but a plexus of weaknesses the singing chambermaid of the stage tricked out in man’s apparel and mounted on a circus horse  i have seen this poor phantom of a prince riding out alone or with a few huntsmen disregarded by all and i have been even grieved for the bearer of so futile and melancholy an existence  the last merovingians may have looked not otherwise  the princess amalia seraphina a daughter of the grandducal house of toggenburgtannhäuser would be equally inconsiderable if she were not a cutting instrument in the hands of an ambitious man  she is much younger than the prince a girl of twoandtwenty sick with vanity superficially clever and fundamentally a fool  she has a redbrown rolling eye too large for her face and with sparks of both levity and ferocity her forehead is high and narrow her figure thin and a little stooping  her manners her conversation which she interlards with french her very tastes and ambitions are alike assumed and the assumption is ungracefully apparent hoyden playing cleopatra  i should judge her to be incapable of truth  in private life a girl of this description embroils the peace of families walks attended by a troop of scowling swains and passes once at least through the divorce court it is a common and except to the cynic an uninteresting type  on the throne however and in the hands of a man like gondremark she may become the authoress of serious public evils  gondremark the true ruler of this unfortunate country is a more complex study  his position in grünewald to which he is a foreigner is eminently false and that he should maintain it as he does a very miracle of impudence and dexterity  his speech his face his policy are all double heads and tails  which of the two extremes may be his actual design he were a bold man who should offer to decide  yet i will hazard the guess that he follows both experimentally and awaits at the hand of destiny one of those directing hints of which she is so lavish to the wise  on the one hand as maire du palais to the incompetent otto and using the lovesick princess for a tool and mouthpiece he pursues a policy of arbitrary power and territorial aggrandisement  he has called out the whole capable male population of the state to military service he has bought cannon he has tempted away promising officers from foreign armies and he now begins in his international relations to assume the swaggering port and the vague threatful language of a bully  the idea of extending grünewald may appear absurd but the little state is advantageously placed its neighbours are all defenceless and if at any moment the jealousies of the greater courts should neutralise each other an active policy might double the principality both in population and extent  certainly at least the scheme is entertained in the court of mittwalden nor do i myself regard it as entirely desperate  the margravate of brandenburg has grown from as small beginnings to a formidable power and though it is late in the day to try adventurous policies and the age of war seems ended fortune we must not forget still blindly turns her wheel for men and nations  concurrently with and tributary to these warlike preparations crushing taxes have been levied journals have been suppressed and the country which three years ago was prosperous and happy now stagnates in a forced inaction gold has become a curiosity and the mills stand idle on the mountain streams  on the other hand in his second capacity of popular tribune gondremark is the incarnation of the free lodges and sits at the centre of an organised conspiracy against the state  to any such movement my sympathies were early acquired and i would not willingly let fall a word that might embarrass or retard the revolution  but to show that i speak of knowledge and not as the reporter of mere gossip i may mention that i have myself been present at a meeting where the details of a republican constitution were minutely debated and arranged and i may add that gondremark was throughout referred to by the speakers as their captain in action and the arbiter of their disputes  he has taught his dupes for so i must regard them that his power of resistance to the princess is limited and at each fresh stretch of authority persuades them with specious reasons to postpone the hour of insurrection  thus to give some instances of his astute diplomacy he salved over the decree enforcing military service under the plea that to be well drilled and exercised in arms was even a necessary preparation for revolt  and the other day when it began to be rumoured abroad that a war was being forced on a reluctant neighbour the grand duke of gerolstein and i made sure it would be the signal for an instant rising i was struck dumb with wonder to find that even this had been prepared and was to be accepted i went from one to another in the liberal camp and all were in the same story all had been drilled and schooled and fitted out with vacuous argument  ‘the lads had better see some real fighting’ they said ‘and besides it will be as well to capture gerolstein we can then extend to our neighbours the blessing of liberty on the same day that we snatch it for ourselves and the republic will be all the stronger to resist if the kings of europe should band themselves together to reduce it’  i know not which of the two i should admire the more the simplicity of the multitude or the audacity of the adventurer  but such are the subtleties such the quibbling reasons with which he blinds and leads this people  how long a course so tortuous can be pursued with safety i am incapable of guessing not long one would suppose and yet this singular man has been treading the mazes for five years and his favour at court and his popularity among the lodges still endure unbroken  i have the privilege of slightly knowing him  heavily and somewhat clumsily built of a vast disjointed rambling frame he can still pull himself together and figure not without admiration in the saloon or the ballroom  his hue and temperament are plentifully bilious he has a saturnine eye his cheek is of a dark blue where he has been shaven essentially he is to be numbered among the manhaters a convinced contemner of his fellows  yet he is himself of a commonplace ambition and greedy of applause  in talk he is remarkable for a thirst of information loving rather to hear than to communicate for sound and studious views and judging by the extreme shortsightedness of common politicians for a remarkable provision of events  all this however without grace pleasantry or charm heavily set forth with a dull countenance  in our numerous conversations although he has always heard me with deference i have been conscious throughout of a sort of ponderous finessing hard to tolerate  he produces none of the effect of a gentleman devoid not merely of pleasantry but of all attention or communicative warmth of bearing  no gentleman besides would so parade his amours with the princess still less repay the prince for his longsuffering with a studied insolence of demeanour and the fabrication of insulting nicknames such as prince featherhead which run from ear to ear and create a laugh throughout the country  gondremark has thus some of the clumsier characters of the selfmade man combined with an inordinate almost a besotted pride of intellect and birth  heavy bilious selfish inornate he sits upon this court and country like an incubus  but it is probable that he preserves softer gifts for necessary purposes indeed it is certain although he vouchsafed none of it to me that this cold and stolid politician possesses to a great degree the art of ingratiation and can be all things to all men  hence there has probably sprung up the idle legend that in private life he is a gross romping voluptuary  nothing at least can well be more surprising than the terms of his connection with the princess  older than her husband certainly uglier and according to the feeble ideas common among women in every particular less pleasing he has not only seized the complete command of all her thought and action but has imposed on her in public a humiliating part  i do not here refer to the complete sacrifice of every rag of her reputation for to many women these extremities are in themselves attractive  but there is about the court a certain lady of a dishevelled reputation a countess von rosen wife or widow of a cloudy count no longer in her second youth and already bereft of some of her attractions who unequivocally occupies the station of the baron’s mistress  i had thought at first that she was but a hired accomplice a mere blind or buffer for the more important sinner  a few hours’ acquaintance with madame von rosen for ever dispelled the illusion  she is one rather to make than to prevent a scandal and she values none of those bribes—money honours or employment—with which the situation might be gilded  indeed as a person frankly bad she pleased me in the court of grünewald like a piece of nature  the power of this man over the princess is therefore without bounds she has sacrificed to the adoration with which he has inspired her not only her marriage vow and every shred of public decency but that vice of jealousy which is so much dearer to the female sex than either intrinsic honour or outward consideration  nay more a young although not a very attractive woman and a princess both by birth and fact she submits to the triumphant rivalry of one who might be her mother as to years and who is so manifestly her inferior in station  this is one of the mysteries of the human heart  but the rage of illicit love when it is once indulged appears to grow by feeding and to a person of the character and temperament of this unfortunate young lady almost any depth of degradation is within the reach of possibility    chapter iii—the prince and the english traveller   so far otto read with waxing indignation and here his fury overflowed he tossed the roll upon the table and stood up  ‘this man’ he said ‘is a devil  a filthy imagination an ear greedy of evil a ponderous malignity of thought and language i grow like him by the reading chancellor where is this fellow lodged’  ‘he was committed to the flag tower’ replied greisengesang ‘in the gamiani apartment’  ‘lead me to him’ said the prince and then a thought striking him ‘was it for that’ he asked ‘that i found so many sentries in the garden’  ‘your highness i am unaware’ answered greisengesang true to his policy  ‘the disposition of the guards is a matter distinct from my functions’  otto turned upon the old man fiercely but ere he had time to speak gotthold touched him on the arm  he swallowed his wrath with a great effort  ‘it is well’ he said taking the roll  ‘follow me to the flag tower’  the chancellor gathered himself together and the two set forward  it was a long and complicated voyage for the library was in the wing of the new buildings and the tower which carried the flag was in the old schloss upon the garden  by a great variety of stairs and corridors they came out at last upon a patch of gravelled court the garden peeped through a high grating with a flash of green tall old gabled buildings mounted on every side the flag tower climbed stage after stage into the blue and high over all among the building daws the yellow flag wavered in the wind  a sentinel at the foot of the tower stairs presented arms another paced the first landing and a third was stationed before the door of the extemporised prison  ‘we guard this mudbag like a jewel’ otto sneered  the gamiani apartment was so called from an italian doctor who had imposed on the credulity of a former prince  the rooms were large airy pleasant and looked upon the garden but the walls were of great thickness for the tower was old and the windows were heavily barred the prince followed by the chancellor still trotting to keep up with him brushed swiftly through the little library and the long saloon and burst like a thunderbolt into the bedroom at the farther end  sir john was finishing his toilet a man of fifty hard uncompromising able with the eye and teeth of physical courage  he was unmoved by the irruption and bowed with a sort of sneering ease  ‘to what am i to attribute the honour of this visit’ he asked  ‘you have eaten my bread’ replied otto ‘you have taken my hand you have been received under my roof  when did i fail you in courtesy  what have you asked that was not granted as to an honoured guest  and here sir’ tapping fiercely on the manuscript ‘here is your return’  ‘your highness has read my papers’ said the baronet  ‘i am honoured indeed  but the sketch is most imperfect  i shall now have much to add i can say that the prince whom i had accused of idleness is zealous in the department of police taking upon himself those duties that are most distasteful  i shall be able to relate the burlesque incident of my arrest and the singular interview with which you honour me at present for the rest i have already communicated with my ambassador at vienna and unless you propose to murder me i shall be at liberty whether you please or not within the week  for i hardly fancy the future empire of grünewald is yet ripe to go to war with england  i conceive i am a little more than quits  i owe you no explanation yours has been the wrong  you if you have studied my writing with intelligence owe me a large debt of gratitude  and to conclude as i have not yet finished my toilet i imagine the courtesy of a turnkey to a prisoner would induce you to withdraw’  there was some paper on the table and otto sitting down wrote a passport in the name of sir john crabtree  ‘affix the seal herr cancellarius’ he said in his most princely manner as he rose  greisengesang produced a red portfolio and affixed the seal in the unpoetic guise of an adhesive stamp nor did his perturbed and clumsy movements at all lessen the comedy of the performance  sir john looked on with a malign enjoyment and otto chafed regretting when too late the unnecessary royalty of his command and gesture  but at length the chancellor had finished his piece of prestidigitation and without waiting for an order had countersigned the passport  thus regularised he returned it to otto with a bow  ‘you will now’ said the prince ‘order one of my own carriages to be prepared see it with your own eyes charged with sir john’s effects and have it waiting within the hour behind the pheasant house  sir john departs this morning for vienna’  the chancellor took his elaborate departure  ‘here sir is your passport’ said otto turning to the baronet  ‘i regret it from my heart that you have met inhospitable usage’  ‘well there will be no english war’ returned sir john  ‘nay sir’ said otto ‘you surely owe me your civility  matters are now changed and we stand again upon the footing of two gentlemen  it was not i who ordered your arrest i returned late last night from hunting and as you cannot blame me for your imprisonment you may even thank me for your freedom’  ‘and yet you read my papers’ said the traveller shrewdly  ‘there sir i was wrong’ returned otto ‘and for that i ask your pardon  you can scarce refuse it for your own dignity to one who is a plexus of weaknesses  nor was the fault entirely mine  had the papers been innocent it would have been at most an indiscretion  your own guilt is the sting of my offence’  sir john regarded otto with an approving twinkle then he bowed but still in silence  ‘well sir as you are now at your entire disposal i have a favour to beg of your indulgence’ continued the prince  ‘i have to request that you will walk with me alone into the garden so soon as your convenience permits’  ‘from the moment that i am a free man’ sir john replied this time with perfect courtesy ‘i am wholly at your highness’s command and if you will excuse a rather summary toilet i will even follow you as i am’  ‘i thank you sir’ said otto  so without more delay the prince leading the pair proceeded down through the echoing stairway of the tower and out through the grating into the ample air and sunshine of the morning and among the terraces and flowerbeds of the garden  they crossed the fishpond where the carp were leaping as thick as bees they mounted one after another the various flights of stairs snowed upon as they went with april blossoms and marching in time to the great orchestra of birds  nor did otto pause till they had reached the highest terrace of the garden  here was a gate into the park and hard by under a tuft of laurel a marble garden seat  hence they looked down on the green tops of many elmtrees where the rooks were busy and beyond that upon the palace roof and the yellow banner flying in the blue  i pray you to be seated sir’ said otto  sir john complied without a word and for some seconds otto walked to and fro before him plunged in angry thought  the birds were all singing for a wager  ‘sir’ said the prince at length turning towards the englishman ‘you are to me except by the conventions of society a perfect stranger  of your character and wishes i am ignorant  i have never wittingly disobliged you  there is a difference in station which i desire to waive  i would if you still think me entitled to so much consideration—i would be regarded simply as a gentleman  now sir i did wrong to glance at these papers which i here return to you but if curiosity be undignified as i am free to own falsehood is both cowardly and cruel  i opened your roll and what did i find—what did i find about my wife lies’ he broke out  ‘they are lies  there are not so help me god four words of truth in your intolerable libel  you are a man you are old and might be the girl’s father you are a gentleman you are a scholar and have learned refinement and you rake together all this vulgar scandal and propose to print it in a public book  such is your chivalry  but thank god sir she has still a husband  you say sir in that paper in your hand that i am a bad fencer i have to request from you a lesson in the art  the park is close behind yonder is the pheasant house where you will find your carriage should i fall you know sir—you have written it in your paper—how little my movements are regarded i am in the custom of disappearing it will be one more disappearance and long before it has awakened a remark you may be safe across the border’  ‘you will observe’ said sir john ‘that what you ask is impossible’  ‘and if i struck you’ cried the prince with a sudden menacing flash  ‘it would be a cowardly blow’ returned the baronet unmoved ‘for it would make no change  i cannot draw upon a reigning sovereign’  ‘and it is this man to whom you dare not offer satisfaction that you choose to insult’ cried otto  ‘pardon me’ said the traveller ‘you are unjust  it is because you are a reigning sovereign that i cannot fight with you and it is for the same reason that i have a right to criticise your action and your wife  you are in everything a public creature you belong to the public body and bone  you have with you the law the muskets of the army and the eyes of spies  we on our side have but one weapon—truth’  ‘truth’ echoed the prince with a gesture  there was another silence  ‘your highness’ said sir john at last ‘you must not expect grapes from a thistle  i am old and a cynic  nobody cares a rush for me and on the whole after the present interview i scarce know anybody that i like better than yourself  you see i have changed my mind and have the uncommon virtue to avow the change  i tear up this stuff before you here in your own garden i ask your pardon i ask the pardon of the princess and i give you my word of honour as a gentleman and an old man that when my book of travels shall appear it shall not contain so much as the name of grünewald  and yet it was a racy chapter  but had your highness only read about the other courts  i am a carrion crow but it is not my fault after all that the world is such a nauseous kennel’  ‘sir’ said otto ‘is the eye not jaundiced’  ‘nay’ cried the traveller ‘very likely  i am one who goes sniffing i am no poet  i believe in a better future for the world or at all accounts i do most potently disbelieve in the present  rotten eggs is the burthen of my song  but indeed your highness when i meet with any merit i do not think that i am slow to recognise it  this is a day that i shall still recall with gratitude for i have found a sovereign with some manly virtues and for once—old courtier and old radical as i am—it is from the heart and quite sincerely that i can request the honour of kissing your highness’s hand’  ‘nay sir’ said otto ‘to my heart’  and the englishman taken at unawares was clasped for a moment in the prince’s arms  ‘and now sir’ added otto ‘there is the pheasant house close behind it you will find my carriage which i pray you to accept  god speed you to vienna’  ‘in the impetuosity of youth’ replied sir john ‘your highness has overlooked one circumstance  i am still fasting’  ‘well sir’ said otto smiling ‘you are your own master you may go or stay  but i warn you your friend may prove less powerful than your enemies  the prince indeed is thoroughly on your side he has all the will to help but to whom do i speak—you know better than i do he is not alone in grünewald’  ‘there is a deal in position’ returned the traveller gravely nodding ‘gondremark loves to temporise his policy is below ground and he fears all open courses and now that i have seen you act with so much spirit i will cheerfully risk myself on your protection  who knows  you may be yet the better man’  ‘do you indeed believe so’ cried the prince  ‘you put life into my heart’  ‘i will give up sketching portraits’ said the baronet  ‘i am a blind owl i had misread you strangely  and yet remember this a sprint is one thing and to run all day another  for i still mistrust your constitution the short nose the hair and eyes of several complexions no they are diagnostic and i must end i see as i began’  ‘i am still a singing chambermaid’ said otto  ‘nay your highness i pray you to forget what i had written’ said sir john ‘i am not like pilate and the chapter is no more  bury it if you love me’    chapter iv—while the prince is in the anteroom      greatly comforted by the exploits of the morning the prince turned towards the princess’s anteroom bent on a more difficult enterprise the curtains rose before him the usher called his name and he entered the room with an exaggeration of his usual mincing and airy dignity there were about a score of persons waiting principally ladies it was one of the few societies in grünewald where otto knew himself to be popular and while a maid of honour made her exit by a side door to announce his arrival to the princess he moved round the apartment collecting homage and bestowing compliments with friendly grace  had this been the sum of his duties he had been an admirable monarch  lady after lady was impartially honoured by his attention  ‘madam’ he said to one ‘how does this happen  i find you daily more adorable’  ‘and your highness daily browner’ replied the lady  ‘we began equal o there i will be bold we have both beautiful complexions  but while i study mine your highness tans himself’  ‘a perfect negro madam and what so fitly—being beauty’s slave’ said otto—‘madame grafinski when is our next play  i have just heard that i am a bad actor’  ‘o ciel’ cried madame grafinski  ‘who could venture  what a bear’  ‘an excellent man i can assure you’ returned otto  ‘o never  o is it possible’ fluted the lady  ‘your highness plays like an angel’  ‘you must be right madam who could speak falsely and yet look so charming’ said the prince  ‘but this gentleman it seems would have preferred me playing like an actor’  a sort of hum a falsetto feminine cooing greeted the tiny sally and otto expanded like a peacock  this warm atmosphere of women and flattery and idle chatter pleased him to the marrow  ‘madame von eisenthal your coiffure is delicious’ he remarked  ‘every one was saying so’ said one  ‘if i have pleased prince charming’  and madame von eisenthal swept him a deep curtsy with a killing glance of adoration  ‘it is new’ he asked  ‘vienna fashion’  ‘mint new’ replied the lady ‘for your highness’s return  i felt young this morning it was a premonition  but why prince do you ever leave us’  ‘for the pleasure of the return’ said otto  ‘i am like a dog i must bury my bone and then come back to great upon it’  ‘o a bone  fie what a comparison  you have brought back the manners of the wood’ returned the lady  ‘madam it is what the dog has dearest’ said the prince  ‘but i observe madame von rosen’  and otto leaving the group to which he had been piping stepped towards the embrasure of a window where a lady stood  the countess von rosen had hitherto been silent and a thought depressed but on the approach of otto she began to brighten  she was tall slim as a nymph and of a very airy carriage and her face which was already beautiful in repose lightened and changed flashed into smiles and glowed with lovely colour at the touch of animation  she was a good vocalist and even in speech her voice commanded a great range of changes the low notes rich with tenor quality the upper ringing on the brink of laughter into music  a gem of many facets and variable hues of fire a woman who withheld the better portion of her beauty and then in a caressing second flashed it like a weapon full on the beholder now merely a tall figure and a sallow handsome face with the evidences of a reckless temper anon opening like a flower to life and colour mirth and tenderness—madame von rosen had always a dagger in reserve for the despatch of illassured admirers  she met otto with the dart of tender gaiety  ‘you have come to me at last prince cruel’ she said  ‘butterfly well and am i not to kiss your hand’ she added  ‘madam it is i who must kiss yours’  and otto bowed and kissed it  ‘you deny me every indulgence’ she said smiling  ‘and now what news in court’ inquired the prince  ‘i come to you for my gazette’  ‘ditchwater’ she replied  ‘the world is all asleep grown grey in slumber i do not remember any waking movement since quite an eternity and the last thing in the nature of a sensation was the last time my governess was allowed to box my ears  but yet i do myself and your unfortunate enchanted palace some injustice  here is the last—o positively’  and she told him the story from behind her fan with many glances many cunning strokes of the narrator’s art  the others had drawn away for it was understood that madame von rosen was in favour with the prince  none the less however did the countess lower her voice at times to within a semitone of whispering and the pair leaned together over the narrative  ‘do you know’ said otto laughing ‘you are the only entertaining woman on this earth’  ‘o you have found out so much’ she cried  ‘yes madam i grow wiser with advancing years’ he returned  ‘years’ she repeated  ‘do you name the traitors  i do not believe in years the calendar is a delusion’  ‘you must be right madam’ replied the prince  ‘for six years that we have been good friends i have observed you to grow younger’  ‘flatterer’ cried she and then with a change ‘but why should i say so’ she added ‘when i protest i think the same  a week ago i had a council with my father director the glass and the glass replied “not yet”  i confess my face in this way once a month  o a very solemn moment  do you know what i shall do when the mirror answers “now”’  ‘i cannot guess’ said he  ‘no more can i’ returned the countess  ‘there is such a choice suicide gambling a nunnery a volume of memoirs or politics—the last i am afraid’  ‘it is a dull trade’ said otto  ‘nay’ she replied ‘it is a trade i rather like  it is after all first cousin to gossip which no one can deny to be amusing  for instance if i were to tell you that the princess and the baron rode out together daily to inspect the cannon it is either a piece of politics or scandal as i turn my phrase  i am the alchemist that makes the transmutation  they have been everywhere together since you left’ she continued brightening as she saw otto darken ‘that is a poor snippet of malicious gossip—and they were everywhere cheered—and with that addition all becomes political intelligence’  ‘let us change the subject’ said otto  ‘i was about to propose it’ she replied ‘or rather to pursue the politics  do you know this war is popular—popular to the length of cheering princess seraphina’  ‘all things madam are possible’ said the prince and this among others that we may be going into war but i give you my word of honour i do not know with whom’  ‘and you put up with it’ she cried  ‘i have no pretensions to morality and i confess i have always abominated the lamb and nourished a romantic feeling for the wolf  o be done with lambiness  let us see there is a prince for i am weary of the distaff’  ‘madam’ said otto ‘i thought you were of that faction’  ‘i should be of yours mon prince if you had one’ she retorted  ‘is it true that you have no ambition  there was a man once in england whom they call the kingmaker  do you know’ she added ‘i fancy i could make a prince’  ‘some day madam’ said otto ‘i may ask you to help make a farmer’  ‘is that a riddle’ asked the countess  ‘it is’ replied the prince ‘and a very good one too’  ‘tit for tat  i will ask you another’ she returned  ‘where is gondremark’  ‘the prime minister  in the primeministry no doubt’ said otto  ‘precisely’ said the countess and she pointed with her fan to the door of the princess’s apartments  ‘you and i mon prince are in the anteroom  you think me unkind’ she added  ‘try me and you will see set me a task put me a question there is no enormity i am not capable of doing to oblige you and no secret that i am not ready to betray’  ‘nay madam but i respect my friend too much’ he answered kissing her hand  ‘i would rather remain ignorant of all  we fraternise like foemen soldiers at the outposts but let each be true to his own army’  ‘ah’ she cried ‘if all men were generous like you it would be worth while to be a woman’  yet judging by her looks his generosity if anything had disappointed her she seemed to seek a remedy and having found it brightened once more  ‘and now’ she said ‘may i dismiss my sovereign  this is rebellion and a cas pendable but what am i to do my bear is jealous’  ‘madam enough’ cried otto  ‘ahasuerus reaches you the sceptre more he will obey you in all points  i should have been a dog to come to whistling’  and so the prince departed and fluttered round grafinski and von eisenthal  but the countess knew the use of her offensive weapons and had left a pleasant arrow in the prince’s heart  that gondremark was jealous—here was an agreeable revenge  and madame von rosen as the occasion of the jealousy appeared to him in a new light    chapter v—   gondremark is in my lady’s chamber   the countess von rosen spoke the truth  the great prime minister of grünewald was already closeted with seraphina  the toilet was over and the princess tastefully arrayed sat face to face with a tall mirror sir john’s description was unkindly true true in terms and yet a libel a misogynistic masterpiece  her forehead was perhaps too high but it became her her figure somewhat stooped but every detail was formed and finished like a gem her hand her foot her ear the set of her comely head were all dainty and accordant if she was not beautiful she was vivid changeful coloured and pretty with a thousand various prettinesses and her eyes if they indeed rolled too consciously yet rolled to purpose  they were her most attractive feature yet they continually bore eloquent false witness to her thoughts for while she herself in the depths of her immature unsoftened heart was given altogether to manlike ambition and the desire of power the eyes were by turns bold inviting fiery melting and artful like the eyes of a rapacious siren  and artful in a sense she was  chafing that she was not a man and could not shine by action she had conceived a woman’s part of answerable domination she sought to subjugate for byends to rain influence and be fancy free and while she loved not man loved to see man obey her  it is a common girl’s ambition  such was perhaps that lady of the glove who sent her lover to the lions  but the snare is laid alike for male and female and the world most artfully contrived  near her in a low chair gondremark had arranged his limbs into a catlike attitude highshouldered stooping and submiss  the formidable blue jowl of the man and the dull bilious eye set perhaps a higher value on his evident desire to please  his face was marked by capacity temper and a kind of bold piratical dishonesty which it would be calumnious to call deceit  his manners as he smiled upon the princess were overfine yet hardly elegant  ‘possibly’ said the baron ‘i should now proceed to take my leave  i must not keep my sovereign in the anteroom  let us come at once to a decision’  ‘it cannot cannot be put off’ she asked  ‘it is impossible’ answered gondremark  ‘your highness sees it for herself  in the earlier stages we might imitate the serpent but for the ultimatum there is no choice but to be bold like lions  had the prince chosen to remain away it had been better but we have gone too far forward to delay’  ‘what can have brought him’ she cried  ‘today of all days’  ‘the marplot madam has the instinct of his nature’ returned gondremark  ‘but you exaggerate the peril  think madam how far we have prospered and against what odds  shall a featherhead—but no’ and he blew upon his fingers lightly with a laugh  ‘featherhead’ she replied ‘is still the prince of grünewald’  ‘on your sufferance only and so long as you shall please to be indulgent’ said the baron  ‘there are rights of nature power to the powerful is the law  if he shall think to cross your destiny—well you have heard of the brazen and the earthen pot’  ‘do you call me pot  you are ungallant baron’ laughed the princess  ‘before we are done with your glory i shall have called you by many different titles’ he replied  the girl flushed with pleasure  ‘but frédéric is still the prince monsieur le flatteur’ she said  ‘you do not propose a revolution—you of all men’  ‘dear madam when it is already made’ he cried  ‘the prince reigns indeed in the almanac but my princess reigns and rules’  and he looked at her with a fond admiration that made the heart of seraphina swell looking on her huge slave she drank the intoxicating joys of power meanwhile he continued with that sort of massive archness that so ill became him ‘she has but one fault there is but one danger in the great career that i foresee for her  may i name it may i be so irreverent it is in herself—her heart is soft’  ‘her courage is faint baron’ said the princess  ‘suppose we have judged ill suppose we were defeated’  ‘defeated madam’ returned the baron with a touch of illhumour  ‘is the dog defeated by the hare  our troops are all cantoned along the frontier in five hours the vanguard of five thousand bayonets shall be hammering on the gates of brandenau and in all gerolstein there are not fifteen hundred men who can manœuvre  it is as simple as a sum  there can be no resistance’  ‘it is no great exploit’ she said  ‘is that what you call glory  it is like beating a child’  ‘the courage madam is diplomatic’ he replied  ‘we take a grave step we fix the eyes of europe for the first time on grünewald and in the negotiations of the next three months mark me we stand or fall  it is there madam that i shall have to depend upon your counsels’ he added almost gloomily  ‘if i had not seen you at work if i did not know the fertility of your mind i own i should tremble for the consequence  but it is in this field that men must recognise their inability  all the great negotiators when they have not been women have had women at their elbows  madame de pompadour was ill served she had not found her gondremark but what a mighty politician  catherine de’ medici too what justice of sight what readiness of means what elasticity against defeat  but alas madam her featherheads were her own children and she had that one touch of vulgarity that one trait of the goodwife that she suffered family ties and affections to confine her liberty’  these singular views of history strictly ad usum seraphinæ did not weave their usual soothing spell over the princess  it was plain that she had taken a momentary distaste to her own resolutions for she continued to oppose her counsellor looking upon him out of halfclosed eyes and with the shadow of a sneer upon her lips  ‘what boys men are’ she said ‘what lovers of big words  courage indeed  if you had to scour pans herr von gondremark you would call it i suppose domestic courage’  ‘i would madam’ said the baron stoutly ‘if i scoured them well  i would put a good name upon a virtue you will not overdo it they are not so enchanting in themselves’  ‘well but let me see’ she said  ‘i wish to understand your courage why we asked leave like children  our grannie in berlin our uncle in vienna the whole family have patted us on the head and sent us forward courage  i wonder when i hear you’  ‘my princess is unlike herself’ returned the baron  ‘she has forgotten where the peril lies  true we have received encouragement on every hand but my princess knows too well on what untenable conditions and she knows besides how in the publicity of the diet these whispered conferences are forgotten and disowned  the danger is very real’—he raged inwardly at having to blow the very coal he had been quenching—‘none the less real in that it is not precisely military but for that reason the easier to be faced  had we to count upon your troops although i share your highness’s expectations of the conduct of alvenau we cannot forget that he has not been proved in chief command but where negotiation is concerned the conduct lies with us and with your help i laugh at danger’  ‘it may be so’ said seraphina sighing  ‘it is elsewhere that i see danger  the people these abominable people—suppose they should instantly rebel  what a figure we should make in the eyes of europe to have undertaken an invasion while my own throne was tottering to its fall’  ‘nay madam’ said gondremark smiling ‘here you are beneath yourself what is it that feeds their discontent  what but the taxes  once we have seized gerolstein the taxes are remitted the sons return covered with renown the houses are adorned with pillage each tastes his little share of military glory and behold us once again a happy family  “ay” they will say in each other’s long ears “the princess knew what she was about she was in the right of it she has a head upon her shoulders and here we are you see better off than before”  but why should i say all this  it is what my princess pointed out to me herself it was by these reasons that she converted me to this adventure’  ‘i think herr von gondremark’ said seraphina somewhat tartly ‘you often attribute your own sagacity to your princess’  for a second gondremark staggered under the shrewdness of the attack the next he had perfectly recovered  ‘do i’ he said  ‘it is very possible  i have observed a similar tendency in your highness’  it was so openly spoken and appeared so just that seraphina breathed again  her vanity had been alarmed and the greatness of the relief improved her spirits  ‘well’ she said ‘all this is little to the purpose  we are keeping frédéric without and i am still ignorant of our line of battle  come coadmiral let us consult    how am i to receive him now  and what are we to do if he should appear at the council’  ‘now’ he answered  ‘i shall leave him to my princess for just now  i have seen her at work  send him off to his theatricals  but in all gentleness’ he added  ‘would it for instance would it displease my sovereign to affect a headache’  ‘never’ said she  ‘the woman who can manage like the man who can fight must never shrink from an encounter  the knight must not disgrace his weapons’  ‘then let me pray my belle dame sans merci’ he returned ‘to affect the only virtue that she lacks  be pitiful to the poor young man affect an interest in his hunting be weary of politics find in his society as it were a grateful repose from dry considerations  does my princess authorise the line of battle’  ‘well that is a trifle’ answered seraphina  ‘the council—there is the point’  ‘the council’ cried gondremark  ‘permit me madam’  and he rose and proceeded to flutter about the room counterfeiting otto both in voice and gesture not unhappily  ‘what is there today herr von gondremark ah herr cancellarius a new wig  you cannot deceive me i know every wig in grünewald i have the sovereign’s eye  what are these papers about  o i see  o certainly  surely surely  i wager none of you remarked that wig  by all means  i know nothing about that  dear me are there as many as all that  well you can sign them you have the procuration  you see herr cancellarius i knew your wig  and so’ concluded gondremark resuming his own voice ‘our sovereign by the particular grace of god enlightens and supports his privy councillors’  but when the baron turned to seraphina for approval he found her frozen ‘you are pleased to be witty herr von gondremark’ she said ‘and have perhaps forgotten where you are  but these rehearsals are apt to be misleading  your master the prince of grünewald is sometimes more exacting’  gondremark cursed her in his soul  of all injured vanities that of the reproved buffoon is the most savage and when grave issues are involved these petty stabs become unbearable  but gondremark was a man of iron he showed nothing he did not even like the common trickster retreat because he had presumed but held to his point bravely  ‘madam’ he said ‘if as you say he prove exacting we must take the bull by the horns’  ‘we shall see’ she said and she arranged her skirt like one about to rise  temper scorn disgust all the more acrid feelings became her like jewels and she now looked her best  ‘pray god they quarrel’ thought gondremark  ‘the damned minx may fail me yet unless they quarrel  it is time to let him in  zz—fight dogs’ consequent on these reflections he bent a stiff knee and chivalrously kissed the princess’s hand  ‘my princess’ he said ‘must now dismiss her servant  i have much to arrange against the hour of council’  ‘go’ she said and rose  and as gondremark tripped out of a private door she touched a bell and gave the order to admit the prince    chapter vi—the prince delivers a lecture on marriage with practical illustrations of divorce   with what a world of excellent intentions otto entered his wife’s cabinet how fatherly how tender how morally affecting were the words he had prepared  nor was seraphina unamiably inclined  her usual fear of otto as a marplot in her great designs was now swallowed up in a passing distrust of the designs themselves  for gondremark besides she had conceived an angry horror  in her heart she did not like the baron behind his impudent servility behind the devotion which with indelicate delicacy he still forced on her attention she divined the grossness of his nature  so a man may be proud of having tamed a bear and yet sicken at his captive’s odour  and above all she had certain jealous intimations that the man was false and the deception double  true she falsely trifled with his love but he perhaps was only trifling with her vanity  the insolence of his late mimicry and the odium of her own position as she sat and watched it lay besides like a load upon her conscience  she met otto almost with a sense of guilt and yet she welcomed him as a deliverer from ugly things  but the wheels of an interview are at the mercy of a thousand ruts and even at otto’s entrance the first jolt occurred  gondremark he saw was gone but there was the chair drawn close for consultation and it pained him not only that this man had been received but that he should depart with such an air of secrecy  struggling with this twinge it was somewhat sharply that he dismissed the attendant who had brought him in  ‘you make yourself at home chez moi’ she said a little ruffled both by his tone of command and by the glance he had thrown upon the chair  ‘madam’ replied otto ‘i am here so seldom that i have almost the rights of a stranger’  ‘you choose your own associates frédéric’ she said  ‘i am here to speak of it’ he returned  ‘it is now four years since we were married and these four years seraphina have not perhaps been happy either for you or for me  i am well aware i was unsuitable to be your husband  i was not young i had no ambition i was a trifler and you despised me i dare not say unjustly  but to do justice on both sides you must bear in mind how i have acted  when i found it amused you to play the part of princess on this little stage did i not immediately resign to you my box of toys this grünewald  and when i found i was distasteful as a husband could any husband have been less intrusive  you will tell me that i have no feelings no preference and thus no credit that i go before the wind that all this was in my character  and indeed one thing is true that it is easy too easy to leave things undone  but seraphina i begin to learn it is not always wise  if i were too old and too uncongenial for your husband i should still have remembered that i was the prince of that country to which you came a visitor and a child  in that relation also there were duties and these duties i have not performed’  to claim the advantage of superior age is to give sure offence  ‘duty’ laughed seraphina ‘and on your lips frédéric  you make me laugh  what fancy is this  go flirt with the maids and be a prince in dresden china as you look  enjoy yourself mon enfant and leave duty and the state to us’  the plural grated on the prince  ‘i have enjoyed myself too much’ he said ‘since enjoyment is the word  and yet there were much to say upon the other side  you must suppose me desperately fond of hunting  but indeed there were days when i found a great deal of interest in what it was courtesy to call my government  and i have always had some claim to taste i could tell live happiness from dull routine and between hunting and the throne of austria and your society my choice had never wavered had the choice been mine  you were a girl a bud when you were given me—’  ‘heavens’ she cried ‘is this to be a lovescene’  ‘i am never ridiculous’ he said ‘it is my only merit and you may be certain this shall be a scene of marriage à la mode  but when i remember the beginning it is bare courtesy to speak in sorrow  be just madam you would think me strangely uncivil to recall these days without the decency of a regret  be yet a little juster and own if only in complaisance that you yourself regret that past’  ‘i have nothing to regret’ said the princess  ‘you surprise me  i thought you were so happy’  ‘happy and happy there are so many hundred ways’ said otto  ‘a man may be happy in revolt he may be happy in sleep wine change and travel make him happy virtue they say will do the like—i have not tried and they say also that in old quiet and habitual marriages there is yet another happiness  happy yes i am happy if you like but i will tell you frankly i was happier when i brought you home’  ‘well’ said the princess not without constraint ‘it seems you changed your mind’  ‘not i’ returned otto ‘i never changed  do you remember seraphina on our way home when you saw the roses in the lane and i got out and plucked them  it was a narrow lane between great trees the sunset at the end was all gold and the rooks were flying overhead  there were nine nine red roses you gave me a kiss for each and i told myself that every rose and every kiss should stand for a year of love  well in eighteen months there was an end  but do you fancy seraphina that my heart has altered’  ‘i am sure i cannot tell’ she said like an automaton  ‘it has not’ the prince continued  ‘there is nothing ridiculous even from a husband in a love that owns itself unhappy and that asks no more i built on sand pardon me i do not breathe a reproach—i built i suppose upon my own infirmities but i put my heart in the building and it still lies among the ruins’  ‘how very poetical’ she said with a little choking laugh unknown relentings unfamiliar softnesses moving within her  ‘what would you be at’ she added hardening her voice  ‘i would be at this’ he answered ‘and hard it is to say  i would be at this—seraphina i am your husband after all and a poor fool that loves you  understand’ he cried almost fiercely ‘i am no suppliant husband what your love refuses i would scorn to receive from your pity  i do not ask i would not take it  and for jealousy what ground have i  a doginthemanger jealousy is a thing the dogs may laugh at  but at least in the world’s eye i am still your husband and i ask you if you treat me fairly  i keep to myself i leave you free i have given you in everything your will  what do you in return  i find seraphina that you have been too thoughtless  but between persons such as we are in our conspicuous station particular care and a particular courtesy are owing  scandal is perhaps not easy to avoid but it is hard to bear’  ‘scandal’ she cried with a deep breath  ‘scandal  it is for this you have been driving’  ‘i have tried to tell you how i feel’ he replied  ‘i have told you that i love you—love you in vain—a bitter thing for a husband i have laid myself open that i might speak without offence  and now that i have begun i will go on and finish’  ‘i demand it’ she said  ‘what is this about’  otto flushed crimson  ‘i have to say what i would fain not’ he answered  ‘i counsel you to see less of gondremark’  ‘of gondremark  and why’ she asked  ‘your intimacy is the ground of scandal madam’ said otto firmly enough—‘of a scandal that is agony to me and would be crushing to your parents if they knew it’  ‘you are the first to bring me word of it’ said she  ‘i thank you’  ‘you have perhaps cause’ he replied  ‘perhaps i am the only one among your friends—’  ‘o leave my friends alone’ she interrupted  ‘my friends are of a different stamp  you have come to me here and made a parade of sentiment  when have i last seen you  i have governed your kingdom for you in the meanwhile and there i got no help  at last when i am weary with a man’s work and you are weary of your playthings you return to make me a scene of conjugal reproaches—the grocer and his wife  the positions are too much reversed and you should understand at least that i cannot at the same time do your work of government and behave myself like a little girl  scandal is the atmosphere in which we live we princes it is what a prince should know  you play an odious part do you believe this rumour’  ‘madam should i be here’ said otto  ‘it is what i want to know’ she cried the tempest of her scorn increasing  ‘suppose you did—i say suppose you did believe it’  ‘i should make it my business to suppose the contrary’ he answered  ‘i thought so  o you are made of baseness’ said she  ‘madam’ he cried roused at last ‘enough of this  you wilfully misunderstand my attitude you outwear my patience  in the name of your parents in my own name i summon you to be more circumspect’  ‘is this a request monsieur mon mari’ she demanded  ‘madam if i chose i might command’ said otto  ‘you might sir as the law stands make me prisoner’ returned seraphina  ‘short of that you will gain nothing’  ‘you will continue as before’ he asked  ‘precisely as before’ said she  ‘as soon as this comedy is over i shall request the freiherr von gondremark to visit me  do you understand’ she added rising  ‘for my part i have done’  ‘i will then ask the favour of your hand madam’ said otto palpitating in every pulse with anger  ‘i have to request that you will visit in my society another part of my poor house  and reassure yourself—it will not take long—and it is the last obligation that you shall have the chance to lay me under’  ‘the last’ she cried  ‘most joyfully’  she offered her hand and he took it on each side with an elaborate affectation each inwardly incandescent  he led her out by the private door following where gondremark had passed they threaded a corridor or two little frequented looking on a court until they came at last into the prince’s suite  the first room was an armoury hung all about with the weapons of various countries and looking forth on the front terrace  ‘have you brought me here to slay me’ she inquired  ‘i have brought you madam only to pass on’ replied otto  next they came to a library where an old chamberlain sat half asleep he rose and bowed before the princely couple asking for orders  ‘you will attend us here’ said otto  the next stage was a gallery of pictures where seraphina’s portrait hung conspicuous dressed for the chase red roses in her hair as otto in the first months of marriage had directed  he pointed to it without a word she raised her eyebrows in silence and they passed still forward into a matted corridor where four doors opened  one led to otto’s bedroom one was the private door to seraphina’s  and here for the first time otto left her hand and stepping forward shot the bolt  ‘it is long madam’ said he ‘since it was bolted on the other side’  ‘one was effectual’ returned the princess  ‘is this all’  ‘shall i reconduct you’ he asking bowing  ‘i should prefer’ she asked in ringing tones ‘the conduct of the freiherr von gondremark’  otto summoned the chamberlain  ‘if the freiherr von gondremark is in the palace’ he said ‘bid him attend the princess here’  and when the official had departed ‘can i do more to serve you madam’ the prince asked  ‘thank you no  i have been much amused’ she answered  ‘i have now’ continued otto ‘given you your liberty complete  this has been for you a miserable marriage’  ‘miserable’ said she  ‘it has been made light to you it shall be lighter still’ continued the prince  ‘but one thing madam you must still continue to bear—my father’s name which is now yours  i leave it in your hands  let me see you since you will have no advice of mine apply the more attention of your own to bear it worthily’  ‘herr von gondremark is long in coming’ she remarked  ‘o seraphina seraphina’ he cried  and that was the end of their interview  she tripped to a window and looked out and a little after the chamberlain announced the freiherr von gondremark who entered with something of a wild eye and changed complexion confounded as he was at this unusual summons  the princess faced round from the window with a pearly smile nothing but her heightened colour spoke of discomposure  otto was pale but he was otherwise master of himself  ‘herr von gondremark’ said he ‘oblige me so far reconduct the princess to her own apartment’  the baron still all at sea offered his hand which was smilingly accepted and the pair sailed forth through the picturegallery  as soon as they were gone and otto knew the length and breadth of his miscarriage and how he had done the contrary of all that he intended he stood stupefied  a fiasco so complete and sweeping was laughable even to himself and he laughed aloud in his wrath  upon this mood there followed the sharpest violence of remorse and to that again as he recalled his provocation anger succeeded afresh  so he was tossed in spirit now bewailing his inconsequence and lack of temper now flaming up in whitehot indignation and a noble pity for himself  he paced his apartment like a leopard  there was danger in otto for a flash  like a pistol he could kill at one moment and the next he might he kicked aside  but just then as he walked the long floors in his alternate humours tearing his handkerchief between his hands he was strung to his top note every nerve attent  the pistol you might say was charged  and when jealousy from time to time fetched him a lash across the tenderest of his feeling and sent a string of her firepictures glancing before his mind’s eye the contraction of his face was even dangerous  he disregarded jealousy’s inventions yet they stung  in this height of anger he still preserved his faith in seraphina’s innocence but the thought of her possible misconduct was the bitterest ingredient in his pot of sorrow  there came a knock at the door and the chamberlain brought him a note he took it and ground it in his hand continuing his march continuing his bewildered thoughts and some minutes had gone by before the circumstance came clearly to his mind  then he paused and opened it  it was a pencil scratch from gotthold thus conceived      ‘the council is privately summoned at once                                                                   g v h’  if the council was thus called before the hour and that privately it was plain they feared his interference  feared here was a sweet thought  gotthold too—gotthold who had always used and regarded him as a mere peasant lad had now been at the pains to warn him gotthold looked for something at his hands  well none should be disappointed the prince too long beshadowed by the uxorious lover should now return and shine  he summoned his valet repaired the disorder of his appearance with elaborate care and then curled and scented and adorned prince charming in every line but with a twitching nostril he set forth unattended for the council    chapter vii—the prince dissolves the council   it was as gotthold wrote  the liberation of sir john greisengesang’s uneasy narrative last of all the scene between seraphina and the prince had decided the conspirators to take a step of bold timidity there had been a period of bustle liveried messengers speeding here and there with notes and at halfpast ten in the morning about an hour before its usual hour the council of grünewald sat around the board  it was not a large body  at the instance of gondremark it had undergone a strict purgation and was now composed exclusively of tools  three secretaries sat at a sidetable  seraphina took the head on her right was the baron on her left greisengesang below these grafinski the treasurer count eisenthal a couple of noncombatants and to the surprise of all gotthold  he had been named a privy councillor by otto merely that he might profit by the salary and as he was never known to attend a meeting it had occurred to nobody to cancel his appointment his present appearance was the more ominous coming when it did gondremark scowled upon him and the noncombatant on his right intercepting this black look edged away from one who was so clearly out of favour  ‘the hour presses your highness’ said the baron ‘may we proceed to business’  ‘at once’ replied seraphina  ‘your highness will pardon me’ said gotthold ‘but you are still perhaps unacquainted with the fact that prince otto has returned’  ‘the prince will not attend the council’ replied seraphina with a momentary blush  ‘the despatches herr cancellarius  there is one for gerolstein’  a secretary brought a paper  ‘here madam’ said greisengesang  ‘shall i read it’  ‘we are all familiar with its terms’ replied gondremark  ‘your highness approves’  ‘unhesitatingly’ said seraphina  ‘it may then be held as read’ concluded the baron  ‘will your highness sign’  the princess did so gondremark eisenthal and one of the noncombatants followed suit and the paper was then passed across the table to the librarian  he proceeded leisurely to read  ‘we have no time to spare herr doctor’ cried the baron brutally  ‘if you do not choose to sign on the authority of your sovereign pass it on or you may leave the table’ he added his temper ripping out  ‘i decline your invitation herr von gondremark and my sovereign as i continue to observe with regret is still absent from the board’ replied the doctor calmly and he resumed the perusal of the paper the rest chafing and exchanging glances  ‘madame and gentlemen’ he said at last ‘what i hold in my hand is simply a declaration of war’  ‘simply’ said seraphina flashing defiance  ‘the sovereign of this country is under the same roof with us’ continued gotthold ‘and i insist he shall be summoned  it is needless to adduce my reasons you are all ashamed at heart of this projected treachery’  the council waved like a sea  there were various outcries  ‘you insult the princess’ thundered gondremark  ‘i maintain my protest’ replied gotthold  at the height of this confusion the door was thrown open an usher announced ‘gentlemen the prince’ and otto with his most excellent bearing entered the apartment  it was like oil upon the troubled waters every one settled instantly into his place and griesengesang to give himself a countenance became absorbed in the arrangement of his papers but in their eagerness to dissemble one and all neglected to rise  ‘gentlemen’ said the prince pausing  they all got to their feet in a moment and this reproof still further demoralised the weaker brethren  the prince moved slowly towards the lower end of the table then he paused again and fixing his eye on greisengesang ‘how comes it herr cancellarius’ he asked ‘that i have received no notice of the change of hour’  ‘your highness’ replied the chancellor ‘her highness the princess    ’ and there paused  ‘i understood’ said seraphina taking him up ‘that you did not purpose to be present’  their eyes met for a second and seraphina’s fell but her anger only burned the brighter for that private shame  ‘and now gentlemen’ said otto taking his chair ‘i pray you to be seated  i have been absent there are doubtless some arrears but ere we proceed to business herr grafinski you will direct four thousand crowns to be sent to me at once  make a note if you please’ he added as the treasurer still stared in wonder  ‘four thousand crowns’ asked seraphina  ‘pray for what’  ‘madam’ returned otto smiling ‘for my own purposes’  gondremark spurred up grafinski underneath the table  ‘if your highness will indicate the destination    ’ began the puppet  ‘you are not here sir to interrogate your prince’ said otto  grafinski looked for help to his commander and gondremark came to his aid in suave and measured tones  ‘your highness may reasonably be surprised’ he said ‘and herr grafinski although i am convinced he is clear of the intention of offending would have perhaps done better to begin with an explanation the resources of the state are at the present moment entirely swallowed up or as we hope to prove wisely invested  in a month from now i do not question we shall be able to meet any command your highness may lay upon us but at this hour i fear that even in so small a matter he must prepare himself for disappointment  our zeal is no less although our power may be inadequate’  ‘how much herr grafinski have we in the treasury’ asked otto  ‘your highness’ protested the treasurer ‘we have immediate need of every crown’  ‘i think sir you evade me’ flashed the prince and then turning to the sidetable ‘mr secretary’ he added ‘bring me if you please the treasury docket’  herr grafinski became deadly pale the chancellor expecting his own turn was probably engaged in prayer gondremark was watching like a ponderous cat  gotthold on his part looked on with wonder at his cousin he was certainly showing spirit but what in such a time of gravity was all this talk of money and why should he waste his strength upon a personal issue  ‘i find’ said otto with his finger on the docket ‘that we have 20000 crowns in case’  ‘that is exact your highness’ replied the baron  ‘but our liabilities all of which are happily not liquid amount to a far larger sum and at the present point of time it would be morally impossible to divert a single florin  essentially the case is empty  we have already presented a large note for material of war’  ‘material of war’ exclaimed otto with an excellent assumption of surprise  ‘but if my memory serves me right we settled these accounts in january’  ‘there have been further orders’ the baron explained  ‘a new park of artillery has been completed five hundred stand of arms seven hundred baggage mules—the details are in a special memorandum—mr secretary holtz the memorandum if you please’  ‘one would think gentlemen that we were going to war’ said otto  ‘we are’ said seraphina  ‘war’ cried the prince ‘and gentlemen with whom  the peace of grünewald has endured for centuries  what aggression what insult have we suffered’  ‘here your highness’ said gotthold ‘is the ultimatum  it was in the very article of signature when your highness so opportunely entered’  otto laid the paper before him as he read his fingers played tattoo upon the table  ‘was it proposed’ he inquired ‘to send this paper forth without a knowledge of my pleasure’  one of the noncombatants eager to trim volunteered an answer  ‘the herr doctor von hohenstockwitz had just entered his dissent’ he added  ‘give me the rest of this correspondence’ said the prince  it was handed to him and he read it patiently from end to end while the councillors sat foolishly enough looking before them on the table  the secretaries in the background were exchanging glances of delight a row at the council was for them a rare and welcome feature  ‘gentlemen’ said otto when he had finished ‘i have read with pain this claim upon obermünsterol is palpably unjust it has not a tincture not a show of justice  there is not in all this ground enough for afterdinner talk and you propose to force it as a casus belli’  ‘certainly your highness’ returned gondremark too wise to defend the indefensible ‘the claim on obermünsterol is simply a pretext’  ‘it is well’ said the prince  ‘herr cancellarius take your pen  “the council” he began to dictate—‘i withhold all notice of my intervention’ he said in parenthesis and addressing himself more directly to his wife ‘and i say nothing of the strange suppression by which this business has been smuggled past my knowledge  i am content to be in time—“the council”’ he resumed ‘“on a further examination of the facts and enlightened by the note in the last despatch from gerolstein have the pleasure to announce that they are entirely at one both as to fact and sentiment with the grandducal court of gerolstein”  you have it upon these lines sir you will draw up the despatch’  ‘if your highness will allow me’ said the baron ‘your highness is so imperfectly acquainted with the internal history of this correspondence that any interference will be merely hurtful  such a paper as your highness proposes would be to stultify the whole previous policy of grünewald’  ‘the policy of grünewald’ cried the prince  ‘one would suppose you had no sense of humour  would you fish in a coffee cup’  ‘with deference your highness’ returned the baron ‘even in a coffee cup there may be poison  the purpose of this war is not simply territorial enlargement still less is it a war of glory for as your highness indicates the state of grünewald is too small to be ambitious but the body politic is seriously diseased republicanism socialism many disintegrating ideas are abroad circle within circle a really formidable organisation has grown up about your highness’s throne’  ‘i have heard of it herr von gondremark’ put in the prince ‘but i have reason to be aware that yours is the more authoritative information’  ‘i am honoured by this expression of my prince’s confidence’ returned gondremark unabashed  ‘it is therefore with a single eye to these disorders that our present external policy has been shaped  something was required to divert public attention to employ the idle to popularise your highness’s rule and if it were possible to enable him to reduce the taxes at a blow and to a notable amount  the proposed expedition—for it cannot without hyperbole be called a war—seemed to the council to combine the various characters required a marked improvement in the public sentiment has followed even upon our preparations and i cannot doubt that when success shall follow the effect will surpass even our boldest hopes’  ‘you are very adroit herr von gondremark’ said otto  ‘you fill me with admiration  i had not heretofore done justice to your qualities’  seraphina looked up with joy supposing otto conquered but gondremark still waited armed at every point he knew how very stubborn is the revolt of a weak character  ‘and the territorial army scheme to which i was persuaded to consent—was it secretly directed to the same end’ the prince asked  ‘i still believe the effect to have been good’ replied the baron ‘discipline and mounting guard are excellent sedatives  but i will avow to your highness i was unaware at the date of that decree of the magnitude of the revolutionary movement nor did any of us i think imagine that such a territorial army was a part of the republican proposals’  ‘it was’ asked otto  ‘strange  upon what fancied grounds’  ‘the grounds were indeed fanciful’ returned the baron  ‘it was conceived among the leaders that a territorial army drawn from and returning to the people would in the event of any popular uprising prove lukewarm or unfaithful to the throne’  ‘i see’ said the prince  ‘i begin to understand’  ‘his highness begins to understand’ repeated gondremark with the sweetest politeness  ‘may i beg of him to complete the phrase’  ‘the history of the revolution’ replied otto dryly  ‘and now’ he added ‘what do you conclude’  ‘i conclude your highness with a simple reflection’ said the baron accepting the stab without a quiver ‘the war is popular were the rumour contradicted tomorrow a considerable disappointment would be felt in many classes and in the present tension of spirits the most lukewarm sentiment may be enough to precipitate events  there lies the danger the revolution hangs imminent we sit at this council board below the sword of damocles’  ‘we must then lay our heads together’ said the prince ‘and devise some honourable means of safety’  up to this moment since the first note of opposition fell from the librarian seraphina had uttered about twenty words  with a somewhat heightened colour her eyes generally lowered her foot sometimes nervously tapping on the floor she had kept her own counsel and commanded her anger like a hero  but at this stage of the engagement she lost control of her impatience  ‘means’ she cried  ‘they have been found and prepared before you knew the need for them  sign the despatch and let us be done with this delay’  ‘madam i said “honourable”’ returned otto bowing  ‘this war is in my eyes and by herr von gondremark’s account an inadmissible expedient if we have misgoverned here in grünewald are the people of gerolstein to bleed and pay for our misdoings  never madam not while i live  but i attach so much importance to all that i have heard today for the first time—and why only today i do not even stop to ask—that i am eager to find some plan that i can follow with credit to myself’  ‘and should you fail’ she asked  ‘should i fail i will then meet the blow halfway’ replied the prince ‘on the first open discontent i shall convoke the states and when it pleases them to bid me abdicate’  seraphina laughed angrily  ‘this is the man for whom we have been labouring’ she cried  ‘we tell him of change he will devise the means he says and his device is abdication  sir have you no shame to come here at the eleventh hour among those who have borne the heat and burthen of the day  do you not wonder at yourself  i sir was here in my place striving to uphold your dignity alone  i took counsel with the wisest i could find while you were eating and hunting  i have laid my plans with foresight they were ripe for action and then—‘she choked—‘then you return—for a forenoon—to ruin all  tomorrow you will be once more about your pleasures you will give us leave once more to think and work for you and again you will come back and again you will thwart what you had not the industry or knowledge to conceive  o it is intolerable  be modest sir  do not presume upon the rank you cannot worthily uphold  i would not issue my commands with so much gusto—it is from no merit in yourself they are obeyed  what are you  what have you to do in this grave council  go’ she cried ‘go among your equals  the very people in the streets mock at you for a prince’  at this surprising outburst the whole council sat aghast  ‘madam’ said the baron alarmed out of his caution ‘command yourself’  ‘address yourself to me sir’ cried the prince  ‘i will not bear these whisperings’  seraphina burst into tears  ‘sir’ cried the baron rising ‘this lady—’  ‘herr von gondremark’ said the prince ‘one more observation and i place you under arrest’  ‘your highness is the master’ replied gondremark bowing  ‘bear it in mind more constantly’ said otto  ‘herr cancellarius bring all the papers to my cabinet  gentlemen the council is dissolved’  and he bowed and left the apartment followed by greisengesang and the secretaries just at the moment when the princess’s ladies summoned in all haste entered by another door to help her forth    chapter viii—the party of war takes action   half an hour after gondremark was once more closeted with seraphina  ‘where is he now’ she asked on his arrival  ‘madam he is with the chancellor’ replied the baron  ‘wonder of wonders he is at work’  ‘ah’ she said ‘he was born to torture me  o what a fall what a humiliation  such a scheme to wreck upon so small a trifle  but now all is lost’  ‘madam’ said gondremark ‘nothing is lost  something on the other hand is found  you have found your senses you see him as he is—see him as you see everything where your toogood heart is not in question—with the judicial with the statesman’s eye  so long as he had a right to interfere the empire that may be was still distant  i have not entered on this course without the plain foresight of its dangers and even for this i was prepared  but madam i knew two things i knew that you were born to command that i was born to serve i knew that by a rare conjuncture the hand had found the tool and from the first i was confident as i am confident today that no hereditary trifler has the power to shatter that alliance’  ‘i born to command’ she said  ‘do you forget my tears’  ‘madam they were the tears of alexander’ cried the baron  ‘they touched they thrilled me i forgot myself a moment—even i  but do you suppose that i had not remarked that i had not admired your previous bearing your great selfcommand  ay that was princely’  he paused ‘it was a thing to see  i drank confidence  i tried to imitate your calm  and i was well inspired in my heart i think that i was well inspired that any man within the reach of argument had been convinced but it was not to be nor madam do i regret the failure  let us be open let me disclose my heart  i have loved two things not unworthily grünewald and my sovereign’  here he kissed her hand  ‘either i must resign my ministry leave the land of my adoption and the queen whom i had chosen to obey—or—’  he paused again  ‘alas herr von gondremark there is no “or”’ said seraphina  ‘nay madam give me time’ he replied  ‘when first i saw you you were still young not every man would have remarked your powers but i had not been twice honoured by your conversation ere i had found my mistress  i have madam i believe some genius and i have much ambition  but the genius is of the serving kind and to offer a career to my ambition i had to find one born to rule  this is the base and essence of our union each had need of the other each recognised master and servant lever and fulcrum the complement of his endowment  marriages they say are made in heaven how much more these pure laborious intellectual fellowships born to found empires  nor is this all  we found each other ripe filled with great ideas that took shape and clarified with every word  we grew together—ay madam in mind we grew together like twin children  all of my life until we met was petty and groping was it not—i will flatter myself openly—it was the same with you  not till then had you those eagle surveys that wide and hopeful sweep of intuition  thus we had formed ourselves and we were ready’  ‘it is true’ she cried  ‘i feel it  yours is the genius your generosity confounds your insight all i could offer you was the position was this throne to be a fulcrum  but i offered it without reserve i entered at least warmly into all your thoughts you were sure of me—sure of my support—certain of justice  tell me tell me again that i have helped you’  ‘nay madam’ he said ‘you made me  in everything you were my inspiration  and as we prepared our policy weighing every step how often have i had to admire your perspicacity your manlike diligence and fortitude  you know that these are not the words of flattery your conscience echoes them have you spared a day have you indulged yourself in any pleasure  young and beautiful you have lived a life of high intellectual effort of irksome intellectual patience with details well you have your reward with the fall of brandenau the throne of your empire is founded’  ‘what thought have you in your mind’ she asked  ‘is not all ruined’  ‘nay my princess the same thought is in both our minds’ he said  ‘herr von gondremark’ she replied ‘by all that i hold sacred i have none i do not think at all i am crushed’  ‘you are looking at the passionate side of a rich nature misunderstood and recently insulted’ said the baron  ‘look into your intellect and tell me’  ‘i find nothing nothing but tumult’ she replied  ‘you find one word branded madam’ returned the baron ‘“abdication”’  ‘o’ she cried  ‘the coward  he leaves me to bear all and in the hour of trial he stabs me from behind  there is nothing in him not respect not love not courage—his wife his dignity his throne the honour of his father he forgets them all’  ‘yes’ pursued the baron ‘the word abdication  i perceive a glimmering there’  ‘i read your fancy’ she returned  ‘it is mere madness midsummer madness  baron i am more unpopular than he  you know it  they can excuse they can love his weakness but me they hate’  ‘such is the gratitude of peoples’ said the baron  ‘but we trifle here madam are my plain thoughts  the man who in the hour of danger speaks of abdication is for me a venomous animal  i speak with the bluntness of gravity madam this is no hour for mincing  the coward in a station of authority is more dangerous than fire  we dwell on a volcano if this man can have his way grünewald before a week will have been deluged with innocent blood  you know the truth of what i say we have looked unblenching into this everpossible catastrophe  to him it is nothing he will abdicate  abdicate just god and this unhappy country committed to his charge and the lives of men and the honour of women   ’  his voice appeared to fail him in an instant he had conquered his emotion and resumed ‘but you madam conceive more worthily of your responsibilities  i am with you in the thought and in the face of the horrors that i see impending i say and your heart repeats it—we have gone too far to pause  honour duty ay and the care of our own lives demand we should proceed’  she was looking at him her brow thoughtfully knitted  ‘i feel it’ she said  ‘but how  he has the power’  ‘the power madam  the power is in the army’ he replied and then hastily ere she could intervene ‘we have to save ourselves’ he went on ‘i have to save my princess she has to save her minister we have both of us to save this infatuated youth from his own madness  he in the outbreak would be the earliest victim i see him’ he cried ‘torn in pieces and grünewald unhappy grünewald  nay madam you who have the power must use it it lies hard upon your conscience’  ‘show me how’ she cried  ‘suppose i were to place him under some constraint the revolution would break upon us instantly’  the baron feigned defeat  ‘it is true’ he said  ‘you see more clearly than i do  yet there should there must be some way’  and he waited for his chance  ‘no’ she said ‘i told you from the first there is no remedy  our hopes are lost lost by one miserable trifler ignorant fretful fitful—who will have disappeared tomorrow who knows to his boorish pleasures’  any peg would do for gondremark  ‘the thing’ he cried striking his brow  ‘fool not to have thought of it  madam without perhaps knowing it you have solved our problem’  ‘what do you mean  speak’ she said  he appeared to collect himself and then with a smile ‘the prince’ he said ‘must go once more ahunting’  ‘ay if he would’ cried she ‘and stay there’  ‘and stay there’ echoed the baron  it was so significantly said that her face changed and the schemer fearful of the sinister ambiguity of his expressions hastened to explain  ‘this time he shall go hunting in a carriage with a good escort of our foreign lancers  his destination shall be the felsenburg it is healthy the rock is high the windows are small and barred it might have been built on purpose  we shall intrust the captaincy to the scotsman gordon he at least will have no scruple who will miss the sovereign  he is gone hunting he came home on tuesday on thursday he returned all is usual in that  meanwhile the war proceeds our prince will soon weary of his solitude and about the time of our triumph or if he prove very obstinate a little later he shall be released upon a proper understanding and i see him once more directing his theatricals’  seraphina sat gloomy plunged in thought  ‘yes’ she said suddenly ‘and the despatch  he is now writing it’  ‘it cannot pass the council before friday’ replied gondremark ‘and as for any private note the messengers are all at my disposal  they are picked men madam  i am a person of precaution’  ‘it would appear so’ she said with a flash of her occasional repugnance to the man and then after a pause ‘herr von gondremark’ she added ‘i recoil from this extremity’  ‘i share your highness’s repugnance’ answered he  ‘but what would you have  we are defenceless else’  ‘i see it but this is sudden  it is a public crime’ she said nodding at him with a sort of horror  ‘look but a little deeper’ he returned ‘and whose is the crime’  ‘his’ she cried  ‘his before god  and i hold him liable  but still—’  ‘it is not as if he would be harmed’ submitted gondremark  ‘i know it’ she replied but it was still unheartily  and then as brave men are entitled by prescriptive right as old as the world’s history to the alliance and the active help of fortune the punctual goddess stepped down from the machine  one of the princess’s ladies begged to enter a man it appeared had brought a line for the freiherr von gondremark  it proved to be a pencil billet which the crafty greisengesang had found the means to scribble and despatch under the very guns of otto and the daring of the act bore testimony to the terror of the actor  for greisengesang had but one influential motive fear  the note ran thus ‘at the first council procuration to be withdrawn—corn greis’  so after three years of exercise the right of signature was to be stript from seraphina  it was more than an insult it was a public disgrace and she did not pause to consider how she had earned it but morally bounded under the attack as bounds the wounded tiger  ‘enough’ she said ‘i will sign the order  when shall he leave’  ‘it will take me twelve hours to collect my men and it had best be done at night  tomorrow midnight if you please’ answered the baron  ‘excellent’ she said  ‘my door is always open to you baron  as soon as the order is prepared bring it me to sign’  ‘madam’ he said ‘alone of all of us you do not risk your head in this adventure  for that reason and to prevent all hesitation i venture to propose the order should be in your hand throughout’  ‘you are right’ she replied  he laid a form before her and she wrote the order in a clear hand and reread it  suddenly a cruel smile came on her face  ‘i had forgotten his puppet’ said she  ‘they will keep each other company’  and she interlined and initiated the condemnation of doctor gotthold  ‘your highness has more memory than your servant’ said the baron and then he in his turn carefully perused the fateful paper  ‘good’ said he  ‘you will appear in the drawingroom baron’ she asked  ‘i thought it better’ said he ‘to avoid the possibility of a public affront  anything that shook my credit might hamper us in the immediate future’  ‘you are right’ she said and she held out her hand as to an old friend and equal    chapter ix—the price of the river farm in which vainglory goes before a fall   the pistol had been practically fired  under ordinary circumstances the scene at the council table would have entirely exhausted otto’s store both of energy and anger he would have begun to examine and condemn his conduct have remembered all that was true forgotten all that was unjust in seraphina’s onslaught and by half an hour after would have fallen into that state of mind in which a catholic flees to the confessional and a sot takes refuge with the bottle  two matters of detail preserved his spirits  for first he had still an infinity of business to transact and to transact business for a man of otto’s neglectful and procrastinating habits is the best anodyne for conscience  all afternoon he was hard at it with the chancellor reading dictating signing and despatching papers and this kept him in a glow of selfapproval  but secondly his vanity was still alarmed he had failed to get the money tomorrow before noon he would have to disappoint old killian and in the eyes of that family which counted him so little and to which he had sought to play the part of the heroic comforter he must sink lower than at first  to a man of otto’s temper this was death  he could not accept the situation  and even as he worked and worked wisely and well over the hated details of his principality he was secretly maturing a plan by which to turn the situation  it was a scheme as pleasing to the man as it was dishonourable in the prince in which his frivolous nature found and took vengeance for the gravity and burthen of the afternoon  he chuckled as he thought of it and greisengesang heard him with wonder and attributed his lively spirits to the skirmish of the morning  led by this idea the antique courtier ventured to compliment his sovereign on his bearing  it reminded him he said of otto’s father  ‘what’ asked the prince whose thoughts were miles away  ‘your highness’s authority at the board’ explained the flatterer  ‘o that  o yes’ returned otto but for all his carelessness his vanity was delicately tickled and his mind returned and dwelt approvingly over the details of his victory  ‘i quelled them all’ he thought  when the more pressing matters had been dismissed it was already late and otto kept the chancellor to dinner and was entertained with a leash of ancient histories and modern compliments  the chancellor’s career had been based from the first offput on entire subserviency he had crawled into honours and employments and his mind was prostitute  the instinct of the creature served him well with otto  first he let fall a sneering word or two upon the female intellect thence he proceeded to a closer engagement and before the third course he was artfully dissecting seraphina’s character to her approving husband  of course no names were used and of course the identity of that abstract or ideal man with whom she was currently contrasted remained an open secret  but this stiff old gentleman had a wonderful instinct for evil thus to wind his way into man’s citadel thus to harp by the hour on the virtues of his hearer and not once alarm his selfrespect  otto was all roseate in and out with flattery and tokay and an approving conscience  he saw himself in the most attractive colours  if even greisengesang he thought could thus espy the loose stitches in seraphina’s character and thus disloyally impart them to the opposite camp he the discarded husband—the dispossessed prince—could scarce have erred on the side of severity  in this excellent frame he bade adieu to the old gentleman whose voice had proved so musical and set forth for the drawingroom  already on the stair he was seized with some compunction but when he entered the great gallery and beheld his wife the chancellor’s abstract flatteries fell from him like rain and he reawoke to the poetic facts of life she stood a good way off below a shining lustre her back turned  the bend of her waist overcame him with physical weakness  this was the girlwife who had lain in his arms and whom he had sworn to cherish there was she who was better than success  it was seraphina who restored him from the blow  she swam forward and smiled upon her husband with a sweetness that was insultingly artificial ‘frédéric’ she lisped ‘you are late’  it was a scene of high comedy such as is proper to unhappy marriages and her aplomb disgusted him  there was no etiquette at these small drawingrooms  people came and went at pleasure  the window embrasures became the roost of happy couples at the great chimney the talkers mostly congregated each fullcharged with scandal and down at the farther end the gamblers gambled  it was towards this point that otto moved not ostentatiously but with a gentle insistence and scattering attentions as he went  once abreast of the cardtable he placed himself opposite to madame von rosen and as soon as he had caught her eye withdrew to the embrasure of a window  there she had speedily joined him  ‘you did well to call me’ she said a little wildly  ‘these cards will be my ruin’  ‘leave them’ said otto  ‘i’ she cried and laughed ‘they are my destiny  my only chance was to die of a consumption now i must die in a garret’  ‘you are bitter tonight’ said otto  ‘i have been losing’ she replied  ‘you do not know what greed is’  ‘i have come then in an evil hour’ said he  ‘ah you wish a favour’ she cried brightening beautifully  ‘madam’ said he ‘i am about to found my party and i come to you for a recruit’  ‘done’ said the countess  ‘i am a man again’  ‘i may be wrong’ continued otto ‘but i believe upon my heart you wish me no ill’  ‘i wish you so well’ she said ‘that i dare not tell it you’  ‘then if i ask my favour’ quoth the prince  ‘ask it mon prince’ she answered  ‘whatever it is it is granted’  ‘i wish you’ he returned ‘this very night to make the farmer of our talk’  ‘heaven knows your meaning’ she exclaimed  ‘i know not neither care there are no bounds to my desire to please you  call him made’  ‘i will put it in another way’ returned otto  ‘did you ever steal’  ‘often’ cried the countess  ‘i have broken all the ten commandments and if there were more tomorrow i should not sleep till i had broken these’  ‘this is a case of burglary to say the truth i thought it would amuse you’ said the prince  ‘i have no practical experience’ she replied ‘but o the goodwill  i have broken a workbox in my time and several hearts my own included never a house  but it cannot be difficult sins are so unromantically easy  what are we to break’  ‘madam we are to break the treasury’ said otto and he sketched to her briefly wittily with here and there a touch of pathos the story of his visit to the farm of his promise to buy it and of the refusal with which his demand for money had been met that morning at the council concluding with a few practical words as to the treasury windows and the helps and hindrances of the proposed exploit  ‘they refused you the money’ she said when he had done  ‘and you accepted the refusal  well’  ‘they gave their reasons’ replied otto colouring  ‘they were not such as i could combat and i am driven to dilapidate the funds of my own country by a theft  it is not dignified but it is fun’  ‘fun’ she said ‘yes’  and then she remained silently plunged in thought for an appreciable time  ‘how much do you require’ she asked at length  ‘three thousand crowns will do’ he answered ‘for i have still some money of my own’  ‘excellent’ she said regaining her levity  ‘i am your true accomplice and where are we to meet’  ‘you know the flying mercury’ he answered ‘in the park  three pathways intersect there they have made a seat and raised the statue  the spot is handy and the deity congenial’  ‘child’ she said and tapped him with her fan  ‘but do you know my prince you are an egoist—your handy trystingplace is miles from me you must give me ample time i cannot i think possibly be there before two  but as the bell beats two your helper shall arrive welcome i trust  stay—do you bring any one’ she added  ‘o it is not for a chaperon—i am not a prude’  ‘i shall bring a groom of mine’ said otto  ‘i caught him stealing corn’  ‘his name’ she asked  ‘i profess i know not  i am not yet intimate with my cornstealer’ returned the prince  ‘it was in a professional capacity—’  ‘like me  flatterer’ she cried  ‘but oblige me in one thing  let me find you waiting at the seat—yes you shall await me for on this expedition it shall be no longer prince and countess it shall be the lady and the squire—and your friend the thief shall be no nearer than the fountain  do you promise’  ‘madam in everything you are to command you shall be captain i am but supercargo’ answered otto  ‘well heaven bring all safe to port’ she said  ‘it is not friday’  something in her manner had puzzled otto had possibly touched him with suspicion  ‘is it not strange’ he remarked ‘that i should choose my accomplice from the other camp’  ‘fool’ she said  ‘but it is your only wisdom that you know your friends’  and suddenly in the vantage of the deep window she caught up his hand and kissed it with a sort of passion  ‘now go’ she added ‘go at once’  he went somewhat staggered doubting in his heart that he was overbold for in that moment she had flashed upon him like a jewel and even through the strong panoply of a previous love he had been conscious of a shock  next moment he had dismissed the fear  both otto and the countess retired early from the drawingroom and the prince after an elaborate feint dismissed his valet and went forth by the private passage and the back postern in quest of the groom  once more the stable was in darkness once more otto employed the talismanic knock and once more the groom appeared and sickened with terror  ‘goodevening friend’ said otto pleasantly  ‘i want you to bring a corn sack—empty this time—and to accompany me  we shall be gone all night’  ‘your highness’ groaned the man ‘i have the charge of the small stables  i am here alone’  ‘come’ said the prince ‘you are no such martinet in duty’  and then seeing that the man was shaking from head to foot otto laid a hand upon his shoulder  ‘if i meant you harm’ he said ‘should i be here’  the fellow became instantly reassured  he got the sack and otto led him round by several paths and avenues conversing pleasantly by the way and left him at last planted by a certain fountain where a goggleeyed triton spouted intermittently into a rippling laver  thence he proceeded alone to where in a round clearing a copy of gian bologna’s mercury stood tiptoe in the twilight of the stars  the night was warm and windless  a shaving of new moon had lately arisen but it was still too small and too low down in heaven to contend with the immense host of lesser luminaries and the rough face of the earth was drenched with starlight  down one of the alleys which widened as it receded he could see a part of the lamplit terrace where a sentry silently paced and beyond that a corner of the town with interlacing streetlights  but all around him the young trees stood mystically blurred in the dim shine and in the stockstill quietness the upleaping god appeared alive  in this dimness and silence of the night otto’s conscience became suddenly and staringly luminous like the dial of a city clock  he averted the eyes of his mind but the finger rapidly travelling pointed to a series of misdeeds that took his breath away  what was he doing in that place  the money had been wrongly squandered but that was largely by his own neglect  and he now proposed to embarrass the finances of this country which he had been too idle to govern  and he now proposed to squander the money once again and this time for a private if a generous end  and the man whom he had reproved for stealing corn he was now to set stealing treasure  and then there was madame von rosen upon whom he looked down with some of that illfavoured contempt of the chaste male for the imperfect woman  because he thought of her as one degraded below scruples he had picked her out to be still more degraded and to risk her whole irregular establishment in life by complicity in this dishonourable act  it was uglier than a seduction  otto had to walk very briskly and whistle very busily and when at last he heard steps in the narrowest and darkest of the alleys it was with a gush of relief that he sprang to meet the countess  to wrestle alone with one’s good angel is so hard and so precious at the proper time is a companion certain to be less virtuous than oneself  it was a young man who came towards him—a young man of small stature and a peculiar gait wearing a wide flapping hat and carrying with great weariness a heavy bag  otto recoiled but the young man held up his hand by way of signal and coming up with a panting run as if with the last of his endurance laid the bag upon the ground threw himself upon the bench and disclosed the features of madame von rosen  ‘you countess’ cried the prince  ‘no no’ she panted ‘the count von rosen—my young brother  a capital fellow  let him get his breath’  ‘ah madam    ’ said he  ‘call me count’ she returned ‘respect my incognito’  ‘count be it then’ he replied  ‘and let me implore that gallant gentleman to set forth at once on our enterprise’  ‘sit down beside me here’ she returned patting the further corner of the bench  ‘i will follow you in a moment  o i am so tired—feel how my heart leaps  where is your thief’  ‘at his post’ replied otto  ‘shall i introduce him  he seems an excellent companion’  ‘no’ she said ‘do not hurry me yet  i must speak to you  not but i adore your thief i adore any one who has the spirit to do wrong  i never cared for virtue till i fell in love with my prince’  she laughed musically  ‘and even so it is not for your virtues’ she added  otto was embarrassed  ‘and now’ he asked ‘if you are anyway rested’  ‘presently presently  let me breathe’ she said panting a little harder than before  ‘and what has so wearied you’ he asked  ‘this bag  and why in the name of eccentricity a bag  for an empty one you might have relied on my own foresight and this one is very far from being empty  my dear count with what trash have you come laden  but the shortest method is to see for myself’  and he put down his hand  she stopped him at once  ‘otto’ she said ‘no—not that way  i will tell i will make a clean breast  it is done already  i have robbed the treasury singlehanded  there are three thousand two hundred crowns  o i trust it is enough’  her embarrassment was so obvious that the prince was struck into a muse gazing in her face with his hand still outstretched and she still holding him by the wrist  ‘you’ he said at last  ‘how’ and then drawing himself up ‘o madam’ he cried ‘i understand  you must indeed think meanly of the prince’  ‘well then it was a lie’ she cried  ‘the money is mine honestly my own—now yours  this was an unworthy act that you proposed  but i love your honour and i swore to myself that i should save it in your teeth i beg of you to let me save it’—with a sudden lovely change of tone ‘otto i beseech you let me save it  take this dross from your poor friend who loves you’  ‘madam madam’ babbled otto in the extreme of misery ‘i cannot—i must go’  and he half rose but she was on the ground before him in an instant clasping his knees  ‘no’ she gasped ‘you shall not go  do you despise me so entirely  it is dross i hate it i should squander it at play and be no richer it is an investment it is to save me from ruin  otto’ she cried as he again feebly tried to put her from him ‘if you leave me alone in this disgrace i will die here’  he groaned aloud  ‘o’ she said ‘think what i suffer  if you suffer from a piece of delicacy think what i suffer in my shame  to have my trash refused  you would rather steal you think of me so basely  you would rather tread my heart in pieces  o unkind  o my prince  o otto  o pity me’  she was still clasping him then she found his hand and covered it with kisses and at this his head began to turn  ‘o’ she cried again ‘i see it  o what a horror  it is because i am old because i am no longer beautiful’  and she burst into a storm of sobs  this was the coup de grâce  otto had now to comfort and compose her as he could and before many words the money was accepted  between the woman and the weak man such was the inevitable end  madame von rosen instantly composed her sobs  she thanked him with a fluttering voice and resumed her place upon the bench at the far end from otto  ‘now you see’ she said ‘why i bade you keep the thief at distance and why i came alone  how i trembled for my treasure’  ‘madam’ said otto with a tearful whimper in his voice ‘spare me  you are too good too noble’  ‘i wonder to hear you’ she returned  ‘you have avoided a great folly you will be able to meet your good old peasant  you have found an excellent investment for a friend’s money  you have preferred essential kindness to an empty scruple and now you are ashamed of it  you have made your friend happy and now you mourn as the dove  come cheer up i know it is depressing to have done exactly right but you need not make a practice of it  forgive yourself this virtue come now look me in the face and smile’  he did look at her  when a man has been embraced by a woman he sees her in a glamour and at such a time in the baffling glimmer of the stars she will look wildly well  the hair is touched with light the eyes are constellations the face sketched in shadows—a sketch you might say by passion  otto became consoled for his defeat he began to take an interest  ‘no’ he said ‘i am no ingrate’  ‘you promised me fun’ she returned with a laugh  ‘i have given you as good  we have had a stormy scena’  he laughed in his turn and the sound of the laughter in either case was hardly reassuring  ‘come what are you going to give me in exchange’ she continued ‘for my excellent declamation’  ‘what you will’ he said  ‘whatever i will  upon your honour  suppose i asked the crown’  she was flashing upon him beautiful in triumph  ‘upon my honour’ he replied  ‘shall i ask the crown’ she continued  ‘nay what should i do with it grünewald is but a petty state my ambition swells above it  i shall ask—i find i want nothing’ she concluded  ‘i will give you something instead  i will give you leave to kiss me—once’  otto drew near and she put up her face they were both smiling both on the brink of laughter all was so innocent and playful and the prince when their lips encountered was dumbfoundered by the sudden convulsion of his being  both drew instantly apart and for an appreciable time sat tonguetied  otto was indistinctly conscious of a peril in the silence but could find no words to utter  suddenly the countess seemed to awake ‘as for your wife—’ she began in a clear and steady voice  the word recalled otto with a shudder from his trance  ‘i will hear nothing against my wife’ he cried wildly and then recovering himself and in a kindlier tone ‘i will tell you my one secret’ he added  ‘i love my wife’  ‘you should have let me finish’ she returned smiling  ‘do you suppose i did not mention her on purpose  you know you had lost your head well so had i  come now do not be abashed by words’ she added somewhat sharply  ‘it is the one thing i despise  if you are not a fool you will see that i am building fortresses about your virtue  and at any rate i choose that you shall understand that i am not dying of love for you  it is a very smiling business no tragedy for me  and now here is what i have to say about your wife she is not and she never has been gondremark’s mistress  be sure he would have boasted if she had goodnight’  and in a moment she was gone down the alley and otto was alone with the bag of money and the flying god    chapter x—gotthold’s revised opinion and the fall completed   the countess left poor otto with a caress and buffet simultaneously administered  the welcome word about his wife and the virtuous ending of his interview should doubtless have delighted him  but for all that as he shouldered the bag of money and set forward to rejoin his groom he was conscious of many aching sensibilities  to have gone wrong and to have been set right makes but a double trial for man’s vanity  the discovery of his own weakness and possible unfaith had staggered him to the heart and to hear in the same hour of his wife’s fidelity from one who loved her not increased the bitterness of the surprise  he was about halfway between the fountain and the flying mercury before his thoughts began to be clear and he was surprised to find them resentful  he paused in a kind of temper and struck with his hand a little shrub  thence there arose instantly a cloud of awakened sparrows which as instantly dispersed and disappeared into the thicket  he looked at them stupidly and when they were gone continued staring at the stars ‘i am angry  by what right  by none’ he thought but he was still angry  he cursed madame von rosen and instantly repented  heavy was the money on his shoulders  when he reached the fountain he did out of illhumour and parade an unpardonable act  he gave the money bodily to the dishonest groom ‘keep this for me’ he said ‘until i call for it tomorrow  it is a great sum and by that you will judge that i have not condemned you’ and he strode away ruffling as if he had done something generous  it was a desperate stroke to reenter at the point of the bayonet into his selfesteem and like all such it was fruitless in the end  he got to bed with the devil it appeared kicked and tumbled till the grey of the morning and then fell inopportunely into a leaden slumber and awoke to find it ten  to miss the appointment with old killian after all had been too tragic a miscarriage and he hurried with all his might found the groom for a wonder faithful to his trust and arrived only a few minutes before noon in the guestchamber of the morning star  killian was there in his sunday’s best and looking very gaunt and rigid a lawyer from brandenau stood sentinel over his outspread papers and the groom and the landlord of the inn were called to serve as witnesses  the obvious deference of that great man the innkeeper plainly affected the old farmer with surprise but it was not until otto had taken the pen and signed that the truth flashed upon him fully  then indeed he was beside himself  ‘his highness’ he cried ‘his highness’ and repeated the exclamation till his mind had grappled fairly with the facts  then he turned to the witnesses  ‘gentlemen’ he said ‘you dwell in a country highly favoured by god for of all generous gentlemen i will say it on my conscience this one is the king  i am an old man and i have seen good and bad and the year of the great famine but a more excellent gentleman no never’  ‘we know that’ cried the landlord ‘we know that well in grünewald  if we saw more of his highness we should be the better pleased’  ‘it is the kindest prince’ began the groom and suddenly closed his mouth upon a sob so that every one turned to gaze upon his emotion—otto not last otto struck with remorse to see the man so grateful  then it was the lawyer’s turn to pay a compliment  ‘i do not know what providence may hold in store’ he said ‘but this day should be a bright one in the annals of your reign  the shouts of armies could not be more eloquent than the emotion on these honest faces’  and the brandenau lawyer bowed skipped stepped back and took snuff with the air of a man who has found and seized an opportunity  ‘well young gentleman’ said killian ‘if you will pardon me the plainness of calling you a gentleman many a good day’s work you have done i doubt not but never a better or one that will be better blessed and whatever sir may be your happiness and triumph in that high sphere to which you have been called it will be none the worse sir for an old man’s blessing’  the scene had almost assumed the proportions of an ovation and when the prince escaped he had but one thought to go wherever he was most sure of praise  his conduct at the board of council occurred to him as a fair chapter and this evoked the memory of gotthold  to gotthold he would go  gotthold was in the library as usual and laid down his pen a little angrily on otto’s entrance  ‘well’ he said ‘here you are’  ‘well’ returned otto ‘we made a revolution i believe’  ‘it is what i fear’ returned the doctor  ‘how’ said otto  ‘fear  fear is the burnt child  i have learned my strength and the weakness of the others and i now mean to govern’  gotthold said nothing but he looked down and smoothed his chin  ‘you disapprove’ cried otto  ‘you are a weathercock’  ‘on the contrary’ replied the doctor  ‘my observation has confirmed my fears  it will not do otto not do’  ‘what will not do’ demanded the prince with a sickening stab of pain  ‘none of it’ answered gotthold  ‘you are unfitted for a life of action you lack the stamina the habit the restraint the patience  your wife is greatly better vastly better and though she is in bad hands displays a very different aptitude  she is a woman of affairs you are—dear boy you are yourself  i bid you back to your amusements like a smiling dominie i give you holidays for life  yes’ he continued ‘there is a day appointed for all when they shall turn again upon their own philosophy  i had grown to disbelieve impartially in all and if in the atlas of the sciences there were two charts i disbelieved in more than all the rest they were politics and morals  i had a sneaking kindness for your vices as they were negative they flattered my philosophy and i called them almost virtues  well otto i was wrong i have forsworn my sceptical philosophy and i perceive your faults to be unpardonable  you are unfit to be a prince unfit to be a husband  and i give you my word i would rather see a man capably doing evil than blundering about good’  otto was still silent in extreme dudgeon  presently the doctor resumed ‘i will take the smaller matter first your conduct to your wife  you went i hear and had an explanation  that may have been right or wrong i know not at least you had stirred her temper  at the council she insults you well you insult her back—a man to a woman a husband to his wife in public  next upon the back of this you propose—the story runs like wildfire—to recall the power of signature  can she ever forgive that a woman—a young woman—ambitious conscious of talents beyond yours  never otto  and to sum all at such a crisis in your married life you get into a window corner with that ogling dame von rosen  i do not dream that there was any harm but i do say it was an idle disrespect to your wife  why man the woman is not decent’  ‘gotthold’ said otto ‘i will hear no evil of the countess’  ‘you will certainly hear no good of her’ returned gotthold ‘and if you wish your wife to be the pink of nicety you should clear your court of demireputations’  ‘the commonplace injustice of a byword’ otto cried  ‘the partiality of sex  she is a demirep what then is gondremark  were she a man—’  ‘it would be all one’ retorted gotthold roughly  ‘when i see a man come to years of wisdom who speaks in doublemeanings and is the braggart of his vices i spit on the other side  “you my friend” say i “are not even a gentleman”  well she’s not even a lady’  ‘she is the best friend i have and i choose that she shall be respected’ otto said  ‘if she is your friend so much the worse’ replied the doctor  ‘it will not stop there’  ‘ah’ cried otto ‘there is the charity of virtue  all evil in the spotted fruit  but i can tell you sir that you do madame von rosen prodigal injustice’  ‘you can tell me’ said the doctor shrewdly  ‘have you tried have you been riding the marches’  the blood came into otto’s face  ‘ah’ cried gotthold ‘look at your wife and blush  there’s a wife for a man to marry and then lose  she’s a carnation otto  the soul is in her eyes’  ‘you have changed your note for seraphina i perceive’ said otto  ‘changed it’ cried the doctor with a flush  ‘why when was it different  but i own i admired her at the council  when she sat there silent tapping with her foot i admired her as i might a hurricane were i one of those who venture upon matrimony there had been the prize to tempt me  she invites as mexico invited cortez the enterprise is hard the natives are unfriendly—i believe them cruel too—but the metropolis is paved with gold and the breeze blows out of paradise  yes i could desire to be that conqueror  but to philander with von rosen never  senses  i discard them what are they—pruritus  curiosity reach me my anatomy’  ‘to whom do you address yourself’ cried otto  ‘surely you of all men know that i love my wife’  ‘o love’ cried gotthold ‘love is a great word it is in all the dictionaries  if you had loved she would have paid you back  what does she ask  a little ardour’  ‘it is hard to love for two’ replied the prince  ‘hard  why there’s the touchstone  o i know my poets’ cried the doctor  ‘we are but dust and fire too and to endure life’s scorching and love like the shadow of a great rock should lend shelter and refreshment not to the lover only but to his mistress and to the children that reward them and their very friends should seek repose in the fringes of that peace  love is not love that cannot build a home and you call it love to grudge and quarrel and pick faults  you call it love to thwart her to her face and bandy insults  love’  ‘gotthold you are unjust  i was then fighting for my country’ said the prince  ‘ay and there’s the worst of all’ returned the doctor  ‘you could not even see that you were wrong that being where they were retreat was ruin’  why you supported me’ cried otto  ‘i did  i was a fool like you’ replied gotthold  ‘but now my eyes are open  if you go on as you have started disgrace this fellow gondremark and publish the scandal of your divided house there will befall a most abominable thing in grünewald  a revolution friend—a revolution’  ‘you speak strangely for a red’ said otto  ‘a red republican but not a revolutionary’ returned the doctor  ‘an ugly thing is a grünewalder drunk  one man alone can save the country from this pass and that is the doubledealer gondremark with whom i conjure you to make peace  it will not be you it never can be you—you who can do nothing as your wife said but trade upon your station—you who spent the hours in begging money  and in god’s name what for  why money  what mystery of idiocy was this’  ‘it was to no ill end  it was to buy a farm’ quoth otto sulkily  ‘to buy a farm’ cried gotthold  ‘buy a farm’  ‘well what then’ returned otto ‘i have bought it if you come to that’  gotthold fairly bounded on his seat  ‘and how that’ he cried  ‘how’ repeated otto startled  ‘ay verily how’ returned the doctor  ‘how came you by the money’  the prince’s countenance darkened  ‘that is my affair’ said he  ‘you see you are ashamed’ retorted gotthold  ‘and so you bought a farm in the hour of our country’s need—doubtless to be ready for the abdication and i put it that you stole the funds  there are not three ways of getting money there are but two to earn and steal  and now when you have combined charles the fifth and longfingered tom you come to me to fortify your vanity  but i will clear my mind upon this matter until i know the right and wrong of the transaction i put my hand behind my back  a man may be the pitifullest prince he must be a spotless gentleman’  the prince had gotten to his feet as pale as paper  gotthold’ he said ‘you drive me beyond bounds  beware sir beware’  ‘do you threaten me friend otto’ asked the doctor grimly  ‘that would be a strange conclusion’  ‘when have you ever known me use my power in any private animosity’ cried otto  ‘to any private man your words were an unpardonable insult but at me you shoot in full security and i must turn aside to compliment you on your plainness  i must do more than pardon i must admire because you have faced this—this formidable monarch like a nathan before david  you have uprooted an old kindness sir with an unsparing hand you leave me very bare  my last bond is broken and though i take heaven to witness that i sought to do the right i have this reward to find myself alone  you say i am no gentleman yet the sneers have been upon your side and though i can very well perceive where you have lodged your sympathies i will forbear the taunt’  ‘otto are you insane’ cried gotthold leaping up  ‘because i ask you how you came by certain moneys and because you refuse—’  ‘herr von hohenstockwitz i have ceased to invite your aid in my affairs’ said otto  ‘i have heard all that i desire and you have sufficiently trampled on my vanity  it may be that i cannot govern it may be that i cannot love—you tell me so with every mark of honesty but god has granted me one virtue and i can still forgive  i forgive you even in this hour of passion i can perceive my faults and your excuses and if i desire that in future i may be spared your conversation it is not sir from resentment—not resentment—but by heaven because no man on earth could endure to be so rated  you have the satisfaction to see your sovereign weep and that person whom you have so often taunted with his happiness reduced to the last pitch of solitude and misery  no—i will hear nothing i claim the last word sir as your prince and that last word shall be—forgiveness’  and with that otto was gone from the apartment and doctor gotthold was left alone with the most conflicting sentiments of sorrow remorse and merriment walking to and fro before his table and asking himself with hands uplifted which of the pair of them was most to blame for this unhappy rupture  presently he took from a cupboard a bottle of rhine wine and a goblet of the deep bohemian ruby  the first glass a little warmed and comforted his bosom with the second he began to look down upon these troubles from a sunny mountain yet a while and filled with this false comfort and contemplating life throughout a golden medium he owned to himself with a flush a smile and a halfpleasurable sigh that he had been somewhat over plain in dealing with his cousin  ‘he said the truth too’ added the penitent librarian ‘for in my monkish fashion i adore the princess’  and then with a still deepening flush and a certain stealth although he sat all alone in that great gallery he toasted seraphina to the dregs    chapter xi—providence von rosen act the first she beguiles the baron   at a sufficiently late hour or to be more exact at three in the afternoon madame von rosen issued on the world  she swept downstairs and out across the garden a black mantilla thrown over her head and the long train of her black velvet dress ruthlessly sweeping in the dirt  at the other end of that long garden and back to back with the villa of the countess stood the large mansion where the prime minister transacted his affairs and pleasures  this distance which was enough for decency by the easy canons of mittwalden the countess swiftly traversed opened a little door with a key mounted a flight of stairs and entered unceremoniously into gondremark’s study  it was a large and very high apartment books all about the walls papers on the table papers on the floor here and there a picture somewhat scant of drapery a great fire glowing and flaming in the blue tiled hearth and the daylight streaming through a cupola above  in the midst of this sat the great baron gondremark in his shirtsleeves his business for that day fairly at an end and the hour arrived for relaxation  his expression his very nature seemed to have undergone a fundamental change  gondremark at home appeared the very antipode of gondremark on duty  he had an air of massive jollity that well became him grossness and geniality sat upon his features and along with his manners he had laid aside his sly and sinister expression  he lolled there sunning his bulk before the fire a noble animal  ‘hey’ he cried  ‘at last’  the countess stepped into the room in silence threw herself on a chair and crossed her legs  in her lace and velvet with a good display of smooth black stocking and of snowy petticoat and with the refined profile of her face and slender plumpness of her body she showed in singular contrast to the big black intellectual satyr by the fire  ‘how often do you send for me’ she cried  ‘it is compromising’  gondremark laughed  ‘speaking of that’ said he ‘what in the devil’s name were you about  you were not home till morning’  ‘i was giving alms’ she said  the baron again laughed loud and long for in his shirtsleeves he was a very mirthful creature  ‘it is fortunate i am not jealous’ he remarked ‘but you know my way pleasure and liberty go hand in hand  i believe what i believe it is not much but i believe it—but now to business have you not read my letter’  ‘no’ she said ‘my head ached’  ‘ah well then i have news indeed’ cried gondremark  ‘i was mad to see you all last night and all this morning for yesterday afternoon i brought my long business to a head the ship has come home one more dead lift and i shall cease to fetch and carry for the princess ratafia yes ’tis done  i have the order all in ratafia’s hand i carry it on my heart  at the hour of twelve tonight prince featherhead is to be taken in his bed and like the bambino whipped into a chariot and by next morning he will command a most romantic prospect from the donjon of the felsenburg  farewell featherhead  the war goes on the girl is in my hand i have long been indispensable but now i shall be sole  i have long’ he added exultingly ‘long carried this intrigue upon my shoulders like samson with the gates of gaza now i discharge that burthen’  she had sprung to her feet a little paler  ‘is this true’ she cried  ‘i tell you a fact’ he asseverated  ‘the trick is played’  ‘i will never believe it’ she said  ‘an order in her own hand  i will never believe it heinrich’  ‘i swear to you’ said he  ‘o what do you care for oaths—or i either  what would you swear by wine women and song  it is not binding’ she said  she had come quite close up to him and laid her hand upon his arm  ‘as for the order—no heinrich never  i will never believe it  i will die ere i believe it you have some secret purpose—what i cannot guess—but not one word of it is true’  ‘shall i show it you’ he asked  ‘you cannot’ she answered  ‘there is no such thing’  ‘incorrigible sadducee’ he cried  ‘well i will convert you you shall see the order’  he moved to a chair where he had thrown his coat and then drawing forth and holding out a paper ‘read’ said he  she took it greedily and her eye flashed as she perused it  ‘hey’ cried the baron ‘there falls a dynasty and it was i that felled it and i and you inherit’  he seemed to swell in stature and next moment with a laugh he put his hand forward  give me the dagger’ said he  but she whisked the paper suddenly behind her back and faced him lowering  ‘no no’ she said  ‘you and i have first a point to settle do you suppose me blind  she could never have given that paper but to one man and that man her lover  here you stand—her lover her accomplice her master—o i well believe it for i know your power  but what am i’ she cried ‘i whom you deceive’  ‘jealousy’ cried gondremark  ‘anna i would never have believed it but i declare to you by all that’s credible that i am not her lover  i might be i suppose but i never yet durst risk the declaration  the chit is so unreal a mincing doll she will and she will not there is no counting on her by god  and hitherto i have had my own way without and keep the lover in reserve  and i say anna’ he added with severity ‘you must break yourself of this new fit my girl there must be no combustion  i keep the creature under the belief that i adore her and if she caught a breath of you and me she is such a fool prude and dog in the manger that she is capable of spoiling all’  ‘all very fine’ returned the lady  ‘with whom do you pass your days and which am i to believe your words or your actions’  ‘anna the devil take you are you blind’ cried gondremark  ‘you know me  am i likely to care for such a preciosa  ’tis hard that we should have been together for so long and you should still take me for a troubadour  but if there is one thing that i despise and deprecate it is all such figures in berlin wool  give me a human woman—like myself you are my mate you were made for me you amuse me like the play  and what have i to gain that i should pretend to you  if i do not love you what use are you to me  why none  it is as clear as noonday’  ‘do you love me heinrich’ she asked languishing  ‘do you truly’  ‘i tell you’ he cried ‘i love you next after myself  i should be all abroad if i had lost you’  ‘well then’ said she folding up the paper and putting it calmly in her pocket ‘i will believe you and i join the plot  count upon me  at midnight did you say  it is gordon i see that you have charged with it  excellent he will stick at nothing—’  gondremark watched her suspiciously  ‘why do you take the paper’ he demanded  ‘give it here’  ‘no’ she returned ‘i mean to keep it  it is i who must prepare the stroke you cannot manage it without me and to do my best i must possess the paper  where shall i find gordon  in his rooms’  she spoke with a rather feverish selfpossession  ‘anna’ he said sternly the black bilious countenance of his palace rôle taking the place of the more open favour of his hours at home ‘i ask you for that paper  once twice and thrice’  ‘heinrich’ she returned looking him in the face ‘take care  i will put up with no dictation’  both looked dangerous and the silence lasted for a measurable interval of time  then she made haste to have the first word and with a laugh that rang clear and honest ‘do not be a child’ she said  ‘i wonder at you  if your assurances are true you can have no reason to mistrust me nor i to play you false  the difficulty is to get the prince out of the palace without scandal  his valets are devoted his chamberlain a slave and yet one cry might ruin all’  ‘they must be overpowered’ he said following her to the new ground ‘and disappear along with him’  ‘and your whole scheme along with them’ she cried  ‘he does not take his servants when he goes ahunting a child could read the truth  no no the plan is idiotic it must be ratafia’s  but hear me  you know the prince worships me’  ‘i know’ he said  ‘poor featherhead i cross his destiny’  ‘well now’ she continued ‘what if i bring him alone out of the palace to some quiet corner of the park—the flying mercury for instance gordon can be posted in the thicket the carriage wait behind the temple not a cry not a scuffle not a footfall simply the prince vanishes—what do you say  am i an able ally  are my beaux yuex of service  ah heinrich do not lose your anna—she has power’  he struck with his open hand upon the chimney  ‘witch’ he said ‘there is not your match for devilry in europe  service the thing runs on wheels’  ‘kiss me then and let me go  i must not miss my featherhead’ she said  ‘stay stay’ said the baron ‘not so fast  i wish upon my soul that i could trust you but you are out and in so whimsical a devil that i dare not  hang it anna no it’s not possible’  ‘you doubt me heinrich’ she cried  ‘doubt is not the word’ said he  ‘i know you  once you were clear of me with that paper in your pocket who knows what you would do with it—not you at least—nor i  you see’ he added shaking his head paternally upon the countess ‘you are as vicious as a monkey’  ‘i swear to you’ she cried ‘by my salvation    ‘  ‘i have no curiosity to hear you swearing’ said the baron  ‘you think that i have no religion  you suppose me destitute of honour well’ she said ‘see here i will not argue but i tell you once for all leave me this order and the prince shall be arrested—take it from me and as certain as i speak i will upset the coach  trust me or fear me take your choice’  and she offered him the paper  the baron in a great contention of mind stood irresolute weighing the two dangers  once his hand advanced then dropped  ‘well’ he said ‘since trust is what you call it   ’  ‘no more’ she interrupted ‘do not spoil your attitude  and now since you have behaved like a good sort of fellow in the dark i will condescend to tell you why  i go to the palace to arrange with gordon but how is gordon to obey me  and how can i foresee the hours  it may be midnight ay and it may be nightfall all’s a chance and to act i must be free and hold the strings of the adventure  and now’ she cried ‘your vivien goes  dub me your knight’  and she held out her arms and smiled upon him radiant  ‘well’ he said when he had kissed her ‘every man must have his folly i thank god mine is no worse  off with you  i have given a child a squib’    chapter xii—providence von rosen act the second she informs the prince   it was the first impulse of madame von rosen to return to her own villa and revise her toilette  whatever else should come of this adventure it was her firm design to pay a visit to the princess  and before that woman so little beloved the countess would appear at no disadvantage it was the work of minutes  von rosen had the captain’s eye in matters of the toilette she was none of those who hang in fabian helplessness among their finery and after hours come forth upon the world as dowdies  a glance a loosened curl a studied and admired disorder in the hair a bit of lace a touch of colour a yellow rose in the bosom and the instant picture was complete  ‘that will do’ she said  ‘bid my carriage follow me to the palace  in half an hour it should be there in waiting’  the night was beginning to fall and the shops to shine with lamps along the treebeshadowed thoroughfares of otto’s capital when the countess started on her high emprise  she was jocund at heart pleasure and interest had winged her beauty and she knew it  she paused before the glowing jeweller’s she remarked and praised a costume in the milliner’s window and when she reached the limetree walk with its high umbrageous arches and stir of passersby in the dim alleys she took her place upon a bench and began to dally with the pleasures of the hour  it was cold but she did not feel it being warm within her thoughts in that dark corner shone like the gold and rubies at the jewellers her ears which heard the brushing of so many footfalls transposed it into music  what was she to do  she held the paper by which all depended  otto and gondremark and ratafia and the state itself hung light in her balances as light as dust her little finger laid in either scale would set all flying and she hugged herself upon her huge preponderance and then laughed aloud to think how giddily it might be used  the vertigo of omnipotence the disease of cæsars shook her reason  ‘o the mad world’ she thought and laughed aloud in exultation  a child finger in mouth had paused a little way from where she sat and stared with cloudy interest upon this laughing lady  she called it nearer but the child hung back  instantly with that curious passion which you may see any woman in the world display on the most odd occasions for a similar end the countess bent herself with singleness of mind to overcome this diffidence and presently sure enough the child was seated on her knee thumbing and glowering at her watch  ‘if you had a clay bear and a china monkey’ asked von rosen ‘which would you prefer to break’  ‘but i have neither’ said the child  ‘well’ she said ‘here is a bright florin with which you may purchase both the one and the other and i shall give it you at once if you will answer my question  the clay bear or the china monkey—come’  but the unbreeched soothsayer only stared upon the florin with big eyes the oracle could not be persuaded to reply and the countess kissed him lightly gave him the florin set him down upon the path and resumed her way with swinging and elastic gait  ‘which shall i break’ she wondered and she passed her hand with delight among the careful disarrangement of her locks  ‘which’ and she consulted heaven with her bright eyes  ‘do i love both or neither  a little—passionately—not at all  both or neither—both i believe but at least i will make hay of ratafia’  by the time she had passed the iron gates mounted the drive and set her foot upon the broad flagged terrace the night had come completely the palace front was thick with lighted windows and along the balustrade the lamp on every twentieth baluster shone clear  a few withered tracks of sunset amber and glowworm green still lingered in the western sky and she paused once again to watch them fading  ‘and to think’ she said ‘that here am i—destiny embodied a norn a fate a providence—and have no guess upon which side i shall declare myself  what other woman in my place would not be prejudiced and think herself committed  but thank heaven  i was born just’  otto’s windows were bright among the rest and she looked on them with rising tenderness  ‘how does it feel to be deserted’ she thought  ‘poor dear fool  the girl deserves that he should see this order’  without more delay she passed into the palace and asked for an audience of prince otto  the prince she was told was in his own apartment and desired to be private  she sent her name  a man presently returned with word that the prince tendered his apologies but could see no one  ‘then i will write’ she said and scribbled a few lines alleging urgency of life and death  ‘help me my prince’ she added ‘none but you can help me’  this time the messenger returned more speedily and begged the countess to follow him the prince was graciously pleased to receive the frau gräfin von rosen  otto sat by the fire in his large armoury weapons faintly glittering all about him in the changeful light  his face was disfigured by the marks of weeping he looked sour and sad nor did he rise to greet his visitor but bowed and bade the man begone  that kind of general tenderness which served the countess for both heart and conscience sharply smote her at this spectacle of grief and weakness she began immediately to enter into the spirit of her part and as soon as they were alone taking one step forward and with a magnificent gesture—‘up’ she cried  ‘madame von rosen’ replied otto dully ‘you have used strong words  you speak of life and death  pray madam who is threatened  who is there’ he added bitterly ‘so destitute that even otto of grünewald can assist him’  ‘first learn’ said she ‘the names of the conspirators the princess and the baron gondremark  can you not guess the rest’  and then as he maintained his silence—‘you’ she cried pointing at him with her finger ‘’tis you they threaten  your rascal and mine have laid their heads together and condemned you  but they reckoned without you and me  we make a partie carrée prince in love and politics  they lead an ace but we shall trump it  come partner shall i draw my card’  ‘madam’ he said ‘explain yourself  indeed i fail to comprehend’  ‘see then’ said she and handed him the order  he took it looked upon it with a start and then still without speech he put his hand before his face  she waited for a word in vain  ‘what’ she cried ‘do you take the thing downheartedly  as well seek wine in a milkpail as love in that girl’s heart  be done with this and be a man  after the league of the lions let us have a conspiracy of mice and pull this piece of machinery to ground  you were brisk enough last night when nothing was at stake and all was frolic  well here is better sport here is life indeed’  he got to his feet with some alacrity and his face which was a little flushed bore the marks of resolution  ‘madame von rosen’ said he ‘i am neither unconscious nor ungrateful this is the true continuation of your friendship but i see that i must disappoint your expectations  you seem to expect from me some effort of resistance but why should i resist  i have not much to gain and now that i have read this paper and the last of a fool’s paradise is shattered it would be hyperbolical to speak of loss in the same breath with otto of grünewald  i have no party no policy no pride nor anything to be proud of  for what benefit or principle under heaven do you expect me to contend  or would you have me bite and scratch like a trapped weasel  no madam signify to those who sent you my readiness to go  i would at least avoid a scandal’  ‘you go—of your own will you go’ she cried  ‘i cannot say so much perhaps’ he answered ‘but i go with good alacrity  i have desired a change some time behold one offered me shall i refuse  thank god i am not so destitute of humour as to make a tragedy of such a farce’  he flicked the order on the table  ‘you may signify my readiness’ he added grandly  ‘ah’ she said ‘you are more angry than you own’  ‘i madam angry’ he cried  ‘you rave  i have no cause for anger  in every way i have been taught my weakness my instability and my unfitness for the world  i am a plexus of weaknesses an impotent prince a doubtful gentleman and you yourself indulgent as you are have twice reproved my levity  and shall i be angry  i may feel the unkindness but i have sufficient honesty of mind to see the reasons of this coup d’état’  ‘from whom have you got this’ she cried in wonder  ‘you think you have not behaved well  my prince were you not young and handsome i should detest you for your virtues  you push them to the verge of commonplace and this ingratitude—’  ‘understand me madame von rosen’ returned the prince flushing a little darker ‘there can be here no talk of gratitude none of pride  you are here by what circumstance i know not but doubtless led by your kindness mixed up in what regards my family alone  you have no knowledge what my wife your sovereign may have suffered it is not for you—no nor for me—to judge  i own myself in fault and were it otherwise a man were a very empty boaster who should talk of love and start before a small humiliation  it is in all the copybooks that one should die to please his ladylove and shall a man not go to prison’  ‘love  and what has love to do with being sent to gaol’ exclaimed the countess appealing to the walls and roof  ‘heaven knows i think as much of love as any one my life would prove it but i admit no love at least for a man that is not equally returned  the rest is moonshine’  ‘i think of love more absolutely madam though i am certain no more tenderly than a lady to whom i am indebted for such kindnesses’ returned the prince  ‘but this is unavailing  we are not here to hold a court of troubadours’  ‘still’ she replied ‘there is one thing you forget  if she conspires with gondremark against your liberty she may conspire with him against your honour also’  ‘my honour’ he repeated  ‘for a woman you surprise me  if i have failed to gain her love or play my part of husband what right is left me or what honour can remain in such a scene of defeat  no honour that i recognise  i am become a stranger  if my wife no longer loves me i will go to prison since she wills it if she love another where should i be more in place or whose fault is it but mine  you speak madame von rosen like too many women with a man’s tongue  had i myself fallen into temptation as heaven knows i might i should have trembled but still hoped and asked for her forgiveness and yet mine had been a treason in the teeth of love  but let me tell you madam’ he pursued with rising irritation ‘where a husband by futility facility and illtimed humours has outwearied his wife’s patience i will suffer neither man nor woman to misjudge her  she is free the man has been found wanting’  ‘because she loves you not’ the countess cried  ‘you know she is incapable of such a feeling’  ‘rather it was i who was born incapable of inspiring it’ said otto  madame von rosen broke into sudden laughter  ‘fool’ she cried ‘i am in love with you myself’  ‘ah madam you are most compassionate’ the prince retorted smiling ‘but this is waste debate  i know my purpose  perhaps to equal you in frankness i know and embrace my advantage  i am not without the spirit of adventure  i am in a false position—so recognised by public acclamation do you grudge me then my issue’  ‘if your mind is made up why should i dissuade you’ said the countess ‘i own with a bare face i am the gainer  go you take my heart with you or more of it than i desire i shall not sleep at night for thinking of your misery  but do not be afraid i would not spoil you you are such a fool and hero’  ‘alas madam’ cried the prince ‘and your unlucky money  i did amiss to take it but you are a wonderful persuader  and i thank god i can still offer you the fair equivalent’  he took some papers from the chimney ‘here madam are the titledeeds’ he said ‘where i am going they can certainly be of no use to me and i have now no other hope of making up to you your kindness  you made the loan without formality obeying your kind heart  the parts are somewhat changed the sun of this prince of grünewald is upon the point of setting and i know you better than to doubt you will once more waive ceremony and accept the best that he can give you  if i may look for any pleasure in the coming time it will be to remember that the peasant is secure and my most generous friend no loser’  ‘do you not understand my odious position’ cried the countess  ‘dear prince it is upon your fall that i begin my fortune’  ‘it was the more like you to tempt me to resistance’ returned otto ‘but this cannot alter our relations and i must for the last time lay my commands upon you in the character of prince’  and with his loftiest dignity he forced the deeds on her acceptance  ‘i hate the very touch of them’ she cried  there followed upon this a little silence  ‘at what time’ resumed otto ‘if indeed you know am i to be arrested’  ‘your highness when you please’ exclaimed the countess  ‘or if you choose to tear that paper never’  ‘i would rather it were done quickly’ said the prince  ‘i shall take but time to leave a letter for the princess’  ‘well’ said the countess ‘i have advised you to resist at the same time if you intend to be dumb before your shearers i must say that i ought to set about arranging your arrest  i offered’—she hesitated—‘i offered to manage it intending my dear friend—intending upon my soul to be of use to you  well if you will not profit by my goodwill then be of use to me and as soon as ever you feel ready go to the flying mercury where we met last night  it will be none the worse for you and to make it quite plain it will be better for the rest of us’  ‘dear madam certainly’ said otto  ‘if i am prepared for the chief evil i shall not quarrel with details  go then with my best gratitude and when i have written a few lines of leavetaking i shall immediately hasten to keep tryst  tonight i shall not meet so dangerous a cavalier’ he added with a smiling gallantry  as soon as madame von rosen was gone he made a great call upon his selfcommand  he was face to face with a miserable passage where if it were possible he desired to carry himself with dignity  as to the main fact he never swerved or faltered he had come so heartsick and so cruelly humiliated from his talk with gotthold that he embraced the notion of imprisonment with something bordering on relief  here was at least a step which he thought blameless here was a way out of his troubles  he sat down to write to seraphina and his anger blazed  the tale of his forbearances mounted in his eyes to something monstrous still more monstrous the coldness egoism and cruelty that had required and thus requited them  the pen which he had taken shook in his hand he was amazed to find his resignation fled but it was gone beyond his recall  in a few whitehot words he bade adieu dubbing desperation by the name of love and calling his wrath forgiveness then he cast but one look of leavetaking on the place that had been his for so long and was now to be his no longer and hurried forth—love’s prisoner—or pride’s  he took that private passage which he had trodden so often in less momentous hours  the porter let him out and the bountiful cold air of the night and the pure glory of the stars received him on the threshold he looked round him breathing deep of earth’s plain fragrance he looked up into the great array of heaven and was quieted  his little turgid life dwindled to its true proportions and he saw himself that great flamehearted martyr stand like a speck under the cool cupola of the night  thus he felt his careless injuries already soothed the live air of outofdoors the quiet of the world as if by their silent music sobering and dwarfing his emotions  ‘well i forgive her’ he said  ‘if it be of any use to her i forgive’  and with brisk steps he crossed the garden issued upon the park and came to the flying mercury  a dark figure moved forward from the shadow of the pedestal  ‘i have to ask your pardon sir’ a voice observed ‘but if i am right in taking you for the prince i was given to understand that you would be prepared to meet me’  ‘herr gordon i believe’ said otto  ‘herr oberst gordon’ replied that officer  ‘this is rather a ticklish business for a man to be embarked in and to find that all is to go pleasantly is a great relief to me  the carriage is at hand shall i have the honour of following your highness’  ‘colonel’ said the prince ‘i have now come to that happy moment of my life when i have orders to receive but none to give’  ‘a most philosophical remark’ returned the colonel  ‘begad a very pertinent remark it might be plutarch  i am not a drop’s blood to your highness or indeed to any one in this principality or else i should dislike my orders  but as it is and since there is nothing unnatural or unbecoming on my side and your highness takes it in good part i begin to believe we may have a capital time together sir—a capital time  for a gaoler is only a fellowcaptive’  ‘may i inquire herr gordon’ asked otto ‘what led you to accept this dangerous and i would fain hope thankless office’  ‘very natural i am sure’ replied the officer of fortune  ‘my pay is in the meanwhile doubled’  ‘well sir i will not presume to criticise’ returned the prince  ‘and i perceive the carriage’  sure enough at the intersection of two alleys of the park a coach and four conspicuous by its lanterns stood in waiting  and a little way off about a score of lancers were drawn up under the shadow of the trees    chapter xiii—providence von rosen act the third she enlightens seraphina   when madame von rosen left the prince she hurried straight to colonel gordon and not content with directing the arrangements she had herself accompanied the soldier of fortune to the flying mercury  the colonel gave her his arm and the talk between this pair of conspirators ran high and lively  the countess indeed was in a whirl of pleasure and excitement her tongue stumbled upon laughter her eyes shone the colour that was usually wanting now perfected her face  it would have taken little more to bring gordon to her feet—or so at least she believed disdaining the idea  hidden among some lilac bushes she enjoyed the great decorum of the arrest and heard the dialogue of the two men die away along the path soon after the rolling of a carriage and the beat of hoofs arose in the still air of the night and passed speedily farther and fainter into silence  the prince was gone  madame von rosen consulted her watch  she had still she thought time enough for the titbit of her evening and hurrying to the palace winged by the fear of gondremark’s arrival she sent her name and a pressing request for a reception to the princess seraphina  as the countess von rosen unqualified she was sure to be refused but as an emissary of the baron’s for so she chose to style herself she gained immediate entry  the princess sat alone at table making a feint of dining  her cheeks were mottled her eyes heavy she had neither slept nor eaten even her dress had been neglected  in short she was out of health out of looks out of heart and hagridden by her conscience  the countess drew a swift comparison and shone brighter in beauty  ‘you come madam de la part de monsieur le baron’ drawled the princess  ‘be seated  what have you to say’  ‘to say’ repeated madame von rosen ‘o much to say  much to say that i would rather not and much to leave unsaid that i would rather say  for i am like st paul your highness and always wish to do the things i should not  well to be categorical—that is the word—i took the prince your order  he could not credit his senses  “ah” he cried “dear madame von rosen it is not possible—it cannot be i must hear it from your lips my wife is a poor girl misled she is only silly she is not cruel” “mon prince” said i “a girl—and therefore cruel youth kills flies”—he had such pain to understand it’  ‘madame von rosen’ said the princess in most steadfast tones but with a rose of anger in her face ‘who sent you here and for what purpose tell your errand’  ‘o madam i believe you understand me very well’ returned von rosen ‘i have not your philosophy  i wear my heart upon my sleeve excuse the indecency  it is a very little one’ she laughed ‘and i so often change the sleeve’  ‘am i to understand the prince has been arrested’ asked the princess rising  ‘while you sat there dining’ cried the countess still nonchalantly seated  ‘you have discharged your errand’ was the reply ‘i will not detain you’  ‘o no madam’ said the countess ‘with your permission i have not yet done  i have borne much this evening in your service  i have suffered i was made to suffer in your service’  she unfolded her fan as she spoke  quick as her pulses beat the fan waved languidly  she betrayed her emotion only by the brightness of her eyes and face and by the almost insolent triumph with which she looked down upon the princess there were old scores of rivalry between them in more than one field so at least von rosen felt and now she was to have her hour of victory in them all  ‘you are no servant madame von rosen of mine’ said seraphina  ‘no madam indeed’ returned the countess ‘but we both serve the same person as you know—or if you do not then i have the pleasure of informing you  your conduct is so light—so light’ she repeated the fan wavering higher like a butterfly ‘that perhaps you do not truly understand’  the countess rolled her fan together laid it in her lap and rose to a less languorous position  ‘indeed’ she continued ‘i should be sorry to see any young woman in your situation  you began with every advantage—birth a suitable marriage—quite pretty too—and see what you have come to  my poor girl to think of it  but there is nothing that does so much harm’ observed the countess finely ‘as giddiness of mind’  and she once more unfurled the fan and approvingly fanned herself  ‘i will no longer permit you to forget yourself’ cried seraphina  ‘i think you are mad’  ‘not mad’ returned von rosen  ‘sane enough to know you dare not break with me tonight and to profit by the knowledge  i left my poor pretty prince charming crying his eyes out for a wooden doll  my heart is soft i love my pretty prince you will never understand it but i long to give my prince his doll dry his poor eyes and send him off happy  o you immature fool’ the countess cried rising to her feet and pointing at the princess the closed fan that now began to tremble in her hand  ‘o wooden doll’ she cried ‘have you a heart or blood of any nature this is a man child—a man who loves you  o it will not happen twice it is not common beautiful and clever women look in vain for it  and you you pitiful schoolgirl tread this jewel under foot you stupid with your vanity  before you try to govern kingdoms you should first be able to behave yourself at home home is the woman’s kingdom’  she paused and laughed a little strangely to hear and look upon  ‘i will tell you one of the things’ she said ‘that were to stay unspoken  von rosen is a better women than you my princess though you will never have the pain of understanding it and when i took the prince your order and looked upon his face my soul was melted—o i am frank—here within my arms i offered him repose’  she advanced a step superbly as she spoke with outstretched arms and seraphina shrank  ‘do not be alarmed’ the countess cried ‘i am not offering that hermitage to you in all the world there is but one who wants to and him you have dismissed  “if it will give her pleasure i should wear the martyr’s crown” he cried “i will embrace the thorns”  i tell you—i am quite frank—i put the order in his power and begged him to resist  you who have betrayed your husband may betray me to gondremark my prince would betray no one  understand it plainly’ she cried ‘’tis of his pure forbearance that you sit there he had the power—i gave it him—to change the parts and he refused and went to prison in your place’  the princess spoke with some distress  ‘your violence shocks me and pains me’ she began ‘but i cannot be angry with what at least does honour to the mistaken kindness of your heart it was right for me to know this  i will condescend to tell you  it was with deep regret that i was driven to this step  i admire in many ways the prince—i admit his amiability  it was our great misfortune it was perhaps somewhat of my fault that we were so unsuited to each other but i have a regard a sincere regard for all his qualities  as a private person i should think as you do  it is difficult i know to make allowances for state considerations  i have only with deep reluctance obeyed the call of a superior duty and so soon as i dare do it for the safety of the state i promise you the prince shall be released  many in my situation would have resented your freedoms  i am not’—and she looked for a moment rather piteously upon the countess—‘i am not altogether so inhuman as you think’  ‘and you can put these troubles of the state’ the countess cried ‘to weigh with a man’s love’  ‘madame von rosen these troubles are affairs of life and death to many to the prince and perhaps even to yourself among the number’ replied the princess with dignity  ‘i have learned madam although still so young in a hard school that my own feelings must everywhere come last’  ‘o callow innocence’ exclaimed the other  ‘is it possible you do not know or do not suspect the intrigue in which you move  i find it in my heart to pity you  we are both women after all—poor girl poor girl—and who is born a woman is born a fool  and though i hate all women—come for the common folly i forgive you  your highness’—she dropped a deep stage curtsey and resumed her fan—‘i am going to insult you to betray one who is called my lover and if it pleases you to use the power i now put unreservedly into your hands to ruin my dear self  o what a french comedy  you betray i betray they betray  it is now my cue  the letter yes  behold the letter madam its seal unbroken as i found it by my bed this morning for i was out of humour and i get many too many of these favours  for your own sake for the sake of my prince charming for the sake of this great principality that sits so heavy on your conscience open it and read’  ‘am i to understand’ inquired the princess ‘that this letter in any way regards me’  ‘you see i have not opened it’ replied von rosen ‘but ’tis mine and i beg you to experiment’  ‘i cannot look at it till you have’ returned seraphina very seriously ‘there may be matter there not meant for me to see it is a private letter’  the countess tore it open glanced it through and tossed it back and the princess taking up the sheet recognised the hand of gondremark and read with a sickening shock the following lines—      ‘dearest anna come at once  ratafia has done the deed her husband     is to be packed to prison  this puts the minx entirely in my power     le tour est joué she will now go steady in harness or i will know     the reason why  come                                                                  heinrich’  ‘command yourself madam’ said the countess watching with some alarm the white face of seraphina  ‘it is in vain for you to fight with gondremark he has more strings than mere court favour and could bring you down tomorrow with a word  i would not have betrayed him otherwise but heinrich is a man and plays with all of you like marionnettes  and now at least you see for what you sacrificed my prince  madam will you take some wine  i have been cruel’  ‘not cruel madam—salutary’ said seraphina with a phantom smile  ‘no i thank you i require no attentions  the first surprise affected me will you give me time a little  i must think’  she took her head between her hands and contemplated for a while the hurricane confusion of her thoughts  ‘this information reaches me’ she said ‘when i have need of it  i would not do as you have done but yet i thank you  i have been much deceived in baron gondremark’  ‘o madam leave gondremark and think upon the prince’ cried von rosen  ‘you speak once more as a private person’ said the princess ‘nor do i blame you  but my own thoughts are more distracted  however as i believe you are truly a friend to my—to the—as i believe’ she said ‘you are a friend to otto i shall put the order for his release into your hands this moment  give me the inkdish  there’  and she wrote hastily steadying her arm upon the table for she trembled like a reed ‘remember madam’ she resumed handing her the order ‘this must not be used nor spoken of at present till i have seen the baron any hurried step—i lose myself in thinking  the suddenness has shaken me’  ‘i promise you i will not use it’ said the countess ‘till you give me leave although i wish the prince could be informed of it to comfort his poor heart  and o i had forgotten he has left a letter  suffer me madam i will bring it you  this is the door i think’  and she sought to open it  ‘the bolt is pushed’ said seraphina flushing  ‘o  o’ cried the countess  a silence fell between them  ‘i will get it for myself’ said seraphina ‘and in the meanwhile i beg you to leave me  i thank you i am sure but i shall be obliged if you will leave me’  the countess deeply curtseyed and withdrew    chapter xiv—relates the cause and outbreak of the revolution   brave as she was and brave by intellect the princess when first she was alone clung to the table for support  the four corners of her universe had fallen  she had never liked nor trusted gondremark completely she had still held it possible to find him false to friendship but from that to finding him devoid of all those public virtues for which she had honoured him a mere commonplace intriguer using her for his own ends the step was wide and the descent giddy light and darkness succeeded each other in her brain now she believed and now she could not  she turned blindly groping for the note  but von rosen who had not forgotten to take the warrant from the prince had remembered to recover her note from the princess von rosen was an old campaigner whose most violent emotion aroused rather than clouded the vigour of her reason  the thought recalled to seraphina the remembrance of the other letter—otto’s  she rose and went speedily her brain still wheeling and burst into the prince’s armoury  the old chamberlain was there in waiting and the sight of another face prying or so she felt on her distress struck seraphina into childish anger  ‘go’ she cried and then when the old man was already halfway to the door ‘stay’ she added  ‘as soon as baron gondremark arrives let him attend me here’  ‘it shall be so directed’ said the chamberlain  ‘there was a letter    ’ she began and paused  ‘her highness’ said the chamberlain ‘will find a letter on the table i had received no orders or her highness had been spared this trouble’  ‘no no no’ she cried  ‘i thank you  i desire to be alone’  and then when he was gone she leaped upon the letter  her mind was still obscured like the moon upon a night of clouds and wind her reason shone and was darkened and she read the words by flashes      ‘seraphina’ the prince wrote ‘i will write no syllable of reproach     i have seen your order and i go  what else is left me  i have     wasted my love and have no more  to say that i forgive you is not     needful at least we are now separate for ever by your own act you     free me from my willing bondage i go free to prison  this is the     last that you will hear of me in love or anger  i have gone out of     your life you may breathe easy you have now rid yourself of the     husband who allowed you to desert him of the prince who gave you his     rights and of the married lover who made it his pride to defend you     in your absence  how you have requited him your own heart more     loudly tells you than my words  there is a day coming when your vain     dreams will roll away like clouds and you will find yourself alone     then you will remember                                                                      otto’  she read with a great horror on her mind that day of which he wrote was come  she was alone she had been false she had been cruel remorse rolled in upon her and then with a more piercing note vanity bounded on the stage of consciousness  she a dupe she helpless she to have betrayed herself in seeking to betray her husband she to have lived these years upon flattery grossly swallowing the bolus like a clown with sharpers she—seraphina  her swift mind drank the consequences she foresaw the coming fall her public shame she saw the odium disgrace and folly of her story flaunt through europe  she recalled the scandal she had so royally braved and alas she had now no courage to confront it with  to be thought the mistress of that man perhaps for that    she closed her eyes on agonising vistas  swift as thought she had snatched a bright dagger from the weapons that shone along the wall  ay she would escape  from that worldwide theatre of nodding heads and buzzing whisperers in which she now beheld herself unpitiably martyred one door stood open  at any cost through any stress of suffering that greasy laughter should be stifled  she closed her eyes breathed a wordless prayer and pressed the weapon to her bosom  at the astonishing sharpness of the prick she gave a cry and awoke to a sense of undeserved escape  a little ruby spot of blood was the reward of that great act of desperation but the pain had braced her like a tonic and her whole design of suicide had passed away  at the same instant regular feet drew near along the gallery and she knew the tread of the big baron so often gladly welcome and even now rallying her spirits like a call to battle  she concealed the dagger in the folds of her skirt and drawing her stature up she stood firmfooted radiant with anger waiting for the foe  the baron was announced and entered  to him seraphina was a hated task like the schoolboy with his virgil he had neither will nor leisure to remark her beauties but when he now beheld her standing illuminated by her passion new feelings flashed upon him a frank admiration a brief sparkle of desire  he noted both with joy they were means  ‘if i have to play the lover’ thought he for that was his constant preoccupation ‘i believe i can put soul into it’  meanwhile with his usual ponderous grace he bent before the lady  ‘i propose’ she said in a strange voice not known to her till then ‘that we release the prince and do not prosecute the war’  ‘ah madam’ he replied ‘’tis as i knew it would be  your heart i knew would wound you when we came to this distasteful but most necessary step  ah madam believe me i am not unworthy to be your ally i know you have qualities to which i am a stranger and count them the best weapons in the armoury of our alliance—the girl in the queen—pity love tenderness laughter the smile that can reward  i can only command i am the frowner  but you  and you have the fortitude to command these comely weaknesses to tread them down at the call of reason  how often have i not admired it even to yourself  ay even to yourself’ he added tenderly dwelling it seemed in memory on hours of more private admiration  ‘but now madam—’  ‘but now herr von gondremark the time for these declarations has gone by’ she cried  ‘are you true to me are you false  look in your heart and answer it is your heart i want to know’  ‘it has come’ thought gondremark  ‘you madam’ he cried starting back—with fear you would have said and yet a timid joy  ‘you yourself you bid me look into my heart’  ‘do you suppose i fear’ she cried and looked at him with such a heightened colour such bright eyes and a smile of so abstruse a meaning that the baron discarded his last doubt  ‘ah madam’ he cried plumping on his knees  ‘seraphina  do you permit me have you divined my secret  it is true—i put my life with joy into your power—i love you love with ardour as an equal as a mistress as a brotherinarms as an adored desired sweethearted woman  o bride’ he cried waxing dithyrambic ‘bride of my reason and my senses have pity have pity on my love’  she heard him with wonder rage and then contempt  his words offended her to sickness his appearance as he grovelled bulkily upon the floor moved her to such laughter as we laugh in nightmares  ‘o shame’ she cried  ‘absurd and odious  what would the countess say’  that great baron gondremark the excellent politician remained for some little time upon his knees in a frame of mind which perhaps we are allowed to pity  his vanity within his iron bosom bled and raved  if he could have blotted all if he could have withdrawn part if he had not called her bride—with a roaring in his ears he thus regretfully reviewed his declaration  he got to his feet tottering and then in that first moment when a dumb agony finds a vent in words and the tongue betrays the inmost and worst of a man he permitted himself a retort which for six weeks to follow he was to repent at leisure  ‘ah’ said he ‘the countess  now i perceive the reason of your highness’s disorder’  the lackeylike insolence of the words was driven home by a more insolent manner  there fell upon seraphina one of those stormclouds which had already blackened upon her reason she heard herself cry out and when the cloud dispersed flung the bloodstained dagger on the floor and saw gondremark reeling back with open mouth and clapping his hand upon the wound  the next moment with oaths that she had never heard he leaped at her in savage passion clutched her as she recoiled and in the very act stumbled and drooped  she had scarce time to fear his murderous onslaught ere he fell before her feet  he rose upon one elbow she still staring upon him white with horror  ‘anna’ he cried ‘anna  help’  and then his utterance failed him and he fell back to all appearance dead  seraphina ran to and fro in the room she wrung her hands and cried aloud within she was all one uproar of terror and conscious of no articulate wish but to awake  there came a knocking at the door and she sprang to it and held it panting like a beast and with the strength of madness in her arms till she had pushed the bolt  at this success a certain calm fell upon her reason  she went back and looked upon her victim the knocking growing louder  o yes he was dead  she had killed him  he had called upon von rosen with his latest breath ah who would call on seraphina  she had killed him  she whose irresolute hand could scarce prick blood from her own bosom had found strength to cast down that great colossus at a blow  all this while the knocking was growing more uproarious and more unlike the staid career of life in such a palace  scandal was at the door with what a fatal following she dreaded to conceive and at the same time among the voices that now began to summon her by name she recognised the chancellor’s  he or another somebody must be the first  ‘is herr von greisengesang without’ she called  ‘your highness—yes’ the old gentleman answered  ‘we have heard cries a fall  is anything amiss’  ‘nothing’ replied seraphina ‘i desire to speak with you  send off the rest’  she panted between each phrase but her mind was clear  she let the looped curtain down upon both sides before she drew the bolt and thus secure from any sudden eyeshot from without admitted the obsequious chancellor and again made fast the door  greisengesang clumsily revolved among the wings of the curtain so that she was clear of it as soon as he  ‘my god’ he cried ‘the baron’  ‘i have killed him’ she said  ‘o killed him’  ‘dear me’ said the old gentleman ‘this is most unprecedented  lovers’ quarrels’ he added ruefully ‘redintegratio—’ and then paused  ‘but my dear madam’ he broke out again ‘in the name of all that is practical what are we to do  this is exceedingly grave morally madam it is appalling  i take the liberty your highness for one moment of addressing you as a daughter a loved although respected daughter and i must say that i cannot conceal from you that this is morally most questionable  and o dear me we have a dead body’  she had watched him closely hope fell to contempt she drew away her skirts from his weakness and in the act her own strength returned to her  ‘see if he be dead’ she said not one word of explanation or defence she had scorned to justify herself before so poor a creature ‘see if he be dead’ was all  with the greatest compunction the chancellor drew near and as he did so the wounded baron rolled his eyes  ‘he lives’ cried the old courtier turning effusively to seraphina ‘madam he still lives’  ‘help him then’ returned the princess standing fixed  ‘bind up his wound’  ‘madam i have no means’ protested the chancellor  ‘can you not take your handkerchief your neckcloth anything’ she cried and at the same moment from her light muslin gown she rent off a flounce and tossed it on the floor  ‘take that’ she said and for the first time directly faced greisengesang  but the chancellor held up his hands and turned away his head in agony the grasp of the falling baron had torn down the dainty fabric of the bodice and—‘o highness’ cried greisengesang appalled ‘the terrible disorder of your toilette’  ‘take up that flounce’ she said ‘the man may die’  greisengesang turned in a flutter to the baron and attempted some innocent and bungling measures  ‘he still breathes’ he kept saying ‘all is not yet over he is not yet gone’  ‘and now’ said she ‘if that is all you can do begone and get some porters he must instantly go home’  ‘madam’ cried the chancellor ‘if this most melancholy sight were seen in town—o dear the state would fall’ he piped  ‘there is a litter in the palace’ she replied  ‘it is your part to see him safe  i lay commands upon you  on your life it stands’  ‘i see it dear highness’ he jerked  ‘clearly i see it  but how what men  the prince’s servants—yes  they had a personal affection  they will be true if any’  ‘o not them’ she cried  ‘take sabra my own man’  ‘sabra  the grandmason’ returned the chancellor aghast  ‘if he but saw this he would sound the tocsin—we should all be butchered’  she measured the depth of her abasement steadily  ‘take whom you must’ she said ‘and bring the litter here’  once she was alone she ran to the baron and with a sickening heart sought to allay the flux of blood  the touch of the skin of that great charlatan revolted her to the toes the wound in her ignorant eyes looked deathly yet she contended with her shuddering and with more skill at least than the chancellor’s staunched the welling injury  an eye unprejudiced with hate would have admired the baron in his swoon he looked so great and shapely it was so powerful a machine that lay arrested and his features cleared for the moment both of temper and dissimulation were seen to be so purely modelled  but it was not thus with seraphina  her victim as he lay outspread twitching a little his big chest unbared fixed her with his ugliness and her mind flitted for a glimpse to otto  rumours began to sound about the palace of feet running and of voices raised the echoes of the great arched staircase were voluble of some confusion and then the gallery jarred with a quick and heavy tramp  it was the chancellor followed by four of otto’s valets and a litter  the servants when they were admitted stared at the dishevelled princess and the wounded man speech was denied them but their thoughts were riddled with profanity  gondremark was bundled in the curtains of the litter were lowered the bearers carried it forth and the chancellor followed behind with a white face  seraphina ran to the window  pressing her face upon the pane she could see the terrace where the lights contended thence the avenue of lamps that joined the palace and town and overhead the hollow night and the larger stars  presently the small procession issued from the palace crossed the parade and began to thread the glittering alley the swinging couch with its four porters the muchpondering chancellor behind  she watched them dwindle with strange thoughts her eyes fixed upon the scene her mind still glancing right and left on the overthrow of her life and hopes  there was no one left in whom she might confide none whose hand was friendly or on whom she dared to reckon for the barest loyalty  with the fall of gondremark her party her brief popularity had fallen  so she sat crouched upon the windowseat her brow to the cool pane her dress in tatters barely shielding her her mind revolving bitter thoughts  meanwhile consequences were fast mounting and in the deceptive quiet of the night downfall and red revolt were brewing  the litter had passed forth between the iron gates and entered on the streets of the town  by what flying panic by what thrill of air communicated who shall say but the passing bustle in the palace had already reached and reechoed in the region of the burghers  rumour with her loud whisper hissed about the town men left their homes without knowing why knots formed along the boulevard under the rare lamps and the great limes the crowd grew blacker  and now through the midst of that expectant company the unusual sight of a closed litter was observed approaching and trotting hard behind it that great dignitary cancellarius greisengesang  silence looked on as it went by and as soon as it was passed the whispering seethed over like a boiling pot  the knots were sundered and gradually one following another the whole mob began to form into a procession and escort the curtained litter  soon spokesmen a little bolder than their mates began to ply the chancellor with questions  never had he more need of that great art of falsehood by whose exercise he had so richly lived and yet now he stumbled the master passion fear betraying him  he was pressed he became incoherent and then from the jolting litter came a groan  in the instant hubbub and the gathering of the crowd as to a natural signal the cleareyed quavering chancellor heard the catch of the clock before it strikes the hour of doom and for ten seconds he forgot himself  this shall atone for many sins  he plucked a bearer by the sleeve  ‘bid the princess flee  all is lost’ he whispered  and the next moment he was babbling for his life among the multitude  five minutes later the wildeyed servant burst into the armoury  ‘all is lost’ he cried  ‘the chancellor bids you flee’  and at the same time looking through the window seraphina saw the black rush of the populace begin to invade the lamplit avenue  ‘thank you georg’ she said  ‘i thank you  go’  and as the man still lingered ‘i bid you go’ she added  ‘save yourself’  down by the private passage and just some two hours later amalia seraphina the last princess followed otto johann friedrich the last prince of grünewald     book iii—fortunate misfortune   chapter i—princess cinderella   the porter drawn by the growing turmoil had vanished from the postern and the door stood open on the darkness of the night  as seraphina fled up the terraces the cries and loud footing of the mob drew nearer the doomed palace the rush was like the rush of cavalry the sound of shattering lamps tingled above the rest and overtowering all she heard her own name bandied among the shouters  a bugle sounded at the door of the guardroom one gun was fired and then with the yell of hundreds mittwalden palace was carried at a rush  sped by these dire sounds and voices the princess scaled the long garden skimming like a bird the starlit stairways crossed the park which was in that place narrow and plunged upon the farther side into the rude shelter of the forest  so at a bound she left the discretion and the cheerful lamps of palace evenings ceased utterly to be a sovereign lady and falling from the whole height of civilisation ran forth into the woods a ragged cinderella  she went direct before her through an open tract of the forest full of brush and birches and where the starlight guided her and beyond that again must thread the columned blackness of a pine grove joining overhead the thatch of its long branches  at that hour the place was breathless a horror of night like a presence occupied that dungeon of the wood and she went groping knocking against the boles—her ear betweenwhiles strained to aching and yet unrewarded  but the slope of the ground was upward and encouraged her and presently she issued on a rocky hill that stood forth above the sea of forest  all around were other hilltops big and little sable vales of forest between overhead the open heaven and the brilliancy of countless stars and along the western sky the dim forms of mountains  the glory of the great night laid hold upon her her eyes shone with stars she dipped her sight into the coolness and brightness of the sky as she might have dipped her wrist into a spring and her heart at that ethereal shock began to move more soberly  the sun that sails overhead ploughing into gold the fields of daylight azure and uttering the signal to man’s myriads has no word apart for man the individual and the moon like a violin only praises and laments our private destiny  the stars alone cheerful whisperers confer quietly with each of us like friends they give ear to our sorrows smilingly like wise old men rich in tolerance and by their double scale so small to the eye so vast to the imagination they keep before the mind the double character of man’s nature and fate  there sat the princess beautifully looking upon beauty in council with these glad advisers  bright like pictures clear like a voice in the porches of her ear memory reenacted the tumult of the evening the countess and the dancing fan the big baron on his knees the blood on the polished floor the knocking the swing of the litter down the avenue of lamps the messenger the cries of the charging mob and yet all were far away and phantasmal and she was still healingly conscious of the peace and glory of the night  she looked towards mittwalden and above the hilltop which already hid it from her view a throbbing redness hinted of fire  better so better so that she should fall with tragic greatness lit by a blazing palace  she felt not a trace of pity for gondremark or of concern for grünewald that period of her life was closed for ever a wrench of wounded vanity alone surviving  she had but one clear idea to flee—and another obscure and halfrejected although still obeyed to flee in the direction of the felsenburg  she had a duty to perform she must free otto—so her mind said very coldly but her heart embraced the notion of that duty even with ardour and her hands began to yearn for the grasp of kindness  she rose with a start of recollection and plunged down the slope into the covert  the woods received and closed upon her  once more she wandered and hasted in a blot uncheered unpiloted  here and there indeed through rents in the woodroof a glimmer attracted her here and there a tree stood out among its neighbours by some force of outline here and there a brushing among the leaves a notable blackness a dim shine relieved only to exaggerate the solid oppression of the night and silence  and betweenwhiles the unfeatured darkness would redouble and the whole ear of night appear to be gloating on her steps  now she would stand still and the silence would grow and grow till it weighed upon her breathing and then she would address herself again to run stumbling falling and still hurrying the more  and presently the whole wood rocked and began to run along with her  the noise of her own mad passage through the silence spread and echoed and filled the night with terror  panic hunted her panic from the trees reached forth with clutching branches the darkness was lit up and peopled with strange forms and faces  she strangled and fled before her fears  and yet in the last fortress reason blown upon by these gusts of terror still shone with a troubled light  she knew yet could not act upon her knowledge she knew that she must stop and yet she still ran  she was already near madness when she broke suddenly into a narrow clearing  at the same time the din grew louder and she became conscious of vague forms and fields of whiteness  and with that the earth gave way she fell and found her feet again with an incredible shock to her senses and her mind was swallowed up  when she came again to herself she was standing to the midleg in an icy eddy of a brook and leaning with one hand on the rock from which it poured  the spray had wet her hair  she saw the white cascade the stars wavering in the shaken pool foam flitting and high overhead the tall pines on either hand serenely drinking starshine and in the sudden quiet of her spirit she heard with joy the firm plunge of the cataract in the pool  she scrambled forth dripping  in the face of her proved weakness to adventure again upon the horror of blackness in the groves were a suicide of life or reason  but here in the alley of the brook with the kind stars above her and the moon presently swimming into sight she could await the coming of day without alarm  this lane of pinetrees ran very rapidly downhill and wound among the woods but it was a wider thoroughfare than the brook needed and here and there were little dimpling lawns and coves of the forest where the starshine slumbered  such a lawn she paced taking patience bravely and now she looked up the hill and saw the brook coming down to her in a series of cascades and now approached the margin where it welled among the rushes silently and now gazed at the great company of heaven with an enduring wonder  the early evening had fallen chill but the night was now temperate out of the recesses of the wood there came mild airs as from a deep and peaceful breathing and the dew was heavy on the grass and the tightshut daisies  this was the girl’s first night under the naked heaven and now that her fears were overpast she was touched to the soul by its serene amenity and peace  kindly the host of heaven blinked down upon that wandering princess and the honest brook had no words but to encourage her  at last she began to be aware of a wonderful revolution compared to which the fire of mittwalden palace was but the crack and flash of a percussioncap  the countenance with which the pines regarded her began insensibly to change the grass too short as it was and the whole winding staircase of the brook’s course began to wear a solemn freshness of appearance  and this slow transfiguration reached her heart and played upon it and transpierced it with a serious thrill  she looked all about the whole face of nature looked back brimful of meaning finger on lip leaking its glad secret  she looked up  heaven was almost emptied of stars  such as still lingered shone with a changed and waning brightness and began to faint in their stations  and the colour of the sky itself was the most wonderful for the rich blue of the night had now melted and softened and brightened and there had succeeded in its place a hue that has no name and that is never seen but as the herald of morning  ‘o’ she cried joy catching at her voice ‘o it is the dawn’  in a breath she passed over the brook and looped up her skirts and fairly ran in the dim alleys  as she ran her ears were aware of many pipings more beautiful than music in the small dishshaped houses in the fork of giant arms where they had lain all night lover by lover warmly pressed the brighteyed bighearted singers began to awaken for the day  her heart melted and flowed forth to them in kindness  and they from their small and high perches in the clerestories of the wood cathedral peered down sidelong at the ragged princess as she flitted below them on the carpet of the moss and tassel  soon she had struggled to a certain hilltop and saw far before her the silent inflooding of the day  out of the east it welled and whitened the darkness trembled into light and the stars were extinguished like the streetlamps of a human city  the whiteness brightened into silver the silver warmed into gold the gold kindled into pure and living fire and the face of the east was barred with elemental scarlet  the day drew its first long breath steady and chill and for leagues around the woods sighed and shivered  and then at one bound the sun had floated up and her startled eyes received day’s first arrow and quailed under the buffet  on every side the shadows leaped from their ambush and fell prone  the day was come plain and garish and up the steep and solitary eastern heaven the sun victorious over his competitors continued slowly and royally to mount  seraphina drooped for a little leaning on a pine the shrill joy of the woodlands mocking her  the shelter of the night the thrilling and joyous changes of the dawn were over and now in the hot eye of the day she turned uneasily and looked sighingly about her  some way off among the lower woods a pillar of smoke was mounting and melting in the gold and blue  there surely enough were human folk the hearthsurrounders  man’s fingers had laid the twigs it was man’s breath that had quickened and encouraged the baby flames and now as the fire caught it would be playing ruddily on the face of its creator  at the thought she felt acold and little and lost in that great outofdoors  the electric shock of the young sunbeams and the unhuman beauty of the woods began to irk and daunt her  the covert of the house the decent privacy of rooms the swept and regulated fire all that denotes or beautifies the home life of man began to draw her as with cords  the pillar of smoke was now risen into some stream of moving air it began to lean out sideways in a pennon and thereupon as though the change had been a summons seraphina plunged once more into the labyrinth of the wood  she left day upon the high ground  in the lower groves there still lingered the blue early twilight and the seizing freshness of the dew but here and there above this field of shadow the head of a great outspread pine was already glorious with day and here and there through the breaches of the hills the sunbeams made a great and luminous entry here seraphina hastened along forest paths  she had lost sight of the pilot smoke which blew another way and conducted herself in that great wilderness by the direction of the sun  but presently fresh signs bespoke the neighbourhood of man felled trunks white slivers from the axe bundles of green boughs and stacks of firewood  these guided her forward until she came forth at last upon the clearing whence the smoke arose  a hut stood in the clear shadow hard by a brook which made a series of inconsiderable falls and on the threshold the princess saw a sunburnt and hardfeatured woodman standing with his hands behind his back and gazing skyward  she went to him directly a beautiful brighteyed and haggard vision splendidly arrayed and pitifully tattered the diamond eardrops still glittering in her ears and with the movement of her coming one small breast showing and hiding among the ragged covert of the laces  at that ambiguous hour and coming as she did from the great silence of the forest the man drew back from the princess as from something elfin  ‘i am cold’ she said ‘and weary  let me rest beside your fire’  the woodman was visibly commoved but answered nothing  ‘i will pay’ she said and then repented of the words catching perhaps a spark of terror from his frightened eyes  but as usual her courage rekindled brighter for the check  she put him from the door and entered and he followed her in superstitious wonder  within the hut was rough and dark but on the stone that served as hearth twigs and a few dry branches burned with the brisk sounds and all the variable beauty of fire  the very sight of it composed her she crouched hard by on the earth floor and shivered in the glow and looked upon the eating blaze with admiration  the woodman was still staring at his guest at the wreck of the rich dress the bare arms the bedraggled laces and the gems  he found no word to utter  ‘give me food’ said she—‘here by the fire’  he set down a pitcher of coarse wine bread a piece of cheese and a handful of raw onions  the bread was hard and sour the cheese like leather even the onion which ranks with the truffle and the nectarine in the chief place of honour of earth’s fruits is not perhaps a dish for princesses when raw  but she ate if not with appetite with courage and when she had eaten did not disdain the pitcher  in all her life before she had not tasted of gross food nor drunk after another but a brave woman far more readily accepts a change of circumstances than the bravest man  all that while the woodman continued to observe her furtively many low thoughts of fear and greed contending in his eyes she read them clearly and she knew she must begone  presently she arose and offered him a florin  ‘will that repay you’ she asked  but here the man found his tongue  ‘i must have more than that’ said he  ‘it is all i have to give you’ she returned and passed him by serenely  yet her heart trembled for she saw his hand stretched forth as if to arrest her and his unsteady eyes wandering to his axe  a beaten path led westward from the clearing and she swiftly followed it  she did not glance behind her  but as soon as the least turning of the path had concealed her from the woodman’s eyes she slipped among the trees and ran till she deemed herself in safety  by this time the strong sunshine pierced in a thousand places the pinethatch of the forest fired the red boles irradiated the cool aisles of shadow and burned in jewels on the grass  the gum of these trees was dearer to the senses than the gums of araby each pine in the lusty morning sunlight burned its own woodincense and now and then a breeze would rise and toss these rooted censers and send shade and sungem flitting swift as swallows thick as bees and wake a brushing bustle of sounds that murmured and went by  on she passed and up and down in sun and shadow now aloft on the bare ridge among the rocks and birches with the lizards and the snakes and anon in the deep grove among sunless pillars  now she followed wandering woodpaths in the maze of valleys and again from a hilltop beheld the distant mountains and the great birds circling under the sky  she would see afar off a nestling hamlet and go round to avoid it  below she traced the course of the foam of mountain torrents  nearer hand she saw where the tender springs welled up in silence or oozed in green moss or in the more favoured hollows a whole family of infant rivers would combine and tinkle in the stones and lie in pools to be a bathingplace for sparrows or fall from the sheer rock in rods of crystal  upon all these things as she still sped along in the bright air she looked with a rapture of surprise and a joyful fainting of the heart they seemed so novel they touched so strangely home they were so hued and scented they were so beset and canopied by the dome of the blue air of heaven  at length when she was well weary she came upon a wide and shallow pool  stones stood in it like islands bulrushes fringed the coast the floor was paved with the pine needles and the pines themselves whose roots made promontories looked down silently on their green images  she crept to the margin and beheld herself with wonder a hollow and brighteyed phantom in the ruins of her palace robe  the breeze now shook her image now it would be marred with flies and at that she smiled and from the fading circles her counterpart smiled back to her and looked kind  she sat long in the warm sun and pitied her bare arms that were all bruised and marred with falling and marvelled to see that she was dirty and could not grow to believe that she had gone so long in such a strange disorder  then with a sigh she addressed herself to make a toilette by that forest mirror washed herself pure from all the stains of her adventure took off her jewels and wrapped them in her handkerchief rearranged the tatters of her dress and took down the folds of her hair  she shook it round her face and the pool repeated her thus veiled  her hair had smelt like violets she remembered otto saying and so now she tried to smell it and then shook her head and laughed a little sadly to herself  the laugh was returned upon her in a childish echo  she looked up and lo two children looking on—a small girl and a yet smaller boy standing like playthings by the pool below a spreading pine  seraphina was not fond of children and now she was startled to the heart  ‘who are you’ she cried hoarsely  the mites huddled together and drew back and seraphina’s heart reproached her that she should have frightened things so quaint and little and yet alive with senses  she thought upon the birds and looked again at her two visitors so little larger and so far more innocent  on their clear faces as in a pool she saw the reflection of their fears with gracious purpose she arose  ‘come’ she said ‘do not be afraid of me’ and took a step towards them  but alas at the first moment the two poor babes in the wood turned and ran helterskelter from the princess  the most desolate pang was struck into the girl’s heart  here she was twentytwo—soon twentythree—and not a creature loved her none but otto and would even he forgive  if she began weeping in these woods alone it would mean death or madness  hastily she trod the thoughts out like a burning paper hastily rolled up her locks and with terror dogging her and her whole bosom sick with grief resumed her journey  past ten in the forenoon she struck a highroad marching in that place uphill between two stately groves a river of sunlight and here dead weary careless of consequences and taking some courage from the human and civilised neighbourhood of the road she stretched herself on the green margin in the shadow of a tree  sleep closed on her at first with a horror of fainting but when she ceased to struggle kindly embracing her  so she was taken home for a little from all her toils and sorrows to her father’s arms  and there in the meanwhile her body lay exposed by the highwayside in tattered finery and on either hand from the woods the birds came flying by and calling upon others and debated in their own tongue this strange appearance  the sun pursued his journey the shadow flitted from her feet shrank higher and higher and was upon the point of leaving her altogether when the rumble of a coach was signalled to and fro by the birds  the road in that part was very steep the rumble drew near with great deliberation and ten minutes passed before a gentleman appeared walking with a sober elderly gait upon the grassy margin of the highway and looking pleasantly around him as he walked  from time to time he paused took out his notebook and made an entry with a pencil and any spy who had been near enough would have heard him mumbling words as though he were a poet testing verses  the voice of the wheels was still faint and it was plain the traveller had far outstripped his carriage  he had drawn very near to where the princess lay asleep before his eye alighted on her but when it did he started pocketed his notebook and approached  there was a milestone close to where she lay and he sat down on that and coolly studied her  she lay upon one side all curled and sunken her brow on one bare arm the other stretched out limp and dimpled  her young body like a thing thrown down had scarce a mark of life  her breathing stirred her not  the deadliest fatigue was thus confessed in every language of the sleeping flesh  the traveller smiled grimly  as though he had looked upon a statue he made a grudging inventory of her charms the figure in that touching freedom of forgetfulness surprised him the flush of slumber became her like a flower  ‘upon my word’ he thought ‘i did not think the girl could be so pretty and to think’ he added ‘that i am under obligation not to use one word of this’  he put forth his stick and touched her and at that she awoke sat up with a cry and looked upon him wildly  ‘i trust your highness has slept well’ he said nodding  but she only uttered sounds  ‘compose yourself’ said he giving her certainly a brave example in his own demeanour  ‘my chaise is close at hand and i shall have i trust the singular entertainment of abducting a sovereign princess’  ‘sir john’ she said at last  ‘at your highness’s disposal’ he replied  she sprang to her feet  ‘o’ she cried ‘have you come from mittwalden’  ‘this morning’ he returned ‘i left it and if there is any one less likely to return to it than yourself behold him’  ‘the baron—’ she began and paused  ‘madam’ he answered ‘it was well meant and you are quite a judith but after the hours that have elapsed you will probably be relieved to hear that he is fairly well  i took his news this morning ere i left  doing fairly well they said but suffering acutely  hey—acutely  they could hear his groans in the next room’  ‘and the prince’ she asked ‘is anything known of him’  ‘it is reported’ replied sir john with the same pleasurable deliberation ‘that upon that point your highness is the best authority’  ‘sir john’ she said eagerly ‘you were generous enough to speak about your carriage  will you i beseech you will you take me to the felsenburg  i have business there of an extreme importance’  ‘i can refuse you nothing’ replied the old gentleman gravely and seriously enough  ‘whatever madam it is in my power to do for you that shall be done with pleasure  as soon as my chaise shall overtake us it is yours to carry you where you will  but’ added he reverting to his former manner ‘i observe you ask me nothing of the palace’  ‘i do not care’ she said  ‘i thought i saw it burning’  ‘prodigious’ said the baronet  ‘you thought  and can the loss of forty toilettes leave you cold  well madam i admire your fortitude  and the state too  as i left the government was sitting—the new government of which at least two members must be known to you by name sabra who had i believe the benefit of being formed in your employment—a footman am i right—and our old friend the chancellor in something of a subaltern position  but in these convulsions the last shall be first and the first last’  ‘sir john’ she said with an air of perfect honesty ‘i am sure you mean most kindly but these matters have no interest for me’  the baronet was so utterly discountenanced that he hailed the appearance of his chaise with welcome and by way of saying something proposed that they should walk back to meet it  so it was done and he helped her in with courtesy mounted to her side and from various receptacles for the chaise was most completely fitted out produced fruits and truffled liver beautiful white bread and a bottle of delicate wine  with these he served her like a father coaxing and praising her to fresh exertions and during all that time as though silenced by the laws of hospitality he was not guilty of the shadow of a sneer  indeed his kindness seemed so genuine that seraphina was moved to gratitude  ‘sir john’ she said ‘you hate me in your heart why are you so kind to me’  ‘ah my good lady’ said he with no disclaimer of the accusation ‘i have the honour to be much your husband’s friend and somewhat his admirer’  ‘you’ she cried  ‘they told me you wrote cruelly of both of us’  ‘such was the strange path by which we grew acquainted’ said sir john ‘i had written madam with particular cruelty since that shall be the phrase of your fair self  your husband set me at liberty gave me a passport ordered a carriage and then with the most boyish spirit challenged me to fight  knowing the nature of his married life i thought the dash and loyalty he showed delightful  “do not be afraid” says he “if i am killed there is nobody to miss me”  it appears you subsequently thought of that yourself  but i digress  i explained to him it was impossible that i could fight  “not if i strike you” says he  very droll i wish i could have put it in my book  however i was conquered took the young gentleman to my high favour and tore up my bits of scandal on the spot  that is one of the little favours madam that you owe your husband’  seraphina sat for some while in silence  she could bear to be misjudged without a pang by those whom she contemned she had none of otto’s eagerness to be approved but went her own way straight and head in air to sir john however after what he had said and as her husband’s friend she was prepared to stoop  ‘what do you think of me’ she asked abruptly  ‘i have told you already’ said sir john ‘i think you want another glass of my good wine’  ‘come’ she said ‘this is unlike you  you are not wont to be afraid you say that you admire my husband in his name be honest’  ‘i admire your courage’ said the baronet  ‘beyond that as you have guessed and indeed said our natures are not sympathetic’  ‘you spoke of scandal’ pursued seraphina  ‘was the scandal great’  ‘it was considerable’ said sir john  ‘and you believed it’ she demanded  ‘o madam’ said sir john ‘the question’  ‘thank you for that answer’ cried seraphina  ‘and now here i will tell you upon my honour upon my soul in spite of all the scandal in this world i am as true a wife as ever stood’  ‘we should probably not agree upon a definition’ observed sir john  ‘o’ she cried ‘i have abominably used him—i know that it is not that i mean  but if you admire my husband i insist that you shall understand me i can look him in the face without a blush’  ‘it may be madam’ said sir john ‘nor have i presumed to think the contrary’  ‘you will not believe me’ she cried  ‘you think i am a guilty wife you think he was my lover’  ‘madam’ returned the baronet ‘when i tore up my papers i promised your good husband to concern myself no more with your affairs and i assure you for the last time that i have no desire to judge you’  ‘but you will not acquit me  ah’ she cried ‘he will—he knows me better’  sir john smiled  ‘you smile at my distress’ asked seraphina  ‘at your woman’s coolness’ said sir john  ‘a man would scarce have had the courage of that cry which was for all that very natural and i make no doubt quite true  but remark madam—since you do me the honour to consult me gravely—i have no pity for what you call your distresses you have been completely selfish and now reap the consequence  had you once thought of your husband instead of singly thinking of yourself you would not now have been alone a fugitive with blood upon your hands and hearing from a morose old englishman truth more bitter than scandal’  ‘i thank you’ she said quivering  ‘this is very true  will you stop the carriage’  ‘no child’ said sir john ‘not until i see you mistress of yourself’  there was a long pause during which the carriage rolled by rock and woodland  ‘and now’ she resumed with perfect steadiness ‘will you consider me composed  i request you as a gentleman to let me out’  ‘i think you do unwisely’ he replied  ‘continue if you please to use my carriage’  ‘sir john’ she said ‘if death were sitting on that pile of stones i would alight  i do not blame i thank you i now know how i appear to others but sooner than draw breath beside a man who can so think of me i would—o’ she cried and was silent  sir john pulled the string alighted and offered her his hand but she refused the help  the road had now issued from the valleys in which it had been winding and come to that part of its course where it runs like a cornice along the brow of the steep northward face of grünewald  the place where they had alighted was at a salient angle a bold rock and some windtortured pinetrees overhung it from above far below the blue plains lay forth and melted into heaven and before them the road by a succession of bold zigzags was seen mounting to where a tower upon a tall cliff closed the view  ‘there’ said the baronet pointing to the tower ‘you see the felsenburg your goal  i wish you a good journey and regret i cannot be of more assistance’  he mounted to his place and gave a signal and the carriage rolled away  seraphina stood by the wayside gazing before her with blind eyes  sir john she had dismissed already from her mind she hated him that was enough for whatever seraphina hated or contemned fell instantly to lilliputian smallness and was thenceforward steadily ignored in thought and now she had matter for concern indeed  her interview with otto which she had never yet forgiven him began to appear before her in a very different light  he had come to her still thrilling under recent insult and not yet breathed from fighting her own cause and how that knowledge changed the value of his words  yes he must have loved her this was a brave feeling—it was no mere weakness of the will  and she was she incapable of love  it would appear so and she swallowed her tears and yearned to see otto to explain all to ask pity upon her knees for her transgressions and if all else were now beyond the reach of reparation to restore at least the liberty of which she had deprived him  swiftly she sped along the highway and as the road wound out and in about the bluffs and gullies of the mountain saw and lost by glimpses the tall tower that stood before and above her purpled by the mountain air    chapter ii—treats of a christian virtue   when otto mounted to his rolling prison he found another occupant in a corner of the front seat but as this person hung his head and the brightness of the carriage lamps shone outward the prince could only see it was a man  the colonel followed his prisoner and clappedto the door and at that the four horses broke immediately into a swinging trot  ‘gentlemen’ said the colonel after some little while had passed ‘if we are to travel in silence we might as well be at home  i appear of course in an invidious character but i am a man of taste fond of books and solidly informing talk and unfortunately condemned for life to the guardroom  gentlemen this is my chance don’t spoil it for me  i have here the pick of the whole court barring lovely woman i have a great author in the person of the doctor—’  ‘gotthold’ cried otto  ‘it appears’ said the doctor bitterly ‘that we must go together  your highness had not calculated upon that’  ‘what do you infer’ cried otto ‘that i had you arrested’  ‘the inference is simple’ said the doctor  ‘colonel gordon’ said the prince ‘oblige me so far and set me right with herr von hohenstockwitz’  ‘gentlemen’ said the colonel ‘you are both arrested on the same warrant in the name of the princess seraphina acting regent countersigned by prime minister freiherr von gondremark and dated the day before yesterday the twelfth  i reveal to you the secrets of the prisonhouse’ he added  ‘otto’ said gotthold ‘i ask you to pardon my suspicions’  ‘gotthold’ said the prince ‘i am not certain i can grant you that’  ‘your highness is i am sure far too magnanimous to hesitate’ said the colonel  ‘but allow me we speak at home in my religion of the means of grace and i now propose to offer them’  so saying the colonel lighted a bright lamp which he attached to one side of the carriage and from below the front seat produced a goodly basket adorned with the long necks of bottles  ‘tu spem reducis—how does it go doctor’ he asked gaily ‘i am in a sense your host and i am sure you are both far too considerate of my embarrassing position to refuse to do me honour gentlemen i drink to the prince’  ‘colonel’ said otto ‘we have a jovial entertainer  i drink to colonel gordon’  thereupon all three took their wine very pleasantly and even as they did so the carriage with a lurch turned into the highroad and began to make better speed  all was bright within the wine had coloured gotthold’s cheek dim forms of forest trees dwindling and spiring scarves of the starry sky now wide and now narrow raced past the windows through one that was left open the air of the woods came in with a nocturnal raciness and the roll of wheels and the tune of the trotting horses sounded merrily on the ear toast followed toast glass after glass was bowed across and emptied by the trio and presently there began to fall upon them a luxurious spell under the influence of which little but the sound of quiet and confidential laughter interrupted the long intervals of meditative silence  ‘otto’ said gotthold after one of these seasons of quiet ‘i do not ask you to forgive me  were the parts reversed i could not forgive you’  ‘well’ said otto ‘it is a phrase we use  i do forgive you but your words and your suspicions rankle and not yours alone  it is idle colonel gordon in view of the order you are carrying out to conceal from you the dissensions of my family they have gone so far that they are now public property  well gentlemen can i forgive my wife  i can of course and do but in what sense  i would certainly not stoop to any revenge as certainly i could not think of her but as one changed beyond my recognition’  ‘allow me’ returned the colonel  ‘you will permit me to hope that i am addressing christians  we are all conscious i trust that we are miserable sinners’  ‘i disown the consciousness’ said gotthold  ‘warmed with this good fluid i deny your thesis’  ‘how sir  you never did anything wrong and i heard you asking pardon but this moment not of your god sir but of a common fellowworm’ the colonel cried  ‘i own you have me you are expert in argument herr oberst’ said the doctor  ‘begad sir i am proud to hear you say so’ said the colonel  ‘i was well grounded indeed at aberdeen  and as for this matter of forgiveness it comes sir of loose views and what is if anything more dangerous a regular life  a sound creed and a bad morality that’s the root of wisdom  you two gentlemen are too good to be forgiving’  ‘the paradox is somewhat forced’ said gotthold  ‘pardon me colonel’ said the prince ‘i readily acquit you of any design of offence but your words bite like satire  is this a time do you think when i can wish to hear myself called good now that i am paying the penalty and am willing like yourself to think it just of my prolonged misconduct’  ‘o pardon me’ cried the colonel  ‘you have never been expelled from the divinity hall you have never been broke  i was broke for a neglect of military duty  to tell you the open truth your highness i was the worse of drink it’s a thing i never do now’ he added taking out his glass  ‘but a man you see who has really tasted the defects of his own character as i have and has come to regard himself as a kind of blind teetotum knocking about life begins to learn a very different view about forgiveness  i will talk of not forgiving others sir when i have made out to forgive myself and not before and the date is like to be a long one  my father the reverend alexander gordon was a good man and damned hard upon others  i am what they call a bad one and that is just the difference  the man who cannot forgive any mortal thing is a green hand in life’  ‘and yet i have heard of you colonel as a duellist’ said gotthold  ‘a different thing sir’ replied the soldier  ‘professional etiquette and i trust without unchristian feeling’  presently after the colonel fell into a deep sleep and his companions looked upon each other smiling  ‘an odd fish’ said gotthold  ‘and a strange guardian’ said the prince  ‘yet what he said was true’  ‘rightly looked upon’ mused gotthold ‘it is ourselves that we cannot forgive when we refuse forgiveness to our friend  some strand of our own misdoing is involved in every quarrel’  ‘are there not offences that disgrace the pardoner’ asked otto  ‘are there not bounds of selfrespect’  ‘otto’ said gotthold ‘does any man respect himself  to this poor waif of a soldier of fortune we may seem respectable gentlemen but to ourselves what are we unless a pasteboard portico and a deliquium of deadly weaknesses within’  ‘i yes’ said otto ‘but you gotthold—you with your interminable industry your keen mind your books—serving mankind scorning pleasures and temptations  you do not know how i envy you’  ‘otto’ said the doctor ‘in one word and a bitter one to say i am a secret tippler  yes i drink too much  the habit has robbed these very books to which you praise my devotion of the merits that they should have had  it has spoiled my temper  when i spoke to you the other day how much of my warmth was in the cause of virtue how much was the fever of last night’s wine  ay as my poor fellowsot there said and as i vaingloriously denied we are all miserable sinners put here for a moment knowing the good choosing the evil standing naked and ashamed in the eye of god’  ‘is it so’ said otto  ‘why then what are we  are the very best—’  ‘there is no best in man’ said gotthold  ‘i am not better it is likely i am not worse than you or that poor sleeper  i was a sham and now you know me that is all’  ‘and yet it has not changed my love’ returned otto softly  ‘our misdeeds do not change us  gotthold fill your glass  let us drink to what is good in this bad business let us drink to our old affection and when we have done so forgive your too just grounds of offence and drink with me to my wife whom i have so misused who has so misused me and whom i have left i fear i greatly fear in danger  what matters it how bad we are if others can still love us and we can still love others’  ‘ay’ replied the doctor  ‘it is very well said  it is the true answer to the pessimist and the standing miracle of mankind  so you still love me and so you can forgive your wife  why then we may bid conscience “down dog” like an illtrained puppy yapping at shadows’  the pair fell into silence the doctor tapping on his empty glass  the carriage swung forth out of the valleys on that open balcony of highroad that runs along the front of grünewald looking down on gerolstein  far below a white waterfall was shining to the stars from the falling skirts of forest and beyond that the night stood naked above the plain  on the other hand the lamplight skimmed the face of the precipices and the dwarf pinetrees twinkled with all their needles and were gone again into the wake  the granite roadway thundered under wheels and hoofs and at times by reason of its continual winding otto could see the escort on the other side of a ravine riding well together in the night  presently the felsenburg came plainly in view some way above them on a bold projection of the mountain and planting its bulk against the starry sky  ‘see gotthold’ said the prince ‘our destination’  gotthold awoke as from a trance  ‘i was thinking’ said he ‘if there is any danger why did you not resist  i was told you came of your free will but should you not be there to help her’  the colour faded from the prince’s cheeks    chapter iii—providence von rosen act the last in which she gallops off   when the busy countess came forth from her interview with seraphina it is not too much to say that she was beginning to be terribly afraid  she paused in the corridor and reckoned up her doings with an eye to gondremark  the fan was in requisition in an instant but her disquiet was beyond the reach of fanning  ‘the girl has lost her head’ she thought and then dismally ‘i have gone too far’  she instantly decided on secession  now the mons sacer of the frau von rosen was a certain rustic villa in the forest called by herself in a smart attack of poesy tannen zauber and by everybody else plain kleinbrunn  thither upon the thought she furiously drove passing gondremark at the entrance to the palace avenue but feigning not to observe him and as kleinbrunn was seven good miles away and in the bottom of a narrow dell she passed the night without any rumour of the outbreak reaching her and the glow of the conflagration was concealed by intervening hills  frau von rosen did not sleep well she was seriously uneasy as to the results of her delightful evening and saw herself condemned to quite a lengthy sojourn in her deserts and a long defensive correspondence ere she could venture to return to gondremark  on the other hand she examined by way of pastime the deeds she had received from otto and even here saw cause for disappointment  in these troublous days she had no taste for landed property and she was convinced besides that otto had paid dearer than the farm was worth  lastly the order for the prince’s release fairly burned her meddling fingers  all things considered the next day beheld an elegant and beautiful lady in a ridinghabit and a flapping hat draw bridle at the gate of the felsenburg not perhaps with any clear idea of her purpose but with her usual experimental views on life  governor gordon summoned to the gate welcomed the omnipotent countess with his most gallant bearing though it was wonderful how old he looked in the morning  ‘ah governor’ she said ‘we have surprises for you sir’ and nodded at him meaningly  ‘eh madam leave me my prisoners’ he said ‘and if you will but join the band begad i’ll be happy for life’  ‘you would spoil me would you not’ she asked  ‘i would try i would try’ returned the governor and he offered her his arm  she took it picked up her skirt and drew him close to her  ‘i have come to see the prince’ she said  ‘now infidel on business  a message from that stupid gondremark who keeps me running like a courier do i look like one herr gordon’ and she planted her eyes in him  ‘you look like an angel ma’am’ returned the governor with a great air of finished gallantry  the countess laughed  ‘an angel on horseback’ she said  ‘quick work’  ‘you came you saw you conquered’ flourished gordon in high good humour with his own wit and grace  ‘we toasted you madam in the carriage in an excellent good glass of wine toasted you fathom deep the finest woman with begad the finest eyes in grünewald  i never saw the like of them but once in my own country when i was a young fool at college thomasina haig her name was  i give you my word of honour she was as like you as two peas’  ‘and so you were merry in the carriage’ asked the countess gracefully dissembling a yawn  ‘we were we had a very pleasant conversation but we took perhaps a glass more than that fine fellow of a prince has been accustomed to’ said the governor ‘and i observe this morning that he seems a little off his mettle  we’ll get him mellow again ere bedtime  this is his door’  ‘well’ she whispered ‘let me get my breath  no no wait  have the door ready to open’  and the countess standing like one inspired shook out her fine voice in ‘lascia ch’io pianga’ and when she had reached the proper point and lyrically uttered forth her sighings after liberty the door at a sign was flung wide open and she swam into the prince’s sight brighteyed and with her colour somewhat freshened by the exercise of singing  it was a great dramatic entrance and to the somewhat doleful prisoner within the sight was sunshine  ‘ah madam’ he cried running to her—‘you here’  she looked meaningly at gordon and as soon as the door was closed she fell on otto’s neck  ‘to see you here’ she moaned and clung to him  but the prince stood somewhat stiffly in that enviable situation and the countess instantly recovered from her outburst  ‘poor child’ she said ‘poor child  sit down beside me here and tell me all about it  my heart really bleeds to see you  how does time go’  ‘madam’ replied the prince sitting down beside her his gallantry recovered ‘the time will now go all too quickly till you leave  but i must ask you for the news  i have most bitterly condemned myself for my inertia of last night  you wisely counselled me it was my duty to resist  you wisely and nobly counselled me i have since thought of it with wonder  you have a noble heart’  ‘otto’ she said ‘spare me  was it even right i wonder  i have duties too you poor child and when i see you they all melt—all my good resolutions fly away’  ‘and mine still come too late’ he replied sighing  ‘o what would i not give to have resisted  what would i not give for freedom’  ‘well what would you give’ she asked and the red fan was spread only her eyes as if from over battlements brightly surveyed him  ‘i  what do you mean  madam you have some news for me’ he cried  ‘o o’ said madam dubiously  he was at her feet  ‘do not trifle with my hopes’ he pleaded  ‘tell me dearest madame von rosen tell me  you cannot be cruel it is not in your nature  give  i can give nothing i have nothing i can only plead in mercy’  ‘do not’ she said ‘it is not fair  otto you know my weakness  spare me  be generous’  ‘o madam’ he said ‘it is for you to be generous to have pity’  he took her hand and pressed it he plied her with caresses and appeals the countess had a most enjoyable sham siege and then relented  she sprang to her feet she tore her dress open and all warm from her bosom threw the order on the floor  ‘there’ she cried  ‘i forced it from her  use it and i am ruined’ and she turned away as if to veil the force of her emotions  otto sprang upon the paper read it and cried out aloud  ‘o god bless her’ he said ‘god bless her’  and he kissed the writing  von rosen was a singularly goodnatured woman but her part was now beyond her  ‘ingrate’ she cried ‘i wrung it from her i betrayed my trust to get it and ’tis she you thank’  ‘can you blame me’ said the prince  ‘i love her’  ‘i see that’ she said  ‘and i’  ‘you madame von rosen  you are my dearest my kindest and most generous of friends’ he said approaching her  ‘you would be a perfect friend if you were not so lovely  you have a great sense of humour you cannot be unconscious of your charm and you amuse yourself at times by playing on my weakness and at times i can take pleasure in the comedy but not today today you will be the true the serious the manly friend and you will suffer me to forget that you are lovely and that i am weak  come dear countess let me today repose in you entirely’  he held out his hand smiling and she took it frankly  ‘i vow you have bewitched me’ she said and then with a laugh ‘i break my staff’ she added ‘and i must pay you my best compliment  you made a difficult speech  you are as adroit dear prince as i am—charming’  and as she said the word with a great curtsey she justified it  ‘you hardly keep the bargain madam when you make yourself so beautiful’ said the prince bowing  ‘it was my last arrow’ she returned  ‘i am disarmed  blank cartridge o mon prince  and now i tell you if you choose to leave this prison you can and i am ruined  choose’  ‘madame von rosen’ replied otto ‘i choose and i will go  my duty points me duty still neglected by this featherhead  but do not fear to be a loser  i propose instead that you should take me with you a bear in chains to baron gondremark  i am become perfectly unscrupulous to save my wife i will do all all he can ask or fancy  he shall be filled were he huge as leviathan and greedy as the grave i will content him and you the fairy of our pantomime shall have the credit’  ‘done’ she cried  ‘admirable  prince charming no longer—prince sorcerer prince solon  let us go this moment  stay’ she cried pausing  ‘i beg dear prince to give you back these deeds  ’twas you who liked the farm—i have not seen it and it was you who wished to benefit the peasants  and besides’ she added with a comical change of tone ‘i should prefer the ready money’  both laughed  ‘here i am once more a farmer’ said otto accepting the papers ‘but overwhelmed in debt’  the countess touched a bell and the governor appeared  ‘governor’ she said ‘i am going to elope with his highness  the result of our talk has been a thorough understanding and the coup d’état is over  here is the order’  colonel gordon adjusted silver spectacles upon his nose  ‘yes’ he said ‘the princess very right  but the warrant madam was countersigned’  ‘by heinrich’ said von rosen  ‘well and here am i to represent him’  ‘well your highness’ resumed the soldier of fortune ‘i must congratulate you upon my loss  you have been cut out by beauty and i am left lamenting  the doctor still remains to me probus doctus lepidus jucundus a man of books’  ‘ay there is nothing about poor gotthold’ said the prince  ‘the governor’s consolation  would you leave him bare’ asked von rosen  ‘and your highness’ resumed gordon ‘may i trust that in the course of this temporary obscuration you have found me discharge my part with suitable respect and i may add tact  i adopted purposely a cheerfulness of manner mirth it appeared to me and a good glass of wine were the fit alleviations’  ‘colonel’ said otto holding out his hand ‘your society was of itself enough  i do not merely thank you for your pleasant spirits i have to thank you besides for some philosophy of which i stood in need  i trust i do not see you for the last time and in the meanwhile as a memento of our strange acquaintance let me offer you these verses on which i was but now engaged  i am so little of a poet and was so ill inspired by prison bars that they have some claim to be at least a curiosity’  the colonel’s countenance lighted as he took the paper the silver spectacles were hurriedly replaced  ‘ha’ he said ‘alexandrines the tragic metre  i shall cherish this your highness like a relic no more suitable offering although i say it could be made “dieux de l’immense plaine et des vastes forêts”  very good’ he said ‘very good indeed “et du geôlier luimême apprendre des leçons”  most handsome begad’  ‘come governor’ cried the countess ‘you can read his poetry when we are gone  open your grudging portals’  ‘i ask your pardon’ said the colonel  ‘to a man of my character and tastes these verses this handsome reference—most moving i assure you can i offer you an escort’  ‘no no’ replied the countess  ‘we go incogniti as we arrived  we ride together the prince will take my servant’s horse  hurry and privacy herr oberst that is all we seek’ and she began impatiently to lead the way  but otto had still to bid farewell to dr gotthold and the governor following with his spectacles in one hand and the paper in the other had still to communicate his treasured verses piece by piece as he succeeded in deciphering the manuscript to all he came across and still his enthusiasm mounted  ‘i declare’ he cried at last with the air of one who has at length divined a mystery ‘they remind me of robbie burns’  but there is an end to all things and at length otto was walking by the side of madame von rosen along that mountain wall her servant following with both the horses and all about them sunlight and breeze and flying bird and the vast regions of the air and the capacious prospect wildwood and climbing pinnacle and the sound and voice of mountain torrents at their hand and far below them green melting into sapphire on the plains  they walked at first in silence for otto’s mind was full of the delight of liberty and nature and still betweenwhiles he was preparing his interview with gondremark  but when the first rough promontory of the rock was turned and the felsenburg concealed behind its bulk the lady paused  ‘here’ she said ‘i will dismount poor karl and you and i must ply our spurs  i love a wild ride with a good companion’  as she spoke a carriage came into sight round the corner next below them in the order of the road  it came heavily creaking and a little ahead of it a traveller was soberly walking notebook in hand  ‘it is sir john’ cried otto and he hailed him  the baronet pocketed his notebook stared through an eyeglass and then waved his stick and he on his side and the countess and the prince on theirs advanced with somewhat quicker steps  they met at the reentrant angle where a thin stream sprayed across a boulder and was scattered in rain among the brush and the baronet saluted the prince with much punctilio  to the countess on the other hand he bowed with a kind of sneering wonder  ‘is it possible madam that you have not heard the news’ he asked  ‘what news’ she cried  ‘news of the first order’ returned sir john ‘a revolution in the state a republic declared the palace burned to the ground the princess in flight gondremark wounded—’  ‘heinrich wounded’ she screamed  ‘wounded and suffering acutely’ said sir john  ‘his groans—’  there fell from the lady’s lips an oath so potent that in smoother hours it would have made her hearers jump  she ran to her horse scrambled to the saddle and yet half seated dashed down the road at full gallop  the groom after a pause of wonder followed her  the rush of her impetuous passage almost scared the carriage horses over the verge of the steep hill and still she clattered further and the crags echoed to her flight and still the groom flogged vainly in pursuit of her  at the fourth corner a woman trailing slowly up leaped back with a cry and escaped death by a hand’sbreadth  but the countess wasted neither glance nor thought upon the incident  out and in about the bluffs of the mountain wall she fled loosereined and still the groom toiled in her pursuit  ‘a most impulsive lady’ said sir john  ‘who would have thought she cared for him’  and before the words were uttered he was struggling in the prince’s grasp  ‘my wife the princess  what of her’  ‘she is down the road’ he gasped  ‘i left her twenty minutes back’  and next moment the choked author stood alone and the prince on foot was racing down the hill behind the countess    chapter iv—babes in the wood   while the feet of the prince continued to run swiftly his heart which had at first by far outstripped his running soon began to linger and hang back  not that he ceased to pity the misfortune or to yearn for the sight of seraphina but the memory of her obdurate coldness awoke within him and woke in turn his own habitual diffidence of self  had sir john been given time to tell him all had he even known that she was speeding to the felsenburg he would have gone to her with ardour  as it was he began to see himself once more intruding profiting perhaps by her misfortune and now that she was fallen proffering unloved caresses to the wife who had spurned him in prosperity  the sore spots upon his vanity began to burn once more his anger assumed the carriage of a hostile generosity he would utterly forgive indeed he would help save and comfort his unloving wife but all with distant selfdenial imposing silence on his heart respecting seraphina’s disaffection as he would the innocence of a child  so when at length he turned a corner and beheld the princess it was his first thought to reassure her of the purity of his respect and he at once ceased running and stood still  she upon her part began to run to him with a little cry then seeing him pause she paused also smitten with remorse and at length with the most guilty timidity walked nearly up to where he stood  ‘otto’ she said ‘i have ruined all’  ‘seraphina’ he cried with a sob but did not move partly withheld by his resolutions partly struck stupid at the sight of her weariness and disorder  had she stood silent they had soon been locked in an embrace but she too had prepared herself against the interview and must spoil the golden hour with protestations  ‘all’ she went on ‘i have ruined all  but otto in kindness you must hear me—not justify but own my faults  i have been taught so cruelly i have had such time for thought and see the world so changed  i have been blind stoneblind i have let all true good go by me and lived on shadows  but when this dream fell and i had betrayed you and thought i had killed—’  she paused  ‘i thought i had killed gondremark’ she said with a deep flush ‘and i found myself alone as you said’  the mention of the name of gondremark pricked the princes generosity like a spur  ‘well’ he cried ‘and whose fault was it but mine  it was my duty to be beside you loved or not  but i was a skulker in the grain and found it easier to desert than to oppose you  i could never learn that better part of love to fight love’s battles  but yet the love was there  and now when this toy kingdom of ours has fallen first of all by my demerits and next by your inexperience and we are here alone together as poor as job and merely a man and a woman—let me conjure you to forgive the weakness and to repose in the love  do not mistake me’ he cried seeing her about to speak and imposing silence with uplifted hand  ‘my love is changed it is purged of any conjugal pretension it does not ask does not hope does not wish for a return in kind  you may forget for ever that part in which you found me so distasteful and accept without embarrassment the affection of a brother’  ‘you are too generous otto’ she said  ‘i know that i have forfeited your love  i cannot take this sacrifice  you had far better leave me o go away and leave me to my fate’  ‘o no’ said otto ‘we must first of all escape out of this hornet’s nest to which i led you  my honour is engaged  i said but now we were as poor as job and behold not many miles from here i have a house of my own to which i will conduct you  otto the prince being down we must try what luck remains to otto the hunter  come seraphina show that you forgive me and let us set about this business of escape in the best spirits possible  you used to say my dear that except as a husband and a prince i was a pleasant fellow  i am neither now and you may like my company without remorse  come then it were idle to be captured  can you still walk  forth then’ said he and he began to lead the way  a little below where they stood a goodsized brook passed below the road which overleapt it in a single arch  on one bank of that loquacious water a footpath descended a green dell  here it was rocky and stony and lay on the steep scarps of the ravine here it was choked with brambles and there in fairy haughs it lay for a few paces evenly on the green turf  like a sponge the hillside oozed with wellwater the burn kept growing both in force and volume at every leap it fell with heavier plunges and span more widely in the pool  great had been the labours of that stream and great and agreeable the changes it had wrought  it had cut through dykes of stubborn rock and now like a blowing dolphin spouted through the orifice along all its humble coasts it had undermined and rafteddown the goodlier timber of the forest and on these rough clearings it now set and tended primrose gardens and planted woods of willow and made a favourite of the silver birch  through all these friendly features the path its human acolyte conducted our two wanderers downward—otto before still pausing at the more difficult passages to lend assistance the princess following  from time to time when he turned to help her her face would lighten upon his—her eyes half desperately woo him  he saw but dared not understand  ‘she does not love me’ he told himself with magnanimity ‘this is remorse or gratitude i were no gentleman no nor yet a man if i presumed upon these pitiful concessions’  some way down the glen the stream already grown to a good bulk of water was rudely dammed across and about a third of it abducted in a wooden trough  gaily the pure water air’s first cousin fleeted along the rude aqueduct whose sides and floor it had made green with grasses the path bearing it close company threaded a wilderness of briar and wildrose  and presently a little in front the brown top of a mill and the tall millwheel spraying diamonds arose in the narrows of the glen at the same time the snoring music of the saws broke the silence  the miller hearing steps came forth to his door and both he and otto started  ‘goodmorning miller’ said the prince  ‘you were right it seems and i was wrong  i give you the news and bid you to mittwalden  my throne has fallen—great was the fall of it—and your good friends of the phoenix bear the rule’  the redfaced miller looked supreme astonishment  ‘and your highness’ he gasped  ‘my highness is running away’ replied otto ‘straight for the frontier’  ‘leaving grünewald’ cried the man  ‘your father’s son  it’s not to be permitted’  ‘do you arrest us friend’ asked otto smiling  ‘arrest you  i’ exclaimed the man  ‘for what does your highness take me  why sir i make sure there is not a man in grünewald would lay hands upon you’  ‘o many many’ said the prince ‘but from you who were bold with me in my greatness i should even look for aid in my distress’  the miller became the colour of beetroot  ‘you may say so indeed’ said he  ‘and meanwhile will you and your lady step into my house’  ‘we have not time for that’ replied the prince ‘but if you would oblige us with a cup of wine without here you will give a pleasure and a service both in one’  the miller once more coloured to the nape  he hastened to bring forth wine in a pitcher and three bright crystal tumblers  ‘your highness must not suppose’ he said as he filled them ‘that i am an habitual drinker the time when i had the misfortune to encounter you i was a trifle overtaken i allow but a more sober man than i am in my ordinary i do not know where you are to look for and even this glass that i drink to you and to the lady is quite an unusual recreation’  the wine was drunk with due rustic courtesies and then refusing further hospitality otto and seraphina once more proceeded to descend the glen which now began to open and to be invaded by the taller trees  ‘i owed that man a reparation’ said the prince ‘for when we met i was in the wrong and put a sore affront upon him  i judge by myself perhaps but i begin to think that no one is the better for a humiliation’  ‘but some have to be taught so’ she replied  ‘well well’ he said with a painful embarrassment  ‘well well  but let us think of safety  my miller is all very good but i do not pin my faith to him  to follow down this stream will bring us but after innumerable windings to my house  here up this glade there lies a crosscut—the world’s end for solitude—the very deer scarce visit it are you too tired or could you pass that way’  ‘choose the path otto  i will follow you’ she said  ‘no’ he replied with a singular imbecility of manner and appearance ‘but i meant the path was rough  it lies all the way by glade and dingle and the dingles are both deep and thorny’  ‘lead on’ she said  ‘are you not otto the hunter’  they had now burst across a veil of underwood and were come into a lawn among the forest very green and innocent and solemnly surrounded by trees  otto paused on the margin looking about him with delight then his glance returned to seraphina as she stood framed in that silvan pleasantness and looking at her husband with undecipherable eyes  a weakness both of the body and mind fell on him like the beginnings of sleep the cords of his activity were relaxed his eyes clung to her ‘let us rest’ he said and he made her sit down and himself sat down beside her on the slope of an inconsiderable mound  she sat with her eyes downcast her slim hand dabbling in grass like a maid waiting for love’s summons  the sound of the wind in the forest swelled and sank and drew near them with a running rush and died away and away in the distance into fainting whispers  nearer hand a bird out of the deep covert uttered broken and anxious notes  all this seemed but a halting prelude to speech  to otto it seemed as if the whole frame of nature were waiting for his words and yet his pride kept him silent the longer he watched that slender and pale hand plucking at the grasses the harder and rougher grew the fight between pride and its kindly adversary  ‘seraphina’ he said at last ‘it is right you should know one thing i never   ’  he was about to say ‘doubted you’ but was that true  and if true was it generous to speak of it  silence succeeded  ‘i pray you tell it me’ she said ‘tell it me in pity’  ‘i mean only this’ he resumed ‘that i understand all and do not blame you  i understand how the brave woman must look down on the weak man  i think you were wrong in some things but i have tried to understand it and i do  i do not need to forget or to forgive seraphina for i have understood’  ‘i know what i have done’ she said  ‘i am not so weak that i can be deceived with kind speeches  i know what i have been—i see myself  i am not worth your anger how much less to be forgiven  in all this downfall and misery i see only me and you you as you have been always me as i was—me above all  o yes i see myself and what can i think’  ‘ah then let us reverse the parts’ said otto  ‘it is ourselves we cannot forgive when we deny forgiveness to another—so a friend told me last night  on these terms seraphina you see how generously i have forgiven myself  but am not i to be forgiven  come then forgive yourself—and me’  she did not answer in words but reached out her hand to him quickly  he took it and as the smooth fingers settled and nestled in his love ran to and fro between them in tender and transforming currents  ‘seraphina’ he cried ‘o forget the past  let me serve and help you let me be your servant it is enough for me to serve you and to be near you let me be near you dear—do not send me away’  he hurried his pleading like the speech of a frightened child  ‘it is not love’ he went on ‘i do not ask for love my love is enough   ’  ‘otto’ she said as if in pain  he looked up into her face  it was wrung with the very ecstasy of tenderness and anguish on her features and most of all in her changed eyes there shone the very light of love  ‘seraphina’ he cried aloud and with a sudden tuneless voice ‘seraphina’  ‘look round you at this glade’ she cried ‘and where the leaves are coming on young trees and the flowers begin to blossom  this is where we meet meet for the first time it is so much better to forget and to be born again  o what a pit there is for sins—god’s mercy man’s oblivion’  ‘seraphina’ he said ‘let it be so indeed let all that was be merely the abuse of dreaming let me begin again a stranger  i have dreamed in a long dream that i adored a girl unkind and beautiful in all things my superior but still cold like ice  and again i dreamed and thought she changed and melted glowed and turned to me  and i—who had no merit but a love slavish and unerect—lay close and durst not move for fear of waking’  ‘lie close’ she said with a deep thrill of speech  so they spake in the spring woods and meanwhile in mittwalden rathhaus the republic was declared     bibliographical postscript to complete the story   the reader well informed in modern history will not require details as to the fate of the republic  the best account is to be found in the memoirs of herr greisengesang 7 bände leipzig by our passing acquaintance the licentiate roederer  herr roederer with too much of an author’s licence makes a great figure of his hero—poses him indeed to be the centrepiece and cloudcompeller of the whole  but with due allowance for this bias the book is able and complete  the reader is of course acquainted with the vigorous and bracing pages of sir john 2 vols london longman hurst rees orme and brown  sir john who plays but a toothcomb in the orchestra of this historical romance blows in his own book the big bassoon  his character is there drawn at large and the sympathy of landor has countersigned the admiration of the public  one point however calls for explanation the chapter on grünewald was torn by the hand of the author in the palace gardens how comes it then to figure at full length among my more modest pages the lion of the caravan  that eminent literatus was a man of method ‘juvenal by double entry’ he was once profanely called and when he tore the sheets in question it was rather as he has since explained in the search for some dramatic evidence of his sincerity than with the thought of practical deletion  at that time indeed he was possessed of two blotted scrolls and a fair copy in double  but the chapter as the reader knows was honestly omitted from the famous ‘memoirs on the various courts of europe’  it has been mine to give it to the public  bibliography still helps us with a further glimpse of our characters  i have here before me a small volume printed for private circulation no printer’s name nd ‘poésies par frédéric et amélie’  mine is a presentation copy obtained for me by mr bain in the haymarket and the name of the first owner is written on the flyleaf in the hand of prince otto himself  the modest epigraph—‘le rime n’est pas riche’—may be attributed with a good show of likelihood to the same collaborator  it is strikingly appropriate and i have found the volume very dreary those pieces in which i seem to trace the hand of the princess are particularly dull and conscientious  but the booklet had a fair success with that public for which it was designed and i have come across some evidences of a second venture of the same sort now unprocurable  here at least we may take leave of otto and seraphina—what do i say of frédéric and amélie—ageing together peaceably at the court of the wife’s father jingling french rhymes and correcting joint proofs  still following the booklists i perceive that mr swinburne has dedicated a rousing lyric and some vigorous sonnets to the memory of gondremark that name appears twice at least in victor hugo’s trumpetblasts of patriot enumeration and i came latterly when i supposed my task already ended on a trace of the fallen politician and his countess  it is in the ‘diary of j hogg cotterill esq’ that very interesting work  mr cotterill being at naples is introduced may 27th to ‘a baron and baroness gondremark—he a man who once made a noise—she still beautiful—both witty  she complimented me much upon my french—should never have known me to be english—had known my uncle sir john in germany—recognised in me as a family trait some of his grand air and studious courtesy—asked me to call’  and again may 30th ‘visited the baronne de gondremark—much gratified—a most refined intelligent woman quite of the old school now hélas extinct—had read my remarks on sicily—it reminds her of my uncle but with more of grace—i feared she thought there was less energy—assured no—a softer style of presentation more of the literary grace but the same firm grasp of circumstance and force of thought—in short just buttonhole’s opinion  much encouraged  i have a real esteem for this patrician lady’  the acquaintance lasted some time and when mr cotterill left in the suite of lord protocol and as he is careful to inform us in admiral yardarm’s flagship one of his chief causes of regret is to leave ‘that most spirituelle and sympathetic lady who already regards me as a younger brother’
