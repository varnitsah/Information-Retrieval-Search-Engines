12753547	the facts concerning the recent carnival of crime in connecticut  by mark twain    i was feeling blithe almost jocund i put a match to my cigar and just then the mornings mail was handed in the first superscription i glanced at was in a handwriting that sent a thrill of pleasure through and through me it was aunt marys and she was the person i loved and honored most in all the world outside of my own household she had been my boyhoods idol maturity which is fatal to so many enchantments had not been able to dislodge her from her pedestal no it had only justified her right to be there and placed her dethronement permanently among the impossibilities to show how strong her influence over me was i will observe that long after everybody elses dostopsmoking had ceased to affect me in the slightest degree aunt mary could still stir my torpid conscience into faint signs of life when she touched upon the matter but all things have their limit in this world a happy day came at last when even aunt marys words could no longer move me i was not merely glad to see that day arrive i was more than gladi was grateful for when its sun had set the one alloy that was able to mar my enjoyment of my aunts society was gone the remainder of her stay with us that winter was in every way a delight of course she pleaded with me just as earnestly as ever after that blessed day to quit my pernicious habit but to no purpose whatever the moment she opened the subject i at once became calmly peacefully contentedly indifferentabsolutely adamantinely indifferent consequently the closing weeks of that memorable visit melted away as pleasantly as a dream they were so freighted for me with tranquil satisfaction i could not have enjoyed my pet vice more if my gentle tormentor had been a smoker herself and an advocate of the practice well the sight of her handwriting reminded me that i way getting very hungry to see her again i easily guessed what i should find in her letter i opened it good just as i expected she was coming coming this very day too and by the morning train i might expect her any moment  i said to myself i am thoroughly happy and content now if my most pitiless enemy could appear before me at this moment i would freely right any wrong i may have done him  straightway the door opened and a shriveled shabby dwarf entered he was not more than two feet high he seemed to be about forty years old every feature and every inch of him was a trifle out of shape and so while one could not put his finger upon any particular part and say this is a conspicuous deformity the spectator perceived that this little person was a deformity as a wholea vague general evenly blended nicely adjusted deformity there was a foxlike cunning in the face and the sharp little eyes and also alertness and malice and yet this vile bit of human rubbish seemed to bear a sort of remote and illdefined resemblance to me it was dully perceptible in the mean form the countenance and even the clothes gestures manner and attitudes of the creature he was a farfetched dim suggestion of a burlesque upon me a caricature of me in little one thing about him struck me forcibly and most unpleasantly he was covered all over with a fuzzy greenish mold such as one sometimes sees upon mildewed bread the sight of it was nauseating  he stepped along with a chipper air and flung himself into a dolls chair in a very freeandeasy way without waiting to be asked he tossed his hat into the wastebasket he picked up my old chalk pipe from the floor gave the stem a wipe or two on his knee filled the bowl from the tobaccobox at his side and said to me in a tone of pert command  gimme a match  i blushed to the roots of my hair partly with indignation but mainly because it somehow seemed to me that this whole performance was very like an exaggeration of conduct which i myself had sometimes been guilty of in my intercourse with familiar friendsbut never never with strangers i observed to myself i wanted to kick the pygmy into the fire but some incomprehensible sense of being legally and legitimately under his authority forced me to obey his order he applied the match to the pipe took a contemplative whiff or two and remarked in an irritatingly familiar way  seems to me its devilish odd weather for this time of year  i flushed again and in anger and humiliation as before for the language was hardly an exaggeration of some that i have uttered in my day and moreover was delivered in a tone of voice and with an exasperating drawl that had the seeming of a deliberate travesty of my style now there is nothing i am quite so sensitive about as a mocking imitation of my drawling infirmity of speech i spoke up sharply and said  look here you miserable ashcat you will have to give a little more attention to your manners or i will throw you out of the window  the manikin smiled a smile of malicious content and security puffed a whiff of smoke contemptuously toward me and said with a still more elaborate drawl  comego gently now dont put on too many airs with your betters  this cool snub rasped me all over but it seemed to subjugate me too for a moment the pygmy contemplated me awhile with his weasel eyes and then said in a peculiarly sneering way  you turned a tramp away from your door this morning  i said crustily  perhaps i did perhaps i didnt how do you know  well i know it isnt any matter how i know  very well suppose i did turn a tramp away from the doorwhat of it  oh nothing nothing in particular only you lied to him  i didnt that is i  yes but you did you lied to him  i felt a guilty pangin truth i had felt it forty times before that tramp had traveled a block from my doorbut still i resolved to make a show of feeling slandered so i said  this is a baseless impertinence i said to the tramp  therewait you were about to lie again i know what you said to him you said the cook was gone downtown and there was nothing left from breakfast two lies you knew the cook was behind the door and plenty of provisions behind her  this astonishing accuracy silenced me and it filled me with wondering speculations too as to how this cub could have got his information of course he could have culled the conversation from the tramp but by what sort of magic had he contrived to find out about the concealed cook now the dwarf spoke again  it was rather pitiful rather small in you to refuse to read that poor young womans manuscript the other day and give her an opinion as to its literary value and she had come so far too and so hopefully now wasnt it  i felt like a cur and i had felt so every time the thing had recurred to my mind i may as well confess i flushed hotly and said  look here have you nothing better to do than prowl around prying into other peoples business did that girl tell you that  never mind whether she did or not the main thing is you did that contemptible thing and you felt ashamed of it afterward aha you feel ashamed of it now  this was a sort of devilish glee with fiery earnestness i responded  i told that girl in the kindest gentlest way that i could not consent to deliver judgment upon any ones manuscript because an individuals verdict was worthless it might underrate a work of high merit and lose it to the world or it might overrate a trashy production and so open the way for its infliction upon the world i said that the great public was the only tribunal competent to sit in judgment upon a literary effort and therefore it must be best to lay it before that tribunal in the outset since in the end it must stand or fall by that mighty courts decision anyway  yes you said all that so you did you juggling smallsouled shuffler and yet when the happy hopefulness faded out of that poor girls face when you saw her furtively slip beneath her shawl the scroll she had so patiently and honestly scribbled atso ashamed of her darling now so proud of it beforewhen you saw the gladness go out of her eyes and the tears come there when she crept away so humbly who had come so  oh peace peace peace blister your merciless tongue havent all these thoughts tortured me enough without your coming here to fetch them back again  remorse remorse it seemed to me that it would eat the very heart out of me and yet that small fiend only sat there leering at me with joy and contempt and placidly chuckling presently he began to speak again every sentence was an accusation and every accusation a truth every clause was freighted with sarcasm and derision every slowdropping word burned like vitriol the dwarf reminded me of times when i had flown at my children in anger and punished them for faults which a little inquiry would have taught me that others and not they had committed he reminded me of how i had disloyally allowed old friends to be traduced in my hearing and been too craven to utter a word in their defense he reminded me of many dishonest things which i had done of many which i had procured to be done by children and other irresponsible persons of some which i had planned thought upon and longed to do and been kept from the performance by fear of consequences only with exquisite cruelty he recalled to my mind item by item wrongs and unkindnesses i had inflicted and humiliations i had put upon friends since dead who died thinking of those injuries maybe and grieving over them he added by way of poison to the stab  for instance said he take the case of your younger brother when you two were boys together many a long year ago he always lovingly trusted in you with a fidelity that your manifold treacheries were not able to shake he followed you about like a dog content to suffer wrong and abuse if he might only be with you patient under these injuries so long as it was your hand that inflicted them the latest picture you have of him in health and strength must be such a comfort to you you pledged your honor that if he would let you blindfold him no harm should come to him and then giggling and choking over the rare fun of the joke you led him to a brook thinly glazed with ice and pushed him in and how you did laugh man you will never forget the gentle reproachful look he gave you as he struggled shivering out if you live a thousand years oh you see it now you see it now  beast i have seen it a million times and shall see it a million more and may you rot away piecemeal and suffer till doomsday what i suffer now for bringing it back to me again  the dwarf chuckled contentedly and went on with his accusing history of my career i dropped into a moody vengeful state and suffered in silence under the merciless lash at last this remark of his gave me a sudden rouse  two months ago on a tuesday you woke up away in the night and fell to thinking with shame about a peculiarly mean and pitiful act of yours toward a poor ignorant indian in the wilds of the rocky mountains in the winter of eighteen hundred and  stop a moment devil stop do you mean to tell me that even my very thoughts are not hidden from you  it seems to look like that didnt you think the thoughts i have just mentioned  if i didnt i wish i may never breathe again look here friendlook me in the eye who are you  well who do you think  i think you are satan himself i think you are the devil  no  no then who can you be  would you really like to know  indeed i would  well i am your conscience  in an instant i was in a blaze of joy and exultation i sprang at the creature roaring  curse you i have wished a hundred million times that you were tangible and that i could get my hands on your throat once oh but i will wreak a deadly vengeance on  folly lightning does not move more quickly than my conscience did he darted aloft so suddenly that in the moment my fingers clutched the empty air he was already perched on the top of the high bookcase with his thumb at his nose in token of derision i flung the poker at him and missed i fired the bootjack in a blind rage i flew from place to place and snatched and hurled any missile that came handy the storm of books inkstands and chunks of coal gloomed the air and beat about the manikins perch relentlessly but all to no purpose the nimble figure dodged every shot and not only that but burst into a cackle of sarcastic and triumphant laughter as i sat down exhausted while i puffed and gasped with fatigue and excitement my conscience talked to this effect  my good slave you are curiously witlessno i mean characteristically so in truth you are always consistent always yourself always an ass other wise it must have occurred to you that if you attempted this murder with a sad heart and a heavy conscience i would droop under the burdening in influence instantly fool i should have weighed a ton and could not have budged from the floor but instead you are so cheerfully anxious to kill me that your conscience is as light as a feather hence i am away up here out of your reach i can almost respect a mere ordinary sort of fool but you pah  i would have given anything then to be heavyhearted so that i could get this person down from there and take his life but i could no more be heavyhearted over such a desire than i could have sorrowed over its accomplishment so i could only look longingly up at my master and rave at the ill luck that denied me a heavy conscience the one only time that i had ever wanted such a thing in my life by and by i got to musing over the hours strange adventure and of course my human curiosity began to work i set myself to framing in my mind some questions for this fiend to answer just then one of my boys entered leaving the door open behind him and exclaimed  my what has been going on here the bookcase is all one riddle of  i sprang up in consternation and shouted  out of this hurry jump fly shut the door quick or my conscience will get away  the door slammed to and i locked it i glanced up and was grateful to the bottom of my heart to see that my owner was still my prisoner i said  hang you i might have lost you children are the heedlessest creatures but look here friend the boy did not seem to notice you at all how is that  for a very good reason i am invisible to all but you  i made a mental note of that piece of information with a good deal of satisfaction i could kill this miscreant now if i got a chance and no one would know it but this very reflection made me so lighthearted that my conscience could hardly keep his seat but was like to float aloft toward the ceiling like a toy balloon i said presently  come my conscience let us be friendly let us fly a flag of truce for a while i am suffering to ask you some questions  very well begin  well then in the first place why were you never visible to me before  because you never asked to see me before that is you never asked in the right spirit and the proper form before you were just in the right spirit this time and when you called for your most pitiless enemy i was that person by a very large majority though you did not suspect it  well did that remark of mine turn you into flesh and blood  no it only made me visible to you i am unsubstantial just as other spirits are  this remark prodded me with a sharp misgiving  if he was unsubstantial how was i going to kill him but i dissembled and said persuasively  conscience it isnt sociable of you to keep at such a distance come down and take another smoke  this was answered with a look that was full of derision and with this observation added  come where you can get at me and kill me the invitation is declined with thanks  all right said i to myself so it seems a spirit can be killed after all there will be one spirit lacking in this world presently or i lose my guess then i said aloud  friend  there wait a bit i am not your friend i am your enemy i am not your equal i am your master call me my lord if you please you are too familiar  i dont like such titles i am willing to call you sir that is as far as  we will have no argument about this just obey that is all go on with your chatter  very well my lordsince nothing but my lord will suit youi was going to ask you how long you will be visible to me  always  i broke out with strong indignation this is simply an outrage that is what i think of it you have dogged and dogged and dogged me all the days of my life invisible that was misery enough now to have such a looking thing as you tagging after me like another shadow all the rest of my day is an intolerable prospect you have my opinion my lord make the most of it  my lad there was never so pleased a conscience in this world as i was when you made me visible it gives me an inconceivable advantage now i can look you straight in the eye and call you names and leer at you jeer at you sneer at you and you know what eloquence there is in visible gesture and expression more especially when the effect is heightened by audible speech i shall always address you henceforth in your own sniveling drawlbaby  i let fly with the coalhod no result my lord said  come come remember the flag of truce  ah i forgot that i will try to be civil and you try it too for a novelty the idea of a civil conscience it is a good joke an excellent joke all the consciences i have ever heard of were nagging badgering faultfinding execrable savages yes and always in a sweat about some poor little insignificant trifle or otherdestruction catch the lot of them i say i would trade mine for the smallpox and seven kinds of consumption and be glad of the chance now tell me why is it that a conscience cant haul a man over the coals once for an offense and then let him alone why is it that it wants to keep on pegging at him day and night and night and day week in and week out forever and ever about the same old thing there is no sense in that and no reason in it i think a conscience that will act like that is meaner than the very dirt itself  well we like it that suffices  do you do it with the honest intent to improve a man  that question produced a sarcastic smile and this reply  no sir excuse me we do it simply because it is business it is our trade the purpose of it is to improve the man but we are merely disinterested agents we are appointed by authority and havent anything to say in the matter we obey orders and leave the consequences where they belong but i am willing to admit this much we do crowd the orders a trifle when we get a chance which is most of the time we enjoy it we are instructed to remind a man a few times of an error and i dont mind acknowledging that we try to give pretty good measure and when we get hold of a man of a peculiarly sensitive nature oh but we do haze him i have consciences to come all the way from china and russia to see a person of that kind put through his paces on a special occasion why i knew a man of that sort who had accidentally crippled a mulatto baby the news went abroad and i wish you may never commit another sin if the consciences didnt flock from all over the earth to enjoy the fun and help his master exorcise him that man walked the floor in torture for fortyeight hours without eating or sleeping and then blew his brains out the child was perfectly well again in three weeks  well you are a precious crew not to put it too strong i think i begin to see now why you have always been a trifle inconsistent with me in your anxiety to get all the juice you can out of a sin you make a man repent of it in three or four different ways for instance you found fault with me for lying to that tramp and i suffered over that but it was only yesterday that i told a tramp the square truth to wit that it being regarded as bad citizenship to encourage vagrancy i would give him nothing what did you do then why you made me say to myself ah it would have been so much kinder and more blameless to ease him off with a little white lie and send him away feeling that if he could not have bread the gentle treatment was at least something to be grateful for well i suffered all day about that three days before i had fed a tramp and fed him freely supposing it a virtuous act straight off you said oh false citizen to have fed a tramp and i suffered as usual i gave a tramp work you objected to itafter the contract was made of course you never speak up beforehand next i refused a tramp work you objected to that next i proposed to kill a tramp you kept me awake all night oozing remorse at every pore sure i was going to be right this time i sent the next tramp away with my benediction and i wish you may live as long as i do if you didnt make me smart all night again because i didnt kill him is there any way of satisfying that malignant invention which is called a conscience  ha ha this is luxury go on  but come now answer me that question is there any way  well none that i propose to tell you my son ass i dont care what act you may turn your hand to i can straightway whisper a word in your ear and make you think you have committed a dreadful meanness it is my businessand my joyto make you repent of everything you do if i have fooled away any opportunities it was not intentional i beg to assure you it was not intentional  dont worry you havent missed a trick that i know of i never did a thing in all my life virtuous or otherwise that i didnt repent of in twentyfour hours in church last sunday i listened to a charity sermon my first impulse was to give three hundred and fifty dollars i repented of that and reduced it a hundred repented of that and reduced it another hundred repented of that and reduced it another hundred repented of that and reduced the remaining fifty to twentyfive repented of that and came down to fifteen repented of that and dropped to two dollars and a half when the plate came around at last i repented once more and contributed ten cents well when i got home i did wish to goodness i had that ten cents back again you never did let me get through a charity sermon without having something to sweat about  oh and i never shall i never shall you can always depend on me  i think so many and manys the restless night ive wanted to take you by the neck if i could only get hold of you now  yes no doubt but i am not an ass i am only the saddle of an ass but go on go on you entertain me more than i like to confess  i am glad of that you will not mind my lying a little to keep in practice look here not to be too personal i think you are about the shabbiest and most contemptible little shriveledup reptile that can be imagined i am grateful enough that you are invisible to other people for i should die with shame to be seen with such a mildewed monkey of a conscience as you are now if you were five or six feet high and  oh come who is to blame  i dont know  why you are nobody else  confound you i wasnt consulted about your personal appearance  i dont care you had a good deal to do with it nevertheless when you were eight or nine years old i was seven feet high and as pretty as a picture  i wish you had died young so you have grown the wrong way have you  some of us grow one way and some the other you had a large conscience once if youve a small conscience now i reckon there are reasons for it however both of us are to blame you and i you see you used to be conscientious about a great many things morbidly so i may say it was a great many years ago you probably do not remember it now well i took a great interest in my work and i so enjoyed the anguish which certain pet sins of yours afflicted you with that i kept pelting at you until i rather overdid the matter you began to rebel of course i began to lose ground then and shrivel a littlediminish in stature get moldy and grow deformed the more i weakened the more stubbornly you fastened on to those particular sins till at last the places on my person that represent those vices became as callous as sharkskin take smoking for instance i played that card a little too long and i lost when people plead with you at this late day to quit that vice that old callous place seems to enlarge and cover me all over like a shirt of mail it exerts a mysterious smothering effect and presently i your faithful hater your devoted conscience go sound asleep sound it is no name for it i couldnt hear it thunder at such a time you have some few other vicesperhaps eighty or maybe ninetythat affect me in much the same way  this is flattering you must be asleep a good part of your time  yes of late years i should be asleep all the time but for the help i get  who helps you  other consciences whenever a person whose conscience i am acquainted with tries to plead with you about the vices you are callous to i get my friend to give his client a pang concerning some villainy of his own and that shuts off his meddling and starts him off to hunt personal consolation my field of usefulness is about trimmed down to tramps budding authoresses and that line of goods now but dont you worryill harry you on theirs while they last just you put your trust in me  i think i can but if you had only been good enough to mention these facts some thirty years ago i should have turned my particular attention to sin and i think that by this time i should not only have had you pretty permanently asleep on the entire list of human vices but reduced to the size of a homeopathic pill at that that is about the style of conscience i am pining for if i only had you shrunk you down to a homeopathic pill and could get my hands on you would i put you in a glass case for a keepsake no sir i would give you to a yellow dog that is where you ought to beyou and all your tribe you are not fit to be in society in my opinion now another question do you know a good many consciences in this section  plenty of them  i would give anything to see some of them could you bring them here and would they be visible to me  certainly not  i suppose i ought to have known that without asking but no matter you can describe them tell me about my neighbor thompsons conscience please  very well i know him intimately have known him many years i knew him when he was eleven feet high and of a faultless figure but he is very pasty and tough and misshapen now and hardly ever interests himself about anything as to his present sizewell he sleeps in a cigarbox  likely enough there are few smaller meaner men in this region than hugh thompson do you know robinsons conscience  yes he is a shade under four and a half feet high used to be a blond is a brunette now but still shapely and comely  well robinson is a good fellow do you know tom smiths conscience  i have known him from childhood he was thirteen inches high and rather sluggish when he was two years oldas nearly all of us are at that age he is thirtyseven feet high now and the stateliest figure in america his legs are still racked with growingpains but he has a good time nevertheless never sleeps he is the most active and energetic member of the new england conscience club is president of it night and day you can find him pegging away at smith panting with his labor sleeves rolled up countenance all alive with enjoyment he has got his victim splendidly dragooned now he can make poor smith imagine that the most innocent little thing he does is an odious sin and then he sets to work and almost tortures the soul out of him about it  smith is the noblest man in all this section and the purest and yet is always breaking his heart because he cannot be good only a conscience could find pleasure in heaping agony upon a spirit like that do you know my aunt marys conscience  i have seen her at a distance but am not acquainted with her she lives in the open air altogether because no door is large enough to admit her  i can believe that let me see do you know the conscience of that publisher who once stole some sketches of mine for a series of his and then left me to pay the law expenses i had to incur in order to choke him off  yes he has a wide fame he was exhibited a month ago with some other antiquities for the benefit of a recent member of the cabinets conscience that was starving in exile tickets and fares were high but i traveled for nothing by pretending to be the conscience of an editor and got in for halfprice by representing myself to be the conscience of a clergyman however the publishers conscience which was to have been the main feature of the entertainment was a failureas an exhibition he was there but what of that the management had provided a microscope with a magnifying power of only thirty thousand diameters and so nobody got to see him after all there was great and general dissatisfaction of course but  just here there was an eager footstep on the stair i opened the door and my aunt mary burst into the room it was a joyful meeting and a cheery bombardment of questions and answers concerning family matters ensued by and by my aunt said  but i am going to abuse you a little now you promised me the day i saw you last that you would look after the needs of the poor family around the corner as faithfully as i had done it myself well i found out by accident that you failed of your promise was that right  in simple truth i never had thought of that family a second time and now such a splintering pang of guilt shot through me i glanced up at my conscience plainly my heavy heart was affecting him his body was drooping forward he seemed about to fall from the bookcase my aunt continued  and think how you have neglected my poor protege at the almshouse you dear hardhearted promisebreaker i blushed scarlet and my tongue was tied as the sense of my guilty negligence waxed sharper and stronger my conscience began to sway heavily back and forth and when my aunt after a little pause said in a grieved tone since you never once went to see her maybe it will not distress you now to know that that poor child died months ago utterly friendless and forsaken my conscience could no longer bear up under the weight of my sufferings but tumbled headlong from his high perch and struck the floor with a dull leaden thump he lay there writhing with pain and quaking with apprehension but straining every muscle in frantic efforts to get up in a fever of expectancy i sprang to the door locked it placed my back against it and bent a watchful gaze upon my struggling master already my fingers were itching to begin their murderous work  oh what can be the matter exclaimed by aunt shrinking from me and following with her frightened eyes the direction of mine my breath was coming in short quick gasps now and my excitement was almost uncontrollable my aunt cried out  oh do not look so you appal me oh what can the matter be what is it you see why do you stare so why do you work your fingers like that  peace woman i said in a hoarse whisper look elsewhere pay no attention to me it is nothingnothing i am often this way it will pass in a moment it comes from smoking too much  my injured lord was up wildeyed with terror and trying to hobble toward the door i could hardly breathe i was so wrought up my aunt wrung her hands and said  oh i knew how it would be i knew it would come to this at last oh i implore you to crush out that fatal habit while it may yet be time you must not you shall not be deaf to my supplications longer my struggling conscience showed sudden signs of weariness oh promise me you will throw off this hateful slavery of tobacco my conscience began to reel drowsily and grope with his handsenchanting spectacle i beg you i beseech you i implore you your reason is deserting you there is madness in your eye it flames with frenzy oh hear me hear me and be saved see i plead with you on my very knees as she sank before me my conscience reeled again and then drooped languidly to the floor blinking toward me a last supplication for mercy with heavy eyes oh promise or you are lost promise and be redeemed promise promise and live with a longdrawn sigh my conquered conscience closed his eyes and fell fast asleep  with an exultant shout i sprang past my aunt and in an instant i had my lifelong foe by the throat after so many years of waiting and longing he was mine at last i tore him to shreds and fragments i rent the fragments to bits i cast the bleeding rubbish into the fire and drew into my nostrils the grateful incense of my burntoffering at last and forever my conscience was dead  i was a free man i turned upon my poor aunt who was almost petrified with terror and shouted  out of this with your paupers your charities your reforms your pestilent morals you behold before you a man whose lifeconflict is done whose soul is at peace a man whose heart is dead to sorrow dead to suffering dead to remorse a man without a conscience in my joy i spare you though i could throttle you and never feel a pang fly  she fled since that day my life is all bliss bliss unalloyed bliss nothing in all the world could persuade me to have a conscience again i settled all my old outstanding scores and began the world anew i killed thirtyeight persons during the first two weeksall of them on account of ancient grudges i burned a dwelling that interrupted my view i swindled a widow and some orphans out of their last cow which is a very good one though not thoroughbred i believe i have also committed scores of crimes of various kinds and have enjoyed my work exceedingly whereas it would formerly have broken my heart and turned my hair gray i have no doubt  in conclusion i wish to state by way of advertisement that medical colleges desiring assorted tramps for scientific purposes either by the gross by cord measurement or per ton will do well to examine the lot in my cellar before purchasing elsewhere as these were all selected and prepared by myself and can be had at a low rate because i wish to clear out my stock and get ready for the spring trade
