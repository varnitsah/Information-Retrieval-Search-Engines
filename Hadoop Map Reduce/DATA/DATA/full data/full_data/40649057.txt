 st michael does battle     chapter i  a cornish landlord   then you dont care for the place yourself tyrrel eustace le neve said musingly as he gazed in front of him with a comprehensive glance at the long gray moor and the wide expanse of black and stormy water  its bleak of course bleak and cold i grant you all this upland plateau about the lizard promontory seems bleak and cold everywhere but to my mind it has a certain wild and weird picturesqueness of its own for all that it aims at gloominess i confess in its own way i dont dislike it  for my part tyrrel answered clinching his hand hard as he spoke and knitting his brow despondently i simply hate it if i wasnt the landlord here to be perfectly frank with you id never come near penmorgan i do it for conscience sake to be among my own people thats my only reason i disapprove of absenteeism and now the lands mine why i must put up with it i suppose and live upon it in spite of myself but i do it against the grain the whole place if i tell you the truth is simply detestable to me  he leaned on his stick as he spoke and looked down gloomily at the heather a handsome young man walter tyrrel of the true cornish typetall dark poeticallooking with pensive eyes and a thick black mustache which gave dignity and character to his otherwise almost too delicately feminine features and he stood on the open moor just a hundred yards outside his own front door at penmorgan on the lizard peninsula looking westward down a great wedgeshaped gap in the solid serpentine rock to a broad belt of sea beyond without a ship or a sail on it the view was indeed as eustace le neve admitted a somewhat bleak and dreary one for miles as far as the eye could reach on either side nothing was to be seen but one vast heather clad upland just varied at the dip by bare ledges of dark rock and a single gray glimpse of tossing sea between them a little farther on to be sure winding round the cliff path one could open up a glorious prospect on either hand over the rocky islets of kynance and mullion cove with mounts bay and penzance and the lands end in the distance that was a magnificent siteif only his ancestors had had the sense to see it but penmorgan house like most other cornish landlords houses had been carefully placedfor shelters sake no doubtin a seaward hollow where the view was most restricted and the outlook one got from it over black moor and blacker rocks was certainly by no means of a cheerful character eustace le neve himself most cheery and sanguine of men just home from his south american railwaylaying and with the luxuriant vegetation of the argentine still fresh in his mind was forced to admit as he looked about him that the position of his friends house on that rolling brown moor was far from a smiling one  you used to come here when you were a boy though he objected after a pause with a glance at the great breakers that curled in upon the cove and you must surely have found it pleasant enough then what with the bathing and the fishing and the shooting and the boating and all the delights of the sea and the country  walter tyrrel nodded his head it was clear the subject was extremely distasteful to him  yestill i was twelve or thirteen he said slowly as one who grudges assent in my uncles time i liked it well enough no doubt boys dont realize the full terror of sea or cliff you know and are perfectly happy swimming and climbing i used to be amphibious in those days like a seal or an otterin the water half my time and i scrambled over the rocksgreat heavens it makes me giddy now just to think where i scrambled but when i was about thirteen years oldhis face grew graver stilla change seemed to come over me and i began    well i began to hate penmorgan ive hated it ever since i shall always hate it i learned what it all meant i supposerocks wrecks and accidents i saw how dull and gloomy it was and i couldnt bear coming down here i came as seldom as i dared till my uncle died last year and left it to me and then there was no help for it i had to come down its a landlords business i consider to live among his tenants and look after the welfare of the soil committed to his charge by his queen and country he holds it in trust strictly speaking for the nation so i felt i must come and live here but i hate it all the same i hate it i hate it  he said it so energetically and with such strange earnestness in his voice that eustace le neve scanning his face as he spoke felt sure there must be some good reason for his friends dislike of his ancestral home and forebore like a man to question him further perhaps he thought it was connected in tyrrels mind with some painful memory some episode in his history he would gladly forget though to be sure when one comes to think of it at thirteen such episodes are rare and improbable a man doesnt as a rule get crossed in love at that early age nor does he generally form lasting and abiding antipathies and indeed for the matter of that penmorgan was quite gloomy enough in itself in all conscience to account for his dislikea lonely and gauntlooking granitebuilt house standing bare and square on the edge of a black moor under shelter of a rocky dip in a treeless country it must have been a terrible change for a bachelor about town like walter tyrrel to come down at twentyeight from his luxurious club and his snug chambers in st james to the isolation and desolation of that wild cornish manorhouse but the tyrrels he knew were all built like that le neve had been with three of the family at rugby and conscience was their stumbling block when once a tyrrel was convinced his duty lay anywhere no consideration on earth would keep him from doing it  lets take a stroll down by the shore le neve suggested carelessly after a short pause slipping his arm through his friends  your cliffs at least must be fine they look grand and massive and after three years of broiling on a south american line this fresh souwesters just the thing to my mind to blow the cobwebs out of one  he was a breezylooking young man this newcomer from beyond the sea a son of the vikings tyrrels contemporary in age but very unlike him in form and features for eustace le neve was fair and bigbuilt a florid young giant with tawny beard mustache and whiskers which he cut in a becoming vandyke point of artistic carelessness there was more of the artist than of the engineer indeed about his frank and engaging english facea face which made one like him as soon as one looked at him it was impossible to do otherwise exuberant vitality was the keynote of the mans being and he was candidly open too he impressed one at first sight by some nameless instinct with a certain wellfounded friendly confidence a lovable soul if ever there was one equally liked at once by men and women  our cliffs are fine walter tyrrel answered grudgingly in the tone of one who against his will admits an adverse point he sees no chance of gainsaying theyre black and repellant and ironbound and dangerous but theyre certainly magnificent i dont deny it come and see them by all means theyre the only lions we have to show a stranger in this part of cornwall so youd better make the most of them  and he took as if mechanically the winding path that led down the gap toward the frowning cove in the wall of cliff before them  eustace le neve was a little surprised at this unexpected course for he himself would naturally have made rather for the top of the promontory whence they were certain to obtain a much finer and more extensive view but he had only arrived at penmorgan the evening before so he bowed at once to his companions more mature experience of cornish scenery they threaded their way through the gully for it was little morea great waterworn rent in the dark serpentine rocks with the sea at its lower endpicking their path as they went along huge granite boulders or across fallen stones till they reached a small beach of firm white sand on whose even floor the waves were rolling in and curling over magnificently it was a curious place eustace thought rather dreary than beautiful on either side rose black cliffs towering sheer into the air and shutting out overhead all but a narrow cleft of murky sky around the sea dashed itself in angry white foam against broken stacks and tiny weedclad skerries at the end of the first point a solitary islet just separated from the mainland by a channel of seething water jutted above into the waves with hanging tresses of blue and yellow seaweed tyrrel pointed to it with one hand thats michaels crag he said laconically youve seen it before no doubt in half a dozen pictures its shaped exactly like st michaels mount in miniature a marine painter fellow down heres forever taking its portrait  le neve gazed around him with a certain slight shudder of unspoken disapprobation this place didnt suit his sunny nature it was even blacker and more dismal than the brown moorland above it tyrrel caught the dissatisfaction in his companions eye before le neve had time to frame it in words  well you dont think much of it he said inquiringly  i cant say i do le neve answered with apologetic frankness i suppose south america has spoilt me for this sort of thing but its not to my taste i call it gloomy without being even impressive  gloomy tyrrel answered oh yes gloomy certainly but impressive well yes for myself i think so to me its all terribly unspeakably ineffably impressive i come here every day and sit close on the sands and look out upon the sea by the edge of the breakers its the only place on this awful coast one feels perfectly safe in you cant tumble over here orroll anything down to do harm to anybody  a steep cliff path led up the sheer face of the rock to southward it was a difficult path a mere foothold on the ledges but its difficulty at once attracted the engineers attention lets go up that way he said waving his hand toward it carelessly the view from on top there must be infinitely finer  i believe it is tyrrel replied in an unconcerned voice like one who retails vague hearsay evidence i havent seen it myself since i was a boy of thirteen i never go along the top of the cliffs on any account  le neve gazed down on him astonished you believe it is he exclaimed unable to conceal his surprise and wonder you never go up there why walter how odd of you i was reading up the guidebook this morning before breakfast and it says the walk from this point on the penmorgan estate to kynance cove is the most magnificent bit of wild cliff scenery anywhere in cornwall  so im told tyrrel answered unmoved and i remember as a boy i thought it very fine but that was long since i never go by it  why not le neve cried  tyrrel shrugged his shoulders and shook himself impatiently i dont know he answered in a testy sort of voice i dont like the cliff top its so dangerous dont you know so unsafe so unstable the rocks go off so sheer and stones topple over so easily  le neve laughed a little laugh of halfdisguised contempt he was moving over toward the path up the cliff side as they spoke why you used to be a firstclass climber at school he said attempting it especially when you were a little chap i remember you could scramble up trees like a monkey what fun we had once in the doctors orchard and as to the cliffs you neednt go so near you have to tumble over them it seems ridiculous for a landowner not to know a bit of scenery on his own estate thats celebrated and talked about all over england  im not afraid of tumbling over for myself tyrrel answered a little nettled by his friends frank tone of amusement i dont feel myself so useful to my queen and country that i rate my own life at too high a figure its the people below im chiefly concerned about theres always someone wandering and scrambling about these cliffs dont you seefishermen tourists geologists if you let a loose stone go it may fall upon them and crush them  the engineer looked back upon him with a somewhat puzzled expression well thats carrying conscience a point too far he said with one strong hand on the rock and one sure foot in the first convenient cranny if were not to climb cliffs for fear of showering down stones on those who stand below we wont dare to walk or ride or drive or put to sea for fear of running over or colliding against somebody we shall have to stop all our trains and keep all our steamers in harbor theres nothing in this world quite free from risk weve got to take it and lump it you know the old joke about those dangerous bedsso many people die in them wont you break your rule just for once and come up on top here to see the view with me  tyrrel shook his head firmly not today he answered with a quiet smile not by that path at any rate its too risky for my taste the stones are so loose and it overhangs the road the quarrymen go to the cave by  le neve had now made good his foothold up the first four or five steps well youve no objection to my going at any rate he said with a wave of one hand in his cheerful goodhumor you dont put a veto on your friends here do you  oh not the least objection tyrrel answered hurriedly watching him climb none the less with nervous interest itsits a purely personal and individual feeling besides he added after a pause i can stop below here if need be and warn the quarrymen  ill be back in ten minutes le neve shouted from the cliff  no dont hurry his host shouted back take your own time its safest once you get to the top youd better walk along the whole cliff path to kynance they tell me its splendid the views so wide and you can easily get back across the moor by lunchtime only mind about the edge and whatever you do let no stones roll over  all right le neve made answer clinging close to a point of rock ill do no damage its opening out beautifully on every side now i can see round the corner to st michaels mount and the point at the end there must be tolpednpenwith     chapter ii  trevennack   it was a stiff hot climb to the top of the cliff but as soon as he reached it eustace le neve gazed about him enchanted at the outlook he was not in love with cornwall as far as hed seen it yet and to say the truth except in a few broken seaward glens that high and barren inland plateau has little in it to attract or interest anyone least of all a traveler fresh from the rich luxuriance of south american vegetation but the view that burst suddenly upon eustace le neves eye as he gained the summit of that precipitous serpentine bluff fairly took his breath away it was a rich and varied one to the north and west loomed headland after headland walled in by steep crags and stretching away in purple perspective toward marazion st michaels mount and the penzance district to the south and east huge masses of fallen rock lay tossed in wild confusion over kynance cove and the neighboring bays with the bare boss of the rill and the rearing horse in the foreground le neve stood and looked with open eyes of delight it was the first beautiful view he had seen since he came to cornwall but this at least was beautiful almost enough so to compensate for his first acute disappointment at the barrenness and gloom of the lizard scenery  for some minutes he could only stand with open eyes and gaze delighted at the glorious prospect cliffs sea and rocks all blended with one another in solemn harmony even the blackness of the great crags and the scorched air of the brown and waterlogged moorland in the rear now ceased to oppress him they fell into their proper place in one consistent and wellblended picture but after awhile impelled by a desire to look down upon the next little bay beyondfor the coast is indented with endless coves and headlandsthe engineer walked on along the top by a coastguards path that threaded its way marked by whitened stones round the points and gullies as he did so he happened to notice on the very crest of the ridge that overlooked the rock they called st michaels crag a tall figure of a man silhouetted in dark outline against the pale gray skyline from the very first moment eustace le neve set eyes upon that striking figure this man exerted upon him some nameless attraction even at this distance the engineer could see he had a certain indefinite air of dignity and distinction and he poised himself lightly on the very edge of the cliff in a way that would no doubt have made walter tyrrel shudder with fear and alarm yet there was something about that poise quite unearthly and uncanny the man stood so airily on his high rocky perch that he reminded le neve at once of nothing so much as of giovanni da bolognas mercury in the bargello at florence he seemed to spurn the earth as if about to spring from it with a bound his feet were as if freed from the common bond of gravity  it was a figure that belonged naturally to the cornish moorland  le neve advanced along the path till he nearly reached the summit where the man was standing the point itself was a rugged tor or little group of bare and weatherworn rocks overlooking the sea and st michaels crag below it as the engineer drew near he saw the stranger was not alone under shelter of the rocks a girl lay stretched at length on a loose camelshair rug her head was hatless in her hand she held half open a volume of poetry she looked up as eustace passed and he noted at a glance that she was dark and pretty the cornish type once more bright black eyes glossy brown hair a rich complexion a soft and rounded beauty  cleer the father said warningly in a modulated voice as the young man approached dont let your hat blow away dear its close by the path there  the girl he called cleer darted forward and picked it up with a little blush of confusion eustace le neve raised his hat by way of excuse for disturbing her and was about to pass on but the view down into the bay below with the jagged and pointed crag islanded in white foam held him spellbound for a moment he paused and gazed at it this is a lovely lookout sir he said after a seconds silence as if to apologize for his intrusion turning round to the stranger who still stood poised like a statue on the natural pedestal of lichen covered rock beside him a lovely lookout and a wonderful bit of wild coast scenery  yes the stranger answered in a voice as full of dignity as his presence and his mien its the grandest spot along the cornish coast from here you can see in one view st michaels mount st michaels crag st michaels church and st michaels promontory the whole of this country indeed just teems with st michael  which is st michaels promontory the young man asked with a side glance at cleer as they called the daughter he wasnt sorry indeed for the chance of having a second look at her  why lands end of course the dignified stranger answered at once descending from his perch as he spoke with a light spring more like a boys than a mature mans you must surely know those famous lines in lycidas about                                            the fable of bellerus old     where the great vision of the guarded mount     looks towards namancos and bayonas hold     look homeward angel now and melt with ruth  yes i know them of course eustace answered with ingenuous shyness but as so often happens with poetry to say the truth im afraid i attached no very definite idea to them the music so easily obscures the sense though the moment you suggest it i see they cant possibly mean anyone but st michael  my fathers very much interested in the antiquities of cornwall the girl cleer put in looking up at him somewhat timidly so he naturally knows all these things and perhaps he expects others to know them unreasonably  weve every ground for knowing them the father went on glancing down at her with tender affection were cornish to the backbone cornish born and bred if ever there were cornishmen every man of my ancestors was a tre pol or pen to the tenth generation backward and im descended from the bassets toothe bassets of tehidy you must have heard of the bassets in cornish history they owned st michaels mount before these newfangled st aubyn people  its lord st levans now isnt it le neve put in anxious to show off his knowledge of the local aristocracy  yes theyve made him lord st levan the dignified stranger answered with an almost imperceptible curl of his delicate lower lip theyve made him lord st levan the queen can make one anything he was plain sir john st aubyn before that you know his family bought the mount from my ancestorsthe bassets of tehidy theyre new people at marazionnew people altogether theyve only been there since 1660  le neve smiled a quiet smile that seemed to him in his innocence a fairly decent antiquity as things go nowadays but the dignified stranger appeared to think so little of it that his new acquaintance abstained from making note or comment on it he waited half a moment to see whether cleer would speak again he wanted to hear that pleasant voice once more but as she held her peace he merely raised his hat and accepting the dismissal continued his walk round the cliffs alone yet somehow the rest of the way the figure of that statuesque stranger haunted him he looked back once or twice the descendant of the bassets of tehidy had now resumed his high pedestal upon the airy tor and was gazing away seaward like the mystic great vision of his own miltonic quotation toward the spanish coast wrapped round in a loose cloak of most poetic dimensions le neve wondered who he was and what errand could have brought him there  at the point called the rill he diverged from the path a bit to get that beautiful glimpse down into the rockstrewn cove and smooth white sands at kynance a coastguard with brush and pail was busy as he passed by renewing the whitewash on the landmark boulders that point the path on dark nights to the stumbling wayfarer le neve paused and spoke to him thats a finelooking man my friend the gentleman on the tor there he said after a few commonplaces do you happen to know his name is he spending the summer about here  the man stopped in his work and looked up his eye lighted with pleasure on the dignified stranger yes hes one of the right sort sir he answered with a sort of proprietary pride in the distinguished figure a real old cornish gentleman of the good old days he is if ever you see one thats trevennack of trevennack and miss cleers his daughter fine old crusted cornish names every one of them im a cornishman myself and i know them well the whole grand lot of them the trevennacks and the bassets they was all one time gone by they owned st michaels mount and penzance and marazion and mullion here they owned penmorgan too afore the tyrrels bought it up michael basset trevennack thats the gentlemans full name the eldest son of the eldest son is always a michael to keep up the memory of the times gone by when they was guardians of the mount and st michaels constables and the ladys miss cleer after st cleer of cornwallher that gives her name still to st cleer by liskeard  and do they live here le neve asked much interested in the intelligent local tone of the mans conversation  lord bless you no sir they dont live nowhere theyre in the service dont you see they lives in malta or gibraltar or wherever the admiralty sends him hes an admiralty man he is connected with the vittling yard i was in the navy myself on the good old billy ruffun afore i was put in the coastguards and i knowed him well when we was both together on the mediterranean station always the same grand old cornish gentleman with them gracious manners so haughty like an yet so condescending wherever they put him a gentleman born no gentleman on earth more the gentleman all round than trevennack of trevennack  then hes staying down here on a visit le neve went on curiously peering over the edge of the cliffs as he spoke to observe the cormorants  dont you go too nigh sir the coastguard put in warningly shes slippery just there yes theyre staying down in olivers lodgings at gunwalloe hes on leave thats where it is every three or four years he gets leave from the vittling and comes home to england and then he always ups and runs down to the lizard and wanders about on the cliffs by himself like this with miss cleer to keep him company hes a chip of the old rock he iscornish granite to the core as the saying goes and he cant be happy away from it youll see him any day standing like that on the very edge of the cliff looking across over the water as if he was a coastguard hisself and always sort o perched on the highest bit of rock he can come nigh anywhere  he looks an able man le neve went on still regarding the stranger poised now as before on the very summit of the tor with his cloak wrapped around him  able i believe you why hes the very heart and soul the brains and senses of the vittling department the navyd starve if it wasnt for him hes a companion of st michael and st george mr trevennack is taint every one as is a companion of st michael and st george the queen made him that herself for his management of the vittling its a strange place for a man in his position to spend his holiday le neve went on reflectively youd think coming back so seldom hed want to see something of london brighton scarborough scotland  the coastguard looked up and held his brush idle in one hand with a mysterious air not when you come to know his history he answered gazing hard at him  oh theres a history to him is there le neve answered not surprised well he certainly has the look of it  the coastguard nodded his head and dropped his voice still lower yes theres a history to him he replied and thats why youll always see trevennack of trevennack on the top of the cliff and never at the bottomthankee very kindly sir it aint often we gets a chance of a good cigar at kynancewell it must be fifteen year now or maybe sixteeni dont mind the right timetrevennack came down in old squire tyrrels days him as is buried at mullion church town and stopped at gunwalloe same as he might be stopping there in his lodgings nowadays he had his only son with him too a finelooking young gentleman they say for his age for i wasnt here theni was serving my time under admiral de horsey on the good old billy ruffun the very picture of miss cleer and twelve year old or thereabouts and they called him master michael the same as they always call the eldest boy of the trevennacks of trevennack aye and one day they two father and son were astrolling on the beach under the cliffs by penmorganmind them stones on the edge sir theyre powerful loose dont you drop none overwhen just as you might loosen them pebbles there with your foot over came a shower o small bits from the cliff on top and as sure as youre livin hit the two on em right so sir mr trevennack himself he wasnt much hurtjust bruised a bit on the forehead for he was wearing a scotch cap but master michael well it caught him right on the top of the head and afore they knowed what it was it smashed his skull in aye that it did sir just so it smashed the boys skull in they carried him home and cut the bone out and trepanned him but bless you it want no good he lingered on for a night and then afore morning he died insensible  what a terrible story le neve exclaimed with a face of horror recoiling instinctively from the edge of the cliff that had wrought this evil aye you may well say so it was rough on him the coastguard went on with the calm criticism of his kind his only sonand all in a minute like as you may term itsuch a promising young gentleman it was rough terrible rough on him so from that day to this whenever trevennack has a holiday down he comes here to gunwalloe and walks about the cliffs and looks across upon the rocks by penmorgan point or stands on the top of michaels crag just over against the spot where his boy was hurted an he never wants to go nowhere else in all england but just to stand like that on the very edge of the cliff and look over from atop and brood and think about it  as the man spoke it flashed across le neves mind at once that trevennacks voice had quivered with a strange thrill of emotion as he uttered that line no doubt pregnant with meaning for him look homeward angel now and melt with ruth he was thinking of his own boy most likely not of the poets feigned lycidas  hell stand like that for hours the coastguard went on confidentially musing like to himself with miss cleer by his side reading in her book or doing her knitting or something but you couldnt get him for love or money to go below the cliffs no not if you was to kill him hes afraid of going belowthats where it is he always thinks somethings sure to tumble from the top on him natural enough too after all thats been he likes to get as high as ever he can in the air where he can see all around him and be certain there aint anyone above to let anything drop as might hurt him michaels crags where he likes best to stand on the top there by the horse he always chooses them spots in malta it was san mickayly and in gibraltar it was the summit of europa point by the edge of the twelve apostles battery  how curious le neve exclaimed its just the other way on now with my friend mr tyrrel im stopping at penmorgan but mr tyrrel wont go on top of the cliffs for anything he says hes afraid he might let something drop by accident on the people below him  the coastguard grew suddenly graver like enough he said stroking his chin like enough and right too for him sir you see hes a tyrrel and hes bound to be cautious  why so le neve asked somewhat puzzled why a tyrrel more than the rest of us  the man hesitated and stared hard at him  well its like this sir he answered at last with the shamefaced air of the intelligent laboring man who confesses to a superstition we cornish are oldfashioned and we has our ideas the tyrrels are new people like in cornwall as we say they came in only with cromwells folk when he fought the grenvilles but its well beknown in the county bad luck goes with them you see theyre descended from that sir walter tyrrel youll read about in the history books him as killed king william rufious in the new forest youll hear all about it at rufious stone where the king was killed sir walter he drew and he aimed at a deer and the king was standing by and the bullet it glanced asideor maybe it was afore bullets and then itd be an arrow but anyhow one or tother it hit the king and he fell and died there the stones standing to this day on the place where he fell and ive seen it and read of it when i was in hospital at netley but sir walter he got clear away and ran across to france and ever since that time theyve called the eldest son of the tyrrels walter same as theyve called the eldest son of the trevennacks michael but they say every walter tyrrel thats born into the world is bound sooner or later to kill his man unintentional so he do right to avoid going too near the cliffs i say we shouldnt tempt providence and the tyrrels is all a conscientious people     chapter iii  face to face   when eustace le neve returned to lunch at penmorgan that day he was silent to his host about trevennack of trevennack to say the truth he was so much attracted by miss cleers appearance that he didnt feel inclined to mention having met her but he wanted to meet her again for all that and hoped he would do so perhaps tyrrel might know the family and ask them round to dine some night at any rate society is rare at the lizard sooner or later he felt sure hed knock up against the mysterious stranger somewhere and that involved the probability of knocking up against the mysterious strangers beautiful daughter  next morning after breakfast however he made a vigorous effort to induce walter tyrrel to mount the cliff and look at the view from penmorgan point toward the rill and kynance it was absurd he said truly for the proprietor of such an estate never to have seen the most beautiful spot in it but tyrrel was obdurate on the point of actually mounting the cliff itself he wouldnt yield one jot or tittle only after much persuasion he consented at last to cross the headland by the fields at the back and come out at the tor above st michaels crag provided always eustace would promise hed neither go near the edge himself nor try to induce his friend to approach it  satisfied with this lame compromisefor he really wished his host to enjoy that glorious vieweustace le neve turned up the valley behind the house with walter tyrrel by his side and after traversing several fields through gaps in the stone walls led out his companion at last to the tor on the headland  as they approached it from behind the engineer observed not without a faint thrill of pleasure that trevennacks stately figure stood upright as before upon the windswept pile of fissured rocks and that cleer sat reading under its shelter to leeward but by her side this morning sat also an elder lady whom eustace instinctively recognized as her mothera graceful dignified lady with silvery white hair and black cornish eyes and features not untinged by the mellowing hallowing air of a great sorrow  le neve raised his hat as they drew near with a pleased smile of welcome and trevennack and his daughter both bowed in return a glorious morning the engineer said drinking in to the full the lovely golden haze that flooded and halfobscured the lands end district and trevennack assented gravely the crag stands up well in this sunshine against the dark water behind he said waving one gracious hand toward the island at his foot and poising lighter than ever  oh take care walter tyrrel cried looking up at him on tenterhooks its so dangerous up there you might tumble any minute  i never tumble trevennack made answer with solemn gravity spreading one hand on either side as if to balance himself like an acrobat but he descended as he spoke and took his place beside them  tyrrel looked at the view and looked at the pretty girl it was evident he was quite as much struck by the one as by the other indeed of the two cleer seemed to attract the larger share of his attention for some minutes they stood and talked all five of them together without further introduction than their common admiration for that exquisite bay in which trevennack appeared to take an almost proprietary interest it gratified him obviously a cornish man that these strangers as he thought them should be so favorably impressed by his native county but tyrrel all the while looked ill at ease though he sidled away as far as possible from the edge of the cliff and sat down near cleer at a safe distance from the precipice he was silent and preoccupied that mattered but little however as the rest did all the talking especially trevennack who turned out to be indeed a perfect treasurehouse of cornish antiquities and cornish folklore  i generally stand below on top of michaels crag he said to eustace pointing it out when the tide allows it but when its high as it is now such a roaring and seething scour sets through the channel between the rock and the mainland that no swimmer could stem it and then i come up here and look down from above upon it its the finest point on all our cornish coast this point we stand on it has the widest view the purest air the hardest rock the highest and most fantastic tor of any of them  my husbands quite an enthusiast for this particular place mrs trevennack interposed watching his face as she spoke with a certain anxious and illdisguised wifely solicitude  hes come here for years it has many associations for us  some painful and some happy cleer added half aloud and tyrrel nodding assent looked at her as if expecting some marked recognition  you should see it in the pilchard season her father went on turning suddenly to eustace with much animation in his voice thats the time for cornwalla month or so later than nowyou should see it then for picturesqueness and variety when the corn is in the shock says our cornish rhyme then the fish are off the rockand the rocks st michaels the huer as we call him for he gives the hue and cry from the hilltop lookout when the fish are coming he stands on michaels crag just below there as i stand myself so often and when he sights the shoals by the ripple on the water he motions to the boats which way to go for the pilchards then the rowers in the lurkers as we call our seineboats surround the shoal with a tuck net or drag the seine into mullion cove all alive with a mass of shimmering silver the jowsters come down with their carts on to the beach and hawk them about round the neighborhoodive seen them twelve a penny while in the curinghouses theyre bulking them and pressing them as if for dear life to send away to genoa leghorn and naples thats where all our fish goto the catholic south the pope and the pilchards says our cornish toast for its the friday fast that makes our only market  you can see them on st georges island in looe harbor cleer put in quite innocently theyre like a sea of silver thereon st georges island  my dear her father corrected with that grave oldfashioned courtesy which the coastguard had noted and described as at once so haughty and yet so condescending how often ive begged of you not to call it st georges island its st nicholas and st michaelsone may as well be correctand till a very recent date a chapel to st michael actually stood there upon the rocky top it was only destroyed you remember at the time of the reformation  everybody calls it st georges now cleer answered with girlish persistence and her father looked round at her sharply with an impatient snap of the fingers while mrs trevennacks eye was fixed on him now more carefully and more earnestly tyrrel observed than ever  i wonder why it is eustace le neve interposed to spare cleers feelings that so many high places tops of mountains and so forth seem always to be dedicated to st michael in particular he seems to love such airy sites theres st michaels mount here you know and mont st michel in normandy and at le puy in auvergne theres a st michaels rock and at ever so many other places i cant remember this minute  trevennack was in his element the question just suited him he smiled a curious smile of superior knowledge youve come to the right place for information he said blandly turning round to the engineer im a companion of st michael and st george myself and my family as i told you once owned st michaels mount so for that and various other reasons ive made a special study of st michael the archangel and all that pertains to him and then he went on to give a long and learned disquisition which le neve and walter tyrrel only partially followed about the connection between st michael and the celtic race as well as about the archangels peculiar love for high and airy situations most of the time indeed le neve was more concerned in watching cleer trevennacks eyes as her father spoke than in listening to the civil servants profound dissertation he gathered however from the part he caught that st michael the archangel had been from early days a very important and powerful cornish personage and that he clung to high places on the tors and rocks because he had to fight and subdue the prince of the air whom he always destroyed at last on some pointed pinnacle and now that he came to think of it eustace vaguely recollected he had always seen st michael in pictures or stained glass windows delineated just so with drawn sword and warriors mienin the act of triumphing over his dragonlike enemy on the airy summit of some tall jagged crag or rockbound precipice  as for mrs trevennack she watched her husband every moment he spoke with a close and watchful care which le neve hardly noticed but which didnt for a minute escape walter tyrrels more piercing and observant scrutiny  at last as the amateur lecturer was beginning to grow somewhat prolix a cormorant below created a slight diversion for awhile by settling in his flight on the very highest point of michaels crag and proceeding to preen his glittering feathers in the full golden flood of that bright august sunlight  with irrepressible boyish instinct le neve took up a stone and was just on the point of aiming it quite without reason at the bird on the pinnacle  but before he could let it go the two other men moved as if by a single impulse had sprung forward with a bound and in the selfsame tone and in the selfsame words cried out with one accord in a wildly excited voice for gods sake dont throw you dont know how dangerous it is  le neve let his hand drop flat and allowed the stone to fall from it as he did so the two others stood back a pace as if guarding him but kept their hands still ready to seize the engineers arm if he made the slightest attempt at motion eustace felt they were watching him as one might watch a madman for a moment they were silent trevennack was the first to speak his voice had an earnest and solemn ring in it like a reproving angels how can you tell what precious life may be passing below he said with stern emphasis fixing le neve with his reproachful eye the stone might fall short it might drop out of sight you might kill whomsoever it struck unseen and thenhe drank in a deep breath gaspingyou would know you were a murderer  walter tyrrel drew himself up at the words like one stung no no not a murderer he cried not quite as bad as a murderer it wouldnt be murder surely it would be accidental homicide unintentional unwilleda terrible result of most culpable carelessness of course but it wouldnt be quite murder dont call it murder i cant allow that not that name by any means   though to the end of your life eustace if you were to kill a man so youd never cease to regret it and mourn over it daily youd never cease to repent your guilty carelessness in sackcloth and ashes  he spoke so seriously so earnestly with such depth of personal feeling that trevennack starting back stood and gazed at him slowly with those terrible eyes like one who awakens by degrees from a painful dream to some awful reality tyrrel winced before his scrutiny for a moment the elder man just looked at him and stared then he took one step forward sir he said in a very low voice half broken with emotion i had a dear son of my own once a very dear dear son he was killed by such an accident on this very spot no wonder i remember it  mrs trevennack and cleer both gave a start of surprise the mans words astonished them for never before during fifteen long years had that unhappy father alluded in any way in overt words to his sons tragic end he had brooded and mused over it in his crushed and wounded spirit he had revisited the scene of his loss whenever opportunity permitted him he had made of his sorrow a cherished and petted daily companion but he had stored it up deep in his own inmost heart never uttering a word of it even to his wife or daughter the two women knew michael trevennack must be profoundly moved indeed so to tear open the halfhealed wound in his tortured bosom before two casual strangers  but tyrrel too gave a start as he spoke and looked hard at the careworn face of that unhappy man then youre mr trevennack he exclaimed all aghast mr trevennack of the admiralty  and the dignified stranger answered bowing his head very low yes youve guessed me right im michael trevennack  with scarcely a word of reply walter tyrrel turned and strode away from the spot i must go now he muttered faintly looking at his watch with some feigned surprise as a feeble excuse ive an appointment at home he hadnt the courage to stay his heart misgave him once fairly round the corner he fled like a wounded creature too deeply hurt even to cry eustace le neve raising his hat hastened after him all mute wonder for several hundred yards they walked on side by side across the open heathy moor then as they passed the first wall tyrrel paused for a moment and spoke not a murderer he cried in his anguish oh no not quite as bad as a murderer surely eustace but still a culpable homicide oh god how terrible  and even as he disappeared across the moor to eastward trevennack far behind seized his wifes arm spasmodically and clutching it tight in his iron grip murmured low in a voice of supreme conviction do you see what that means lucy i can read it all now it was he who rolled down that cursed stone it was he who killed our boy and i can guess who he is he must be tyrrel of penmorgan  cleer didnt hear the words she was below gazing after them     chapter iv  tyrrels remorse   the two young men walked back without interchanging another word to the gate of the manorhouse tyrrel opened it with a swing then once within his own grounds and free from prying eyes he sat down forthwith upon a little craggy cliff that overhung the carriagedrive buried his face in his hands and to le neves intense astonishment cried long and silently he let himself go with a rush thats the cornish nature eustace le neve sat by his side not daring to speak but in mute sympathy with his sorrow for many minutes neither uttered a sound at last tyrrel looked up and in an agony of remorse turned round to his companion of course you understand he said  and eustace answered reverently yes i think i understand having come so near doing the same thing myself i sympathize with you  tyrrel paused a moment again his face was like marble then he added in a tone of the profoundest anguish till this minute eustace ive never told anybody and if it hadnt been forced out of me by that poor mans tortured and brokenhearted face i wouldnt have told you now but could i look at him today and not break down before him  how did it all happen le neve asked leaning forward and clasping his friends arm with a brotherly gesture  tyrrel answered with a deep sigh like this ill make a clean breast of it all at last ive bottled it up too long ill tell you now eustace  nearly sixteen years ago i was staying down here at penmorgan with my uncle the trevennacks as i learned afterward were in lodgings at gunwalloe but so far as i can remember at present i never even saw them to the best of my belief i never set eyes on michael trevennack himself before this very morning if id known who he was you may be pretty sure id have cut off my right hand before id allowed myself to speak to him  well one day that year i was strolling along the top of the cliff by michaels crag with my uncle beside me who owned penmorgan i was but a boy then and i walked by the edge more than once very carelessly my uncle knew the cliffs though and how dangerous they were he knew men might any time be walking below digging launces in the sand or getting lobworms for their lines or hunting serpentine to polish or looking for seabirds eggs among the halfway ledges time after time he called out to me walter my boy take care dont go so near the edge youll tumble over presently and time after time i answered him back like a boy that i was oh im all right uncle no fear about me i can take care of myself these cliffs dont crumble theyre a deal too solid  at last when he saw it was no good warning me that way any longer he turned round to me rather sharplyhe was a tyrrel you see and conscientious as we all of us areit runs in the blood somehowif you dont mind for yourself at least mind for others who can say who may be walking underneath those rocks if you let a loose stone fall you may commit manslaughter  i laughed and thought ill of him he was such a fidget i was only a boy i considered him absurdly and unnecessarily particular he had stalked on a yard or two in front i loitered behind and out of pure boyish deviltry as i was just above michaels crag i loosened some stones with my foot and showered them over deliberately oh heavens i feel it yet how they rattled and rumbled  my uncle wasnt looking he walked on and left me behind he didnt see me push them he didnt see them fall he didnt hear them rattle but as they reached the bottom i heard myselfor thought i hearda vague cry below a cry as of some one wounded i was frightened at that i didnt dare to look down but ran on to my uncle not till some hours after did i know the whole truth for we walked along the cliffs all the way to kynance and then returned inland by the road to the lizard  that afternoon late there was commotion at penmorgan the servants brought us word how a bit of the cliff near michaels crag had foundered unawares and struck two people who were walking belowa mr trevennack in lodgings at gunwalloe and his boy michael the father wasnt much hurt they said but the sonoh eustace the son was dangerously wounded  i listened in terror he lived out the night and died next morning  tyrrel leaned back in agony as he spoke and looked utterly crushed it was an awful memory le neve hardly knew what to say the mans remorse was so poignant after all those years the boys thoughtless act seemed to weigh like a millstone round the grown mans neck eustace held his peace and felt for him by and by tyrrel went on again rocking himself to and fro on his rough seat as he spoke for fifteen years he said piteously ive borne this burden in my heart and never told anybody i tell it now first of all men to you youre the only soul on earth who shares my secret  then your uncle didnt suspect it eustace asked all breathless  walter tyrrel shook his head on the contrary he answered he said to me next day how glad i am walter my boy i called you away from the cliff that moment it was quite providential for if youd loosened a stone and then this thing had happened wed both of us have believed it was you that did it i was too frightened and appalled to tell him it was i i thought theyd hang me but from that day to thiseustace eustace believe meive never ceased to think of it ive never forgiven myself  yet it was an accident after all le neve said trying to comfort him  no no not quite i should have been warned in time i should have obeyed my uncle but what would you have its the luck of the tyrrels  he spoke plaintively le neve pulled a piece of grass and began biting it to hide his confusion how near he might have come to doing the same thing himself he thanked his stars it wasnt he he thanked his stars he hadnt let that stone drop from the cliff that morning  tyrrel was the first to break the solemn silence you can understand now he said with an impatient gesture why i hate penmorgan ive hated it ever since i shall always hate it it seems like a mute reminder of that awful day in my uncles time i never came near it but as soon as it was my own i felt i must live upon it and now this terror of meeting trevennack some day has made life one long burden to me sooner or later i felt sure i should run against him they told me how he came down here from time to time to see where his son died and i knew i should meet him now you can understand too why i hate the top of the cliffs so much and will walk at the bottom i had two good reasons for that one ive told you already the other was the fear of coming across trevennack  le neve turned to him compassionately my dear fellow he said you take it too much to heart it was so long ago and you were only a child the the accident might happen to any boy any day  yes yes tyrrel answered passionately i know all that i try so to console myself but then ive wrecked that unhappy mans life for him  he has his daughter still le neve put in vaguely it was all he could think of to say by way of consolation and to him cleer trevennack would have made up for anything  a strange shade passed over tyrrels face eustace noted it instinctively something within seemed to move that cornish heart yes he has his daughter still the squire of penmorgan answered with a vacant air but for me that only makes things still worse than before how can she pardon my act what can she ever think of me  le neve turned sharply round upon him there was some undercurrent in the tone in which he spoke that suggested far more than the mere words themselves might perhaps have conveyed to him what do you mean he asked all eager in a quick low voice youve met miss trevennack before youve seen her youve spoken to her  for a second tyrrel hesitated then with a burst he spoke out i may as well tell you all he cried now ive told you so much yes ive met her before ive seen her ive spoken to her  but she didnt seem to recognize you le neve objected taken aback  tyrrel shook his head despondently thats the worst of it all he answered with a very sad sigh she didnt even remember me she was so much to me and to herwhy to her eustacei was less than nothing  and you knew who she was when you saw her just now le neve asked greatly puzzled  yes and no not exactly i knew she was the person id seen and talked with but id never heard her name nor connected her in any way with michael trevennack if i had things would be different its a terrible nemesis ill tell you how it happened i may as well tell all but the worst point of the whole to me in this crushing blow is to learn that that girl is michael trevennacks daughter  where and when did you meet her then le neve asked growing curious  quite casually once only some time since in a railway carnage it must be two years ago now and i was going from bath to bournemouth she traveled with me in the same compartment as far as temple combe and i talked all the way with her i can remember every word of it eustace its foolish of me to acknowledge it perhaps but in those two short hours i fell madly in love with her her face has lived with me ever since ive longed to meet her but i was stupidly afraid to ask her name before she got out of the train and i had no clue at all to her home or her relations yet a thousand times since ive said to myself if ever i marry ill marry that girl who went in the carriage from bath to temple combe with me ive cherished her memory from that day to this you maynt believe i dare say in love at first sight but this i can swear to you was a genuine case of it  i can believe in it very well le neve answered most truthfully now ive seen miss trevennack  tyrrel looked at him and smiled sadly well when i saw her again this morning he went on after a short pause my heart came up into my mouth i said to myself with a bound its she its she at last ive found her and it dashed my best hopes to the ground at once to see she didnt even remember having met me  le neve looked at him shyly walter he said after a short struggle im not surprised you fell in love with her and shall i tell you why i fell in love with her myself too the moment i saw her  tyrrel turned to him without one word of reproach well were no rivals now he answered generously even if she would have meeven if she loved me wellhow could i ask her to takeher brothers murderer  le neve drew a long breath he hadnt thought of that before but had it been other wise he couldnt help feeling that the master of penmorgan would have been a formidable rival for a penniless engineer just home from south america  for already eustace le neve was dimly aware in his own sanguine mind that he meant to woo and win that beautiful cleer trevennack     chapter v  a strange delusion   trevennack and his wife sat alone that night in their bare rooms at gunwalloe cleer had gone out to see some girls of her acquaintance who were lodging close by in a fishermans house and the husband and wife were left for a few hours by themselves together  michael mrs trevennack began as soon as they were alone rising up from her chair and coming over toward him tenderly i was horribly afraid you were going to break out before those two young men on the cliff today i saw you were just on the very brink of it but you resisted bravely thank you so much for that youre a dear good fellow i was so pleased with you and so proud of you  break out about our poor boy trevennack asked with a dreamy air passing his bronzed hand wearily across his high white forehead  his wife seated herself sideways upon the arm of his chair and bent over him as he sat with wifely confidence no no dear she said taking his hand in hers and soothing it with her soft palm about you knowwell of course that other thing  at the mere hint trevennack leaned back and drew himself up proudly to his full height like a soldier he looked majestic as he sat thereevery inch a st michael well its hard to keep such a secret he answered laying his free hand on his breast hard to keep such a secret and i own when they were talking about it i longed to tell them but for cleers sake i refrained lucy for cleers sake i always refrain youre quite right about that i know of course for cleers sake i must keep it locked up in my own heart forever  the silverhaired lady bent over him again both caressingly and proudly michael dear michael she said with a soft thrill in her voice i love you and honor you for it i can feel what it costs you my darling i know how hard you have to fight against it i could see you fighting against it today and i was proud of the way you struggled with it singlehanded till you gained the victory  trevennack drew himself up still more haughtily than before and who should struggle against the devil he said singlehanded as you say and gain the victory at last if not i myself lucy  he said it like some great one his wife soothed his hand again and repressed a sigh she was a greathearted lady that brave wife and mother who bore her own trouble without a word spoken to anyone but she must sigh at least sometimes it was such a relief to her pent up feelings who indeed she said acquiescent who indeed if not you and i love you best when you conquer so michael  trevennack looked down upon her with a strange tender look on his face in which gentleness and condescension were curiously mingled yes he answered musing for dear cleers sake i will always keep my peace about it ill say not a word ill never tell anybody and yet its hard to keep it in very hard indeed i have to bind myself round as it were with bonds of iron the secret will almost out of itself at times as this morning for example when that young fellow wanted to know why st michael always clung to such airy pinnacles how jauntily he talked about it as if the reason for the selection were a matter of no moment how little he seemed to think of the prince of the archangels  but for cleers sake darling you kept it in mrs trevennack said coaxingly and for cleers sake youll keep it in stilli know you will now wont you  trevennack looked the picture of embodied selfrestraint his back was rigid for cleers sake ill keep it in he said firmly i know how important it is for her never in this world have i breathed a word of it to any living soul but you and never in this world i will the rest wouldnt understand theyd say it was madness  they would his wife assented very gravely and earnestly and that would be so bad for cleers future prospects people would think you were out of your mind and you know how chary young men are nowadays of marrying a girl when they believe or even suspect theres insanity in the family you can talk of it as much and as often as you like to me dear michael i think that does you good it acts as a safety valve it keeps you from bottling your secret up in your own heart too long and brooding over it and worrying yourself i like you to talk to me of it whenever you feel inclined but for heavens sake darling to nobody else not a hint of it for worlds the consequences might be terrible  trevennack rose and stood at his full height with his heels on the edge of the low cottage fender you can trust me lucy he said in a very soft tone with grave and conscious dignity you can trust me to hold my tongue i know how much depends upon it  the beautiful lady with the silvery hair sat and gazed on him admiringly she knew she could trust him she knew he would keep it in but she knew at the same time how desperate a struggle the effort cost him and visionary though he was she loved and admired him for it  there was an eloquent silence then after a while trevennack spoke again more tenderly and regretfully that man did it he said with slow emphasis i saw by his face at once he did it he killed our poor boy i could read it in his look im sure it was he and besides i have news of it certain newsfrom elsewhere and he looked up significantly  michael mrs trevennack said drawing close to him with an appealing gesture and gazing hard into his eyes its a long time since he was a boy at the time he did it carelessly no doubt but not guiltily culpably for cleers sake there toooh forgive him forgive him she clasped her hands tight she looked up at him tearfully  it was the devils work her husband answered with a faint frown on his high forehead and my task in life lucy is to fight down the devil  fight him down in your own heart then dear mrs trevennack said gently remember we all may fall lucifer didand he was once an archangel fight him down in your own heart when he suggests hateful thoughts to you for i know what you felt when it came over you instinctively that that young man had done it you wanted to fly straight at his throat dear michaelyou wanted to fly at his throat and fling him over the precipice  i did trevennack answered making no pretense of denial but for cleers sake i refrained and for cleers sake if you wish it ill try to forgive him  mrs trevennack pressed his hand tears stood in her dim eyes she too had a terrible battle to fight all the days of her life and she fought it valiantly michael she said with an effort try to avoid that young man try to avoid him i implore you dont go near him in the future if you see him too often im afraid what the result for you both may be you control yourself wonderfully dear you control yourself i know and im grateful to you for it but if you see too much of him i dread an outbreak it may get the better of you and thenthink of cleer avoid him avoid him  for only that silverheaded woman of all people on earth knew the terrible truth that michael trevennacks was a hopeless case of suppressed insanity well suppressed indeed and kept firmly in check for his daughters sake and by his brave wifes aid but insanity none the less of the profoundest monomaniacal pattern for all that all day long and every day in his dealings with the outer world he kept down his monomania an able and trusted government servant he never allowed it for one moment to interfere with his public duties to his wife alone he let out what he thought the inmost and deepest secret of his real existencethat he was the archangel michael to no one else did he ever allow a glimpse of the truth as he thought it to appear he knew the world would call it madness and he didnt wish the stigma of inherited insanity to cling to his cleer  not even cleer herself for a moment suspected it  trevennack was wise enough and cunning enough as madmen often are to keep his own counsel for good and sufficient reason     chapter vi  pure accident   during the next week or so as chance would have it cleer trevennack fell in more than once on her walks with eustace le neve and walter tyrrel they had picked up acquaintance in an irregular way to be sure but cleer hadnt happened to be close by when her father uttered those strange words to his wife it was he who did it it was he who killed our boy nor did she notice particularly the marked abruptness of tyrrels departure on that unfortunate occasion so she had no such objection to meeting the two young men as trevennack himself not unnaturally displayed she regarded his evident avoidance of walter tyrrel as merely one of papas fancies to cleer papas fancies were mysterious but very familiar entities and tyrrel and le neve were simply two interesting and intelligent young menthe squire of the village and a friend on a visit to him indeed to be quite confidential it was the visitor who occupied the larger share of cleers attention he was so goodlooking and so nice his open face and pink and white complexion had attracted her fancy from the very first and the more she saw of him the more she liked him  they met oftenquite by accident of courseon the moor and elsewhere tyrrel for his part shrank somewhat timidly from the sister of the boy for his share in whose death he so bitterly reproached himself yet he couldnt quite drag himself off whenever he found himself in cleers presence she bound him as by a spell he was profoundly attracted to her there was something about the pretty cornish girl so frank so confiding in one word so magnetic that when once he came near her he couldnt tear himself away as he felt he ought to yet he could see very well none the less it was for eustace le neve that she watched most eagerly with the natural interest of a budding girl in the man who takes her pure maiden fancy tyrrel allowed with a sigh that this was well indeed for how could he ever dream now he knew who she was of marrying young michael trevennacks sister  one afternoon the two friends were returning from a long ramble across the open moor when near a little knoll of bare and weathered rock that rose from a circling belt of cornish heath they saw cleer by herself propped against the huge boulders with her eyes fixed intently on a papercovered novel she looked up and smiled as they approached and the young men turning aside from their illmarked path came over and stood by her they talked for awhile about the ordinary nothings of society smalltalk till by degrees cleer chanced accidentally to bring the conversation round to something that had happened to her mother and herself a year or two since in malta le neve snatched at the word for he was eager to learn all he could about the trevennacks movements so deeply had cleer already impressed her image on his susceptible nature  and when do you go back there he asked somewhat anxiously i suppose your fathers leave is for a week or two only  oh dear no we dont go back at all thank heaven cleer answered with a sunny smile i cant bear exile mr le neve and i never cared one bit for living in malta but this year fortunately papas going to be transferred for a permanence to england hes to have charge of a department that has something or other to do with provisioning the channel squadron i dont quite understand what but anyhow hell have to be running about between portsmouth and plymouth and i dont know where else and mamma and i will have to take a house for ourselves in london  le neves face showed his pleasure thats well he answered briskly then you wont be quite lost i mean therell be some chance at least when you go away from here of ones seeing you sometimes  a bright red spot rose deep on cleers cheek through the dark olive brown skin how kind of you to say so she answered looking down im sure mammall be very pleased indeed if youll take the trouble to call then to hide her confusion she went on hastily and are you going to be in england too i thought i understood the other day from your friend you had something to do with a railway in south america  oh thats all over now le neve answered with a wave well pleased she should ask him about his whereabouts so cordially i was only employed in the construction of the line you know ive nothing at all to do with its maintenance and working and now the tracks laid my work theres finished but as to stopping in englandahthats quite another thing an engineers you know is a roving life hes here today and there tomorrow i must go i suppose wherever work may take me and there isnt much stirring in the markets just now in the way of engineering  i hope youll get something at home cleer said simply with a blush and then blamed herself for saying it she blushed again at the thought she looked prettiest when she blushed walter tyrrel a little behind stood and admired her all the while but eustace was flattered she should think of wanting him to remain in england  thank you he said somewhat timidly for her bashfulness made him a trifle bashful in return i should like to very muchfor more reasons than one and he looked at her meaningly im getting tired in some ways of life abroad id much prefer to come back now and settle down in england  cleer rose as he spoke his frank admiration made her feel self conscious she thought this conversation had gone quite far enough for them both for the present after all she knew so little of him though he was really very nice and he looked at her so kindly but perhaps it would be better to go and hunt up papa i think i ought to be moving now she said with a delicious little flush on her smooth dark cheek my fatherll be waiting for me and she set her face across the moor in the opposite direction from the gate of penmorgan  we may come with you maynt we eustace asked with just an undertone of wistfulness  but tyrrel darted a warning glance at him he at least couldnt go to confront once more that poor dead boys father  i must hurry home he said feebly consulting his watch with an abstracted air its getting so late but dont let me prevent you from accompanying miss trevennack  cleer shrank away a little alarmed she wasnt quite sure whether it would be perfectly right for her to walk about alone on the moorland with only one young man though she wouldnt have minded the two for there is safety in numbers oh no she said half frightened in that composite tone which is at once an entreaty and a positive command dont mind me mr le neve im quite accustomed to strolling by myself round the cliff i wouldnt make you miss your dinner for worlds and besides papas not far off he went away from me rambling  the two young men accepting their dismissal in the sense in which it was intended saluted her deferentially and turned away on their own road but cleer took the path to michaels crag by the gully  from the foot of the crag you cant see the summit its own shoulders and the loose rocks of the foreground hide it but cleer was pretty certain her father must be there for he was mostly to be found when tide permitted it perched up on the highest pinnacle of his namesake skerry looking out upon the waters with a preoccupied glance from that airy citadel the waves in the narrow channel that separate the crag from the opposite mainland were running high and boisterous but cleer had a sure foot and could leap light as a gazelle from rock to rock not for nothing was she michael trevennacks daughter well trained from her babyhood to high and airy climbs she chose an easy spot where it was possible to spring across by a series of boulders arranged accidentally like steppingstones and in a minute she was standing on the main crag itself a huge beetling mass of detached serpentine pushed boldly out as the advanceguard of the land into the assailing waves and tapering at its top into a pyramidal steeple  the face of the crag was wet with spray in places but cleer didnt mind spray she was accustomed to the sea in all its moods and tempers she clambered up the steep sidea sheer wall of bare rock lightly clad here and there with sparse drapery of green sapphire or clumps of purple seaaster rooted firm in the crannies its front was yellow with great patches of lichen and on the peaks overhead the gulls perched chattering or launched themselves in long curves upon the evening air cleer paused half way up to draw breath and admire the familiar scene often as she had gone there before she could never help gazing with enchanted eyes on those brilliantly colored pinnacles on that deep green sea on those angry white breakers that dashed in ceaseless assault against the solid black wall of rock all round her then she started once more on her climb up the uncertain path a mere foothold in the crannies clinging close with her tiny hands as she went to every jutting corner or weatherworn rock and every woody stem of weatherbeaten sea plants  at last panting and hot she reached the sharp top expecting to find trevennack at his accustomed post on the very tallest pinnacle of the craggy little islet but to her immense surprise her father wasnt there his absence disquieted her cleer stood up on the fissured mass of orangelichened rock that crowned the very summit dispossessing the gulls who flapped round her as she mounted it then shading her eyes with her hand she looked down in every direction to see if she could descry that missing figure in some nook of the crag he was nowhere visible father she cried aloud at the top of her voice father father father but the only answer to her cry was the sound of the sea on the base and the loud noise of the gulls as they screamed and fluttered in angry surprise over their accustomed breedinggrounds  alarmed and irresolute cleer sat down on the rock and facing landwards for awhile waved her handkerchief to and fro to attract if possible her fathers attention then she scanned the opposite cliffs beyond the gap or chasm that separated her from the mainland but she could nowhere see him he must have forgotten her and gone home to dinner alone she fancied now for it was nearly seven oclock nothing remained but to climb down again and follow him it was getting full late to be out by herself on the island and tide was coming in and the surf was getting strongatlantic swell from the gale at sea yesterday  painfully and toilsomely she clambered down the steep path making her foothold good step by step in the slippery crannies rendered still more dangerous in places by the sticky spray and the brine that dashed over them from the seething channel it was harder coming down a good deal than going up and she was accustomed to her fathers hand to guide herto fit her light foot on the little ledges by the way or to lift her down over the steepest bits with unfailing tenderness so she found it rather difficult to descend by herselfboth difficult and tedious at last however after one or two nasty slips and a false step or so on the way that ended in her grazing the tender skin on those white little fingers cleer reached the base of the crag and stood face to face with the final problem of crossing the chasm that divided the islet from the opposite mainland  then for the first time the truth was borne in upon her with a sudden rush that she couldnt get backshe was imprisoned on the island she had crossed over at almost the last moment possible the sea now quite covered two or three of her steppingstones fierce surf broke over the rest with each advancing billow and rendered the task of jumping from one to the other impracticable even for a strong and surefooted man far more for a slight girl of cleers height and figure  in a moment the little prisoner took in the full horror of the situation it was now about half tide and seven oclock in the evening high water would therefore fall between ten and eleven and it must be nearly two in the morning she calculated hastily before the sea had gone down enough to let her cross over in safety even then in the dark she dared hardly face those treacherous stepping stones she must stop there till day broke if she meant to get ashore again without unnecessary hazard  cleer was a trevennack and therefore brave but the notion of stopping alone on that desolate island thronged with gulls and cormorants in the open air through all those long dark hours till morning dawned fairly frightened and appalled her for a minute or two she crouched and cowered in silence then overcome by terror she climbed up once more to the first platform of rock above the reach of the spray and shouted with all her might father father father  but tis a lonely coast that wild stretch by the lizard not a soul was within earshot cleer sat there still or stood on top of the crag for many minutes together shouting and waving her handkerchief for dear life itself but not a soul heard her she might have died there unnoticed not a creature came near to help or deliver her the gulls and the cormorants alone stared at her and wondered  meanwhile tide kept flowing with incredible rapidity the gale in the atlantic had raised an unwonted swell and though there was now little wind the breakers kept thundering in upon the firm sandy beach with a deafening roar that drowned cleers poor voice completely to add to her misfortunes fog began to drift slowly with the breeze from seaward it was getting dark too and the rocks were damp overhead the gulls screamed loud as they flapped and circled above her  in an agony of despair cleer sat down all unnerved on the topmost crag she began to cry to herself it was all up now she knew she must stop there alone till morning     chapter vii  peril by land   the trevennacks dined in their lodgings at gunwalloe at halfpast seven but in the rough openair life of summer visitors on the cornish coast meals as a rule are very movable feasts and michael trevennack wasnt particularly alarmed when he reached home that evening to find cleer hadnt returned before him they had missed one another somehow among the tangled paths that led down the gully an easy enough thing to do between those big boulders and bramblebushes and it was a quarter to eight before trevennack began to feel alarmed at cleers prolonged absence by that time however he grew thoroughly frightened and reproaching himself bitterly for having let his daughter stray out of his sight in the first place he hurried back with his wife at the top of his speed along the cliff path to the penmorgan headland  its half an hours walk from gunwalloe to michaels crag and by the time trevennack reached the mouth of the gully the sands were almost covered so for the first time in fifteen years he was forced to take the path right under the cliff to the now comparatively distant island round whose base a whole waste of angry sea surged sullenly on the way they met a few workmen who in answer to their inquiries could give them no news but who turned back to aid in the search for the missing young lady when they got opposite michaels crag a wide belt of black water all encumbered with broken masses of sharp rock some above and some below the surface now separated them by fifty yards or more from the island it was growing dark fast for these were the closing days of august twilight and dense fog had drifted in half obliterating everything they could barely descry the dim outline of the pyramidal rock in its lower half its upper part was wholly shrouded in thick mist and drizzle  with a wild cry of despair trevennack raised his voice and shouted aloud cleer cleer where are you  that clarion voice as of his namesake angel though raised against the wind could be heard above even the thud of the fierce breakers that pounded the sand on the highest peak above where she sat cold and shivering cleer heard it and jumped up here here father she cried out with a terrible effort descending at the same time down the sheer face of the cliff as far as the dashing spray and fierce wild waves would allow her  no other ear caught the sound of that answering cry but trevennacks keen senses preternaturally awakened by the gravity of the crisis detected the faint ring of her girlish voice through the thunder of the surf shes there he cried frantically waving his hands above his head shes there shes there we must get across and save her  for a second mrs trevennack doubted whether he was really right or whether this was only one of poor michaels hallucinations but the next moment with another cry cleer waved her handkerchief in return and let it fall from her hand it came carried on the light breeze and dropped in the water before their very eyes half way across the channel  frenzied at the sight trevennack tore off his coat and would have plunged into the sea then and there to rescue her but the workmen held him back no no sir you mustnt they said no harm cant come to the young lady if she stops there sheve only got to sit on them rocks there till morning and the tidell leave her high and dry right enough as it always do but nobody couldnt live in such a sea as thatnot tim o truro the waves ud dash him up afore he knowed where he was and smash him all to pieces on the side o the island  trevennack tried to break from them but the men held him hard their resistance angered him he chafed under their restraint how dare these rough fellows lay hands like that on the prince of the archangels and a superior officer in her majestys civil service but with the selfrestraint that was habitual to him he managed to refrain even so from disclosing his identity he only struggled ineffectually instead of blasting them with his hot breath or clutching his strong arms round their bare throats and choking them as he stood there and hesitated half undecided how to act of a sudden a sharp cry arose from behind trevennack turned and looked through the dark and the fog he could just dimly descry two men hurrying up with ropes and life buoys as they neared him he started in unspeakable horror for one of them indeed was only eustace le neve but the otherthe other was that devil walter tyrrel who he felt sure in his own heart had killed their dear michael and it was his task in life to fight and conquer devils  for a minute he longed to leap upon him and trample him under foot as long ago he had trampled his old enemy satan what was the fellow doing here now what business had he with cleer was he always to be in at the death of a trevennack  but true to her trust the silverhaired lady clutched his arm with tender watchfulness for cleers sake dear michael she whispered low in his ear for cleers sakesay nothing dont speak to him dont notice him  the distracted father drew back a step out of reach of the spray but lucy he cried low to her only think only remember if i cared to go on the cliff and just spread my wings i could fly across and save herso instantly so easily  his wife held his hand hard that touch always soothed him if you did michael she said gently with her feminine tact theyd all declare you were mad and had no wings to fly with and cleers in no immediate danger just now i feel sure dont try theres a dear man thats right oh thank you  reassured by her calm confidence trevennack fell back yet another step on the sands and watched the men aloof walter tyrrel turned to him his heart was in his mouth he spoke in short sharp sentences the coastguards wife told us he said weve come down to get her off ive sent word direct to the lizard lifeboat but im afraid it wont come they darent venture out sea runs too high and these rocks are too dangerous  as he spoke he tore off his coat tied a rope round his waist flung his boots on the sand and girded himself rapidly with an inflated lifebuoy then before the men could seize him or prevent the rash attempt he had dashed into the great waves that curled and thundered on the beach and was struggling hard with the sea in a life and death contest eustace le neve held the rope and tried to aid him in his endeavors he had meant to plunge in himself but walter tyrrel was beforehand with him he was no match in a race against time for the fiery and impetuous cornish temperament it wasnt long however before the breakers proved themselves more than equal foes for walter tyrrel in another minute he was pounded and pummeled on the unseen rocks under water by the great curling billows they seized him resistlessly on their crests tumbled him over like a child and dashed him bruised and bleeding one limp bundle of flesh against the jagged and pointed summits of the submerged boulders  with all his might eustace le neve held on to the rope then in coat and boots as he stood he plunged into the waves and lifted walter tyrrel in his strong arms landward he was a bigger built and more powerful man than his host and his huge limbs battled harder with the gigantic waves but even so in that swirling flood it was touch and go with him the breakers lifted him off his feet tossed him to and fro in their trough flung him down again forcibly against the sharp edged rocks and tried to float off his half unconscious burden but le neve persevered in spite of them scrambling and tottering as he went over wet and slippery reefs with tyrrel still clasped in his arms and pressed tight to his breast till he landed him safe at last on the firm sand beside him  the squire was far too beaten and bruised by the rocks to make a second attempt against those resistless breakers indeed le neve brought him ashore more dead than alive bleeding from a dozen wounds on the face and hands and with the breath almost failing in his battered body they laid him down on the beach while the fishermen crowded round him admiring his pluck though they deprecated his foolhardiness for they knowed the squire couldnt never live agin it but le neve still full of the reckless courage of youth and health and strength and manhood keenly alive now to the peril of cleers lonely situation never heeded their forebodings he dashed in once more just as he stood clothes and all in the wild and desperate attempt to stem that fierce flood and swim across to the island  in such a sea as then raged indeed and among such broken rocks swimming in the strict sense was utterly impossible by some mere miracle of dashing about howeverhere battered against the sharp rocks there flung over them by the breakers and yonder again sucked down like a straw in an eddy by the fierce strength of the undertoweustace found himself at last half unconscious and half choked carried round by the swirling scour that set through the channel to the south front of the island next instant he felt he was cast against the dead wall of rock like an india rubber ball he rebounded into the trough the sea caught him a second time and flung him once more helpless against the dripping precipice with what life was left in him he clutched with both hands the bare serpentine edge good luck befriended him the great wave had lifted him up on its towering crest to the level of vegetation beyond the debatable zone he clung to the hard root of woody seaaster in the clefts the waves dashed back in tumultuous little cataracts and left him there hanging  like a mountain goat eustace clambered up the side on hands knees feet elbows glad to escape with his life from that irresistible turmoil the treacherous herbs on the slope of the crag were kind to him he scrambled ahead like some mad wild thing he went onward upward cutting his hands at each stage tearing the skin from his fingers it was impossible but he did it next minute he found himself high and dry on the island  his clothes were clinging wet of course and his limbs bruised and battered but he was safe on the firm plateau of the rock at last and he had rescued cleer trevennack  in the first joy and excitement of the moment he forgot altogether the cramping conventionalities of our everyday life and repeating the cry he had heard michael trevennack raise from the beach below he shouted aloud at the top of his voice cleer cleer where are you  here came an answering voice from the depths of the gloom overhead and following the direction whence the sound seemed to come eustace le neve clambered up to her  as he seized her hand and wrung it cleer crying the while with delight and relief it struck him all at once for the very first time he had done no good by coming save to give her companionship it would be hopeless to try carrying her through those intricate rock channels and that implacable surf whence he himself had emerged alone and unburdened only by a miracle they two must stop alone there on the rock till morning  as for cleer too innocent and too much of a mere woman in her deadly peril to think of anything but the delightful sense of confidence in a strong man at her side to guard and protect her she sat and held his hand still in a perfect transport of gratitude oh how good of you to come she cried again and again bending over it in her relief and half tempted to kiss it how good of you to come across like that to save me     chapter viii  safe at last   the night was long the night was dark slowly the fog closed them in it grew rainier and more dismal but on the summit of the crag eustace le neve stood aloft and waved his arms and shouted he lit a match and shaded it the dull glare of it through the mist just faintly reached the eyes of the anxious watchers on the beach below from a dozen lips there rose an answering shout the pair on the crag half heard its last echoes eustace put his hands to his mouth and cried aloud once more in stentorian tones all right cleers here we can hold out till morning  trevennack alone heard the words but he repeated them so instantly that his wife felt sure it was true hearing not insane hallucination the sea was gaining on them now it had risen almost up to the face of the cliffs reluctantly they turned along the path by the gully and mounting the precipice waited and watched till morning on the tor that overlooks michaels crag from the penmorgan headland  every now and again through that livelong night trevennack whispered in his wifes ear if only i chose to spread my wings and launch myself i could fly across and carry her and each time that brave woman holding his hand in her own and smoothing it gently answered in her soft voice but then the secret would be out and cleers life would be spoiled and theyd call you a madman wait till morning dear michael do do wait till morning  and trevennack struggling hard with the mad impulse in his heart replied with all his soul i will i will for cleers sake and yours ill try to keep it down ill not be mad ill be strong and restrain it  for he knew he was insane in his inmost soul almost as well as he knew his name was michael the archangel  on the island meanwhile eustace le neve and cleer trevennack sat watching out the weary night and longing for the dawn to make the way back possible at least cleer did for as to eustace in spite of rain and fog and cold and darkness he was by no means insensible to the unwonted pleasure of so long a teteatete in such romantic circumstances with the beautiful cornish girl to be sure the waves roared and the drizzle dripped and the seabirds flapped all round them but many waters will not quench love cleer was by his side holding his hand in hers in the dark for pure companys sake because she was so frightened and as the night wore on they talked at last of many things they were prisoners there for five mortal hours or so alone together and they might as well make the best of it by being sociable with one another  there could be no denying however that it was cold and damp and dark and uncomfortable the rain came beating down upon them as they sat there side by side on that exposed rock the spray from the breakers blew in with the night wind the light breeze struck chill on their wet clothes and faces after awhile eustace began a slow tour of inspection over the crag seeking some cave or rock shelter some projecting ledge of stone on the leeward side that might screen their backs at least from the driving showers cleer couldnt be left alone she clung to his hand as he felt his way about the islet with uncertain steps through the gloom and fog once he steadied himself on a jutting piece of the rock as he supposed when to his immense surprisewhrrrit rose from under his hand with a shrill cry of alarm and fluttered wildly seaward it was some sleeping gull no doubt disturbed unexpectedly in its accustomed restingplace eustace staggered and almost fell cleer supported him with her arm he accepted her aid gratefully they stumbled on in the dark once more lighting now and again for a minute or two one of his six precious matcheshe had no more in his caseand exploring as well as they might the whole broken surface of that fissured pinnacle im so glad you smoke mr le neve cleer said simply as he lit one for if you didnt you know wed have been left here all night in utter darkness  at last in a nook formed by the weathered joints eustace found a rugged niche somewhat dryer than the rest and laid cleer gently down in it on a natural spring seat of tufted rockplants then he settled down beside her with what cheerfulness he could muster up and taking off his wet coat spread it on top across the cleft like a tent roof to shelter them it was no time indeed to stand upon ceremony cleer recognized as much and nestled close to his side like a sensible girl as she was so as to keep warm by mere company while eustace still holding her hand just to assure her of his presence placed himself in such an attitude leaning before her and above her as to protect her as far as possible from the drizzling rainfall through the gap in front of them there they sat till morning talking gradually of many things and growing more and more confidential in spite of cold and wet as they learnt more and more with each passing hour of each others standpoint there are some situations where you get to know people better in a few halfhours together than you could get to know them in months upon months of mere drawingroom acquaintance and this was one of them before morning dawned eustace le neve and cleer trevennack felt just as if they had known one another quite well for years they were old and trusted friends already old friendsand even something more than that though no word of love was spoken between them each knew of what the other was thinking eustace felt cleer loved him cleer felt eustace loved her and in spite of rain and cold and fog and darkness they were almost happybefore dawn came to interrupt their strange teteatete on the islet  as soon as day broke eustace looked out from their eyrie on the fissured peak and down upon the troubled belt of water below the sea was now ebbing and the passage between the rock and the mainland though still full for it was never dry even at springtide low water was fairly passable by this time over the natural bridge of stepping stones he clambered down the side giving his hand to cleer from ledge to ledge as he went the fog had lifted a little and on the opposite headland they could just dimly descry the weary watchers looking eagerly out for them eustace put his hands to his mouth and gave a loud halloo the sound of the breakers was less deafening now his voice carried to the mainland trevennack who had sat under a tarpaulin through the livelong night watching and waiting with anxious heart for the morning raised an answering shout and waved his hat in his hand frantically st michaels crag had not betrayed its trust that was the motto of the trevennacksstand fast st michaelsunder the crest of the rocky islet castled and mured flamboyant eustace reached the bottom of the rock and wading in the water himself or jumping into the deepest parts helped cleer across the steppingstones meanwhile the party on the cliff had hurried down by the gully path and a minute later cleer was in her mothers arms while trevennack held her hand inarticulate with joy and bent over her eagerly  oh mother cleer cried in her simple girlish naivete mr le neves been so kind to me i dont know how i should ever have got through the night without him it was so good of him to come hes been such a help to me  the father and mother both looked into her eyesa single searching glanceand understood perfectly they grasped le neves hand tears rolled down their cheeks not a word was spoken but in a certain silent way all four understood one another  wheres tyrrel eustace asked  and mrs trevennack answered carried home severely hurt he was bruised on the rocks but we hope not dangerously the doctors been to see him we hear and finds no bones broken still hes terribly battered about in those fearful waves and it must be weeks they tell us before he can quite recover  but cleer as was natural thought more of the man who had struggled through and reached her than of the man who had failed in the attempt though he suffered all the more for it this is a world of the successful in it as in most other planets i have visited people make a deal more fuss over the smallest success than over the noblest failure  it was no moment for delay eustace turned on his way at once and ran up to penmorgan and the trevennacks returned very wet and cold in the dim gray dawn to their rooms at gunwalloe  as soon as they were alonecleer put safely to bedtrevennack looked at his wife lucy he said slowly in a disappointed tone after this of course come what may they must marry  they must his wife answered theres no other way left and fortunately dear i could see from the very first cleer likes him and he likes her  the father paused a moment it wasnt quite the match he had hoped for a trevennack of trevennack then he added very fervently thank god it was himnot that other man tyrrel thank god the first one fell in the water and was hurt what should we ever have doneoh what should we have done lucy if shed been cut off all night long on that lonely crag face to face with the man who murdered our dear boy michael  mrs trevennack drew a long breath then she spoke earnestly once more dear heart she said looking deep into his clear brown eyes now remember more than ever cleers future is at stake for cleers sake more than ever keep a guard on yourself michael watch word and deed do nothing foolish  you can trust me trevennack answered drawing himself up to his full height and looking proudly before him cleers future is at stake cleer has a lover now till cleer is married ill give you my sacred promise no living soul shall ever know in any way shes an archangels daughter     chapter ix  medical opinion   from that day forth by some unspoken compact it was eustace and cleer wherever they met between them le neve began it by coming round in the afternoon of that selfsame day as soon as hed slept off the first effects of his fatigue and chill to inquire of mrs trevennack how cleer was getting on after her nights exposure and mrs trevennack accepted the frank usurpation in very good part as indeed was no wonder for cleer had wanted to know half an hour before whether eustace had yet been round to ask after her the form of speech told all there was no formal engagement and none of the party knew exactly how or when they began to take it for granted but from that evening on michaels crag it was a tacitly accepted fact between le neve and the trevennacks that eustace was to marry cleer as soon as he could get a permanent appointment anywhere  engineering however is an overstocked profession in that particular it closely resembles most other callings  the holidays passed away and walter tyrrel recovered and the trevennacks returned to town for the head of the house to take up his new position in the admiralty service but eustace le neve heard of no opening anywhere for an energetic young man with south american experience those three years he had passed out of england indeed had made him lose touch with other members of his craft people shrugged their shoulders when they heard of him and opined with a chilly smile he was the sort of young man who ought to go to the colonies thats the easiest way of shelving all similar questions the colonies are popularly regarded in england as the predestined dumpingground for all the fools and failures of the mothercountry so eustace settled down in lodgings in london not far from the trevennacks and spent more of his time it must be confessed in going round to see cleer than in perfecting himself in the knowledge of his chosen art not that he failed to try every chance that lay open to himhe had far too much energy to sit idle in his chair and let the stream of promotion flow by unattempted but chances were few and applicants were many and month after month passed away to his chagrin without the clever young engineer finding an appointment anywhere meanwhile his little nestegg of southamerican savings was rapidly disappearing and though tyrrel who had influence with railway men exerted himself to the utmost on his friends behalf partly for cleers sake and partly for eustaces ownle neve saw his balance growing daily smaller and began to be seriously alarmed at last not merely for his future prospects of employment and marriage but even for his immediate chance of a modest livelihood  nor was mrs trevennack for her part entirely free from sundry qualms of conscience as to her husbands condition and the rightfulness of concealing it altogether from cleers accepted lover trevennack himself was so perfectly sane in every ordinary relation of life so able a business head so dignified and courtly an english gentleman that eustace never even for a moment suspected any undercurrent of madness in that sound practical intelligence indeed no man could talk with more absolute common sense about his daughters future or the duties and functions of an admiralty official than michael trevennack it was only to his wife in his most confidential moments that he ever admitted the truth as to his archangelic character to all others whom he met he was simply a distinguished english civil servant of blameless life and very solid judgment the heads of his department placed the most implicit trust in trevennacks opinion there was no man about the place who could decide a knotty point of detail offhand like michael trevennack what was his poor wife to do then was it her place to warn eustace that cleers father might at any moment unexpectedly develop symptoms of dangerous insanity was she bound thus to wreck her own daughters happiness was she bound to speak out the very secret of her heart which she had spent her whole life in inducing trevennack himself to bottle up with ceaseless care in his distracted bosom  and yet  she saw the other point of view as wellalas all too plainly she was a martyr to conscience like walter tyrrel himself was it right of her then to tie eustace for life to a girl who was really a madmans daughter this hateful question was up before her often in the dead dark night as she lay awake on her bed tossing and turning feverishly it tortured her in addition to her one lifelong trouble for the silverhaired lady had borne the burden of that unknown sorrow locked up in her own bosom for fifteen years and it had left on her face such a beauty of holiness as a great trouble often leaves indelibly stamped on women of the same brave loving temperament  one day about three months later in their drawingroom at bayswater eustace le neve happened to let drop a casual remark which cut poor mrs trevennack to the quick like a knife at her heart he was talking of some friend of his who had lately got engaged its a terrible thing he said seriously theres insanity in the family i wouldnt marry into such a family as thatno not if i loved a girl to distraction mrs trevennack the fathers in a madhouse you know and the girls very nice now but one never can tell when the tendency may break out and thenjust think what an inheritance to hand on to ones innocent children  trevennack took no open notice of what he said but mrs trevennack winced grew suddenly pale and stammered out some conventional none committing platitude his words entered her very soul they stung and galled her that night she lay awake and thought more bitterly to herself about the matter than ever next morning early as soon as trevennack had set off to catch the fast train from waterloo to portsmouth direct he was frequently down there on admiralty business she put on her cloak and bonnet without a word to cleer and set out in a hansom all alone to harley street  the house to which she drove was seriouslooking and professionalin point of fact it was dr yatewestburys the wellknown specialist on mental diseases she sent up no card and gave no name on the contrary she kept her veil downand it was a very thick one but dr yatewestbury made no comment on this reticence it was a familiar occurrence with himpeople are often ashamed to have it known they consult a maddoctor  i want to ask you about my husbands case mrs trevennack began trembling and the great specialist all attention leaned forward and listened to her  mrs trevennack summoned up courage and started from the very beginning she described how her husband who was a government servant had been walking below a cliff on the seashore with their only son some fifteen years earlier and how a shower of stones from the top had fallen on their heads and killed their poor boy whose injuries were the more serious she could mention it all now with comparatively little emotion great sorrows since had half obliterated that first and greatest one but she laid stress upon the point that her husband had been struck too and was very gravely hurtso gravely indeed that it was weeks before he recovered physically  on what part of the head yatewestbury asked with quick medical insight  and mrs trevennack answered here laying her small gloved hand on the center of the left temple  the great specialist nodded go on he said quietly fourth frontal convolution and it was a month or two i have no doubt before you noticed any serious symptoms supervening  exactly so mrs trevennack made answer very much relieved it was all of a month or two but from that day forthfrom the very beginning i meanhe had a natural horror of going beneath a cliff and he liked to get as high up as he could so as to be perfectly sure there was nobody at all anywhere above to hurt him and then she went on to describe in short but graphic phrase how he loved to return to the place of his sons accident and to stand for hours on lonely sites overlooking the spot and especially on a crag which was dedicated to st michael  the specialist caught at what was coming with the quickness she thought of long experience till he fancied himself the archangel he said promptly and curiously  mrs trevennack drew a deep breath of satisfaction and relief yes she answered flushing hot till he fancied himself the archangel therethere were extenuating circumstances you see his own names michael and his familywell his family have a special connection with st michaels mount their crests a castled crag with stand fast st michaels and he knew he had to fight against this mad impulse of his ownwhich he felt was like a devil within himfor his daughters sake and he was always standing alone on these rocky high places dedicated to st michael till the fancy took full hold upon him and now though he knows in a sort of a way hes mad he believes quite firmly hes st michael the archangel  yatewestbury nodded once more precisely the development i should expect to occur he said after such an accident  mrs trevennack almost bounded from her seat in her relief then you attribute it to the accident first of all she asked eagerly  not a doubt about it the specialist answered the region you indicate is just the one where similar illusory ideas are apt to arise from external injuries the bruise gave the cause and circumstances the form besides the case is normalquite normal altogether does he have frequent outbreaks  mrs trevennack explained that he never had any except to herself and that but seldom he never alluded to the subject in any way  yatewestbury bit his lip he must have great selfcontrol he answered less confidently in a case like that im bound to admit my prognosisfor the final resultwould be most unfavorable the longer he bottles it up the more terrible is the outburst likely to be when it arrives you must expect that some day he will break out irrepressibly  mrs trevennack bowed her head with the solemn placidity of despair im quite prepared for that she said quietly though i try hard to delay it for a specific reason that wasnt the question i came to consult you about today i feel sure my poor husbands case is perfectly hopeless as far as any possibility of cure is concerned what i want to know is about another aspect of the case she leaned forward appealingly oh doctor she cried clasping her hands i have a dear daughter at homethe one thing yet left me shes engaged to be married to a young man whom she lovesa young man who loves her am i bound to tell him shes a madmans child is there any chance of its affecting her is the taint hereditary  she spoke with deep earnestness she rushed out with it without reserve yatewestbury gazed at her compassionately he was a kind hearted man no certainly not he answered with emphasis not the very slightest reason in any way to fear it the sanest man coming from the very sanest and healthiest stock on earth would almost certainly be subject to delusions under such circumstances this is accident not diseasecircumstance not temperament the injury to the brain is the result of a special blow grief for the loss of his son and brooding over the event no doubt contributed to the particular shape the delusion has assumed but the injurys the main thing i dont doubt theres a clot of blood formed just here on the brain obstructing its functions in part and disturbing its due relations in every other way you say hes a good man of business the very apparent rationality of the delusionthe way its been led up to by his habit of standing on cliffs his name his associations his family everythingis itself a good sign that the partial insanity is due to a local and purely accidental cause it simulates reason as closely as possible dismiss the question altogether from your mind as far as your daughters future is concerned its no more likely to be inherited than a broken leg or an amputated arm is  mrs trevennack burst into a flood of joyous tears then all i have to do she sobbed out is to keep him from an outbreak until after my daughters married  dr yatewestbury nodded thats all you have to do he answered sympathetically and im sure mrs trevennack he paused with a start and checked himself  why how do you know my name the astonished mother cried drawing back with a little shudder of half superstitious alarm at such surprising prescience  dr yatewestbury made a clean breast of it well to tell the truth he said mr trevennack himself called round here yesterday in the afternoon and stated the whole case to me from his own point of view giving his name in fullas a man would naturally dobut never describing to me the nature of his delusion he said it was too sacred a thing for him to so much as touch upon that he knew he wasnt mad but that the world would think him so and he wanted to know from something hed heard said whether madness caused by an injury of the sort would or would not be considered by medical men as inheritable and i told him at once as ive told you today there was not the faintest danger of it but i never made such a slip in my life before as blurting out the name i could only have done it to you trust me your secret is safe in my keeping i have hundreds in my head he took her hand in his own as he spoke dear madam he said gently i understand i feel for you  thank you mrs trevennack answered low with tears standing in her eyes imim so glad youve seen him it makes your opinion so much more valuable to me but you thought his delusion wholly due to the accident then  wholly due to the accident dear lady yes wholly wholly due to it you may go home quite relieved your doubts and fears are groundless miss trevennack may marry with a clear conscience     chapter x  a bold attempt   during the next ten or eleven months poor mrs trevennack had but one abiding terrorthat a sudden access of irrepressible insanity might attack her husband before cleer and eustace could manage to get married trevennack however with unvarying tenderness did his best in every way to calm her fears though no word on the subject passed between them directly he let her feel with singular tact that he meant to keep himself under proper control whenever a dangerous topic cropped up in conversation he would look across at her affectionately with a reassuring smile for cleers sake he murmured often if she was close by his side for cleers sake dearest and his wife mutely grateful knew at once what he meant and smiled approval sadly  her heart was very full her part was a hard one to play with fitting cheerfulness but in his very madness itself she couldnt help loving admiring and respecting that strong grave husband who fought so hard against his own profound convictions  ten months passed away however and eustace le neve didnt seem to get much nearer any permanent appointment than ever he began to tire at last of applying unsuccessfully for every passing vacancy now and then he got odd jobs to be sure but odd jobs wont do for a man to marry upon and serious work seemed always to elude him walter tyrrel did his best no doubt to hunt up all the directors of all the companies he knew but no posts fell vacant on any line they were connected with it grieved walter to the heart for he had always had the sincerest friendship for eustace le neve and now that eustace was going to marry cleer trevennack walter felt himself doubly bound in honor to assist him it was he who had ruined the trevennacks hopes in life by his unintentional injury to their only son the least he could do in return he thought and felt was to make things as easy as possible for their daughter and her intended husband  by july however things were looking so black for the engineers prospects that tyrrel made up his mind to run up to town and talk things over seriously with eustace le neve himself in person he hated going up there for he hardly knew how he could see much of eustace without running some risk of knocking up accidentally against michael trevennack and there was nothing on earth that sensitive young squire dreaded so much as an unexpected meeting with the man he had so deeply though no doubt so unintentionally and unwittingly injured but he went all the same he felt it was his duty and duty to walter tyrrel spoke in an imperative mood which he dared not disobey however much he might be minded to turn a deaf ear to it  le neve had little to suggest of any practical value it wasnt his fault tyrrel knew engineering was slack and many good men were looking out for appointments in these crowded days its a foolish mistake to suppose that energy industry ability and integrity are necessarily successful to insure success you must have influence opportunity and good luck as well to back them without these not even the invaluable quality of unscrupulousness itself is secure from failure  if only walter tyrrel could have got his friend to accept such terms indeed he would gladly for cleers sake have asked le neve to marry on an allowance of half the penmorgan rentroll but in this commercial age such quixotic arrangements are simply impossible so tyrrel set to work with fiery zeal to find out what openings were just then to be had and first of all for that purpose he went to call on a parliamentary friend of his sir edward jones the fat and good natured chairman of the great north midland railway tyrrel was a shareholder whose vote was worth considering and he supported the board with unwavering loyalty  sir edward was therefore all attention and listened with sympathy to tyrrels glowing account of his friends engineering energy and talent when hed finished his eulogy however the practical railway magnate crossed his fat hands and put in with very commonsense dryness if hes so clever as all that why doesnt he have a shot at this wharfedale viaduct  walter tyrrel drew back a little surprised the wharfedale viaduct was a question just then in everybodys mouth but what a question why it was one of the great engineering works of the age and it was informally understood that the company were prepared to receive plans and designs from any competent person there came the rub though would eustace have a chance in such a competition as that much as he believed in his old schoolfellow tyrrel hesitated and reflected my friends young of course he said after a pause hes had very little experiencecomparatively i meanto the greatness of the undertaking  sir edward pursed his fat lips its a trick with your railway kings well young men are often more inventive than old ones he answered slowly youth has ideas middle age has experience in a matter like this my own belief is the ideas count for most yes if i were you tyrrel id ask your friend to consider it  you would walter cried brightening up  aye that i would the great railwayman answered still more confidently than before rubbing his fat hands reflectively its a capital opening erasmus walkerll be in for it of course and erasmus walkerll get it but dont you tell your fellow that itll only discourage him you just send him down to yorkshire to reconnoiter the ground and if hes good for anything when hes seen the spot hell make a plan of his own a great deal better than walkers not that thatll matter dont you know as far as this viaduct goes the companyll take walkers no matter how good any other fellows may be and how bad walkersbecause walker has a great name and because they think they cant go far wrong if they follow walker but still if your friends design is a good one itll attract attentionwhich is always something and after theyve accepted walkers and flaws begin to be found in itas experts can always find flaws in anything no matter how well plannedyour friend can come forward and make a fuss in the papers or whats better still you can come forward and make it for him to say these flaws were strikingly absent from his very superior and scientific conception therell be flaws in your friends as well of course but they wont be the same ones and nobodyll have the same interest in finding them out and exposing them and thatll get your man talked about in the papers and the profession its better anyhow than wasting his time doing nothing in london here  he shall do it walter cried all on fire ill take care he shall do it and sir edward i tell you id give five thousand pounds down if only he could get the job away from walker  got a grudge against walker then sir edward cried quickly puckering up his small eyes  oh no tyrrel answered smiling that was not much in his line but ive got strong reasons of my own on the other hand for wishing to do a good turn to le neve in this business  and he went home reflecting in his own soul on the way that many thousands would be as dross in the pan to him if only he could make cleer trevennack happy  but that very same evening trevennack came home from the admiralty in a most excited condition  lucy he cried to his wife as soon as he was alone in the room with her who do you think i saw todaythere alive in the flesh standing smiling on the steps of sir edward jones housethat brute walter tyrrel who killed our poor boy for us hush hush michael his wife cried in answer its so long ago now and he was such a boy at the time and he repents it bitterlyim sure he repents it you promised youd try to forgive him for cleers sake dear heart you must keep your promise  trevennack knit his brows what does he mean then by dogging my steps he cried what does he mean by coming after me up to london like this what does he mean by tempting me i cant stand the sight of him i wont be challenged lucy i dont know whether its the devil or not but when i saw the fellow today i had hard work to keep my hands off him i wanted to spring at his throat i would have liked to throttle him  the silverhaired lady drew still closer to the excited creature and held his hands with a gentle pressure michael she said earnestly this is the devil this is the greatest temptation of all this is what i dread most for you remember its satan himself that suggests such thoughts to you fight the devil within dearest fight him within like a man thats the surest place after all to conquer him  trevennack drew himself up proudly and held his peace for a time then he went on in another tone i shall get leave said he quietly becoming pure human once more i shall get leave of absence i cant stop in town while this creatures about id have to spring at him if i saw him again i cant keep my hands off him ill fly from temptation i must go down into the country  not to cornwall mrs trevennack cried in deep distress for she dreaded the effect of those harrowing associations for him  trevennack shook his head gravely no not to cornwall he answered ive another plan this time i want to go to dartmoor its lonely enough there not a soul to distract me you know lucy when one means to fight the devil theres nothing for it like the wilderness and dartmoors wilderness enough for me i shall go to ivybridge for the tors and the beacons  mrs trevennack assented gladly if he wanted to fight the devil it was best at any rate he should be out of reach of walter tyrrel while he did it and it was a good thing to get him away too from st michaels mount and st michaels crag and st michaels chair and all the other reminders of his archangelic dignity in the penzance neighborhood why she remembered with a wan smilethe dead ghost of a smile ratherhe couldnt even pass the angel inn at helston without explaining to his companions that the parish church was dedicated to st michael and that the swinging sign of the old coaching house once bore a picture of the winged saint himself in mortal conflict with his satanic enemy it was something at any rate to get trevennack away from a district so replete with memories of his past greatness to say nothing of the spot where their poor boy had died but mrs trevennack didnt know that one thing which led her husband to select dartmoor this time for his summer holiday was the existence on the wild hills a little behind ivybridge of a clattercrowned peak known to all the countryside as st michaels tor and crowned in earlier days by a medieval chapel it was on this sacred site of his antique cult that trevennack wished to fight the internal devil and he would fight it with a will on that he was resolved fight and as became his angelic reputation conquer     chapter xi  business is business   it reconciled cleer to leaving london for awhile when she learnt that eustace le neve was going north to yorkshire with walter tyrrel to inspect the site of the proposed wharfedale viaduct not that she ever mentioned his companions name in her fathers presence mrs trevennack had warned her many times over with tears in her eyes but without cause assigned never to allude to tyrrels existence before her fathers face and cleer though she never for one moment suspected the need for such reticence obeyed her mothers injunction with implicit honesty so they parted two ways eustace and tyrrel for the north the trevennacks for devonshire cleer needed a change indeed shed spent the best part of a year in london and for cleer that was a wild and delightful holiday though eustace wasnt there to be sure he wrote hopefully from the north he was maturing his ideas he was evolving a plan the sense of the magnitude of his stake in this attempt had given him an unwonted outburst of inspiration as she wandered with her father among those boggy uplands or stood on the rocky tors that so strangely crest the low flat hilltops of the great devonian moor she felt a marvelous exhilaration stir her blood the old cornish freedom making itself felt through all the restrictions of our modern civilization she was to the manner born and she loved the celtic west country  but to michael trevennack it was life health vigor he hated london he hated officialdom he hated the bonds of red tape that enveloped him its hard to know yourself an archangel    one of the seven who nearest to the throne    stand ready at command and are as eyes    that run through all the heavens or down to the earth  and yet to have to sit at a desk all day long with a pen in your hand in obedience to the orders of the first lord of the admiralty its hard to know you can    bear swift errands over moist and dry    oer sea and land  as his laureate milton puts it and yet be doomed to keep still hour after hour in a stuffy office or to haggle over details of pork and cheese in a malodorous victualing yard trevennack knew his paradise lost by heartit was there indeed that he had formed his main ideas of the archangelic character and he repeated the sonorous lines to himself over and over again in a ringing loud voice as he roamed the free moor or poised light on the craggy pinnacles this was the world that he loved these wild rolling uplands these tall peaks of rock these great granite boulders he had loved them always from the very beginning of things had he not poised so of old ages and ages gone by on that famous crag    of alabaster piled up to the clouds    conspicuous far winding with one ascent    accessible from earth one entrance high    the rest was craggy cliff that overhung    still as it rose impossible to climb  so he had poised in old days so he poised himself now with cleer by his side an angel confessed on those high tors of dartmoor  but amid all the undulations of that great stony ocean one peak there was that delighted trevennacks soul more than any of the resta bold russet crest bursting suddenly through the heathery waste in abrupt ascent and scarcely to be scaled save on one difficult side like its miltonic prototype even cleer who accompanied her father everywhere on his rambles clad in stout shoes and coarse blue serge gown for dartmoor is by no means a place to be approached by those who like agag walk delicatelyeven cleer didnt know that this craggy peak jagged and pointed like some alpine or dolomitic aiguille was known to all the neighboring shepherds around as st michaels tor from its now forgotten chapel a few wild moorland sheep grazed now and again on the short herbage at its base but for the most part father and daughter found themselves alone amid that gorseclad solitude there michael trevennack would stand erect with head bare and brows knit in the full eye of the sun for hour after hour at a time fighting the devil within him and when he came back at night tired out with his long tramp across the moor and his internal struggle he would murmur to his wife ive conquered him today it was a hard hard fight but i conquered i conquered him  up in the north meanwhile eustace le neve worked away with a will at the idea for his viaduct as he rightly wrote to cleer the need itself inspired him love is a great engineer and eustace learned fast from him he was full of the fresh originality of youth and the place took his fancy and impressed itself upon him gazing at it each day there rose up slowly by degrees in his mind like a dream the picture of a great work on a new and startling principlea modification of the cantilever to the necessities of the situation bit by bit he worked it out and reduced his first floating conception to paper then he explained it to walter tyrrel who listened hard to his explanations and tried his best to understand the force of the technical arguments enthusiasm is catching and le neve was enthusiastic about his imaginary viaduct till walter tyrrel in turn grew almost as enthusiastic as the designer himself over its beauty and utility so charmed was he with the idea indeed that when le neve had at last committed it all to paper he couldnt resist the temptation of asking leave to show it to sir edward jones whom he had already consulted as to eustaces prospects  eustace permitted him somewhat reluctantly to carry the design to the great railway king and on the very first day of their return to london in the beginning of october tyrrel took the papers round to sir edwards house in onslow gardens the millionaire inspected it at first with cautious reserve he was a good business man and he hated enthusiasmexcept in money matters but gradually as walter tyrrel explained to him the various points in favor of the design sir edward thawed he looked into it carefully then he went over the calculations of material and expense with a critical eye at the end he leant back in his study chair with one finger on the elevation and one eye on the figures while he observed with slow emphasis this is a very good design why man its just about twenty times better than erasmus walkers  then you think it may succeed tyrrel cried with keen delight as anxious for cleers sake as if the design were his own you think they may take it  oh dear no sir edward answered confidently with a superior smile not the slightest chance in the world of that theyd never even dream of it its novel you see novel while walkers is conventional and theyll take the conventional one but its a first rate design for all that i can tell you i never saw a better one  well but how do you know what walkers is like tyrrel asked somewhat dismayed at the practical mans coolness  oh he showed it me last night sir edward answered calmly a very decent design on the familiar lines but not fit to hold a candle to le neves of course any journeyman could have drafted it still it has walkers name to it dont you seeit has walkers name to it that means everything  is it cheaper than this would be tyrrel asked for le neve had laid stress on the point that for economy of material combined with strength of weightresisting power his own plan was remarkable  cheaper sir edward echoed oh dear no by no means nothing could very well be cheaper than this theres genius in its construction dont you see its a new idea intelligently applied to the peculiarities and difficulties of a very unusual position taking advantage most ingeniously of the natural support afforded by the rock and the inequalities of the situation i should say your friend is well within the mark in the estimate he gives he drummed his finger and calculated mentally itd save the company from a hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand pounds i fancy he said ruminating after a minute  and do you mean to tell me tyrrel exclaimed taken aback men of business like the directors of the great north midland will fling away two hundred thousand pounds of the shareholders money as if it were dirt by accepting walkers plan when they might accept this one  sir edward opened his palms like a frenchman in front of him it was a trick he had picked up on foreign bourses  my dear fellow he answered compassionately directors are men and to err is human these great north midland people are mere flesh and blood and none of them very brilliant they know walker and theyll be largely guided by walkers advice in the matter if he saw his way to make more out of contracting for carrying out somebody elses design no doubt hed do it but failing that hell palm his own off upon them and stillingfleetll accept it you see with how little wisdom the railways of the world are governed people think if they get walker to do a thing for them they shift the responsibility upon walkers shoulders and knowing nothing themselves they feel thats a great point it saves them trouble and salves their consciences  a new idea seemed to cross tyrrels mind he leant forward suddenly  but as to safety he asked with some anxiety viewed as a matter of life and death i mean which of these two viaducts is likely to last longest to be freest from danger to give rise in the end to least and fewest accidents  why your friend le neves of course the millionaire answered without a moments hesitation  you think so  i dont think so at all my dear fellow i know it im sure of it look here and he pulled out a design from a pigeonhole in his desk this is in confidence you understand i oughtnt to show it to you but i can trust your honor heres walkers idea it isnt an idea at all in fact its just the ordinary old stone viaduct with the ordinary dangers and the ordinary iron girdersnothing in any way new or original its respectable mediocrity on an affair like that and with this awkward curve too just behind takingoff point the liability to accident is considerably greater than in a construction like le neves where nothings left to chance and where every source of evil such as landsprings or freshets or weakening or concussion is considered beforehand and successfully provided against if a company only thought of the lives and limbs of its passengerswhich it never does of courseand had a head on its shoulders which it seldom possesses le neves is undoubtedly the design it would adopt in the interests of security  tyrrel drew a long breath and you know all this he said and yet you wont say a word for le neve to the directors a recommendation from you you see  sir edward shrugged his shoulders impossible he answered at once it would be a great breach of confidence remember walker showed me his design as a friend and after having looked at it i couldnt go right off and say to stillingfleet ive seen walkers plans and also another fellows and i advise you for my part not to take my friends it wouldnt be gentlemanly  tyrrel paused and reflected he saw the dilemma and yet what was the breach of confidence or of etiquette to the deadly peril to life and limb involved in choosing the worst design instead of the better one it was a hard nut to crack he could see no way out of it  besides sir edward went on musingly even if i told them they wouldnt believe me whatever walker sends in theyre sure to accept it theyve more confidence i feel sure in walker than in anybody  a light broke in on walter tyrrels mind  then the only way he said looking up would be  to work upon walker induce him not to send in if that can be managed  but it cant be sir edward answered with brisk promptitude walkers a moneygrubbing chap if he sees a chance of making a few thousands more anywhere depend upon it hell make em hes a martyr to money he is he toils and slaves for l s d money all his life he has no other interests  what can he want with it tyrrel exclaimed hes a bachelor isnt he without wife or child what can a man like that want to pile up filthy lucre for  cant say im sure sir edward answered good humoredly i have my quiver full of them myself and every guinea i get i find three of my children are quarreling among themselves for ten and sixpence apiece of it but what walker can want with money heaven only knows if i were a bachelor now and had an estate of my own in cornwall say or devonshire im sure i dont know what id do with my income  tyrrel rose abruptly the chance words had put an idea into his head  whats walkers address he asked in a very curt tone  sir edward gave it him  youll find him a tough nut though he added with a smile as he followed the enthusiastic young cornishman to the door but i see youre in earnest good luck go with you     chapter xii  a hard bargain   tyrrel took a hansom and tore round in hot haste to erasmus walkers house he sent in his card the famous engineer was happily at home tyrrel all on fire found himself ushered into the great mans study mr walker sat writing at a luxurious desk in a most luxurious room writing as if for dear life in breathless haste and eagerness he simply paused for a second in the midst of a sentence and looked up impatiently at the intruder on his desperate hurry then he motioned tyrrel into a chair with an imperious wave of his ivory penholder after that he went on writing for some moments in solemn silence only the sound of his steel nib traveling fast as it could go over the foolscap sheet broke for several seconds the embarrassing stillness  walter tyrrel therefore had ample time meanwhile to consider his host and to take in his peculiarities before walker had come to the end of his paragraph the great engineer was a bigbuilt bullnecked bulletheaded sort of person with the selfsatisfied air of monetary success but with that ominous hardness about the corners of the mouth which constantly betrays the lucky man of business his abundant long hair was irongray and wiryerasmus walker had seldom time to waste in getting it cuthis eyes were small and shrewd his hand was firm and gripped the pen in its grasp like a ponderous crowbar his writing tyrrel could see was thick black and decisive altogether the kind of man on whose brow it was written in legible characters that its dogged as does it the delicately organized cornishman felt an instinctive dislike at once for this great coarse mountain of a bullying teuton yet for cleers sake he knew he mustnt rub him the wrong way he must put up with erasmus walker and all his faults and try to approach him by the most accessible sideif indeed any side were accessible at all save the waistcoat pocket  at last however the engineer paused a moment in his headlong course through sentence after sentence held his pen half irresolute over a new blank sheet and turning round to tyrrel without one word of apology said in a quick decisive voice this is business i suppose business for if not ive no time im very pressed this morning very pressed indeed very pressed and occupied  yes it is business tyrrel answered promptly taking his cue with celtic quickness business that may be worth a good deal of money erasmus walker pricked up his ears at that welcome sound and let the pen drop quietly into the rack by his side only im afraid i must ask for a quarter of an hour or so of your valuable time you will not find it thrown away you can name your own price for it  my dear sir the engineer replied taking up his visitors card again and gazing at it hard with a certain inquiring scrutiny if its business and business of an important character of course i need hardly say im very glad to attend to you there are so many people who come bothering me for nothing dont you knowcharitable appeals or what notthat im obliged to make a hard and fast rule about interviews but if its business you mean im your man at once i live for public works go ahead im all attention  he wheeled round in his revolving chair and faced tyrrel in an attitude of sharp practical eagerness his eye was all alert it was clear the man was keen on every passing chance of a stray hundred or two extra his keenness disconcerted the conscientious and idealistic cornishman for a second or two tyrrel debated how to open fire upon so unwonted an enemy at last he began stammering ive a friend who has made a design for the wharfedale viaduct  exactly erasmus walker answered pouncing down upon him like a hawk and ive made one too and as mines in the field why your friends is waste paper  his sharpness half silenced tyrrel but with an effort the younger man went on in spite of interruption thats precisely what ive come about he said i know that already if only youll have patience and hear me out while i unfold my plan youll find what i have to propose is all to your own interest im prepared to pay well for the arrangement i ask will you name your own price for half an hours conversation and then listen to me straight on and without further interruption  erasmus walker glanced back at him with those keen ferretlike eyes of his why certainly he answered ill listen if you wish well treat it as a consultation my fees for consultation depend of course upon the nature of the subject on which advice is asked but youll pay well you say for the scheme you propose now this is business therefore we must be businesslike so first what guarantee have i of your means and solvency i dont deal with men of straw are you known in the city he jerked out his sentences as if words were extorted from him at so much per thousand  i am not tyrrel answered quietly but i gave you my card and you can see from it who i amwalter tyrrel of penmorgan manor im a landed proprietor with a good estate in cornwall and im prepared to riskwell a large part of my property in the business i propose to you without any corresponding risk on your part in plain words im prepared to pay you money down if you will accede to my wish on a pure matter of sentiment  sentiment mr walker replied bringing his jaw down like a rat trap and gazing across at him dubiously i dont deal in sentiment  no probably not tyrrel answered but i said sentiment mr walker and im willing to pay for it i know very well its an article at a discount in the city still to me it means moneys worth and im prepared to give money down to a good tune to humor it let me explain the situation ill do so as briefly and as simply as i can if only youll listen to me a friend of mine as i said one eustace le neve who has been constructing engineer of the rosario and santa fe in the argentine confederacy has made a design for the wharfedale viaduct its a very good design and a practical design and sir edward jones who has seen it entirely approves of it  jones is a good man mr walker murmured nodding his head in acquiescence no dashed nonsense about jones head screwed on the right way jones is a good man and knows what hes talking about well jones says its a good design tyrrel went on breathing freer as he gauged his man more completely and the facts are just these my friends engaged to a young lady up in town here in whom i take a deep interest mr walker whistled low to himself but didnt interrupt hima deep friendly interest tyrrel corrected growing hot in the face at the mans evident insolent misconstruction of his motives and the long and the short of it is his chance of marrying her depends very much upon whether or not he can get this design of his accepted by the directors  he cant mr walker said promptly unless he buys me out thats pat and flat he cant for mines in and mines sure to be taken  so i understand tyrrel went on your name im told carries everything before it but what i want to suggest now is simply this how much will you take money down on the nail this minute to withdraw your own design from the informal competition  erasmus walker gasped hard drew a long breath and stared at him how much will i take he repeated slowly howmuchwilli taketo withdraw my design well that is remarkable  i mean it tyrrel repeated with a very serious face this is to me i will confess a matter of life and death i want to see my friend le neve in a good position in the world such as his talents entitle him to i dont care how much i spend in order to insure it so what i want to know is just this and nothing elsehow much will you take to withdraw from the competition  erasmus walker laid his two hands on his fat knees with his legs wide open and stared long and hard at his incomprehensible visitor so strange a request stunned for a moment even that sound business head a minute or two he paused then with a violent effort he pulled himself together come come he said mr tyrrel lets be practical and aboveboard i dont want to rob you i dont want to plunder you i see you mean business but how do you know suppose even you buy me out this young fellows design has any chance of being accepted what reason have you to think the great north midland people are likely to give such a job to an unknown beginner  sir edward jones says its admirable tyrrel ventured dubiously  sir edward jones says its admirable well thats good as far as it goes jones knows what hes talking about heads screwed on the right way but has your friend any interest with the directorsthats the question have you reason to think if he sends it in and i hold back mine his is the plan theyd be likely to pitch upon  i go upon its merits walter tyrrel said quietly  the very worst thing on earth any man can ever possibly go upon the man of business retorted with cynical confidence if thats all youve got to say my dear sir it wouldnt be fair of me to make money terms with you i wont discuss my price in the matter till ive some reason to believe this idea of yours is workable  i have the designs here all ready walter tyrrel replied holding them out plans elevations specifications estimates sections figures everything will you do me the favor to look at them then perhaps youll be able to see whether or not the offers genuine  the great engineer took the roll with a smile he opened it hastily in a most skeptical humor walter tyrrel leant over him and tried just at first to put in a word or two of explanation such as le neve had made to himself but an occasionally testy yes yes i see was all the thanks he got for his pains and trouble after a minute or two he found out it was better to let the engineer alone that practiced eye picked out in a moment the strong and weak points of the whole conception gradually however as walker went on walter tyrrel could see he paid more and more attention to every tiny detail his whole manner altered the skeptical smile faded away little by little from those thick sensuous lips and a look of keen interest took its place by degrees on the mans eager features thats good he murmured more than once as he examined more closely some section or enlargement thats good very good knows what hes about this eustace le neve man now and again he turned back to reexamine some special point clever dodge he murmured half to himself clever dodge undoubtedly make an engineer in timeno doubt at all about thatif only theyll give him his head and not try to thwart him  tyrrel waited till hed finished then he leant forward once more well what do you think of it now he asked flushing hot is this businessor otherwise  oh business business the great engineer murmured musically regarding the papers before him with a certain professional affection its a devilish clever plani wont deny thatand its devilish well carried out in every detail  tyrrel seized his opportunity and if you were to withdraw your own design he asked somewhat nervously hardly knowing how best to frame his delicate question do you think  the directors  would be likely to accept this one  erasmus walker hummed and hawed he twirled his fat thumbs round one another in doubt then he answered oracularly they might of course and yet again they mightnt  upon whom would the decision rest tyrrel inquired looking hard at him  upon me almost entirely the great engineer responded at once with cheerful frankness to say the plain truth theyve no minds of their own these men theyd ask my advice and accept it implicitly  so jones told me tyrrel answered  so jones told youquite right the engineer echoed with a complacent nod theyve no minds of their own you see theyll do just as i tell them  and you think this design of le neves a good one both mechanically and financially and also exceptionally safe as regards the lives and limbs of passengers and employees tyrrel inquired once more with anxious particularity his tender conscience made him afraid to do anything in the matter unless he was quite sure in his own mind he was doing no wrong in any way either to shareholders competitors or the public generally  my dear sir mr walker replied fingering the papers lovingly its an admirable designsound cheap and practical its as good as it can be to tell you the truth i admire it immensely  well then tyrrel said at last all his scruples removedlets come to business i put it plainly how much will you take to withdraw your own design and to throw your weight into the scale in favor of my friends here  erasmus walker closed one eye and rewarded his visitor fixedly out of the other for a minute or two in silence as if taking his bearings it was a trick he had acquired from frequent use of a theodolite then he answered at last after a long deep pause its your deal mr tyrrel make me an offer wont you  five thousand pounds tremblingly suggested walter tyrrel  erasmus walker opened his eye slowly and never allowed his surprise to be visible on his face why to him a job like that entailing loss of time in personal supervision was hardly worth three the plans were perfunctory and as far as there was anything in them could be used again elsewhere he could employ his precious days meanwhile to better purpose in some more showy and profitable work than this halfhatched viaduct but this was an upset price not enough he murmured slowly shaking his bullet head its a fortune to the young man you must make a better offer  walter tyrrels lip quivered six thousand he said promptly  the engineer judged from the promptitude of the reply that the cornish landlord must still be well squeezable he shook his head gain no no not enough he answered short not enoughby a long way  eight tyrrel suggested drawing a deep breath of suspense it was a big sum indeed for a modest estate like penmorgan  the engineer shook his head once more that rush up two thousand at once was a very good feature the man who could mount by two thousand at a time might surely be squeezed to the even figure  im afraid walter said quivering after a brief mental calculationmortgage at four per centand agricultural depression running down the current value of land in the marketi couldnt by any possibility go beyond ten thousand but to save my friendand to get the young lady marriedi wouldnt mind going as far as that to meet you  the engineer saw at once with true business instinct his man had reached the end of his tether he struck while the iron was hot and clinched the bargain wellas theres a lady in the casehe said gallantlyand to serve a young man of undoubted talent wholl do honor to the profession i dont mind closing with you ill take ten thousand money down to back out of it myself and ill say what i canhonestlyto the midland board in your friends favor  very good tyrrel answered drawing a deep breath of relief i ask no more than that say what you can honestly the money shall be paid you before the end of a fortnight  only mind mr walker added in an impressive afterthought i cant of course engage that the great north midland people will take my advice you mustnt come down upon me for restitution and all that if your friend dont succeed and they take some other fellow all i guarantee for certain is to withdraw my own plansnot to send in anything myself for the competition  i fully understand tyrrel answered and im content to risk it but mind if any other design is submitted of superior excellence to le neves i wouldnt wish you on any account toto do or say anything that goes against your conscience  erasmus walker stared at him whatafter paying ten thousand pounds he said to secure the job  tyrrel nodded a solemn nod especially he added if you think it safer to life and limb i should never forgive myself if an accident were to occur on eustace le neves viaduct     chapter xiii  angel and devil   tyrrel left erasmus walkers house that morning in a turmoil of mingled exultation and fear at least he had done his best to atone for the awful results of his boyish act of criminal thoughtlessness he had tried to make it possible for cleer to marry eustace and thereby to render the trevennacks happier in their sonless old age and what was more satisfactory still he had crippled himself in doing it there was comfort even in that expiation reparation he wouldnt have cared for the sacrifice so much if it had cost him less but it would cost him dear indeed he must set to work at once now and raise the needful sum by mortgaging penmorgan up to the hilt to do it  after all of course the directors might choose some other design than eustaces but he had done what he could and he would hope for the best at any rate for cleers sake if the worst came he would have risked and lost much while if cleers life was made happy he would be happy in the thought of it  he hailed another hansom and drove off still on fire to his lawyers in victoria street on the way he had to go near paddington station he didnt observe as he did so a fourwheel cab that passed him with luggage on top from ivybridge to london it was the trevennacks just returned from their holiday on dartmoor but michael trevennack had seen him and his brow grew suddenly dark he pinched his nails into his palm at sight of that hateful creature though not a sound escaped him for cleer was in the carriage and the man was eustaces friend trevennack accepted eustace perforce after that night on michaels crag for he knew it was politic and indeed he liked the young man himself well enoughthere was nothing against him after all beyond his friendship with tyrrel but had it not been for the need for avoiding scandal after the adventure on the rock he would never have allowed cleer to speak one word to any friend or acquaintance of her brothers murderer  as it was however he never alluded to tyrrel in any way before cleer he had learnt to hold his tongue madman though he was he knew when to be silent  that evening at home cleer had a visit from eustace who came round to tell her how tyrrel had been to see the great engineer erasmus walker and how it was all a mistake that walker was going to send in plans for the wharfedale viaductnay how the big man had approved of his own design and promised to give it all the support in his power for tyrrel was really an awfully kind friend who had pushed things for him like a brick and deserved the very best they could both of them say about him  but of course eustace hadnt the faintest idea himself by what manner of persuasion walter tyrrel had commended his friends designs to erasmus walker if he had needless to say he would never have accepted the strange arrangement  and now cleer eustace cried jubilant and radiant with the easy confidence of youth and love i do believe i shall carry the field at last and spring at a bound into a firstrate position among engineers in england  and then cleer asked nestling close to his side  and then eustace went on smiling tacitly at her native simplicity as it would mean permanent work in superintending and so forth i see no reason whywe shouldnt get married immediately  they were alone in the breakfast room where mrs trevennack had left them they were alone like lovers but in the drawingroom hard by trevennack himself was saying to his wife with a face of suppressed excitement i saw him again today lucy i saw him again that devilin a hansom near paddington if he stops in town im sure i dont know what im ever to do i came back from devonshire having fought the devil hard as i thought and conquered him i felt id got him under i felt he was no match for me but when i see that mans face the devil springs up at me again in full force and grapples with me is he satan himself i believe he must be for i feel i must rush at him and trample him under foot as i trampled him long ago on the summit of niphates  in a tremor of alarm mrs trevennack held his hand oh what would she ever do if the outbreak came  before cleer was married she could see the constant strain of holding himself back was growing daily more and more difficult for her unhappy husband indeed she couldnt bear it herself much longer if cleer didnt marry soon michael would break out openlyperhaps would try to murder that poor man tyrrel and then eustace would be afraid and all would be up with them  by and by eustace came in to tell them the good news he said nothing about tyrrel at least by name lest he should hurt trevennack he merely mentioned that a friend of his had seen erasmus walker that day and that walker had held out great hopes of success for him in this wharfedale viaduct business trevennack listened with a strange mixture of interest and contempt he was glad the young man was likely to get on in his chosen professionfor cleers sake if it would enable them to marry but oh what a fuss it seemed to him to make about such a trifle as a mere bit of a valley that one could fly across in a secondto him who could become         to his proper shape returned      a seraph winged six wings he wore to shade      his lineaments divine the pair that clad      each shoulder broad came mantling oer his breast      with regal ornament the middle pair      girt like a starry zone his waist and round      skirted his loins and thighs the third his feet      shadowed from either heel with feathered mail  and then they talked to him about the difficulties of building a few hundred yards of iron bridge across a miserable valley why was it not he and his kind of whom it was written that they came      gliding through the even      on a sunbeam swift as a shooting star      in autumn thwarts the night  a viaduct indeed a paltry human viaduct what need with such as him to talk of bridges or viaducts  as eustace left that evening mrs trevennack followed him out and beckoned him mysteriously into the diningroom at the side for a minutes conversation the young man followed her much wondering what this strange move could mean mrs trevennack fell back half faint into a chair and gazed at him with a frightened look very rare on that brave face of hers oh eustace she said hurriedly do you know whats happened mr tyrrels in town michael saw him today he was driving near paddington now do you think you could do anything to keep him out of michaels way i dread their meeting i dont know whether you know it but michael has some grudge against him for cleers sake and for yours do keep them apart i beg of you if they meet i cant answer for what harm may come of it  eustace was taken aback at her unexpected words not even to cleer had he ever hinted in any way at the strange disclosure walter tyrrel made to him that first day at penmorgan he hesitated how to answer her without betraying his friends secret at last he said as calmly as he could i guessed to tell you the truth there was some cause of quarrel ill do my very best to keep tyrrel out of the way mrs trevennack as you wish it but im afraid he wont be going down from town for some time to come for he told me only today he had business at his lawyers in victoria street westminster which might keep him here a fortnight indeed i rather doubt whether hell care to go down again until he knows for certain one way or the other about the wharfedale viaduct  mrs trevennack sank back in her chair very pale and wan oh what shall we do if they meet she cried wringing her hands in despair what shall we do if they meet this is more than i can endure eustace eustace i shall break down my burdens too heavy for me  the young man leant over her like a son mrs trevennack he said gently smoothing her silvery white hair with sympathetic fingers i think i can keep them apart ill speak seriously to tyrrel about it hes a very good fellow and hell do anything i ask of him im sure hell try to avoid falling in with your husband hes my kindest of friends and hed cut off his hand to serve me  one word of sympathy brought tears into mrs trevennacks eyes she looked up through them and took the young mans hand in hers it was he who spoke to erasmus walker i suppose she murmured slowly  and eustace nodding assent answered in a low voice it was he mrs trevennack hes a dear good fellow  the orphaned mother clasped her hands this was too too much and michael if the fit came upon him would strangle that young man who was doing his best after all for cleer and eustace  but that night in his bed trevennack lay awake chuckling grimly to himself in an access of mad triumph he fancied he was fighting his familiar foe on a tall cornish peak in archangelic fashion and he had vanquished his enemy and was trampling on him furiously but the face of the fallen seraph was not the face of michael angelos satan as he oftenest figured itfor michael angelo his namesake was one of trevennacks very chiefest admirationsit was the face of walter tyrrel who killed his dear boy writhing horribly in the dust and crying for mercy beneath him     chapter xiv  at arms length   for three or four weeks walter tyrrel remained in town awaiting the result of the wharfedale viaduct competition with some difficulty he raised and paid over meanwhile to erasmus walker the ten thousand pounds of blackmailfor it was little elseagreed upon between them the great engineer accepted the money with as little compunction as men who earn large incomes always display in taking payment for doing nothing it is an enviable state of mind unattainable by most of us who work hard for our living he pocketed his check with a smile as if it were quite in the nature of things that ten thousand pounds should drop upon him from the clouds without rhyme or reason to tyrrel on the other hand with his sensitive conscience the mans greed and callousness seemed simply incomprehensible he stood aghast at such sharp practice but for cleers sake and to ease his own soul he paid it all over without a single murmur  and then the question came up in his mind would it be effectual after all would walker play him false would he throw the weight of his influence into somebody elses scale would the directors submit as tamely as he thought to his direction or dictation it would be hard on tyrrel if after his spending ten thousand pounds without security of any sort eustace were to miss the chance and cleer to go unmarried  at the end of a month however as tyrrel sat one morning in his own room at the metropole which he mostly frequented eustace le neve rushed in full of intense excitement tyrrels heart rose in his mouth he grew pale with agitation the question had been decided one way or the other he saw  well which is it he gasped out hit or miss have you got it  yes ive got it eustace answered half beside himself with delight ive got it ive got it the chairman and walker have just been round to call on me and congratulate me on my success walker says my fortunes made its a magnificent design and in any case itll mean work for me for the next four years after which ill not want for occupation elsewhere so now of course i can marry almost immediately  thank god tyrrel murmured falling back into his chair as he spoke and turning deadly white  he was glad of it oh so glad and yet in his own heart it would cost him many pangs to see cleer really married in good earnest to eustace  he had worked for it with all his might to be sure he had worked for it and paid for it and now he saw his wishes on the very eve of fulfillment the natural man within him rose up in revolt against the complete success of his own unselfish action  as for mrs trevennack when she heard the good news she almost fainted with joy it might yet be in time cleer might be married now before poor michael broke forth in that inevitable paroxysm  for inevitable she felt it was at last as each day went by it grew harder and harder for the man to contain himself fighting desperately against it every hour immersing himself as much as he could in the petty fiddling details of the office and the victualing yard so as to keep the fierce impulse under due control michael trevennack yet found the mad mood within him more and more ungovernable with each week that went by as he put it to his own mind he could feel his wings growing as if they must burst through the skin he could feel it harder and ever harder as time went on to conceal the truth to pretend he was a mere man when he knew himself to be really the prince of the archangels to busy himself about contracts for pork and cheese and biscuits when he could wing his way n boldly over sea and land or stand forth before the world in gorgeous gear armed as of yore in the adamant and gold of his celestial panoply  so michael trevennack thought in his own seething soul but that strong brave woman his wife bearing her burden unaided and watching him closely day and night with a keen eye of mingled love and fear could see that the madness was gaining on him gradually oftener and oftener now did he lose himself in his imagined world less and less did he tread the solid earth beneath us mrs trevennack had by this time but one anxious care left in lifeto push on as fast as possible cleer and eustaces marriage  but difficulties intervened as they always will intervene in this workaday world of ours first of all there were formalities about the appointment itself then even when all was arranged eustace found he had to go north in person shortly after christmas and set to work with a will at putting his plan into practical shape for contractor and workmen and as soon as he got there he saw at once he must stick at it for six months at least before he could venture to take a short holiday for the sake of getting married engineering is a very absorbing trade it keeps a man day and night at the scene of his labors  storm or flood at any moment may ruin everything it would be prudent too eustace thought to have laid by a little more for household expenses before plunging into the unknown sea of matrimony and though mrs trevennack flying full in the face of all matronly respect for foresight in young people urged him constantly to marry money or no money and never mind about a honeymoon eustace stuck to his point and determined to take no decisive step till he saw how the work was turning out in wharfedale it was thus full august of the succeeding year before he could fix a date definitely and then to cleers great joy he named a day at last about the beginning of september  it was an immense relief to mrs trevennacks mind when after one or two alterations she knew the third was finally fixed upon she had good reasons of her own for wishing it to be early for the twenty ninth is michaelmas day and it was always with difficulty that her husband could be prevented from breaking out before the eyes of the world on that namesake feast of st michael and all angels for on that sacred day when in every church in christendom his importance as the generalissimo of the angelic host was remembered and commemorated it seemed hard indeed to the seraph in disguise that he must still guard his incognito still go on as usual with his petty higgling over corned beef and biscuits and the price of jute sacking there was war in heaven said the gospel for the daythat sonorous gospel mrs trevennack so cordially dreadedfor her husband would always go to church at morning service and hold himself more erect than was his wont to hear itthere was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not and should he who could thus battle against all the powers of evil be held in check any longer as with a leash of straw by the lords commissioners of the admiralty no no he would stand forth in his true angelic shape and show these martinets what form they had ignorantly taken for mere michael trevennack of the victualing department  one thing alone eased mrs trevennacks mind through all those weary months of waiting and watching walter tyrrel had long since gone back again to penmorgan her husband had been free from that greatest of all temptations to a mad paroxysm of ragethe sight of the man who as he truly believed had killed their michael and now if only tyrrel would keep away from town till cleer was married and all was settledmrs trevennack sighed deepshe would almost count herself a happy woman  on the day of cleers wedding however walter tyrrel came to town he came on purpose he couldnt resist the temptation of seeing with his own eyes the final success of his general plan even though it cost him the pang of watching the marriage of the one girl he ever truly loved to another man by his own deliberate contrivance but he didnt forget eustace le neves earnest warning that he should keep out of the way of michael trevennack even without eustace his own conscience would have urged that upon him the constant burden of his remorse for that boyish crime weighed hard upon him every hour of every day that he lived he didnt dare on such a morning to face the father of the boy he had unwittingly and halfinnocently murdered  so very early as soon as the church was opened he stole in unobserved and took a place by himself in the farthest corner of the gallery a pillar concealed him from view for further security he held his handkerchief constantly in front of his face or shielded himself behind one of the big freeseat prayerbooks cleer came in looking beautiful in her wedding dress mrs trevennacks pathetic face glowed radiant for once in this final realization of her dearest wishes a single second only near the end of the ceremony tyrrel leaned forward incautiously anxious to see cleer at an important point of the proceedings at the very same instant trevennack raised his face their eyes met in a flash tyrrel drew back horrorstruck and penitent at his own intrusion at such a critical moment but strange to say trevennack took no overt notice had his wife only known she would have sunk in her seat in her agony of fear but happily she didnt know trevennack went through the ceremony all outwardly calm he gave no sign of what he had seen even to his wife herself he buried it deep in his own heart that made it all the more dangerous     chapter xv  st michael does battle   the wedding breakfast went off pleasantly without a hitch of any sort trevennack always dignified and always a grand seigneur rose to the occasion with his happiest spirit the silverhaired wife gazing up at him felt proud of him as of old and was for once quite at her ease for all was over now thank heaven and dear cleer was married  that same afternoon the bride and bridegroom started off for their honeymoon to the tyrol and italy when mrs trevennack was left alone with her husband it was with a thankful heart she turned to him flowing over in soul with joy oh michael she cried melting im so happy so happy so happy  trevennack stooped down and kissed her forehead tenderly he had always been a good husband and he loved her with all his heart thats well lucy he answered thank god its all over for i cant hold out much longer the strains too much for me he paused a moment and looked at her lucy he said once more clasping his forehead with one hand ive fought against it hard im fighting against it still but at times it almost gets the better of me do you know who i saw in the church this morning skulking behind a pillar that man walter tyrrel  mrs trevennack gazed at him all aghast this was surely a delusion a fixed idea an insane hallucination oh no dear she cried prying deep into his eyes it couldnt be he it couldnt you must be mistaken michael im sure hes not in london  no more mistaken than i am this minute trevennack answered rushing over to the window and pointing with one hand eagerly see see there he is lucythe man that killed our poor dear michael  mrs trevennack uttered a little cry half sob half wail as she looked out of the window and under the gaslamps opposite recognized through the mist the form of walter tyrrel  but trevennack didnt rush out at him as she feared and believed he would he only stood still in his place and glared at his enemy not now he said slowly not now on cleers wedding day but some other timemore suitable i hear it in my ears i hear the voice still ringing go michael of celestial armies prince i cant disobey i shall go in due time i shall fight the enemy  and he sank back in his chair with his eyes staring wildly  for the next week or two while cleer wrote home happy letters from paris innsbruck milan venice florence poor mrs trevennack was tortured inwardly with another terrible doubt had michaels state become so dangerous at last that he must be put under restraint as a measure of public security for walter tyrrels sake ought she to make his condition known to the world at largeand spoil cleers honeymoon she shrank from that final necessity with a deadly shrinking day after day she put the discovery off and solaced her soul with the best intentionsas what true woman would not  but we know where good intentions go on the morning of the twenty ninth which is michaelmas day the poor mother rose in fear and trembling michael to all outward appearance was as sane as usual he breakfasted and went down to the office as was his wont  when he arrived there however he found letters from falmouth awaiting him with bad news his presence was needed at once he must miss his projected visit to st michaels cornhill he must go down to cornwall  hailing a cab at the door he hastened back to paddington just in time for the cornish express this was surely a call the words rang in his ears louder and clearer than ever go michael of celestial armies prince he would go and obey them he would trample under foot this foul fiend that masqueraded in human shape as his dear boys murderer he would wield once more that huge twohanded sword brandished aloft widewasting in unearthly warfare he would come out in his true shape before heaven and earth as the chief of the archangels  stepping into a firstclass compartment he found himself unluckily for his present mood alone all the way down to exeter the fit was on him he stood up in the carriage swaying his unseen blade celestial temper fine and rolling forth in a loud voice miltonic verses of his old encounters in heaven with the powers of darkness       now waved their fiery swords and in the air       made horrid circles two broad suns their shields       blazed opposite while expectation stood       in horror  he mouthed out the lines in a perfect ecstasy of madness it was delightful to be alone he could give his soul full vent he knew he was mad he knew he was an archangel  and all the way down he repeated to himself many times over that he would trample under foot that base fiend walter tyrrel satan has many disguises squat like a toad close at the ear of eve he sat in paradise for      spirits as they please      can limb themselves and color or size assume      as likes them best condense or rare  if he himself michael prince of celestial hosts could fit his angelic majesty to the likeness of a man trevennackcould not satan meet him on his own ground and try to thwart him as of old in the likeness of a man walter tyrrelhis dear boys murderer  as far as exeter this was his one train of thought but from there to plymouth new passengers got in they turned the current trevennack changed his mind rapidly another mood came over him his wifes words struck him vaguely in some tenderer place fight the devil within you michael fight him there and conquer him that surely was fitter far for an angelic nature that foeman was worthier his celestial steel turn homeward angel now and melt with ruth not his to do vengeance on the man walter tyrrel not his to play the divine part of vindicator in his madness even trevennack was magnanimous leave the creature to the torment of his own guilty soul do angels care for thrusts of such as he tantaene animis coelestibus irae  at ivybridge station the train slowed and then stopped trevennack accustomed to the cornish express noted the stoppage with surprise were not down to pull up here he said quickly to the guard  no sir the guard answered touching his hat with marked respect for he knew the admiralty official well signals are against us lines blocked as far as plymouth  ill get out here then trevennack said in haste and the guard opened the door a new idea had rushed suddenly into the madmans head this was st michaels dayhis own day and there was st michaels torhis own torfull in sight before him he would go up there this very evening and before the eyes of all the world in his celestial armor taking lucys advice do battle with and quell this fierce devil within him  no sooner thought than done fiery hot within he turned out of the gate and as the shades of autumn evening began to fall walked swiftly up the moor toward the tor and the uplands  as he walked his heart beat to a lilting rhythm within him go michael of celestial armies princego michaelgo michael go michael of celestial armies princego michaelgo michael  the moor was draped in fog it was a still damp evening swirling clouds rose slowly up and lifted at times and disclosed the peaty hollows the high tors the dusky heather but trevennack stumbled on oer bog or steep through strait rough dense or rare as chance might lead him clambering ever toward his goal now seen now invisiblethe great stack of wild rock that crowned the gray undulating moor to northward often he missed his way often he floundered for awhile in deep ochreous bottoms up to his knees in soft slush but with some strange mad instinct he wandered on nevertheless and slowly drew near the high point he was aiming at  by this time it was pitch dark the sun had set and fog obscured the starlight but trevennack all on fire wandered madly forward and scaled the rocky tor by the wellknown path guided not by sight but by pure instinctive groping in his present exalted state indeed he had no need of eyes what matters earthly darkness to angelic feet he could pick his own way through the gloom though all the fiends from hell in serried phalanx broke loose to thwart him he would reach the top at last reach the top reach the top and there fight that old serpent who lay in wait to destroy him at last he gained the peak and stood with feet firmly planted on the little rocky platform now satan come on ha traitor come if you dare your antagonist is ready for you  crrrk as he stood there waiting a terrible shock brought him to himself all at once with startling suddenness trevennack drew back aghast and appalled even in his mad exaltation this strange assault astonished him he had expected a struggle indeed he had expected a conflict but with a spiritual foe to meet his adversary in so bodily a form as this wholly startled and surprised him for it was a fierce earthly shock he received upon his right leg as he mounted the rocky platform satan had been lying in wait for him then expecting him waylaying him and in corporeal presence too for this was a spear of good steel this was a solid thing that assaulted him as he rose assaulted him with frantic rage and uncontrollable fury  for a moment trevennack was stunnedthe sharpness of the pain and the suddenness of the attack took both breath and sense away from him he stood there one instant irresolute before he knew how to comport himself but before he could make up his mindcrrk a second time the presence had assailed him again fighting with deadly force and in a white heat of frenzy trevennack had no leisure to think what this portent might mean man or fiend it was a lifeanddeath struggle now between them he stood face to face at last in mortal conflict with his materialized enemy what form the evil thing had assumed to suit his present purpose trevennack knew not nor did he even care stung with pain and terror he rushed forward blindly upon his enraged assailant and closed with him at once tooth and nail in a deadly grapple  a more terrible battle man and brute never fought trevennack had no sword no celestial panoply but he could wrestle like a cornishman he must trample his foe under foot then in this final struggle by sheer force of strong thews and strained muscles alone he fought the creature as it stood flinging his arms round it wildly the thing seemed to rear itself as if on cloven hoofs trevennack seized it round the waist and grasping it hard in an iron grip clung to it with all the wild energy of madness yield satan yield but still the creature eluded him once more it drew back a pacehe felt its hot breath he smelt its hateful smelland prepared to rush again at him trevennack bent down to receive its attack crouching the creature burst full tilt on himit almost threw him over trevennack caught it in his horror and awecaught it bodily by the hornsfor horned it seemed to be as well as clovenfootedand by sheer force of arm held it off from him an elbows length one minute the thing struggled and reared again yes yes it was satanhe felt him all over nowa devil undisguisedbut satan rather in medieval than in miltonic fashion his skin was rough and hairy as a satyrs his odor was foul his feet were cleft his horns sharp and terrible he flung him from him horrified  quick as lightning the demon rose again and tilted fiercely at him once more it was a death fight between those two for that rocky platform should satan thus usurp st michaels tor ten thousand times no yield yield no surrender each knew the ground well and even in the dark and in the mad heat of the conflict each carefully avoided the steep edge of the precipice but the fiend knew it best apparently he had been lying in a snug nook under lee of a big rock sharpening his sword on its side before trevennack came up there against this rock he took his stand firm as a rock himself and seemed to defy his enemys arms to dislodge him from his position  trevennacks hands and legs were streaming now with blood his left arm was sorely wounded his thumb hung useless but with the strange energy of madness he continued the desperate conflict against his unseen foe never should michael turn and yield to the deadly assaults of the evil one he rushed on blindly once more and the adversary stooped to oppose him again a terrible shock it almost broke both his knees but by sheer strength of nerve he withstood it still struggling then they closed in a final grapple it was a toothand nail conflict they fought one another with every weapon they possessed each hugged each in their fury they tilted and tore and wrestled and bit and butted  trevennacks coat was in ribbons his arm was ripped and bleeding but he grasped the adversary still he fought blindly to the end down satan i defy thee  it was a long fierce fight at last bit by bit the enemy began to yield trevennack had dashed him against the crag time after time like a log till he too was torn and hurt and bleeding his flesh was like pulp he could endure the unequal fight no longer he staggered and gave way a great joy rose up tremulous in trevennacks heart even without his celestial sword then he had vanquished his enemy he seized the creature round the middle dragged it a dead weight in his weary arms to the edge of the precipice and dropped it feebly resisting on to the bare rock beneath him  victory victory once more a great victory  he stood on the brink of the tor and poised himself as if for flight in his accustomed attitude but he was faint from loss of blood and his limbs shook under him  a light seemed to break before his blinded eyes victory victory it was the light from heaven he stared forward to welcome it the brink of the precipice what was that to such as he he would spread his wingsfor onceat lastthus thus and fly forward on full pinions to his expected triumph  he raised both arms above his head and spread them out as if for flight his knees trembled fearfully his fingers quivered then he launched himself on the air and fell his eyes closed halfway he lost consciousness he fainted before he had reached the bottom he was wholly insensible  next day it was known before noon in london that a strange and inexplicable accident had befallen mr michael trevennack cmg the wellknown admiralty official on the moor near ivybridge mr trevennack it seemed had started by the cornish express for falmouth on official business but the line being blocked between ivybridge and plymouth he had changed his plans and set out to walk as was conjectured by a devious path across the moor to tavistock deceased knew the neighborhood well and was an enthusiastic admirer of its tors and uplands but fog coming on the unfortunate gentleman it was believed had lost his way and tried to shelter himself for a time behind a tall peak of rock which he used frequently to visit during his summer holidays there he was apparently attacked by a savage moorland ramone of that wild breed of mountain sheep peculiar to dartmoor and famous for the strength and ferocity often displayed by the fathers of the flock mr trevennack was unarmed and a terrible fight appeared to have taken place between these illmatched antagonists on the summit of the rocks full details of which the telegram said in its curt businesslike way were too ghastly for publication after a long and exhausting struggle however the combatants must either have slipped on the wet surface and tumbled over the edge of the rocks together in a deadly grapple or else as seemed more probable from the positions in which the bodies were found the unhappy gentleman had just succeeded in flinging his assailant over and then faint from loss of blood had missed his footing and fallen beside his dead antagonist at any rate when the corpse was discovered life had been extinct for several hours and it was the opinion of the medical authorities who conducted the post mortem that death was due not so much to the injuries themselves as to asphyxiation in the act of falling      the jury found it death from accidental circumstances cleer never knew more than that her father had met his end by walking over the edge of a cliff on dartmoor      but when the body came home for burial dr yatewestbury looked in by mrs trevennacks special request and performed an informal and private examination of the brain and nervous system at the close of the autopsy he came down to the drawingroom where the silverhaired lady sat pale and tearful but courageous it is just as i thought he said a clot of blood due to external injury has pressed for years above the left frontal region causing hallucinations and irregularities of a functional character only you neednt have the slightest fear of its proving hereditary its as purely accidental as a sprain or a wound your daughter mrs le neve couldnt possibly suffer for it  and neither cleer nor le neve nor anyone else ever shared that secret of trevennacks delusions with his wife and the doctor
