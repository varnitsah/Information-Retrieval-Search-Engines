stanley is brought before bandoola the burmese general stanley gave a sudden spring and buried his knife in the leopard they forced the canoe behind bushes so as to be entirely concealed the burmese make a great effort to capture pagoda hill stanley cut down the man who was about to fire the hut the great snake moved his head higher and higher hissing angrily in vain the burmese tried to force their way into the chamber the old burmese general was carried from point to point in a litter    preface   with the exception of the terrible retreat from afghanistan none of englands many little wars have been so fatalin proportion to the number of those engagedas our first expedition to burma it was undertaken without any due comprehension of the difficulties to be encountered from the effects of climate and the deficiency of transport the power and still more the obstinacy and arrogance of the court of ava were altogether underrated and it was considered that our possession of her ports would assuredly bring the enemy who had wantonly forced the struggle upon us to submission events however proved the completeness of the error the burman policy of carrying off every boat on the river laying waste the whole country and driving away the inhabitants and the herds maintained our army as prisoners in rangoon through the first wet season and caused the loss of half the white officers and men first sent there the subsequent campaign was no less fatal and although large reinforcements had been sent fifty percent of the whole died so that less than two thousand fighting men remained in the ranks when the expedition arrived within a short distance of ava not until the last burmese army had been scattered did the court of ava submit to the by no means onerous terms we imposed  great indeed was the contrast presented by this first invasion of the country with the last war in 1885 which brought about the final annexation of burma then a fleet of steamers conveyed the troops up the noble river while in 1824 a solitary steamer was all that india could furnish to aid the flotilla of rowboats no worse government has ever existed than that of burma when with the boast that she intended to drive the british out of india she began the war no people were ever kept down by a more grinding tyranny and the occupation of the country by the british has been an even greater blessing to the population than has that of india  several works some by eyewitnesses others compiled from official documents appeared after the war they differ remarkably in the relation of details and still more in the spelling of the names both of persons and places i have chiefly followed those given in the narratives of mr h h wilson and of major snodgrass the military secretary to the commander of the expedition    chapter 1 a new career   a party was assembled in a room of an hotel in calcutta at the end of the year 1822 it consisted of a gentleman a lady in deep mourning a boy of between fourteen and fifteen and two girls of thirteen and twelve  i think you had better accept my offer nellie the gentleman was saying you will find it hard work enough to make both ends meet with these two girls and stanley would be a heavy drain on you the girls cost nothing but their clothes but he must go to a decent school and then there would be the trouble of thinking what to do with him afterwards if i could have allowed you a couple of hundred a year it would have been altogether different but you see i am fighting an uphill fight myself and need every penny that i can scrape together i am getting on and i can see well enough that unless something occurs to upset the whole thing i shall be doing a big trade one of these days but every half penny of profit has to go into the business so as you know i cannot help you at present though by the time the girls grow up i hope i shall be able to do so and that to a good extent  i feel sure that it would not be a bad thing for stanley he will soon get to be useful to me and in three or four years will be a valuable assistant speaking hindustani as well as he does he wont be very long in picking up enough of the various dialects in kathee and chittagong for our purpose and by twenty he will have a share of the business and be on the highway towards making his fortune it will be infinitely better than anything he is likely to find in england and he will be doing a mans work at the age when he would still be a schoolboy in england  i have spoken to him about it of course he does not like leaving you but he says that he should like it a thousand times better than perhaps having to go into some humdrum office in england  thank you tom mrs brooke said with a sigh it will be very hard to part with himterribly hardbut i see that it is by far the best thing for him and as you say in a monetary way it will be a relief to me i think i can manage very comfortably on the pension in some quiet place at home with the two girls but stanleys schooling would be a heavy drain i might even manage that for i might earn a little money by painting but there would be the question of what to do with him when he left school and without friends or influence it will be hopeless to get him into any good situation  you see herberts parents have both died since he came out here and though he was distantly related to the earl of netherly he was only a second cousin or something of that kind and knew nothing about the family and of course i could not apply to them  certainly not nellie her brother agreed there is nothing so hateful as posing as a poor relationand that is a connection rather than a relationship then you will leave the boy in my hands  i am sure that it will be best she said with a tremor in her voice and at any rate i shall have the comfort of knowing that he will be well looked after  mrs brooke was the widow of a captain in one of the native regiments of the east india company he had six weeks before this been carried off suddenly by an outbreak of cholera and she had been waiting at calcutta in order to see her brother before sailing for england she was the daughter of an english clergyman who had died some seventeen years before nellie who was then eighteen being motherless as well as fatherless had determined to sail for india a great friend of hers had married and gone out a year before nellies father was at that time in bad health and her friend had said to her at parting  now mind nellie i have your promise that if you should find yourself alone here you will come out to me in india i shall be very glad to have you with me and i dont suppose you will be on my hands very long pretty girls dont remain single many months in india  so seeing nothing better to do nellie had shortly after her fathers death sailed for calcutta  lieutenant brooke was also a passenger on board the ava and during the long voyage he and nellie pearson became engaged and were married from her friends house a fortnight after their arrival nellie was told that she was a foolish girl for that she ought to have done better but she was perfectly happy the pay and allowances of her husband were sufficient for them to live upon in comfort and though when the children came there was little to spare the addition of pay when he gained the rank of captain was ample for their wants they had been in fact a perfectly happy coupleboth had bright and sunny dispositions and made the best of everything and she had never had a serious care until he was suddenly taken away from her  stanley had inherited his parents disposition and as his sisters coming so soon after him occupied the greater portion of his mothers care he was left a good deal to his own devices and became a general pet in the regiment and was equally at home in the mens lines and in the officers bungalows the native language came as readily to him as english and by the time he was ten he could talk in their own tongue with the men from the three or four different districts from which the regiment had been recruited his father devoted a couple of hours a day to his studies he did not attempt to teach him latinwhich would he thought be altogether useless to himbut gave him a thorough grounding in english and indian history and arithmetic and insisted upon his spending a certain time each day in reading standard english authors  tom pearson who was five years younger than his sister had come out to india four years after her he was a lad full of life and energy as soon as he left school finding himself the master of a hundred poundsthe last remains of the small sum that his father had left behind himhe took a secondclass passage to calcutta as soon as he had landed he went round to the various merchants and offices and finding that he could not owing to a want of references obtain a clerkship he took a place in the store of a parsee merchant who dealt in english goods here he remained for five years by which time he had mastered two or three native languages and had obtained a good knowledge of business  he now determined to start on his own account he had lived hardly saving up every rupee not needed for actual necessaries and at the end of the five years he had in all a hundred and fifty pounds he had long before this determined that the best opening for trade was among the tribes on the eastern borders of the british territory and had specially devoted himself to the study of the languages of kathee and chittagong  investing the greater portion of his money in goods suitable for the trade he embarked at calcutta in a vessel bound for chittagong there he took passage in a native craft going up the great river to sylhet where he established his headquarters and thenceleaving the greater portion of his goods in the care of a native merchant with whom his late employer had had dealingsstarted with a native and four donkeys on which his goods were packed to trade among the wild tribes  his success fully equalled his anticipations and gradually he extended his operations going as far east as manipur and south almost as far as chittagong the firm in calcutta from whom he had in the first place purchased his goods sent him up fresh stores as he required them and soon seeing the energy with which he was pushing his business gave him considerable credit and he was able to carry on his operations on an increasingly larger scale sylhet remained his headquarters but he had a branch at chittagong whither goods could be sent direct from calcutta and from this he drew his supplies for his trade in that province  much of his business was carried on by means of the waterways and the very numerous streams that covered the whole country and enabled him to carry his goods at a far cheaper rate than he could transport them by land and for this purpose he had a boat specially fitted up with a comfortable cabin he determined from the first to sell none but the best goods in the market and thus he speedily gained the confidence of the natives and the arrival of his boats was eagerly hailed by the villagers on the banks of the rivers  he soon found that money was scarce and that to do a good business he must take native products in barter for his goods and that in this way he not only did a much larger trade but obtained a very much better price for his wares than if he had sold only for money and he soon consigned considerable quantities to the firm in calcutta and by so doing obtained a profit both ways he himself paid a visit to calcutta every six months or so to choose fresh fashions of goods and to visit the firm with whom his dealings every year became more extensive but though laying the foundations for an extensive business he was not as he told his sister at present in a position to help her for his increasing trade continually demanded more and more capital and the whole of his profits were swallowed up by the larger stocks that had to be held at his depots at sylhet chittagong and at the mouths of the larger rivers  twice since he had been out he had met his sister at calcutta and when she came down after her husbands death and heard from toms agents that he would probably arrive there in the course of a fortnight she decided to wait there and meet him he was greatly grieved at her loss and especially so as he was unable to offer her a home for as his whole time was spent in travelling it was impossible for him to do so nor indeed would she have accepted it now that her husband was gone she yearned to be back in england again it was too far better for the girls that she should take them home but when he now offered to take the boy she felt that hard as it would be to leave stanley behind the offer was a most advantageous one for him  the boys knowledge of indian languages which would be of immense advantage to him in such a life would be absolutely useless in england and from what tom told her of his business there could be little doubt that the prospects were excellent stanley himself who now saw his uncle for the first time was attracted to him by the energy and cheeriness of manner that had rendered him so successful in business and he was stirred by the enterprise and adventure of the life he proposed for him more than once in the littlefrequented rivers that stretched into kathee his boats had been attacked by wild tribesmen and he had to fight hard to keep them off petty chiefs had at times endeavoured to obstruct his trading and when at manipur he had twice been witness of desperate fights between rival claimants for the throne all this was to a boy brought up among soldiers irresistibly fascinating especially as the alternative seemed to be a seat in a dull counting house in england  he was then delighted when his mother gave her consent to his remaining with his uncle grieved as he was at being parted from her and his sisters the thought that he should in time be able to be of assistance to her was a pleasant one and aided him to support the pain of parting when a week later she sailed with the girls for england  i suppose you have not done any shooting stanley his uncle asked  not with a gun but i have practised sometimes with pistols father thought that it would be useful  very useful and you must learn to shoot well with them and with fowlingpiece and rifle what with river thieves and dacoits and wild tribesto say nothing of wild beastsa man who travels about as i do wants to be able to shoot straight the straighter you shoot the less likely you are to have to do so i have come to be a good shot myself and whenever we row up a river i constantly practiseeither at floating objects in the water or at birds or other marks in the trees i have the best weapons that money can buy it is my one extravagance and the result is that to my boatmen and the men about me my shooting seems to be marvellous they tell others of it and the result is that i am regarded with great respect i have no doubt whatever that it has saved me from much trouble for the natives have almost got to believe that i only have to point my gun and the man i wish to kill falls dead however far distant  two days after the departure of mrs brooke her brother and stanley started down the hoogly in a native trader  she is a curiouslooking craft uncle  yes she would not be called handsome in home waters but she is uncommonly fast and i find her much more convenient in many ways than a british merchantman  is she yours uncle  no she is not mine and i do not exactly charter her but she works principally for me you see the wages are so low that they can work a craft like this for next to nothing why the captain and his eight men together dont get higher pay than the boatswain of an english trader  the captain owns the vessel he is quite content if he gets a few rupees a month in addition to what he considers his own rate of pay his wife and his two children live on board if the craft can earn twenty rupees a week he considers that he is doing splendidly at the outside he would not pay his men more than four rupees a month each and i suppose that he would put down his services at eight so that would leave him forty rupees a month as the profit earned by the ship  in point of fact i keep him going pretty steadily he makes trips backwards and forwards between the different depots carries me up the rivers for a considerable distance does a little trade on his own accountnot in goods such as i sell you know but purely native storestakes a little freight when he can get it and generally a few native passengers i pay him fifteen rupees a week and i suppose he earns from five to ten in addition so that the arrangement suits us both admirably  i keep the stern cabin for myself as you see she has four little brass guns which i picked up for a song at calcutta and there are twentyfour muskets aft it is an arrangement that the crew are to practise shooting once a week so they have all come to be pretty fair shots and the captain himself can send a twopound shot from those little guns uncommonly straight  you will be amused when you see us practising for action the captains wife and the two boys load the guns and do it very quickly too he runs round from gun to gun takes aim and fires the crew shout and yell and bang away with their muskets i take the command and give a few pice among them if the firing has been accurate  we have been attacked once or twice in the upper waters but have always managed to beat the robbers off without much difficulty the captain fires away till they get pretty close and i pepper them with my riflesi have three of them when they get within fifty yards the crew open fire and as they have three muskets each they can make it very hot for the pirates i have a store of hand grenades and if they push on i throw two or three on board when they get within ten yards and that has always finished the matter they dont understand the things bursting in the middle of them i dont mean to say that my armament would be of much use if we were trading along the coast of the malay peninsula or among the islands but it is quite enough to deal with the petty robbers of these rivers  but i thought that you had a boat that you went up the rivers in uncle  yes we tow a rowboat and a store boat up behind this craft as far as she can go that is as long as she has wind enough to make against the sluggish stream when she can go no further i take to the rowboat it has eight rowers carries a gunit is a twelvepounder howitzerthat i have had cut short so that it is only about a foot long of course it wont carry far but that is not necessary its charge is a pound of powder and a tenpound bag of bullets and at a couple of hundred yards the balls scatter enough to sweep two or three canoes coming abreast and as we can charge and fire the little thing three times in a minute it is all that we require for practical purposes  it is only on a few of the rivers we go up that there is any fear of trouble on the river from sylhet to the east and its branches in kathee or as it is sometimes called kasi the country is comparatively settled the goomtee beyond oudypore is well enough until it gets into kaayn which is what they call independent that is to say it owns no authority and some villages are peaceable and well disposed while others are savage the same may be said of the munnoo and fenny rivers  for the last two years i have done a good deal of trade in assam up the brahmaputra river as far as rungpoor there are a great many villages on the banks and the people are quiet and peaceable  then you dont go further south than chittagong uncle  no the burmese hold aracan on the south and indeed for some distance north of it there is no very clearlydefined border you see the great river runs from rangoon very nearly due north though with a little east in it and extends along at the back of the districts i trade with so that the burmese are not very far from manipur which indeed stands on a branch of the irrawaddy of which another branch runs nearly up to rungpoor  we shall have big trouble with them one of these days indeed we have had troubles already you see the burmese are a great and increasing power and have so easily conquered all their neighbours that they regard themselves as invincible until the beginning of the eighteenth century the burmese were masters of pegu then the people of that country with the help of the dutch and portuguese threw off their yoke but the burmese were not long kept down for in 1753 alompraa huntergathered a force round him and after keeping up an irregular warfare for some time was joined by so many of his countrymen that he attacked and captured ava conquered the whole of pegu and in 1759 the english trading colony at negrais were massacred  this however was not the act of alompra but of the treachery of a frenchman named levine and of an armenian who incited the burmese of the district to exterminate the englishhoping no doubt thus to retrieve in a new quarter the fortunes of france which in india were being extinguished by the genius of clive the english were at the time far too occupied with the desperate struggle they were having in india to attempt to revenge the massacre of their countrymen at negrais  very rapidly the burman power spread they captured the valuable tenasserim coast from siam repulsed a formidable invasion from china annexed aracan and dominated manipur and thus became masters of the whole tract of country lying between china and hindustan as they now bordered upon our territory a mission was sent in 1794 to them from india with a proposal for the settlement of boundaries and for the arrangement of trade between the two countries nothing came of it for the burmese had already proposed to themselves the conquest of india and considered the mission as a proof of the terror that their advance had inspired among us  after the conquest by them of aracan in 1784 there had been a constant irritation felt against us by the burmese owing to the fact that a great number of fugitives from that country had taken refuge in the swamps and islands of chittagong from which they from time to time issued and made raids against the burmese in 1811 these fugitives in alliance with some predatory chiefs invaded aracan in force and being joined by the subject population there expelled the burmese these however soon reconquered the province the affair was nevertheless unfortunate since the burmese naturally considered that as the insurrection had begun with an invasion by the fugitives in chittagong it had been fomented by us  this was in no way the fact we had no force there capable of keeping the masses of fugitives in order but we did our best and arrested many of the leaders when they returned after their defeat this however was far from satisfying the burmese a mission was sent to ava to assure them of our friendly intentions and that we had had nothing whatever to do with the invasion and would do all we could to prevent its recurrence the burmese government declined to receive the mission  we ourselves had much trouble with the insurgents for fearful of reentering burma after their defeat they now carried on a series of raids in our territory and it was not until 1816 that these were finally suppressed nevertheless the court of ava remained dissatisfied and a fresh demand was raised for the surrender of the chiefs who had been captured and of the whole of the fugitives living in the government of chittagong the marquis of hastings replied that the british government could not without a violation of the principles of justice deliver up those who had sought its protection that tranquillity now existed and there was no probability of a renewal of the disturbances but that the greatest vigilance should be used to prevent and punish the authors of any raid that might be attempted against aracan  a year later a second letter was received demanding on the part of the king the cession of ramoo chittagong moorshedabad and dacca that is to say of the whole british possessions east of the ganges lord hastings simply replied that if it was possible to suppose that the demand had been dictated by the king of ava the british government would be justified in regarding it as a declaration of war to this the burmese made no reply doubtless they had heard of the successes we had gained in central india and had learned that our whole force was disposable against them  three years ago the old king died and a more warlike monarch succeeded him since 1810 they have been mixed up in the troubles that have been going on in assam where a civil war had been raging one party or other has sought their assistance and fighting has been going on there nearly incessantly and two months ago the burmese settled the question by themselves taking possession of the whole country  this has of course been a serious blow to me although disorder has reigned it has not interfered with my trading along the banks of the river but now that the burmese have set up their authority i shall for a time anyhow be obliged to give up my operations there for they have evinced considerable hostility to ushave made raids near rungpoor on our side of the river and have pulled down a british flag on an island in the brahmaputra we have taken in consequence the principality of cachar under our protectionindeed its two princes seeing that the burmese were beginning to invade their country invited us to take this stepand we thus occupy the passes from manipur into the low country of sylhet  i wonder that you have been able to trade in manipur uncle as the burmese have been masters there  i am not trading with the capital itself and the burmese have been too occupied with their affairs in assam to exercise much authority in the country besides you see there has not been war between the two countries our merchants at rangoon still carry on their trade up the irrawaddy and in assam this spring the only trouble i had was that i had to pay somewhat higher tolls than i had done before however now that cachar is under our protection i hope that i shall make up for my loss of trade in assam by doing better than before in that province  i thought you called it kathee uncle  so it is generally named but as it is spoken of as cachar in the proclamation assuming the protectorate i suppose it will be called so in future but all these names out here are spelt pretty much according to fancy  while this conversation had been going on the boat had been running fast down the river passing several european vessels almost as if they had been standing still  i should not have thought that a boat like this would pass these large ships stanley said  we have a good deal to learn in the art of sailing yet his uncle replied a great many of these indian dhows can run away from a squarerigged ship in light weather i dont know whether it is the lines of their hulls or the cut of the sails but there is no doubt about their speed they seem to skim over the water while our bluffbowed craft shove their way through it i suppose some day we shall adopt these long sharp bows when we do it will make a wonderful difference in our rate of sailing then too these craft have a very light draft of water but on the other hand they have a deep keel which helps them to lie close to the wind and that long overhanging bow renders them capital craft in heavy weather for as they meet the sea they rise over it gradually instead of its hitting them full on the bow as it does our ships we have much to learn yet in the way of ship building  the trader had his own servant with him and the man now came up and said that a meal was ready and they at once entered the cabin it was roomy and comfortable and was like the rest of the boat of varnished teak there were large windows in the stern it had a table with two fixed benches and there were broad low sofas on each side above these the muskets were disposed in racks while at the end by the door were tom pearsons own rifles four brace of pistols and a couple of swords ten long spears were suspended from the roof of the cabin in leather slings the floor like the rest of the cabin was varnished  it looks very comfortable uncle  yes you see i live quite half my time on board the rest being spent in the boat my man is a capital cook he comes from chittagong and is a mug  what are mugs uncle  they are the original inhabitants of aracan he was one of those who remained there after the burmese had conquered it and speaks their language as well as his own i recommend you to begin it with him at once if things settle down in assam it will be very useful for you in arranging with the burmese officials you wont find it very easy though of course your knowledge of three or four indian tongues will help you it is said to be a mixture of the old tali sanscrit tartar and chinese the tartar and chinese words will of course be quite new to you the other two elements will resemble those that you are familiar with  i talk to the man in hindustani he picked up a little of it at chittagong and has learned a good deal more during the two years that he has been with me and through that you will be able to learn burmese  a week later the dhow entered the harbour stanley had passed most of his time in conversation with khyen toms servant the facility his tongue had acquired in the indian languages was of great benefit to him and he speedily picked up a good many burmese sentences  for the next six months he continued with his uncle the work the latter had carried on and enjoyed it much they sailed up the sluggish rivers with their low flat shores in the dhow towing the rowboat and the store boat behind them the crews of these boats lived on board the dhow until their services were required helping in its navigation and aiding the crew when the wind dropped and sweeps were got out  the villages along the banks were for the most part small but were very numerous at each of these the dhow brought up there was in almost all cases sufficient water to allow of her being moored alongside the banks and as soon as she did so the natives came on board to make their purchases and dispose of their produce in addition to the european and indian goods carried the dhow was laden with rice for which there was a considerable demand at most of the villages  as soon as he had learned the price of the various goods and their equivalent in the products of the country stanley did much of the bartering while his uncle went ashore and talked with the head men of the village with all of whom he made a point of keeping on good terms and so securing a great portion of the trade that might otherwise have been carried by native craft  three times during the six months the dhow had gone back to calcutta to fetch fresh supplies of goods and to take in another cargo of rice while the trader proceeded higher up the river in his own boats while on the voyage stanley always had the rifle and fowling piece that his uncle had handed over for his special use leaning against the bulwark close at hand and frequently shot waterfowl which were so abundant that he was able to keep not only their own table supplied but to furnish the crew and boatmen with a considerable quantity of food they had had no trouble with river pirates for these had suffered so heavily in previous attacks upon the dhow that they shunned any repetition of their loss at the same time every precaution was taken for owing to the intestine troubles in cachar and assam fugitives belonging to the party that happened for the time to be worsted were driven to take refuge in the jungles near the rivers and to subsist largely on plunder the local authorities being too feeble to root them out the boats therefore were always anchored in the middle of the stream at night and two men were kept on watch  to the south as well as in the north the trading operations were more restricted for the burmese became more and more aggressive elephant hunters in the hills that formed the boundary of the british territory to the east were seized and carried off twentythree in one place being captured and six in anotherall being ill treated and imprisoned and the remonstrances of the indian government treated with contempt by the rajah of aracan it was evident that the object of the burmese was to possess themselves of this hill country in order that they might if they chose pour down at any time into the cultivated country round the town of ramoo  there is no doubt stanley said his uncle one day we shall very shortly have a big war with the burmese the fact that these constant acts of aggression are met only by remonstrances on our part increases their arrogance and they are convinced that we are in mortal terror of them they say that in assam their leaders are openly boasting that ere long they will drive us completely from india and one of their generals has confidently declared that after taking india they intend to conquer england with such ignorant people there is but one argument understoodnamely force and sooner or later we shall have to give them such a hearty thrashing that they will be quiet for some time  still i grant that the difficulties are great their country is a tremendous size the beggars are brave and the climate at any rate near the sea coast is horribly unhealthy altogether it will be a big job but it will have to be done or in a very short time we shall see them marching against calcutta    chapter 2 the outbreak of war   on the last day of september 1823just a year after stanley had joined his unclethe dhow sailed into chittagong which had now taken the place of sylhet as the traders chief depot the latter place being too near the burmese in assam for him to care about keeping a large stock of his goods there he went ashore as soon as the dhow cast anchor stanley remaining on board  the fat is all in the fire stanley tom pearson said when he returned the burmese have attacked and killed some of our troops and it is certain that the government cannot put up with that  where was it uncle  down at the mouth of the naaf as you know that is the southern boundary of the province and there was a row there in january one of our native boats laden with rice was coming up the river on our side of the channel when an armed burmese boat came across and demanded duty of course our fellows said they were in their own waters whereupon the burmese fired upon them and killed the steersman there were reports then that bodies of burmese troops were moving about on their side of the river and that it was feared they would cross over and burn some of our villages accordingly our guard at the mouth of the river was increased to fifty men and a few of these were posted on the island of shapuree  this island lies close to our shore and indeed the channel between can be forded at low water it has always formed part of the province of chittagong and there has never been any question raised by the burmese as to this however the viceroy of aracan called upon our resident here to withdraw the guard asserting the right of the king of ava to the island  since then letters have passed to and fro but i hear that the burmese have settled the question by landing on shapuree one night last week they attacked our post there killed and wounded four of the sepoys and drove the rest off the island the indian government have put up with a great deal rather than engage in so costly and difficult an operation as a war with burma but it is impossible that we can stand this  the indian government however used every endeavour to avert the necessity for war although the rajah of aracan lost no time in writing a letter to the government of calcutta stating that he had occupied the island of shapuree and that unless they submitted quietly to this act of justice the cities of dacca and moorshedabad would be forcibly seized in order however to postpone at any rate the outbreak of war the government of bengal resolved to give the court of ava an opportunity to withdraw from the position taken up they therefore acted as if the attack on the guard at shapuree had been the action of the viceroy of aracan alone and addressed a declaration to the burmese government recapitulating the facts of the case pointing out that shapuree had always been acknowledged by burma as forming part of the province of chittagong and calling upon the government to disavow the action of the local authorities the burmese considered this as it was in fact a proof that the government of india was reluctant to enter upon a contest with them and confirmed burma in its confident expectation of annexing the eastern portions of bengal if not of expelling the english altogether  in the meantime shapuree had been reoccupied by us the burmeseafter driving out the little garrisonhad retired and two months after the attack two companies of the 20th native infantry arrived by sea from calcutta and landed there a stockade was built and two sixpounders placed in position another company was stationed on the mainland and the planet and three gunboats each carrying a twelvepounder were stationed in the river  the burmese at once collected large bodies of troops both in aracan and assam the government of bengal made preparations to defend our frontier and especially the position in the north as an advance of the burmese in this direction would not only threaten the important towns of dacca and moorshedabad but would place the invaders in dangerous proximity to calcutta accordingly a portion of the 10th and 23rd native infantry and four companies of the rungpoor local force were marched to sylhet and outposts thrown forward to the frontier  seeing that the burmese operations would probably commence in the north tom pearson had after completing his arrangements at chittagong sailed north to remove his depots from sylhet and other places that would be exposed to an attack from that direction they reached sylhet the first week in january by this time stanley from his constant conversation with his uncles servant had come to speak burmese as fluently as the indian languages he was now nearly sixteen tall for his age and active but owing to the hot climate and the absence of vigorous exercise he was less broad and muscular than most english lads of his age  they found on landing that news had arrived two days before that a powerful army of burmese had entered cachar from manipur and had defeated the troops of jambhir sing that 4000 burmese and assamese had advanced from assam into cachar and had begun to stockade themselves at bickrampore at the foot of the bhortoka pass and that the third division was crossing into the district of jyntea immediately to the north of sylhet there was a complete panic in the town and the ryots were flocking in from all the surrounding country with their families and belongings and were making their way down the country in boats to dacca  i am afraid stanley there is an end of trade for the present what we see here is doubtless taking place all over cachar and it would be just as bad down at chittagong it is a heavy blow for i have done remarkably well this year and was building up the foundations for a good business no doubt when this trouble is over i shall be able to take it up again and it may be if we thrash the burmese heartily which we are sure to do in the long run it may even prove a benefit still there is no doubt that it is a very bad business for me however as just at present there is nothing whatever to be done i propose as soon as the goods are all on board to take a holiday and go out and have a look at the fighting  you will take me with you uncle stanley asked eagerly  certainly lad we dont mean to do any fighting ourselves but only to look on and it may be that after it is over you may be able to make yourself useful if they want to ask questions of any burmese prisoners  you think that there is no chance of their beating us  i should think not though of course there is no saying still i dont think these fellows will be able to stand against our troops of course they have no idea whatever of our style of fighting and have never met any really formidable foes so that i imagine we shall make pretty short work of them however as we shall be mountedfor i will hire a couple of horses there have been plenty of them driven into the townwe shall be able to make a bolt of it if necessary of course we will take our rifles and pistols with us  the goods were not placed on board the dhow but in what was called the store boat as the trader had determined to take up his abode in his rowboat which could move about much faster than the dhow and to allow the captain of that craft to make a good thing of it by taking down to dacca as many of the fugitives as she would hold  finding that the burmese division that had entered jyntea was intrenching itself at a few miles distance major newton the officer commanding on the sylhet frontier concentrated his force at jatrapur a village five miles beyond the sylhet boundary tom pearson had introduced himself to major newton and asked permission to accompany his force saying that his nephew would be able if necessary to communicate with the burmese either before or after the action and that both would willingly act as aidesdecamp the offer was accepted with thanks and they rode out with him on the evening of the 16th of january 1824 to jatrapur  at one oclock in the morning the troops were roused and marched an hour later at daybreak they came in sight of the stockade and a few shots were at once fired upon the advanced guard by the burmese a portion of their force was lying in a village hard by  major newton at once divided his command into two bodies one of these was led by captain johnston against the front of the stockade the other under captain rowe attacked the village adjoining the burmese stationed there gave way after a very faint resistance they were accustomed to rely always on stockades and this attack upon them when not so protected shook them at once those in the stockade however made a resolute resistance  captain rowe after gaining possession of the village and seeing the occupants in full flight moved his force to aid the other division and the burmese dispirited by the defeat of their countrymen and finding themselves attacked on two sides gave way and fled leaving a hundred dead behind them while on the british side but six sepoys were killed  the burmese fled to the hills at a speed that rendered pursuit hopeless by the more heavilyarmed troops and the fugitives soon rallied and effected their junction with the division advancing from manipur after the action major newton returned to sylhet and a few days later mr scott who had been appointed commissioner arrived there and advancing to bhadrapur opened communications with the burmese as however it became evident that the latter were only negotiating in order to gain time to intrench themselves near jatrapur to which they had returned he again placed the matter in the hands of the military commanders  the burmese force amounted to about six thousand men they had erected strong stockades on each bank of the river surma and had thrown a bridge across to connect them captain johnston advanced with a wing of the 10th native infantry a company of the 23rd native infantry and a small party of men of a local corps small as was this force he divided it into two parties one of these under captain rowe crossed the river and then both moved against the enemy the burmese opened fire as they advanced but the sepoys marched gallantly forward and drove the enemy out of their unfinished intrenchments at the point of the bayonet the assam division retreated hastily to the bhortoka pass while the manipur force stockaded itself at doodpatnee  the assam division was first attacked and the stockade carried at the point of the bayonet lieutenant colonel bowen who now commanded then moved against the position at doodpatnee this was very strong steep hills covered the rear while the other faces of the intrenchments were defended by a deep ditch fourteen feet wide with a chevaux de frise of pointed bamboos on its outer edge although the position was attacked with great gallantry it was too strong to be captured by so small a force and they were obliged to withdraw to jatrapur with the loss of one officer killed and four wounded and about one hundred and fifty sepoys killed and wounded  however their bravery had not been without effect for the burmese evacuated their stockade and retreated to manipur leaving cachar free from its invaders thus in less than three weeks the burmese invasion of the northern provinces had been hurled back by a british force of less than a tenth of that of the invaders  stanley and his uncle had been present at all these engagements and in the absence of any cavalry had done good service in conveying messages and despatches and the lad had several times acted as interpreter between the officers and burmese prisoners both received letters from the commissioner thanking them for the assistance that they had rendered  that last affair was unfortunate stanley and it is evident that these stockades of theirs are nasty places to attack and that they ought to be breached by guns before the men are sent forward to storm them however as the burmese have gone our repulse does not matter much  well i felt sure that we should thrash them but i certainly gave them credit for having a great deal more pluck than they have shown as it is if there is nothing fresh takes place here the natives and little traders will soon be coming back from dacca and business will be better than before for the burmese have been talking so big for the last three years that no one has bought more than would just carry him on while now they will be more inclined to lay in good stocks of goods  tomorrow we will start for chittagong you see i have a considerable store there and there is a chance of much more serious fighting in that quarter than this little affair we have seen the governor of aracan has all along been the source of troubles and we may expect that he will cross into the province at the head of a large force and may do an immense deal of damage before we can get enough troops there to oppose him  descending the river they coasted along until they arrived early in march at chittagong they found that great alarm reigned there in january bandoola the greatest military leader of the burmese who was known to have been one of the most strenuous supporters of the war policy at the court of ava had arrived at aracan and taken the command of the troops collected there and had brought with him considerable reinforcements  a wanton outrage that had been committed by the burmese showed how intent they were upon hostilities owing to the unhealthiness of the islet of shapuree the sepoys stationed there had been withdrawn and the companys pilot vessel sophia was ordered to join the gunboats off that island four deputies from the burmese court arrived at mungdoo on the opposite shore and these invited the commander of the sophia to come on shore in order that they might talk over with him in a friendly way the situation of affairs he unsuspectingly accepted their invitation and landed accompanied by an officer and some native seamen the party were at once seized and sent prisoners to aracan where they were detained for a month and then sent back to mungdoo  this wanton insult was followed by a formal declaration of war by the government of india and a similar document was issued by the court of ava the force at sylhet was reinforced and that in chittagong increased it consisted of a wing of the 13th and of the 20th native regiments and a battalion of the 23rd with a local levy amounting in all to some 3000 men of these a wing of the 23rd with two guns and a portion of the native levies were posted at ramoo which was the point most threatened by an invasion from aracan  it was in the north that hostilities first commenced a force moving into assam and driving the burmese before them several sharp blows were dealt the enemy and had it not been for the setting in of the wet season they would have been driven entirely out of assam  i think stanley his uncle said after he had been a short time at chittagong you had better go up to ramoo and see about matters there of course until the burmese move we cannot say what their game is likely to be but it will be as well to get the stores ready for embarkation in case they should advance in that direction if they do so get everything on board at once and you can then be guided by circumstances as the dhow came in yesterday i can spare both our boats and shall of course ship the goods here on board the big craft even if the burmese come this way i have no fear of their taking the town and shall of course lend a hand in the defence if they attempt it you can do the same at ramoo if you like  i was chatting with colonel shatland yesterday he tells me that a large fleet has been collected and that an expedition will be sent to capture rangoon so in that case it is likely that bandoola and his force will march off in that direction  i think government are wrong it will be impossible for the troops to move when the wet season once sets in and they will lose a tremendous lot of men from sickness if they are cooped up in rangoon they had very much better have sent a few thousand men down here to act on the defensive and repel any attempted invasion until the rains are over when they could have been shipped again and join the expedition against rangoon it seems to me a madheaded thing to begin at the present time of the year we have put up with the insults of the burmese for so long that we might just as well have waited for the favourable season before we began our operations in earnest  accordingly on the following day stanley started south for ramoo and on arriving there took charge of the trading operations shortly after meeting captain notonwho commanded therein the street he recognized him as an officer who had been stationed at the same cantonment as his father and whom he had four years previously known well  you dont recognize me captain noton he said i am the son of captain brooke of the 33rd  i certainly did not recognize you the officer said but i am glad to meet you again let me think yes your name is stanley and a regular young pickle you used to be what on earth are you doing here of course i heard of your poor fathers death and was grieved indeed at his loss where is your mother she is well i hope  she went back to england with my sisters two months after my fathers death i joined my uncle her brother he is a trader and carries on business in the district between here and sylhet trading principally on the rivers but of course the war has put a stop to that for the present we saw the fighting up in the north and then came down to this district he has remained at chittagong and i am in charge of goods here i speak burmese fairly now and if i can be of any use to you i shall be very glad to be so there is not much business here and the parsee clerk who is generally in charge can look after it very well i acted as interpreter with the troops in the north and have a letter from mr scott the commissioner thanking me for my services  i remember you used to be able to talk four or five of the native languages but how did you come to pick up burmese  from a servant of my uncles we thought that there would be sure to be war sooner or later and that after it was over there would be a good chance of profitable trade on the burmese rivers i had no great difficulty in learning it from my uncles man who was a native of aracan  i have no doubt you will find it very useful what a big fellow you have grown stanley at least as far as height is concerned let me see how old are you now  i am past sixteen stanley replied i have had several touches of fevercaught i suppose from the damp on the riversbut i think that i am pretty well acclimatized now i know i dont look very strong but i have not had much active exercise and of course the climate is against me  very much so i wonder that you have kept your health as well as you have in this steamy climate  i am going to the mess room now you had better come and lunch with me and i will introduce you to the other officers we are very strong in comparison to the force for counting the assistant surgeon there are ten of us  i shall be very glad sir stanley said i have certainly been feeling rather lonely here for i know no one and there is very little to do during the last year i have often gone up one of the rivers by myself but there has always been occupation while at present things are at a standstill  i tell you what brooke if you would like it i can appoint you interpreter there is not one of us who speaks this mug languagewhich is you know almost the same as burmeseand the officers in charge of the native levy would be delighted to have some one with them who could make the fellows understand i can appoint you a firstclass interpreter the pay is not very high you know but you might just as well be earning it as doing nothing and it would give you a sort of official position and as the son of a british officer and my friend you would be one of us  thank you very much captain noton i should like it immensely should i have to get a uniform  there will be no absolute necessity for it but if you get a white patrol jacket like this and a white cap cover it will establish you in the eyes of the natives as an officer and give you more authority oh by the way you need not get them for one of our lieutenants died the other day of fever his effects have not been sold yet but you may as well have his patrol jackets and belts we can settle what you are to pay for them afterwards it will only be a matter of a few rupees anyhow  they now arrived at the house that had been taken for the use of the officers on entering captain noton introduced him to the others and as several of these had at various times met his father in cantonments or on service he was heartily welcomed by them and at luncheon they listened with great interest to his accounts of the fighting in cachar with the burmese  i fancy we shall find them more formidable here if they come captain noton said bandoola has a great reputation and is immensely popular with them from what you say a considerable proportion of the fellows you met up there were assamese levies raised by the burmese i grant that the burmese themselves do not seem to have done much better but they would never have conquered all the peoples they have come across and built up a great empire if there had not been good fighting stuff in them i have no doubt that we shall thrash them but i dont think we shall do it as easily as our troops did in the north  the time now passed pleasantly with stanley he had after thinking it over declined to accept payment for his services for this would have hindered his freedom of action and prevented his obeying any instructions that his uncle might send him he therefore joined as a volunteer interpreter and was made a member of the officers mess he was specially attached to the native levy and soon acquiring their words of command assisted its officers in drilling it into something like order  early in may a burmese division 8000 strong crossed the naaf and established itself at rutnapullung fourteen miles south of ramoo as soon as captain noton learned that the burmese had crossed the river he sent news of the fact to chittagong with a request that reinforcements should be at once sent to him and then moved out with his force from ramoo to ascertain the strength of the enemy the burmese were seen upon some hills where they were constructing stockades the small british force advanced against them drove them off the hills and following them prepared to attack them in the plain beyond the guns however had not come up partly owing to the cowardice of the elephant drivers and partly to the fact that it was found that several of the essential parts of the guns had been left behind  without their assistance to clear the way captain noton felt that it would be imprudent to attack so great a force and therefore fell back to ramoo here he was joined by three companies of the 20th native infantry bringing up his force to close upon a thousand of whom about half were sepoys and the rest native levies had any energy whatever been shown by the officer in command of chittagong in sending up reinforcementswhich he could well have spared now that the point of attack by the burmese had been made clearcaptain noton might have taken the offensive in which case serious disaster would have been avoided and the burmese would have been driven back across the naaf none however came and on the morning of the 13th of may the enemy appeared on the hill east of ramoo being separated from the british force by the river of the same name  there was some difference of opinion among the officers as to whether it would be better to maintain a position outside the town or to retreat at once but the belief that reinforcements might arrive at any hour caused captain noton to determine to keep in the open and so to cover the town as long as possible  on the evening of the 14th the burmese came down to the river as if to cross it but retired when the two sixpounder guns opened fire upon them that two small guns should produce such an effect confirmed the british officers in their opinion that the burmese although they might defend stockades well were of little use in the open the next morning however the enemy effected the passage of the river farther away and then advancing took possession of a large tank surrounded by a high embankment  captain noton placed his force in an enclosure with a bank three feet high his right flank was protected by the river and a small tank some sixty paces in front was occupied by a strong picket on his left somewhat to the rear was another tank and at this the native levies were placed the main position was held by the sepoys with the two sixpounders as the burmese advanced a sharp fire was opened upon them but they availed themselves of every irregularity of the ground and of cover of all kinds and threw up shelter banks with such rapidity that the fire was by no means so effective as had been expected  during the day news came that the left wing of the 23rd native infantry had left chittagong on the 13th and as it should arrive the next day captain noton determined to hold his ground though the burmese continued to press forward and a good many men as well as two or three officers had been wounded by their fire at nightfall a consultation was held the reinforcements were expected in the morning and although the native levies had shown signs of insubordination and evidently could not be relied upon to make a stand if the burmese attacked in earnest it was resolved to retain the position  during the night the burmese pushed forward their trenches a heavy fire was maintained on both sides during the day but it was with considerable difficulty that the officers in command of the levies kept the men from bolting  things look very black captain pringle said to stanley when the firing died away at nightfall reinforcements should have been here today it is scandalous that they should not have been pushed forward at once when we asked for them still more so that when they once started they should not have come on with the greatest possible speed i doubt whether we shall be able to hold these cowardly curs together till tomorrow if they bolt the sepoys will be sure to do so too in fact their position would be altogether untenable for the burmese could march round this flank and take them in rear  i wish to heaven we had two or three companies of white troops to cover a retreat there would be no fear of the sepoys yielding to a panic if they had british troops with them but when they are outnumbered as they are now one can hardly blame them if they lose heart when the enemy are ten times their strength and will be twenty to one against them if our fellows here bolt  the next morning the burmese had pushed up their trenches to within twelve paces of the british lines and a tremendous fire was opened at nine o clock in spite of the efforts of their officers to keep them steady the native levies bolted and the officers with them dashed across the intervening ground towards the main body one of them fell dead and two others were wounded stanley was running when he fell headlong without a moments thought or consciousness  the burmese occupied the tank as soon as the levies had abandoned it and their fire at once took the defenders of the main position in flank a retreat was now necessary and the sepoys drew off in good order but as the exulting burmans pressed hotly upon them and their cavalry cut off and killed every man who fell wounded from their ranks they became seized with a panic in vain their officers exhorted them to keep steady reaching a rivulet the men threw down their rifles and accoutrements as they crossed it and took to headlong flight  the little group of officers gathered together and fought to the end captains noton truman and pringle lieutenant grigg ensign bennet and maismore the doctor were killed three officers only made their escape of these two were wounded  the fugitives both natives and sepoys continued their flight and when two or three days later they straggled into chittagong it was found that the total loss in killed and missing amounted to about two hundred and fifty those taken prisoners numbered only about twenty all these were more or less severely wounded for no quarter had been given they had in the pursuit been passed over as dead and when after this was over they were found to be alive they were spared from no feeling of humanity but that they might be sent to ava as proofs of the victory obtained over the british the number actually found alive was greater but only those were spared that were capable of travelling  among these was stanley brooke he had remained insensible until the pursuit had been discontinued a violent kick roused him to consciousness and sitting up he found that half a dozen burmese were standing round him his first action on recovering his senses was to discover where he was wounded seeing no signs of blood on his white clothes he took off his cap and passed his hand over his head and found that the blood was flowing from a wound just on the top where a bullet had cut away the hair and scalp and made a wound nearly three inches long at the bottom of which he could feel the bone  looking up at the burmese he said in their own language  that was a pretty close shave wasnt it  two or three of them laughed and all looked amused two of them then helped him to his feet and the group among whom there were some officers then took him some distance to the rear where he was ordered to sit down with three wounded sepoys who had been brought in    chapter 3 a prisoner   the little group of prisoners received several additions until the number mounted up to twenty the spot where they were placed was close to the bank of the river and as all were suffering severely from thirst stanley asked and obtained permission from the guard to fetch some water he first knelt down and took a long drink then he bathed his head and soaking his handkerchief with water made it into a pad placed it on the wound and put his cap on over it then he filled a flask that he carried and joined his companions these were permitted to go down one by one to the river to drink and bathe their wounds  stanley had already learned from them all they knew of what had happened after he had been stunned by the bullet two of them had crossed the rivulet before being wounded and these said that they believed all the white officers had been killed but that they thought most of the troops had got away  it is more than they deserved stanley said indignantly i dont say much about the mugs they had very little drill or discipline and naturally were afraid of the burmese who had long been their masters but if the sepoys had kept together under their officers they might all have escaped for the burmese would never have been able to break their ranks  some of the officers had been killed and most of them wounded before the retreat began sahib one of the sepoys said apologetically and they were ten to one against us  yes i know that but you who had fought before should have known well enough that as long as you kept together you could have beaten them off and they would have been glad enough to have given up the pursuit at last no doubt they all wanted to have a share in the plunder of ramoo  what do you think that they are going to do with us sahib  from what they said as they brought me here i think that we shall be sent to ava or amarapura they lie close together and the court is sometimes at one place and sometimes at the other what they will do with us when we get there i dont know they may cut off our heads they may put us in prison anyhow you may be sure that we shall not have a pleasant time of it  all we have to hope for is that the capture of rangoon by our fleet may lower their pride and bring them to treat for terms it sailed nearly six weeks ago from calcutta and was to have been joined by one from madras and allowing for delays it ought to have been at rangoon a fortnight since and would certainly capture the place without any difficulty so possibly by the time we reach ava we shall find that peace has been made  still the burmese may not consider the loss of rangoon to be important and may even try to recapture itwhich you may be sure they wont do for i heard at chittagong that there were some twenty thousand troops coming which would be quite enough if there were but good roads and plenty of transport for them to march through burma from end to end  in the evening food was brought to the prisoners and talking with some of the burmese who came up to look at them stanley learned that bandoola himself had not accompanied the force across the naaf and that it was commanded by the rajahs who ruled the four provinces of aracan upon the following morning the prisoners were marched away under a strong guard six days later they reached the camp of bandoola they were drawn up at a distance from the great mans tent he came down accompanied by a party of officers to look at them he beckoned to stanley  stanley is brought before bandoola the burmese general  ask him if he is an officer he said to an interpreter standing by his side  the man put the question in hindustani stanley replied in burmese  i am an officer your lordship but a temporary one only i served in the mug levy and was appointed for my knowledge of their tongue  how is it that you come to speak our language bandoola asked in surprise  i am a trader your lordship but when our trade was put an end to by the outbreak of the war i entered the army to serve until peace was made i learned the language from a servant in the service of my uncle whose assistant i was  the burmese general was capable of acts of great cruelty when he considered it necessary but at other times was kindly and good natured  he is but a lad he said to one of his officers and he seems a bold young fellow he would be useful as an interpreter to me for we shall want to question his countrymen when we make them all prisoners however we must send him with the others to ava as he is the only officer that we have taken but i will send a message to some of my friends at the court asking them to represent that i consider he will be useful to me and praying that he may be kept for a time and treated well and may be forwarded to me again when i make my next move against the english  the following day the prisoners started under the escort of twenty soldiers commanded by an officer of some rank who was specially charged to take them safely to ava it was a fortnights march to the irrawaddy until they neared the river the country was very thinly populated but when they approached its banks the villages were comparatively thick standing for the most part in clearings in a great forest on the march the burmese officer frequently talked with stanley asked many questions about england and india and was evidently surprised and somewhat sceptical as to the account the lad gave him of the fighting strength of the country he treated him with considerable indulgence and sent him dishes from his own table  when not talking with him stanley marched at the head of the little party of prisonersall of whom were sepoys no quarter having been given to the native levies of an evening stanley endeavoured to keep up the sepoys spirits by telling them that probably by this time the british expedition had arrived at rangoon and captured it and that peace would most likely follow and they might be exchanged for any burmese who fell into the hands of the english  when they reached a village on the banks of the river the population on seeing them came round and would have maltreated them had not the officer interfered and said he had bandoolas orders to carry them safely to the court and that anyone interfering with them would be severely punished the head man of the village bent low on hearing the generals name  i ask your pardon my lord the prisoners shall not be touched but have you heard the news  i have heard no news the officer said  it arrived here yesterday my lord the barbarians have had the audacity to sail up with a great fleet of ships to rangoon they had vessels of war with them and though our forts fired upon them they had so many cannon that we could not resist them and they have captured the town this happened a fortnight since  the officer stood thunderstruck at what appeared to him to be an act of audacious insolence however after a moments pause he said wrathfully  it is of little matter the town was weak and in no position for defence but a force will soon go down to sweep these barbarians away now get ready your war galley as soon as possible  each village on the river was compelled by law to furnish a war galley for the kings service whenever it might be required these carried from fifty to a hundred men and some three hundred of these boats were always available for service and constituted one of the strongest divisions of the fighting force of the burman empire the village was a large one and in half an hour the crew of the galley were on board and rowing forty oars started up the river  what think you of this news the officer said beckoning to stanley to take his place in front of him these men must be mad to tempt the anger of the lord of the golden stool the mighty emperor had you heard aught of this  i heard but a vague rumour that a fleet had been collected but i heard nothing for certain as to its destination  it is madness the officer repeated we shall sweep them into the sea how many of them are there do you think  as to that i can say little my lord i only heard a report that some ships and troops were to sailsome from madras and some from calcuttabut of the number of the men and ships i know nothing for certain  they have taken evil council the officer said gravely i have heard that they gained some slight advantage in cachar but there they had but irregular troops to meet largely assamese who are but poor cowards this little success must have turned their heads they will now have our regular forces to deal with and these will number a hundred thousandor twice as many if necessary think you that the handful that would be transported in ships can stand against such a host  there may be more than you think my lord many of the ships will be very big much bigger than those that trade with rangoon and some of them will carry as many as five hundred men  even so the officer said scornfully if there were twentyfive such ships or even fifty the force would be as nothing to us they will have to take to their vessels as soon as our army approaches  it may be so sir but i think that they will scarce go without fighting i would represent to you that although much fewer in numbers than your army which attacked us at ramoo the troops made a stout fight of it and that they fought steadily until the mugs ran away after that from what i hear i admit that they fled shamefully but the troops that come to rangoon will be better than those were for there will be white regiments among them and though these may as you say be overpowered with numbers and destroyed i do not think that you will see them running away  and you think that they will really venture to withstand us  i think that they will endeavour to do so  why there will scarce be an occasion for fighting the officer said disdainfully they were mad to come they are madder still to come now the rainy season is just at hand in another week it will be upon us the rivers will spread the flat country will be a marsh even we who are accustomed to it suffer in places like rangoon fever and disease will sweep them away and when the dry season comes and our troops assemble to fight them there will be none left they will die off like flies we shall scarce capture enough to send as prisoners to the emperor  stanley felt that in this respect the burmans prophecies were but too likely to be fulfilled he knew how deadly were the swamp fevers to white men and that in spite of his comfortable home on board the dhow and boat he had himself suffered although during the wet season his uncle made a point of sailing along the coast and of ascending only rivers that flowed between high banks and through a country free from swamps he remembered that his uncle had spoken very strongly of the folly of the expedition being timed to arrive on the coast of burma at the beginning of the wet season and had said that they would suffer terribly from fever before they could advance up the country unless it was intended to confine the operations to the coast towns until the dry season set in  it would indeed have been impossible to have chosen a worse time for the expedition but doubtless the government of india thought chiefly of the necessity for forcing the burmese to stand on the defensive and of so preventing the invasion of india by a vast army unquestionably too they believed that the occupation of rangoon and the stoppage of all trade would show the court of ava that they had embarked in a struggle with no contemptible foe and would be glad to abate their pretensions and to agree to fair terms of peace  the bengal force that had been embarked consisted of two british regimentsthe 13th and 38tha battalion of native infantry and two batteries of european artillery amounting in all to 2175 men the madras forceof which one division was sent on at once the other was to follow shortlyconsisted of the 41st and 89th regiments the madras european regiment seven battalions of native infantry and four batteries of artillery amounting to 9300 men making a total of 11475 fighting men of whom nearly five thousand were europeans in addition to the transports the bengal force was accompanied by a flotilla of twenty gunbrigs and as many rowboats each armed with an eighteenpounder the larne and sophia sloop belonging to the royal navy several of the companys cruisers and the steamboat diana general sir a campbell was appointed to the chief command and colonel mbean with the rank of brigadier general commanded the madras force  the bengal squadron sailed from saugur in the middle of april and reached the rendezvous port cornwallis in the andaman islands at the end of the month the madras first division sailed at the same time and joined them a few days later and the whole force under the escort of h m frigate liffey and the slaney sloop of war left port cornwallis on the 5th of may and arrived on the 9th at the mouth of the irrawaddy  forces were detached for the capture of the islands of chuduba and negrais on the 10th the fleet entered the river and anchored within the bar and on the following morning proceeded with the flood tide up to rangoon the liffey and the larne leading the way a few shots were fired as they went up the river but the burmese were taken wholly by surprise the idea that the english would venture to invade them never having entered their minds  there was considerable disappointment on board the fleet when rangoon came into sight it was situated on the north bank of the main branch of the river thirty miles from the sea it extended about nine hundred yards along the bank and was six or seven hundred yards wide at its broadest part beyond the town were some suburbs outside the palisade that inclosed it the palisades were ten or twelve feet high strengthened by embankments of earth thrown up against them on the inner side one face of the defences ran along the river bank while the others were protected by a shallow creek communicating with the river the town itself consisted for the most part of miserable and dirty hovels and of a few official buildings of larger size  at twelve oclock the liffey anchored abreast of the principal battery close to the water gate the transports being ranged in a line in rear of her a proclamation had been sent on shore on the previous day giving assurances of protection to the people at large and to all who should offer no resistance  when the guns of the fleet were loaded a pause ensued the town was evidently incapable of offering resistance and it was hoped that it would capitulate the burmese were seen standing at their guns but they also remained inactive apparently paralysed at the appearance of this great fleet of vesselsof a size hitherto undreamt of by themand the threatening guns pointed towards them however they were at last goaded by the orders and threats of their officers to open fire upon the ships  the frigate at once replied with a broadside in a very few minutes every gun on shore was silenced and the burmese fled in confusion from their works as soon as they did so the signal for disembarkation was made the troops crowded into the boats which rowed for the shore and the soldiers entered the town without resistance and found it completely deserted  the whole of the population had been driven out by the governor on the previous day and according to burmese custom the men had all been formed into a levy while the women and children were held under guard as hostages for their husbands and fatherstheir lives being forfeited in case of desertion or cowardice by their male relations  the foreigners in the town had all been seized they were few in number consisting of some eight or ten british traders and american missionaries these after being fettered were taken to the custom house prison they were brought up and tried early on the morning of the attack and were accused of having arranged the assault on the town they naturally urged that if they had had the least knowledge that it was going to be made they would have left the place in time but the burmese at once condemned them to death and they were taken back to the prison to be executed  the sentence was not carried out the burmese had intended to execute them on the walls in sight of their countrymen and the authorities had all assembled at the prison for the purpose when fortunately a shot from the first broadside fired passed through the building causing an instant stampede the chiefs at once left the city and the prisoners heavily chained were marched some distance into the country a party of british troops were however pushed forward in advance of the town as soon as it was occupied and the guard in alarm for their own safety placed the prisoners in a house and made off and a patrol found them there on the following morning and brought them into the town  the great pagoda standing two miles and a half from the town was at once occupied as an advanced position by the british it stood upon a conical hill rising seventyfive feet above the plain the area on the top was somewhat over two acres and in the centre rose the pagoda three hundred and thirtyeight feet high  every boat on the river was found to have been removed in spite of proclamations promising good treatment none of the inhabitants returned to the town being prevented from doing so by the burmese authorities and troops no stores whatever had been found and till the end of the wet season the army had to depend entirely upon the fleet for provisions and remained cooped up in the wretched and unhealthy town suffering severely from fever and malaria  the boat in which stanley and the other prisoners were conveyed was changed at every village going up the river as the officer was carrying the despatches from bandoola to the court a flag was hoisted as the boat came in sight of a village this was the signal that another was required and within two or three minutes of their arrival the prisoners their guard and officer were on their way again  thus they proceeded night and day and in four days arrived at ava leaving the prisoners in charge of the guard the officer at once proceeded to the palace in an hour guns were fired drums beat and the bells of the pagodas rung to give notice to the population that a great victory had been won over the english and their army annihilated by bandoola and his valiant troops this obliterated the impression produced by the news that had arrived a few days previously of the landing at rangoon and there were great rejoicings among the population  an officer from the palace presently came down to the boat and the prisoners were marched through the streets to a jail amid the jeers of the mob stanley was surprised at the meanness of the town the great majority of the houses being built of bamboo and thatched with grass and having a very poor appearance the public buildings and the houses of the great officers were constructed of planks and tiled but were heavy and tasteless and it was only upon the innumerable pagodas in and around the town that any care seemed to have been bestowed  he had wondered much at the numerous pagodas that they had seen near every town and village as they passed up but the officer had informed him that these were all private property and that it was considered the most meritorious of actions to erect one consequently every man who had means to do so built a pagoda large or small in proportion to the sum that he could bestow upon it on stanleys remarking upon the great number that were in ruins the officer replied that it was considered so much more meritorious an action to build a pagoda than to repair one that after the death of the founder they were generally suffered to fall into decay  for some days the prisoners were taken out every day and marched about the town for some time so as to afford the population ocular proof of the victory gained by bandoola the place in which they were confined was small and filthy but at the end of a week stanley was taken out and placed in a room by himself and here the officer who had had charge of him paid him a visit an hour or two later  i have expressed to the court he said the wishes of the general and have had permission accorded for you to receive different treatment from the others partly because you are an officer but principally because the general thinks that you may be made useful to him i have informed the officer of the prison that you are to be at liberty to walk about in the city when you please but that to protect you from violence an officer and two soldiers are to accompany you so long as you may think such a precaution necessary i have ordered a dress of our fashion to be brought to you as otherwise you could not go into the streets without being mobbed  stanley expressed his gratitude to the officer for obtaining these indulgences and the latter replied  i acted upon the orders of the general but it has been a pleasure to me for i see that you are a young man of merit and i have learned much from you about your people during the journey and have seen that foolish as they have been to undertake to match themselves against us there are yet some things that might be learned from them and that if they had remained in their island many months journey away from here they might have been worthy of our friendship  a short time after the officer had left a soldier brought up some food of a very much better nature than that with which stanley had been hitherto supplied half an hour later the dress arrived it was that of a burmese officer of inferior grade and consisted of a tunic of thick cloth coming down to the knees leathern sword belt a sort of tippet resembling that of an english coachman with three layers of cloth thickly quilted and a leathern helmet going up to a point in the centre with a flap to protect the neck and ears with it were worn tightfitting stockings of cloth and low shoes  presently an officer came in  i am ordered to go out with you once a day at whatever hour you may desire i am a relative of the officer who brought you here and he has requested me to look after your safety  i am much obliged to you sir stanley said and shall be glad indeed to go out to see the city your kinsman has kindly sent me a dress but if i am not to be noticed it will be necessary for me to stain my face and hands somewhat  that i have thought of the officer said and have brought with me some dye which will darken your skin it would be worse than useless for you to dress as a burman unless you did so for it would seem even more singular to the people in the streets that a white man should be seen walking about dressed as an officer than that a white prisoner should be taken through the streets under a guard  i am ready to go out with you now if you wish it  i shall be ready in a few minutes stanley replied and on being left alone at once changed his attire and stained his face and hands  he had just finished when the officer returned he smiled and said  there is no fear of your being suspected now and you might really go about safely without a guard unless you were to enter into conversation with anyone you speak the language very well but your accent is not quite the same as ours here though in aracan it would pass unremarked  as they went out from the prison the officer told two soldiers who were waiting there to follow at a distance  do not approach us he said unless i call you up  the houses were not constructed in continuous rows but were very scattered each house having its inclosure or garden the population was very small in comparison to the area occupied by the town this was divided into two partsthe inner and outer town the whole was surrounded by a brick wall five miles and a half in circumference some sixteen feet high and ten feet in thickness strengthened on the inside by a great bank of earth the inner town was inclosed by a separate wall with a deep ditch on two sides the river irrawaddy on the third and a tributary river on the fourth  a considerable portion of the inclosed area was occupied by the royal quarter containing the palace the court of justice the council chamber arsenal and the houses of the ministers and chief officials this was cut off from the rest by a strong and wellbuilt wall twenty feet high outside which was a stockade of the same height the total population of ava was but 25000  the officer did not take stanley to the royal quarter observing that it was better not to go there as although he had leave to walk in the town it might give offence were he to show himself near the palace but after going through the wall they visited two or three of the markets of which there were eleven in the town  the markets consisted of thatched huts and sheds and were well supplied with the products of the country here were rice maize wheat and various other grains sticks of sugar cane tobacco cotton and indigo mangoes oranges pineapples custard apples and plantains were in abundance also peacocks jungle fowl pigeons partridges geese ducks and snipesbut little meat was on sale as the burman religion forbids the killing of animals for food venison was the only meat allowed to be sold in the markets but there were lizards iguanas and snakes which were exposed freely for sale and there were large quantities of turtle and tortoise eggs which had been brought up from the delta  stanley saw that there had really been no great occasion for him to stain his skin as the people were for the most part lighter in colour than the hindoos many of the men had however stained their faces to a darker colour and all were tattooed more or less men women and children were all smoking and frequently when both hands were required for any purpose thrust their cigars into the large holes bored in the lobes of their ears both men and women were somewhat short in stature but squarely built and muscular and in the majority of cases inclined to be fat  the men wore a sort of kilt consisting of a double piece of cloth wrapped round the body and falling to the knee over this was a loose tunic with sleeves open in front the headdress was a scanty white turban  the dress of the women was somewhat similar to that of the hindoos consisting of a single garment like a sheet wrapped round the body fastening under the arms and falling to the ankles those of the upper classes were more elaborate the rank among the women was distinguished so stanleys guide pointed out to him by the manner in which the hair was plaited and twisted and by the ornaments in it  the men like the women wore their hair long but while the men wore theirs in a knot at the top of the head the women gathered it in at the back their faces were broad at the cheekbones but narrowed in sharply both at the forehead and chin the narrow and oblique eyes showed the relationship between the burmese and their chinese neighbours they seemed to stanley a lighthearted merry people going about their business with much chatter and laughter and the sound of musical instruments could often be heard inside the houses several men in bright yellow garments mingled with the crowds in the market these were priests the officer told him and it would be a mortal act of sacrilege were anyone else to wear that colour  stanley remarked upon seeing so few soldiers and the officer told him that there was no regular army in burma every man capable of carrying arms was obliged to serve in case of war but with the exception of the kings bodyguard and a very small body of men who were police rather than soldiers there was no force permanently kept up every man was expected to know something of military duty and all were able to build stockades from the fact that the flesh of wild fowl formed one of the principal articles of food the peasantry throughout the country were all accustomed to the use of the gun and were fair marksmen  but you yourself are an officer stanley said  at present yes but tomorrow i may return to my land it is the same with the highest minister one day he may be a trader but if recommended to the king as one possessing ability straightway he is chosen to be a high official if he does not please the king or fails in his duties then the next day he may be selling cloth in the bazaar again  everything is at the will of the king nobody is born with fortune or rank for everything belongs to the king and at a mans death all goes back to him thus everyone in the land has an equal chance in war the bravest becomes a general in peace the cleverest is chosen as a councillor  walking about stanley soon found that there were a great variety of dialects talked in the streets and that the language of the burmese of the coast of the natives of pegu and the central province and of those from districts bordering on the shan states or the frontiers of china differed as widely as those of the most remote parts of great britain did from each other this being so he was convinced that there would be no difficulty whatever in passing as a native without attracting any observation or inquiry so far as the language went  his features and still more the shape of his face might however be noticed by the first comer in the daytime he thought indeed that a little tinge of colour in the corner of the eyes so as to lengthen their appearance and give an oblique cast to them would make a difference the general shape of the head was unalterable but the burmese nose and mouth did not differ very greatly from the european except that the nostrils were smaller and in shape were round rather than oval  for three weeks he continued the same life and then the burmese officer with whom he had now become very friendly said when he entered one morning  you must not go out today there is news that your people have made two forward marches the first was against a stockade which they took and killed many of our men the other time they marched out four or five miles had a fight with our troops and again killed many these things have angered the king and the people of course it is nothing for our troops are only beginning to assemble but it is considered insolent in the extreme and the kings face is darkened against your countrymen four of the prisoners have been taken out this morning and publicly executed and if the news of another defeat comes i fear that it will be very dangerous even for you  what had i best do my friend  i would fain save you for we have come to know each other and i see that there is much good in your ways though they differ greatly from ours were i to take you out as usual you might be killed in the streets were you to slip away and escape i should assuredly be put to death but if in any way i can help you i would fain do so my relation who brought you up here left a fortnight since to rejoin bandoola so his influence cannot serve you  i do not say that you might not escape from this prisonsince you are not like the others confined in a dungeonbut i see not what you could do or where you could go were you to disappear orders would be sent down the river to every village and every passing craft would be examined and you would be sure to be detected while it would be wellnigh impossible to travel the country on foot for it is but thinly inhabited there are often very long distances between the villages and much of the country is swamp and forest without paths for the village trade goes by the river and they have little communication with each other  i know that from what you say you think that your troops will beat ours even when we assemble in large numbers were this so i fear that there would be little chance of your life being spared were it not for that i should say that bandoola having recommended you you would be in no danger here and had better remain until peace is made  what think you yourself  it is very difficult to reply at once stanley said but i thank you greatly for your offer to befriend me in any way you can i do not say that i had not thought of escape for i have of course done so but it seemed to me a thing in the distance and that at any rate until the rains were over and the rivers had sunk it would be useless to attempt it i see now that it will be safest for me to try without delay if you will come in again this afternoon i will tell you what i have thought of  i will do so and i myself will try to think how best the matter can be managed we must remember that the great thing is for you to find concealment for the present after the search for you has been made for some time it will die away and it will then be the easiest plan for you to make your way down the river    chapter 4 a ruined temple   after the officer left him stanley sat thinking for a long time he himself inclined strongly towards the river but he saw that at present the difficulties would be very great the war boats were passing up and down and bodies of troops were being carried down in large craft in every village the men he knew were assembling and drilling even in ava he could see the difference in the population the proportion of men to women having markedly decreased since his arrival  as to the journey by land it appeared to him impossible he was too altogether without money and whether by water or land it would be necessary to go into the villages to buy provisions indeed money would have been almost useless for there was no coined money in burma payments being made in lead for small amounts or in silver for large onesthe quantity necessary being cut off from small sticks or bars or paid in filings  it seemed to him that the best thing would be to take to the forest for a time and endeavour to subsist upon wild fruits or if these were not to be found there to go out into the fields and orchards at night and so manage to hold on for a few weeks his friend told him that in the forests along the principal lines of route to the capital were many bad characterspersons who had committed crime and fled from justice some were cultivators who having been unable to pay their taxes had deserted their land and taken to the woods all committed depredations and traders coming into the town from the shan states or from the country where rubies and emeralds were found always travelled in caravans for mutual protection at times levies were called out and many of these marauders were killed  stanley then had hit upon nothing definite when the officer returned in the afternoon and in reply to the latters question he acknowledged at once that the only thing he could see was to take to the forest until the active search for him had ceased  you would find it difficult to maintain yourself i have thought of a better way than that i am acquainted with a phongee who lives in a temple in a lonely spot four miles away he is a good man though somewhat strange in his habits and i feel sure that on my recommendation he would take you in there would be little chance of your being discovered there you could not go dressed as you are but must disguise yourself as a peasant though it might be well to retain your present attire which may be useful to you afterwards i fear that you will fare badly with him in the way of food there will be enough to eat but it will be of the simplest  so that there is enough to keep life together it matters little what it is  then that is settled  now about making your escape from here your door is closely barred at night and there is no window save those four little holes high up in the wall which scarce a bird could get through  i could cut through the thatch above stanley said if i had but something that i could stand upon to do so there are some bamboos lying just at the bottom of the steps with these and some cord i might make a sort of ladder and should then be able to get at the thatch  i will bring you some cord tomorrow for that and to let yourself down to the ground then i will arrange where to meet you and will guide you out of the town and take you to the priest i will bring a disguise for you and some stain for your body and arms for as a peasant you would be naked to the waist i can think of nothing better  i thank you most heartily stanley said and trust that you may get into no trouble for the kindness that you have shown me  there is no fear of that my friend no one will know that i have been away from the town i am greatly afraid that this will be all that i shall be able to do for you for i am told that i am to go down the river with the next batch of troops which will start in three days i have only been informed of it since i saw you this morning had it not been for you i should have been glad for it is in war time only that one can obtain honour and promotion  i am sorry that you are going sir i shall miss your kindness sorely but i can understand your desire to go to the front it is the same with us when there is a war every officer and soldier hopes that his regiment will be sent there however i shall see you again  has bandoolas army moved yet  no nor do i think that it will do so it is a long march down to rangoon from ramoo and i believe that he will remain where he is until he sees how matters go at rangoon as soon as your people are driven out he will be joined by a great army and will march to dacca there our troops from the north will join him and then he will go to india we think  i fancy stanley said with a smile if he waits until we are turned out from rangoon his stay at ramoo will be a long one  the next day the officer brought several yards of strong cloth such as was worn by the peasants a piece of muslin to make the circular band that was worn by the lower class instead of a complete turban and a lot of horse hair to be worn on the top of the head  now he said strip to the waist and i will dye your body i have dyes of two colours here one for the skin and the other to draw lines on the face so as to make you look older and with this i can also imitate tattoo marks on your chest and shoulders here is a long knife such as everyone wears and here is the cord  as soon as it is getting dark you must carry up two of the bamboo poles taking care that no one observes you do so there is seldom anyone in the courtyard i have had the knife sharpened and it will cut through the thatch easily enough when you get away walk straight to the market that lies nearest to us i will be at its entrance it will take you i suppose two hours to make your ladder and get out you cannot begin until the guard closes your door you tell me he never comes in  no he brings the last meal an hour before sunset i generally sit on the top of the steps till he comes up to lock the door which is about nine oclock and i do not see him again until he unbars the door in the morning i should not think that it will take as long as two hours to make the ladder and cut the thatch at any rate by eleven i ought to join you  i suppose the gates are open  oh yes they are never closed though of course they would be if an enemy were near there is no guard anywhere  after staining stanleys skin the officer waited a quarter of an hour for it to dry thoroughly and then proceeded to draw lines on his face across the forehead and from the corners of his eyes and then spent nearly an hour in executing rough tattoo marks on his body and arms  this dye is very good and will last for weeks before it begins to fade i will bring with me another bottle tonight so that you can at least redye your skin  here is some wax you must turn your hair up from the neck and plaster it in its place with it the turban will prevent anyone seeing how short the hair is here is a little bottle of black dye with which you had better colour it before fixing it with the wax  stanleys hair had not been cut for some time before he had been captured by the burmese and in the two months that had since elapsed it had grown very long and could therefore be turned up as the officer suggested putting on his usual garments he sat at his place at the door of the cell until the guard brought up his evening meal having eaten this he dyed his hair and half an hour later turned it up plastering it with wax and tied a bit of fibre round where the turban would come  by this time it was getting dusk he sat at the door at the top of the steps until he saw that the courtyard was deserted the guard at the gate having gone outside to enjoy the coolness of the air then he ran down the steps took two bamboo poles about ten feet in length and two short pieces of the same wood no thicker than his finger and hurrying up the steps with them laid them down against the side of the room then he went to the steps again and sat there until he saw the guard coming across to fasten his door when he went in and as soon as he heard the bars put up began his preparations  first he lashed the short pieces across the ends of the two bamboos so as to keep them a foot apart then he put ratlines across and soon had the ladder completed he made up his clothes into a bundle wrapped the rough cloth round his waist adjusted the knot of horse hair on the top of his head and fastened it there with wax he wound the turban round below and his disguise was complete  fixing the ladder against the wall he climbed it and it was not long before he cut a hole through the thatch of sufficient size to pass out the work had taken him longer than he had expected for it had to be done in absolute darkness however he was sure that he was well within his time fastening the end of the rope to one of the bamboo rafters he descended the ladder and picked up his bundle then climbed up again got halfway out of the hole and listened intently everything was quiet in the street and in another minute he stood on the ground  when he turned into the principal street there were still many people about sounds of music and singing came from the windows for the burmese are very fond of music and often pass the whole night in playing and singing there was no risk whatever of detection now and he stepped briskly along until he came to the open space with its rows of little thatched huts here he paused for a minute and the officer stepped out from behind a house and joined him  i was not sure at first that it was you he said your disguise is excellent you had better follow me now until we get beyond the busy streets  keeping some twenty yards behind his guide stanley went on until after nearly half an hours walking they passed through a gate in the city walls he now closed up to the officer and after another halfhours walk across a cultivated country they entered a forest the ground now rose steadily and after keeping on for two miles they emerged from the trees at the top of a hill the space had been cleared of timber but it was nearly covered with bushes and young trees in the centre were the ruins of a temple that had evidently existed long before the burmese dynasty occupied the country and had been erected by some older race it was roofless the walls had in places fallen and the ruins were covered with vegetation  the burman ascended some broken steps entered the temple and crossed to one of the opposite corners a dim light was burning in a small apartment which had been roofed with thatch a man was lying dressed on a heap of leaves at one side he started up as the officer entered  who is it who comes here at this hour he asked  thekyn the officer answered  i am glad to see you the phongee said whatever may bring you here you have not fallen into trouble i hope  in no way good priest i am starting in two days down the river to fight the barbarians but before i go i want you to do me a favour  the phongee smiled  beyond naming you in my prayers thekyn there is but little that a hermit can do for any man  not so in this case the officer said i have one here with me who needs rest and concealment i would rather that you did not ask who he is he has done no crime and yet he is in danger and for a month maybe he needs a shelter will you give it him for my sake  assuredly i will the priest said your father was one of my dearest friends in the days when i dwelt in the city i would gladly do all in my power for his son and this is but a small thing that you ask let him enter  stanley went in the priest took down the little lamp from a shelf on which it stood and held it near the lads face then he turned with a smile to thekyn  the painting is but clumsily done he said though maybe it would pass without close examination he is a stranger and comes of a race unknown to me but as you said it matters not to me who he is suffice that he is a friend of yours he is welcome to a share of my shelter and my food though the shelter is rough and the food somewhat scanty of late few indeed have sought me for as i hear most of the men have gone down to the war  i have brought you some food the officer said for stanley had observed that he also carried a bundle a larger one than his own here is a supply of rice that will last for some time and this with your offerings will suffice to keep things going my friend is not like you bound by his religion not to take life and i know that snakes are very plentiful round here  snakes had formed a frequent article of his diet since he had been captured and stanley had lost the repugnance to them that he at first felt so the prospect of their forming the staple of his food was not disagreeable to him it would also afford him some employment to search for and kill them  i shall be well content he said with anything that i can get and trust that i shall be no burden upon you  you will assuredly be none the priest replied here must be at least thirty pounds of rice which alone would keep two men alive for a month as regards the snakes though i may not kill them i may eat them when killed and indeed there are few things better in truth i should not be sorry to have some of the creatures out of the way for they swarm round here so thickly that i have to pay great heed when i walk lest i step upon them  have you been troubled with robbers of late father thekyn asked  they trouble me not at all the priest said men come sometimes they may be robbers or they may not i ask no questions they sometimes bring fruit and other offerings and i know that i need not fear them i have nought to lose save my life and he would be indeed an evil man who would dare to lift his finger against a priestone who harms not anyone and is ready to share what food he has with any man who comes to him hungry  well father i will say goodbye i must be back to the city before men are about as i would not that my absence should be discovered  peace be with you my son may you come back safe from the wars my prayers will be said for you night and morning  be in no uneasiness as to your friend if any should ask me about my companion i shall reply that he is one who has undertaken to rid me of some of the snakes who dispute the possession of this place with me  thekyn motioned to stanley to come outside the hut with him and when he did so handed to him a small but heavy bag  this is lead he said you will need it when you start on your journey down the country there are eight pounds of it and from what you have seen in the market you will know how much food can be got for a small amount of lead i would that i could do more for you and assist your flight  you have done much indeed very much and should i regain my friends i will endeavour to do as much by one of your countrymen for your sake i hope that when this war is over i may meet you again  i hope so the burman said warmly i cannot but think that you will succeed in getting away  my son the old priest said when stanley returned to his cell i am going to my prayers i always rise at this hour and pray till morning therefore you may as well lay yourself down on these leaves there is another cell like this in the opposite corner of the temple in the morning you can cut boughs and roof it like this and make your bed there there is no room for another here and it will doubtless be more pleasant for you to have a place to yourself where you can go and come as you like for in the day women come up to consult me and ask for my prayersbut mind how you enter it for the first time as like as not there will be snakes sheltering there  stanley lay awake for a time listening to the monotonous voice of the priest as he repeated his prayers but his senses soon wandered and he slept soundly till daybreak  his first step was to cut a stout stick and he then proceeded to the other cell which was partially blocked up with stone from the fallen roof it took him two hours to carry this stuff out and he killed no less than nine snakes that he disturbed in his work the prospect of sleeping in a place so frequented was not a pleasant one especially as the cell had no door to it and he resolved at once to erect some sort of bed place where he might be beyond their reach for this purpose he cut two poles each three or four inches longer than the cell one end of each he sharpened and drove in between the interstices of the stone at a distance of some two feet and a half apart and four feet from the ground the other ends he hammered with a heavy stone against the opposite wall until they would go down no farther then he split up some more wood and lashed strips almost touching each other underneath the two poles by the aid of some strong creepers then he filled up the bed place between the poles with dry leaves  one end of the bed was some inches higher than the other this was immaterial and he felt satisfied that even the craftiest snake could not reach him  as to the roof he was by no means particular about it in this part of burma the rainfall is very small the inundations being the effect of heavy rains in the distant hill country which as they come down raise the level of the rivers in some cases as much as eighteen feet and overflow the lowlying country  before beginning to construct the bed he had carried the snakes into the phongee after first cutting off their heads which as he knew the burmans never touch  this is good indeed my son the priest said here we have our breakfast and dinner i will boil some rice and fry four of them for breakfast  the bed was but half completed when he heard the priest sound a bell it was doubtless used as a call to prayer however stanley rightly conjectured that in this case it was a summons to a meal and was soon seated on the ground by the side of the priest little was said at breakfast which stanley enjoyed heartily  so my friend thekyn is starting for the wars what think you of it my son shall we easily overpower these barbarians we have never met them in war before and doubtless their methods of fighting are different from ours  quite different their men are trained as soldiers they act as one man while the burmese fight each for himself then they have cannon with them which they can drag about quickly and use with great effect although they are few in comparison with the armies going down to attack them the latter will find it very difficult work to turn them out of rangoon  do you think that they will beat us then  that i cannot say but i should not be surprised if it were to prove so  the burmese have never been beaten yet the priest said they have been victorious over all their enemies  the burmese are very brave stanley agreed but hitherto they have only fought against people less warlike than themselves now they have to deal with a nation that has made war a study and which always keeps up a large army of men who are trained to fight and who spend all their time in military exercises it is not that they are stronger than the burmese for the burmese are very strong men but only that men who are trained to act together must necessarily possess a great advantage over those who have had no such trainingwho simply take up arms for the occasion and when the trouble is over return to their homes and lay them by until called out to fight again  besides their weapons are better than yours and they have many cannon which by practice they can load and fire very quickly and each of which when the armies are near each other can fire fifty or sixty bullets at once  i have heard a strange story that the barbarians have a ship without sails with a great chimney that pours out quantities of black smoke and a wheel on each side and as the wheels move round the vessel can go straight up the river against the tide even if the wind is blowing strongly down  it is true father there are many such ships but only two or three that have made the long voyage across stormy seas to india  it is wonderful how these men can force fire to be their servant and how it can make the wheels of the ship to move round  that i cannot tell you father i have never seen one of these vessels though i have heard of them  the priest said no more but evidently fell into a profound meditation and stanley getting quietly up returned to his work the priest came in just as he had completed his bed  that is well he said looking at it approvingly i myself although i know that until my time has come no creature can harm me cannot resist a shudder when i hear one rustling amid the leaves of my bed for they come in although some of my friends have had a door placed to exclude their entry at night i wander but little from my cell and always close the door after me but they enter sometimes when i am meditating and forgetful of earthly matters and the first i know of their presence is the rustling of the leaves in the bed at night were i as strong in faith as i should be i would heed it not i tell myself so but my fear is stronger than my will and i am forced to rise turn up the leaves with a stick until i find them and then i open the door and eject them with as much gentleness as may be  i should get no sleep at all stanley said i dont think that even a door would make me feel any safer for i might forget to shut it sometimes tomorrow father i will wage war with them and see if i cannot decrease their numbers considerably  stanleys first task was to clear the bushes away from the court of the temple and this after several days hard work he carried out although he soon saw that by so doing he would not diminish the number of the snakes for the greater portion of the area was covered with blocks of fallen stone among which the reptiles found an impenetrable shelter the clearance effected however was so far useful that while the creatures were before altogether hidden from sight by the bushes they could now be killed when they came out to bask in the sun on the uncovered stones and he could every day destroy a dozen or more without the slightest difficulty  ten days after he had finished the work he heard the sound of mens voices and peeping out saw a burmese officer with a party of eight armed men going to the phongees cell it was possible that they might have come on other business but it was more probable they had come in search of him some of the women who had come up to the hermit had seen him at work and might have mentioned on their return that the priest had a man at work clearing away the bushes the matter might have come to the ears of some officer anxious to distinguish himself and the idea that this was the prisoner for whom a search was being made occurred to him  stanley shrank back into his cell took up the bundle of clothes that served as his pillow got on to the bed and standing on it was able to get his fingers on to the top of the wall he hoisted himself up made his way through the boughs of the roof and dropped on to the ground outside then he went round by the back of the temple until he stood outside the priests cell and could hear the voices within without difficulty  then you know nothing whatever of this man  nothing whatever he replied as i have told you he came to me and asked for shelter i gave him such poor assistance as i could as i should give it to anyone who asked me he has been no burden upon me for he has killed enough snakes for my food and his own  you know not of what part he is a native  not at all i asked him no questions it was no business of mine  could you form any idea from his speech  his speech was ours it seemed to me that it was that of a native of the lower provinces  where is he now  i know not  you say that at present he is away  not seeing him in front i thought he had gone out for he comes and goes as he pleases he is not a hired servant but a guest he cut down the bushes here in order that he might more easily kill the snakes for which indeed i am thankful to him not only for the food that they afford but because they were in such abundance and so fearless that they often came in here knowing that they had naught to fear from me  then you think that he will return soon  as he told me not of his intention of going out at all i cannot say he is away sometimes for hours in the forest  well in any case we shall watch here until his return it may be that he is some idle fellow who prefers killing snakes to honest work but it may also be that he is the escaped prisoner of whom we are in search  i hear little of what passes in the town the priest said quietly news would disturb my meditations and i never question those who come here to ask for my prayers i have heard of the escape of no prisoner  it was a young english officer who got away there has been a great stir about it every house in the town has been searched and every guard boat on the river has been warned to allow no boat to pass without assuring themselves that he is not on board  this was a brown man like ourselves clad only in a petticoat of rough cloth like other peasants  he may have dyed his skin the officer said at any rate we will stay until he returns and question him two of my men shall take their places just inside the entrance and seize him as he enters has he arms  none save his knife and the stick with which he kills the snakes it may be that he has seen you coming hither and if he has committed any crime he would flee and not return here at all  if he does not come back before it is the hour when i must return to the town i shall leave four men to watch for him and they will wait here if it is for a week until he comes back again  you can do as you please the priest said only i pray you withdraw your men from the neighbourhood of this cell i would not that my meditations were disturbed by their talk i have come hither for peace and quietness and to be apart from the world and its distractions  you shall not be disturbed the officer said respectfully and stanley heard a movement of feet and then the closing of the door  thinking it probable that the officer might make a search round the temple he at once made off into the wood behind the temple as soon as he was well among the trees he exchanged his cloth for the disguise he had worn in the town and folding it up to be used as a blanket at night he went further into the wood sat down and proceeded to think what his next step had best be it was evident that he could not return to the temple for the present and it was clear also that the search for him was still maintained and that it would not be safe to attempt to descend the river he regretted that he had been obliged to leave the place without saying goodbye to the priest and again thanking him for the shelter that he had given him but he was sure that when he did not return the old man would guess that he had caught sight of the officer and his party entering the temple and had at once fled had he not known that the guard would remain there he would have waited until they returned to the town and would then have gone in and seen the priest but as they would remain there for some days he thought it was as well to abandon all idea of returning as the suspicions that he might be the man sought for would be heightened by his continued absence and the watch might be continued for a long time on the chance of his coming back  he concluded that at any rate his best course would be to endeavour to make his way for a considerable distance down the country and then to try and get a boat he knew that the country near the river was comparatively thickly populated and that the distances between the villages were not great so that he would find no great difficulty in purchasing provisions the dress he had brought with him was not altogether unfavourable for such a purpose as he could easily pass as a subofficer whose duty it was to inquire whether the villages had each sent all their ablebodied men to the war the only drawback to it would be that if instructions for his arrest had been sent down to the villages along the road as well as those by the river they would have probably been directed to specially look for one clad in such attire however it would be open to him at any moment to take to his peasants disguise again  he at last determined to make a start and by nightfall had traversed several miles through the great forest stretching along by the side of the panlaung river he had asked many questions of his friend the officer as they went up to the temple as to the roads he was told that there was one running almost due south to ramuthayn by which he could travel down to rangoon by way of tannoo this however would take him a long distance from the main river and he decided that he would presently strike the road that ran about halfway between the hills and the irrawaddy he would follow that for a time and would try and strike the river somewhere between meloun and keowuan  below this point there was a network of rivers and but few villages and the country was swampy and unhealthy he infinitely preferred the risks of the descent by the river to those by road and it seemed to him that if he could but obtain possession of one of the small native fishing boats he could drop down at night unnoticed as the width of the river at ava was upwards of a thousand yards and below that town often considerably exceeded that breadth  when it became too dark to proceed further he sat down at the foot of a tree he regretted that he had no means of lighting a fire and determined that at any risk he would obtain the means of doing so at the first village that he came tofor he knew that there were both tigers and leopards in the jungles he thought however that they were not likely to be numerous so near the capital and the old priest had never alluded to them as a source of danger though indeed it had never occurred to him to ask  in the morning he continued his way he had gone but a mile when he heard a sudden scream in the wood a short distance to his left feeling sure that it was a human being in great fear or pain he drew his knife and ran at the top of his speed in the direction of the cry thinking that it might be some man or woman attacked by the robbers of the forest  suddenly he came upon a small open space some twenty yards in diameter he hesitated when his eyes fell on a group in the centre two men were lying on the ground and a leopard stood with a paw on each of them they had guns lying beside them and a fire was burning close by he guessed that the animal had sprung from a tree one of whose boughs extended almost as far as the centre of the opening probably it had killed one of the men in its spring for at the moment when he saw the animal it was licking the blood from the shoulder of the man on whom its right paw rested the other was as far as stanley could see unhurt  illustration stanley gave a sudden spring and buried his knife in the leopard  his tread in the light burmese shoes had been almost noiseless and the leopard which was keeping up a low growling and whose back was towards him had apparently not noticed it he hesitated for a moment and then decided to endeavour to save the man who was still alive creeping up stealthily he gave a sudden spring upon the leopard and buried his knife to the hilt in its body just behind the shoulder  with a terrible roar it rolled over for a moment and then struggled to its feet the time had been sufficient for stanley to pick up and cock one of the guns and as the leopard turned to spring at him he aimed between its eyes and fired again the beast rolled over and stanley caught up the other gun thrust the muzzle within a foot of its head and fired the leopard gave a convulsive quiver and lay dead    chapter 5 with brigands   stanley uttered an involuntary hurrah as the leopard expired and at the sound the burman who had been lying motionless leapt to his feet he looked at the leopard and then at his rescuer and exclaimed in a tone of astonishment  you have slain the beast alone and with no weapon but your knife  no stanley replied i began the fight with my knife only but caught up one of those guns when i wounded him and fired as he charged me then i finished him with the other  comrade the burman said you have done a great deed with courage i who am esteemed no coward would never even have thought of attacking that great leopard with but a knife and that to save the life of a stranger  i saw the guns lying on the ground had it not been for that i should not have dared to attack the leopard for it would have been certain death  certain death indeed but tell me first how you did it it seems to me well nigh a miracle  i was passing along not far distant when i heard your cry stanley said thinking that it was some person in distress i ran hither and saw you both lying with the leopards forepaws upon you the beasts back was turned to me and as it was growling it had not heard my approach seeing the guns lying thereand having no doubt that they were loadedi stole up sprang suddenly on the leopard and drove my knife into it behind the shoulder the blow rolled it over and gave me time to pick up the gun the rest was easy  the man without a word examined the body of the leopard  it is as you say he said it was well struck and would probably have been fatal but the animal would have torn you in pieces before he died but for the guns  well comrade you have saved my life and i am your servant so long as i live i thought all was over with me the leopard as it sprang threw its full weight on my comrade here we had just risen to our feet and the blow struck me also to the ground i raised that cry as i fell i lay there immovable i felt the leopards paw between my shoulders and heard its angry growlings and i held my breath expecting every moment to feel its teeth in my neck  i had but one hope namely that the beast would carry off my comradewho i was well assured was deadto the jungle to devour him and would then come back to fetch me i managed to breathe once very quietly when i felt a movement of the leopard and hearing a low sound guessed that he was licking my comrades blood but slightly as i moved the leopard noticed it and stood straight up again over me i dared not breathe again but the time had come when i felt that i must do so though i was sure that it would be the signal for my death  then i knew not what had happened there was a sharp pain as the leopards claws contracted and then there was a loud roar and its weight was removed from me then i heard it snarl as if about to spring then came the sound of a gun a fall and a struggle and then the sound of another gun then i heard your shout and knew the beast was dead  now sir what can i do for you shall i first skin the leopard  i care not for the skin stanley said it would be of no use to me  then with your permission i will take it off and keep it as long as i live as a remembrance of the narrowest escape that i ever had  is your comrade dead  yes the man replied the leopard struck him between the shoulders as you see and the force of the blow and the weight of the spring must have killed him instantaneously  then i will take his sword gun and cartridges  so stanley undid the sword belt and buckled it round him put the bandolier of cartridges over his shoulders and took up the gun and reloaded it while the man was at work skinning the leopard this operation the man performed with great speed it was evidently one that he had done before as soon as the beast was flayed he rolled up the skin and placed it on his shoulder  you are an officer sir he asked  no i am a fugitive  while he had been watching the man stanley had debated over whether he should confide in him and thought that after the service he had rendered him he could do so with safety  i am an englishmani was captured by bandoola at ramoo and sent a prisoner to ava i have escaped and want to make my way down to rangoon but i heard that orders had been sent along the river to arrest me and i do not at present know how to make my way down  come with me the man said i have friends in the forest some distance from here they will receive you gladly when i tell them what you have done for me and you will be safe until you choose to go we are outlaws but at present we are masters of the forest the government has its hands full and there is no fear of their disturbing us  stanley thought over the matter for a minute or two doubtless it was a robber band that he was asked to join but the offer seemed to promise safety for a time  i agree he said so that you do not ask me to take part in any deeds of violence  about that you shall do as you like the man said but i can tell you that we make good hauls sometimes our difficulty is not to capture booty but to dispose of it  have you a turban for that helmet of yours is out of place in the woods the rest of your dress has nothing peculiar about it and would attract no attention  i have a turban i have been lately in the dress of a peasant the cloth i wore lies fifty yards away i dropped it as i ran it will be useful to cover me at night if for nothing else  stanley exchanged the helmet for the turban that he had before worn and fetched the cloth  will you bury your companion he said  it would be useless he will sleep above ground as well as below and if we are to reach my comrades tonight it is time for us to be moving  they at once set out after five hours walking they came upon the river myitnge the tributary that falls into the irrawaddy at ava it was some four hundred yards across the burman walked along its banks for a short distance and then pulled from a clump of bushes a small boat that was just capable of carrying two he put it in the water they took their seats and paddled across to the other side where he carefully concealed it as before  that is our ferry boat he said it is not often used for our headquarters are in the great forest we shall presently come to but it is as well when occasionally parties are sent out to hunt us to have the means of crossing to the other side  another two hours walking through cultivated fields brought them to the edge of the forest  here you are as safe as if you were in rangoon the burman said in another hour we shall reach my comrades as a rule we change our headquarters frequently at present there is no question of our being disturbed so we have settled ourselves for a time  why were you and your comrade on the other side of the river  his village lies five miles beyond that forest the man said at ordinary times he dared not venture there but he thought that at present most of the able men would be away and so he could pay a visit to his friends he asked me to accompany him and as i had nothing better to do i agreed to go a convoy of traders too strong to be attacked had passed down from the hill country the morning before we started there was not much probability that anyone would come again for a few days  they bring down rubies from there do they not  the mines are the property of the emperor the man said and the gems are sent down once every two months under a strong guard but for all that many of the traders bring rubies down from thereof course secretly the men who work the mines often conceal stones that they come upon and sell them for a small sum to the traders besides sometimes the peasants pick them up elsewhereand these too make haste to sell them for anything that they can get we do not care for them much for it is a risky business going down to ava to sell them and the traders there knowing that at a word from them we should be arrested and most likely executed will give us next to nothing for them we prefer silver and lead for money and garments arms and set jewels  each man takes his share of what is captured and when we have enough we go home to our villages a pound of silver or two or three pounds of lead are generally quite enough to buy the goodwill of the head man of the village we give out that we have been working on the river or in ava since we left and everyone knows better than to ask questions  in another hour they reached the encampment it was now dusk and some fiveandtwenty men were sitting round a great fire a number of leafy arbours had been constructed in a circle beyond them  what returned so soon one of the men said as stanleys guide came near enough for the firelight to fall on his face but where is ranji and whom have you brought herea new recruit  not exactly parnik but one to whom i have promised shelter for a while ranji is dead i should have been dead too and eaten had it not been for my comrade here here is the skin of the beast who slew ranji and when i tell you that the leopard stood with one paw on me you may guess that my escape was a narrow one  the brute was a large one one of the other men said as meinikfor such was the name of stanleys companionunrolled and held the skin up i see it had a bullet between the eyes and another just behind the ear and there is a knife cut behind the shoulder it must have been hot work when it came to knives with a beast of that size  give us some food and cocoa we have eaten nothing today and have walked far when we have fed i will tell you my story  the burmans recital of the adventure with the leopard excited great applause and admiration from his comrades  tis wonderful one said not so much that our new comrade should have killed the leopard though that was a great feat but that armed only with a knife he should attack a beast like this to save the life of a stranger truly i never heard of such a thing has he all his senses  meinik nodded he had received permission from stanley to say who he was stanley had consented with some reluctance but the man assured him that he could trust his companions as well as himself and that it was much better to tell the truth as it would soon be seen that his features differed altogether from their own and that therefore he was some strange person in disguise  he is in his senses he said but he does not see things as we do he is one of those english barbarians who have taken rangoon and against whom our armies are marching he was captured at ramoo and sent by bandoola as a prisoner to ava he has made his escape and will in a short time go down the river but at present the search is too hot for him so you see that he is like ourselves a fugitive  what is his age one of the men asked after a silence during which they all gazed at the newcomer  he is but a lad being as he tells me between sixteen and seventeen but you see his skin is stained and his face marked so as to give him the appearance of age  if the men of his race are as brave as he is meinik our troops will truly have harder work than they think to drive them into the sea does he speak our tongue  yes stanley answered for himself i have been more than two years in the province of chittagong and learned it from one who was in our service  and would many of your people risk their lives in the way you did for a stranger  certainly many men constantly run risks as great to save others  one life is all a man has the burman said why should he give it for a stranger  i dont think that we stop to think of that stanley said it seems to us natural that if we see another in danger of his life we should try to save it whether it is a man or woman whether it be from fire or from any other fate  you must be a strange people the burman said gravely and i should scarce have credited it had i not heard that you had done it yourself but it is wonderful and you too a lad who has not yet come to his full strength  we should be glad to have such a man for our comrade my friends whether he be burman or english matters little he has risked his life for one of us and he is our brother as long as he likes to stay with us  there was a warm exclamation of assent round the circle and stanley felt that he had no cause for uneasiness as long as he remained with them in the evening the men sang many songs and at their request stanley sang some english ones choosing some with lively airs the burmese were much pleased and surprised at these and joined merrily in the chorus  half a dozen of them then set to work with their knives cut down some saplings and boughs and constructed for stanley an arbour similar to the others and he lay down well satisfied with the results of his adventure and feeling that he could remain with these merry fellows criminals though they might be until it would be safe to make his way down the river  in the morning the men started early leaving him in charge of the fire they went off in parties of four or five to watch the various roads leading to the capital two or three of them dressed as peasants going to towns where travellers would halt so as to gain information as to any party coming down when they gathered again at dusk one party only had had any success they had met six merchants coming down with horses laden with spices indigo and cotton these had offered no resistance and they had taken as much as they could carry and then allowed them to go on with the rest of their goods there was a general feeling of regret that the party had not been more numerous and some expressions of anger at the spies on the road by which the traders had come for not letting them know beforehand so that they could have placed their whole force there and carried away all the goods  these are the things that suit us best meinik said to stanley you see one can go down with a parcel of cinnamon or pepper or a bag of dyes or fifty pounds of cotton into the town and sell it in the market at a fair and proper price of course one dresses ones self as a small cultivator and there is no suspicion whatever that all is not right  we shall keep a sharp lookout for the men as they come back again and relieve them of the silver or goods they may have taken in exchange that is if they come by the same roadbut it is more likely that after their adventure today they will choose some other or take a guide and travel by village tracks no doubt they think that they have got off easily for they have not lost more than a quarter of their goods it is war time now and there is no fear of a force being sent against us but usually we do not take so much as a quarter of the merchandise were they to lose everything they would make complaints and then we should have a force sent up against us and be obliged to move away for a time but as it is they are so pleased with getting the greater part of their goods safe to market that they do not care to make a fuss about it for they might have to pay the court officials and others more than the value of the goods lost  they do not often resist then  not often if a man loses his goods he can gather more again but when his life has gone everything has gone besides as a rule we take care that we are so strong that they see at once that resistance would be hopeless sometimes they bring armed guards with them these are men who make it their business to convoy traders down when the times are troubled sometimes we have fights with these but as a rule we seldom attack them unless we are so strong that they do not dare to oppose us still we do have fights sometimes for these shan guards are brave fellows their convoys are generally rich ones for it would not pay small traders to hire men to protect them  in times of peace we seldom stop long in one neighbourhood for when it once becomes known what road we are lying near they come along in parties too strong to be attacked and as it matters little to us where we live we move away perhaps a hundred miles and then settle on another line of traffic we have not been here long we were last down by tannoo and did well for a long time there until at last the governor raised all the villagers and hunted the woods and we found that we had to leave i expect we shall stay here some time now there is no fear of troops being sent out and we can afford not to press too hardly on travellers for we have done so well of late that we could separate and return to our homes each with a good store of booty half our number did leave when we came up from the south and more of us would go if it were not for this order that everyone shall join the army it is much pleasanter to live here free to do as we like than to be driven down like a herd of beasts to fight besides we have no quarrel with your people it was the officials at aracan who began it let them fight if they like  stanley remained a fortnight with the band at the end of that time they heard that a party of thirty traders were coming down together and that they had with them ten armed guards this they no doubt supposed was ample protection for as the band generally worked in such small parties it was believed that there were but a few outlaws in the forest all the band went out and returned in the evening laden with spoil two or three of them were wounded but not severely  so you had resistance today meinik  it lasted only for a minute the man said as soon as they saw how strong we were the guard were glad enough to put up their swords and let us bind them hand and foot while we searched the merchants as you see we have made a good capture though we have not seized more than a fifth of what they brought down with them but it will take them some time to pack their bales again for we searched everything thoroughly and made all the merchants strip and searched their clothes and their hair  what did you do that for  well it was this way i said to my comrades as we went along this morning  the englishman is going to leave us in a day or two i have not forgotten what i owe him and should like to make him a present i propose that we search all the party thoroughly today from what we heard some of them come from the ruby country and are pretty sure to have gems concealed about them or in their baggage i propose that all the stones we find we will give to our friend  they all agreed at once for as you know they all like you and rubies as i told you are of little use to us for we cannot dispose of them without great risk so they did as i proposed and had good fortune twelve out of the number had gems hidden about them and some of them a good lot you need not hesitate to take them for you may be sure that they bought them for next to nothing from poor fellows who had risked their lives to hide them  there they are we have not looked at them but just emptied the parcels into this bag as we found them of course they are all rough stones you must take them as a present from all of us and as a proof that a burman even if he is but a robber is grateful for such a service as that you rendered him  stanley felt that he could not refuse a gift so offered even though the goods were stolen as meinik said the gems were of little use to the robbers since they were afraid to try and dispose of them and their owners had themselves broken the law in having purchased them and had doubtless given sums bearing no proportion to their real value therefore he thanked meinik very heartily and also after they had had their meal the rest of the band who made very light of the matter  the things were useless to them they said if it had been silver or even lead it would have been different but to endeavour to sell rubies they had to risk their lives the goods that they had got that day would fetch them far more money than the rubies and could be sold without difficulty and as soon as the war was over and they could go down to their villages the band would break up they had enough silver and lead hidden away to keep them for years even if they never did any work whatever  what do you do with it when you get back  we hide it it would never do to enter a village with ten or twelve pounds weight of silver and three or four times as much lead for the headman might take it into his head to have us searched so we generally dig a hole at the foot of a tree in some quiet spot and take perhaps a pound of silver and two or three of lead with us a gift of half that silver is enough to convince the headman that we are honest fellows who have been working hard since we went away and from time to time we can go to our store and get what we want from it and can build a house and marry and take up a field or two and perhaps become headmen ourselves before very long  well i am sure i wish you all well stanley said you have all been very kind to me since i joined you and i shall be glad to think of you all as settled quietly down in your villages rather than as remaining here when some day or other you might all be captured and harm come to you  the next morning stanley started with meinik who was a native of a small village on the river some forty miles below ava and who had resolved to accompany him down to rangoon  i shall be able to get a boat and some nets for a pound or two of lead if we are hailed i can do the talking and can land and buy provisions if wanted i have arranged with my comrades to take my share of the silver and lead we have stored up at once for it is likely that they will also have gone to their homes before i shall have returned and we have changed everything into money except what we took yesterday  before starting stanley was again dyed and the tattoo marks imitatedfar more carefully than before three or four of the men operating upon him at once his face was almost entirely covered with these marks some liquid was applied that extracted the colour from his eyebrows and left them snow white some of his hair was similarly treated and looking at himself in a pool of water stanley did not in the slightest degree recognize himself and felt certain that no one would suspect him of being the young english captive  resuming his peasants cloth he took a hearty farewell of the band and started with meinik the latter carried a bundle slung on his gun it contained some clothes and did not look heavy but in the centre were two parcels that weighed some forty pounds stanley carried a bundle with his other clothes and several pounds of rice  two days walking took them to meiniks village once out of the forest they travelled at night and reached the village just as the people were astir the place consisted of ten or twelve huts and meinik created quite an excitement among the few people who inhabited it these consisted of two or three old men some women and children  where have you been for the last year and half meinik if i may ask  working near ava he said but as i should have to go to war if i had remained there i thought that i would come back and see how you all were i have saved a little money and may settle down but whether here or elsewhere i have not yet made up my mind  you will have to go to the war one of the old men said there is scarce a day that one of the war canoes does not stop here to see if there are any ablebodied men they have taken eight and they will assuredly take you  then i shall get a boat he said and take to fishing the war cannot last long and i shall do my best to keep out of the way of the war canoes until it is over if any of you have a boat to sell i will buy it  i will sell you mine the old man said both of my sons have been taken to the war and i am too old to work it myself it is a good one my sons made it only last year  whom have you with you  stanley had remained a short distance off while meinik was talking to his friends  he is an old man i joined along the road he said he is a skilful fisherman and he has agreed to go with me if i can get a boat  is there an empty hut  yes six of them of course when the men were taken they carried off the wives and children as usual as hostages for their conduct  meinik nodded he felt no surprise as it was the custom in burma to hold the women and children of all the men going to the war as guarantees that their husbands would not desert or show cowardice in battle in either event their relatives would be at once put to death  my companion is tired he said we walked all night so we will cook some food and he will sleep  they at once took possession of one of the empty huts which was just as it was left by its proprietor one of the women brought a brand or two from her hearth an earthen cooking pot was filled with water and placed above it and a few handfuls of rice dropped in two or three snakes cut up into small pieces and some pepper pods were added and then meinik went out talked to his acquaintances and arranged for the purchase of the boat stanley watched the fire  in an hour meinik returned  the boat is a good one he said and the nets in fair order i have bought them for two pounds of lead and have promised that when the war is over and the mans sons return it is to be free to them to buy it back at the same price  after eating their meal they both lay down and slept until late in the afternoon then meinik bought an earthenware pot and a flat slab of the same material for making a fire on some peppers and capsicums and a little cinnamon and nutmeg a basket of mangoes and some tobacco as soon as it became dusk they took their places in the boat meinik carrying down two or three faggots of wood  the boat was a canoe hewn out of a pine log it would have carried four people comfortably and there was plenty of room for them both to lie down at full length it was very light the wood having been cut away until it was little thicker than cardboard this was the almost universal method of construction even the war canoes that would carry sixty paddlerssitting two by two on a benchand thirty soldiers being hewn from great single logs of teak the nets were stowed one at each end in the middle was the fireplace on which the brands of the fire had already been laid near it were the faggots and stores  meinik and stanley sat on the nets each with a paddle the former had hidden the greater portion of his store of money in the ground before entering the village as soon as they had fairly started stanley said  had we not better get rid of the fire meinik its light would draw attention to us  that matters little the burman replied there are not likely to be war canoes about at night and i expect that most of them will have gone down the river people fish either by night or by day and even if a war canoe came along they would not trouble about it for of course many men too old to go to the war remain here and go on fishing people cannot starve because there is fighting the old men and women must cultivate the fields and fish or both they and the people of the towns would starve  many even of the young men do not go they keep away from their villages during the day and work in the fields and the headmen shut their eyes for they know that if the fields are not cultivated the people cannot pay their share of the taxes  still it is as well to be on the safe side when the fire has burnt low we will lay a cloth over the top of the boat so that the glow of the embers will not be seen  they kept their course near the middle of the river partly because the current there was stronger partly because any war canoes that might be coming up would keep close to one bank or the other they kept on their way until there was a faint gleam of light in the sky and then paddled into the shore chose a spot where some bushes drooped down into the water and forcing the canoe in behind these so as to be entirely concealed from the sight of any passing boat cooked some food and having eaten their breakfast lay down and slept until evening  illustration they forced the canoe behind bushes so as to be entirely concealed  night after night the journey was continued their supply of food was ample to last them and there was therefore no occasion to stop at any village to purchase more the river at the point where they started was about two miles wide but at some points it was double that width while at others it contracted to little over a mile its level was much lower now than it had been when stanley ascended it two months before sometimes at night they towed one of their nets behind them and obtained an ample supply of fish for their wants  each night they made as stanley calculated about forty miles and after ten days travel they came to the point where the great river divided one small arm running down to rangoon another descending to bassein and then falling into the sea at cape negrais while a large proportion of the water found its way down by innumerable branches between the rangoon and bassein rivers  for the last two or three days they had been obliged to observe great caution for below prome there were numbers of boats all going down the river laden with men and stores these however only travelled by day and the canoe was always at that time either floating in the shelter of bushes or hauled up on the bank at spots where it could be concealed from view by thick growths of rushes  we shall never be able to get down to rangoon by water said meinik the river will be crowded with rowboats near the town and there will be no chance whatever of making our way through them at the next village we come to i will go in and learn the news your countrymen may have been driven out by this time and in that case there will be nothing to do but to travel north on foot until we reach chittagong  i have no fear that we shall be driven out meinik  this conversation had occurred on the night when they had passed the point of division of the two arms of the river they had caught a larger supply of fish than usual and as soon as the boat was laid up meinik started along the bank with a number of them for the nearest village he returned in two hours  it is well i landed he said for the point where the greater portion of our people are gathered is henzawaddy only some fifteen miles further on  you were right your people have not been driven out a large number of our troops are down near rangoon but in the fighting that has taken place we have gained no advantage your people marched out at the end of may carried a stockade and advanced to joazoang and attacked some villages defended by stockades and carried them after having killed a hundred of our men then a great stockade on a hill near the river three miles from rangoonwhich our people thought could not be taken so strongly was it protectedwas attacked the guns of your people made a great gap in a stockade a mile in front of it two hundred men were killed and also the commander  then your people marched on to the great stockade at kemmendine your troops when they got there saw how strong it was and were afraid to attack it they lay down all night close to it and we thought we should destroy them all when they attacked in the morning but their ships that had come up with them opened fire at daybreak as the stockades were hidden from the sight of those on the river we had thought that the ships could do nothing but they shot great balls up into the air and they came down inside the stockade where they burst with an explosion like the noise of a big gun and killed so many that the troops could not remain under so terrible a fire and went away leaving it to your people to enter the stockade without fighting    chapter 6 among friends   it certainly seems to me stanley said when he heard the burmans account of the state of things below that it will not be possible for us to go any further by water  it would be very dangerous meinik said it is certain that all the men in this part of the country have been obliged to go with the army and even were we both natives and had no special reason for avoiding being questioned we should be liable to be seized and executed at once for having disregarded the orders to join the army assuredly we cannot pass down farther in our boat but must take to the land i should say that we had best get spears and shields and join some newlyarrived party  but you forget that though my disguise as a native is good enough to mislead anyone passing us on the road or in the dusk after sunset i should certainly attract attention if travelling with them by day  i forgot that i have grown so accustomed to seeing you that i forget that to other people your face would seem strange as it at first did to me in the forest indeed you look to me now like one of ourselves but were we to join a band someone would be sure to ask questions concerning you ere long what then do you think we had best do  from what i heard of the country from one of your comrades who is a native of this province it would be impossible for us after crossing the river to make our way down on the opposite side since the whole country is swampy and cut up by branches of the irrawaddy on this side there are few obstacles of that kind but on the other hand we shall find the country full of troops going down towards rangoon your comrade told me that the hills that we saw to the east from the forest at ava extended right down into tenasserim and were very high and could not be traversed for that no food could be obtained and that tigers and wild animals and other beasts abounded but he said that the smaller hills that we crossed on the way to your villagewhich he called the pegu yoma hillssome of whose swells come down to the bank extend all the way down to the sea between the irrawaddy and the sittang rivers and that from them streams flowed to one river or the other therefore if we could gain that range we should avoid the swamp country altogether  a few miles back we passed a river coming in from the east and if we follow that up as far as there is water we shall be among the hills he said that there were no mountains at all there but just rounded hills with many villages and much cultivated ground so there ought to be no difficulty in making our way along we shall be able to gather food in the fields or can go into villages and purchase some for the men will all be away besides we can get spears and shields and can say that having been away from home on a journeywhen the men were all ordered to war we returned too late to go with the rest of the villagers and are making our way down to join them many others must be doing the same and the story will be likely enough  in that way we can get down till we are close to the troops round rangoon and must then take our chance of getting through them  that seems better than the other way meinik said there is such a river as you speak of above sarawa we can paddle back tonight and hide near the town then i can go there in the morning and buy a couple of spears and shields and get some more rice and other things we have plenty of ammunition for our guns which we may want if we meet any wild beasts  you dont think that there will be any danger in your going in there meinik of course there is no absolute occasion for us to have spears and shields as we have guns  we ought to have shields meinik replied and it were better to have spears too and also for us to carry axeseveryone carries an axe in war time for we always erect stockades and though a very poor man may only have his knife everyone who can afford it takes an axe most people have such a thing for it is wanted for cutting firewood for clearing the ground for building houses and for many other things and a burman must be poor indeed who does not own one  by all means then get them for us meinik besides we may find them useful for ourselves  they now lay down and slept until evening and then started up the river again keeping close in under shadow of the bank and two hours before daylight concealed the canoe as usual at a spot two miles above sarawa meinik started at daybreak and returned three hours later with two axes spears and shields  that night they turned into the river running to the east and for four nights paddled up it the country was now assuming a different character and the stream was running in a valley with rising groundfrom a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet highon each side and was narrowing very fast towards morning on the fifth day the river had become a small stream of but two or three feet deep and they decided to leave the boat as it was evident that they would be able to go but a short distance further  we may as well hide her carefully stanley said it is certainly not likely that we shall want her again but there is never any saying and at any rate there is no great trouble in doing it  they cooked a meal and then started at once so as to do a few hours walking before the sun became high they determined to keep on eastward until they reached the highest point of the dividing ridge between the two main rivers and then to follow it southward the country was now well cultivated and they had some trouble in avoiding the small villages dotted thickly about as the course they were following was not the one they would take if making straight to join the army they slept for three or four hours in the heat of the day and then pushing on found themselves before sunset on what seemed to them the highest point of the divide to the right they could see the flat country stretching towards the irrawaddy to the left the ground was more sharply undulating two miles away was a stream of fair size which they judged to be the river that runs down to pegu and afterwards joins the rangoon river below the town  stanley thought that the hill on which they stood was some five hundred feet above the low country they had left a great part of the hills was covered with trees although at the point where they had made their way up the hillside was bare they went on until they entered the forest and there set to work to chop firewood meinik carried a tinderbox and soon had a fire blazing and by its side they piled a great stock of wood  i do not know that there are any leopards so far south as this he said but at any rate it will be safer to keep a big fire blazing i never used to think much about leopards but ever since i had that great beasts foot upon my back i have had a horror of them  the next morning they continued their journey south going along boldly and passing through several villages  you are late for the war an old man said as they went through one of them  i know we are meinik replied but we were away with a caravan of traders when the order came and so instead of going down the river we have had to journey on foot but we shall be there in time from what we have heard there has not been much fighting yet  no the white barbarians are all shut up in rangoon we have not attacked them in earnest but we shall soon do so and moreover they will soon be all starved for the country has been swept clear of all cattle for twenty miles round the villages deserted and everything laid waste and we hear that half their number are laid up with sickness and that a great number have died i wish that i were younger that i too could help to destroy the insolent foes who have dared to set foot on our sacred soil  there was no need for haste now and they travelled by easy stages until by the smoke rising from different parts of the forest they knew that they were approaching the spot where the burmese forces lay around rangoon and indeed could see the great pagoda rising above the surrounding country they had heard at the last villages through which they had passed that there had been an attack made upon the pagoda on the 1st of july on that day the burmese in great force had moved down in a line parallel to the road between the pagoda and the town along which a considerable number of our troops were encamped they had advanced until within half a mile of rangoon then had changed front and attacked the british position near the town they occupied a hill near our line and opened fire from there with jingals and small cannon but two british guns firing grape soon silenced their guns and a madras regiment charged the hill and recaptured it  this entirely upset the plan of the wongee in command of the burmese the signal for the whole of the army to attack was to have been given as soon as their left had broken through the british line and had thus cut off all the troops on the road leading to the pagoda from the town seeing that this movement had failed the general did not give the signal for the general attack but ordered the troops to fall back he had been recalled in disgrace to ava and a senior officer who arrived just after the battle assumed the command he at once set to work to make a very strong stockade at kummeroot five miles from the great pagoda and also fortified a point on the river above kemmendinethe stockade that had been captured by the britishand intended from this point to send down fire rafts to destroy the british shipping and at the same time made continuous attacks at night on the british lines  the rains at this time were falling incessantly and the burmese did not think that the british would be able to move out against them the position on the river was connected with that at kummeroot by strong stockades and the burmese general was convinced that if an attack was made it could be easily defeated however eight days after the repulse of the burmese first attack the vessels came up the river while a land column moved against kummeroot  the position was a strong one the river was here divided into two branches and on the point of land between these the principal stockade was erected and was well provided with artillery while on the opposite banks of both rivers other stockades with guns were erected so that any attack by water would be met by the direct fire from the great stockade and a cross fire from those on the banks  four ships came up and the burmese guns opened upon them but the heavy fire from the menofwar was not long in silencing them and then a number of boats full of troops had landed and stormed the stockade and driven out the burmese the land column had been unable to take guns with them owing to the impossibility of dragging them along the rainsodden paths and the burmese chiefs confident in the strength of their principal postwhich was defended by three lines of strong stockades one above anotherand in their immensely superior force treated with absolute contempt the advance of the little british columnof which they were informed as soon as it started by their scouts thickly scattered through the woods  the general soomba wongee was just sitting down to dinner when he was told that the column had nearly reached the first stockade he directed his chiefs to proceed to their posts and drive the audacious strangers away and continued his meal until the heavy and rapid musketry of the assailants convinced him that the matter was more serious than he had expected as a rule the burmese generals do not take any active part in their battles but soomba wongee left his tent and at once went towards the point attacked he found his troops already retreating and that the two outer stockades had been carried by the enemy he rallied his men and himself led the way to the attack but the steady and continuous fire of the british rendered it impossible for him to restore order and the burmese remained crowded together in hopeless confusion however he managed to gather together a body of officers and troops and with them charged desperately upon the british soldiers he with several other leaders of rank was killed and the burmese were scattered through the jungle leaving eight hundred dead behind them  the fact that ten stockades provided with thirty pieces of artillery should have been captured in one day by the british had created a deep impression among the villagers of the neighbourhoodfrom whom the truth could not be concealedand indeed all the villages for many miles round the scene of action were crowded with wounded they told meinik that the army was for a time profoundly depressed many had deserted and the fact that stockades they had thought impregnable were of no avail whatever against the enemy whose regular and combined action was irresistible as against their own isolated and individual method of fighting had shaken their hitherto profound belief in their own superiority to any people with whom they might come in contact  since that time no serious fighting had taken place occasional night attacks had been made and all efforts on the part of the invaders to obtain food by foraging parties had proved unsuccessful the boats of the fleet had gone up the puzendown river that joined the rangoon river some distance below the town and had captured a large number of boats that had been lying there waiting until rangoon was taken before going up the river with their cargoes of rice and salt fish but they had gained no other advantage for although the villages were crowded with fugitives from the town these were driven into the jungle by the troops stationed there for the purpose as soon as the boats were seen coming up the river  in some cases however the boats had arrived so suddenly that there had not been time to do this and the fugitives had been taken to rangoon where it was said they had been very well treated  great reinforcements had now come down from the upper provinces two of the kings brothers had arrived to take command of the army one had established himself at donabew the other at pegu they had brought with them numbers of astrologers to fix upon a propitious time for an attack and the kings invulnerables several thousands stronga special corps whom neither shot nor steel could injurewere with them  about the 6th of august a strong position that had been taken up by a force sent by the prince at pegu in the old portuguese fort of syriam had been attacked with orders that the channel of the rangoon river should be blocked so that none of the strangers should escape the fate that awaited them the position was a very strong one the trees and brushwood round the fort had been cleared away wherever there were gaps in the old wall stockades had been erected and great beams suspended from the parapet in order that if an attack was made the ropes could be cut and the beams fall upon the heads of the assailants  the british had however thrown a bridge across a deep creek pushed on against the place and carried it in a few minutes the garrison flying as soon as the assailants gained the ramparts to a pagoda standing on a very steep hill defended by guns and assailable only by a very steep flight of steps the troops however pressed up these fearlessly and the garrison discouraged and shaken by the reports of the fugitives from the lower fort had fled as soon as the british arrived at the top of the steps  notwithstanding this and other as successful attacks upon their stockades the burmese troops now felt confident that with their numerous forces they would be victorious whenever the astrologers decided that the favourable moment had arrived  meinik had ascertained from the villagers the name of the leader and the locality to which the corps belonged that was posted nearest to rangoon as soon as it was dark he and stanley entered the forest the smoke had served as a guide to them as to the position of the different corps and they were able to make their way between these without being questioned presently however they came upon a strong picket  where are you going the officer in command asked  to join the corps of the woondock snodee meinik replied we were away at bhanno when the order came and the rest had gone down the river before we got to mew so we came on by ourselves not wishing to fail in our duty  you are just in time the officer said the woondock is a quarter of a mile away on the left  they moved off in that direction but soon left the track and avoiding the camp kept away until they reached the edge of the forest then they crept forward through the jungle and brushwood pausing to listen from time to time and three times changing their course to avoid parties of the burmese acting as outposts  on issuing from the jungle they crawled forward for three or four hundred yards so as to be beyond musket shot of the outposts and then remained quiet until morning broke then they could perceive red coats moving about in a small village before which a breastwork had been thrown up some four hundred yards away from them and getting up to their feet ran towards it several shots were fired at them from the jungle behind and some soldiers at once appeared at the breastwork supposing that the two figures approaching were burmese deserters they did not fire and stanley and his companion were soon among them  they were soldiers of one of the bengal regiments and stanley to their surprise addressed them in their own language  i am an englishman he said i am one of the prisoners whom they took at ramoo and have escaped from their hands are there any of your officers in the village  i will take you to them a native subofficer said and stanley in a minute or two entered a cottage in which four english officers were just taking their early breakfast preparatory to turning out on duty  whom have you got here jemadar one of them asked in bengalee  stanley answered for himself  i am an englishman sir and have just escaped from ava  the officer uttered an exclamation of surprise  well sir the senior of them said as he held out his hand to stanley i congratulate you on having got away whoever you are but i am bound to say that if it were not for your speech i should not have believed you for i have never seen anyone look less like an englishman than you do  my name is stanley brooke sir i am the son of the late captain brooke of the 15th native regiment  then i should know you one of the other officers said for i knew your father and i remember seeing your name in the list of officers killed at ramoo and wondered if it could be the lad i knew five or six years ago  i recollect you captain cooke stanley said your regiment was at agra when we were there  right you are and i am heartily glad that the news of your death was false and he shook hands cordially with stanley  and who is your companion the major asked is he an englishman also  no sir he is a native he is a most faithful fellow he has acted as my guide all the way down from the point we started from twenty miles from ava i could never have accomplished it without his aid for although i speak burmese well enough to pass anywhere my face is so different in shape from theirs that if i were looked at closely in the daylight i should be suspected at once i could never have got here without his aid  how was it that he came to help you sir major pemberton asked as far as we can see the burmese hate us like poison even when they are wounded to death they will take a last shot at any soldiers marching past them  i happened to save his life from a leopard stanley said and truly he has shown his gratitude  jemadar the major said take that man away with you see that he is well treated give him some food of course he will presently go with this officer to the general  stanley said a few works in burmese to meinik telling him that he was to have food and would afterwards go with him to the general and he then at the invitation of the officers sat down with them to breakfast while eating it stanley told them something of his adventures after the meal was over the major said  you had better go with mr brooke to the general captain cooke i cannot well leave the regiment  we can let you have an outfit mr brooke though we are most of us reduced pretty well to our last garments what with the jungle and what with the damp we have nearly all arrived at the last state of dilapidation but i am sure the general would like to see you in your present disguise  it makes no difference to me sir stanley said with a laugh i am so accustomed to this black petticoat now that i should almost feel strange in anything else i am afraid this dye will be a long time before it wears itself out it is nearly three weeks since i was dyed last and it has faded very little yet  you need not take your arms anyhow captain cooke said you will attract less attention going without them for it will only be supposed that you are one of the natives who have been brought in by the boats  meinik was sitting on the ground contentedly outside the cottage the jemadar standing beside him  have you had any food meinik stanley asked  the man nodded  good food he said  that is all right now come along with us you can leave your weapons herethey wont be wanted  meinik rose and followed stanley and captain cooke there were houses scattered all along the roadside these were now all occupied by officers and troops and there were so many of them that it had not been necessary to place any of the men under canvasan important consideration during the almost continuous rain of the last three months  why cooke i did not know that you talked burmese an officer standing at one of the doors remarked as the officer came along chatting with stanley  you dont know all my accomplishments phillipson the captain laughed for the idea that there existed such a thing as a burmese peasant who could talk english had not occurred to the other i am taking him to the chief to show off my powers and passed on leaving the officer looking after him with a puzzled expression on his face  on their arrival at sir archibald campbells headquarters captain cooke sent in his name and as the general was not at the moment engaged he was at once shown in followed by stanley meinik remaining without  good morning sir i see you have brought in a deserter the general said  he is not a deserter sir he is an escaped prisoner who has made his way down from ava through the enemys lines  this is mr brooke he was serving as an officer with the native levy at ramoo and was reported as killed however he was fortunately only stunned and being the only officer found alive was sent by bandoola as a prisoner to ava i may say that he is a son of the late captain brooke of the 15th native infantry  you are certainly wonderfully disguised the general said and i congratulate you heartily on your escape i should have passed you by as a native without a second glance though now that i am told that you are an englishman i can see that you have not the wide cheekbones and flat face of a burman how did you manage to make your way down  i travelled almost entirely by night sir and i had with me a faithful guide he is outside i dont think that i should ever have got down without him though i speak burmese well enough to passespecially as the language differs so much in the different districts  is he a burman  yes general  have you arranged with him for any particular sum for his services if so it will of course be paid  no sir he came down simply in gratitude for a service i rendered him i do not know whether he intends to go back but i hope that he will remain here with me  i have brought mr brooke here sir captain cooke said at the request of the major thinking that you might like to ask him some questions as to the state of things in the interior  i should like to have a long talk with mr brooke the general said but unless he has any certain news of the date they intend to attack us i will not detain him now the first thing will be for him to get into civilized clothes again  by the way poor young hitchcocks effects are to be sold this morning i should think that they would fit mr brooke very well  let me see of course your pay has been running on since you were taken prisoner mr brooke  i am afraid sir that there is no pay due stanley said i happened to be at ramoo at the time looking after some goods of my uncle who carries on a considerable trade on the coast and as i talk the language and there were very few who did so i volunteered to act as an officer with the native levy i preferred to act as a volunteer in order that i might be free to leave at any time if i received an order from my uncle to join him at chittagong  i could give an order on him but i do not know where he is to be found i have with me some uncut rubies though i have no idea what they are worth for i have not even looked at them yet but they should certainly be good security for 50 pounds  we can settle that presently mr brooke i will write an order on the paymaster for 500 rupees and we can talk the matter over afterwards i am afraid that you will have to pay rather high for the clothes for almost everyone here has worn out his kit and mr hitchcock only joined us a fortnight before his death so that his are in very good condition of course they are all uniformhe was on my staffbut that will not matter you could hardly be going about in civilian clothes here  i shall be very glad if you will dine with me at six oclock this evening have a talk with your man before that and see what he wants to do if he is a sharp fellow he might be very useful to us  the general wrote the order on the paymaster and captain cooke took stanley across to the office and obtained the cash for it making inquiry he found that the sale was to come off in a quarter of an hour  i will do the bidding for you if you like brooke captain cooke said i dare say you would rather not be introduced generally in your present rig  much rather not and i shall be much obliged by your doing it  all right i will make your money go as far as i can of course the poor fellow brought no fulldress uniform with him or anything of that sort  you will find me here with my burman stanley said we will stroll round the place for half an hour and then come back here again  there was very little to see in the town meinik was astonished when they mounted the river bank and had a view of the ships lying at anchor for a time he was too surprised to speak never having seen anything larger than the clumsy cargo boats which made a voyage once a year up the river  it is wonderful he said at last who would have thought of such great ships if the emperor could but see them i think that he would make peace it is easy to see that you know many things more than we do could one go on board of them  not as i am at present meinik but when i get english clothes on again and rid myself from some of this stain i have no doubt i shall be able to take you on board one of the shipsofwar  and now will you let me know what you are thinking of doing i told the general what service you had rendered me and he asked me what you were going to do i told him that as yet i did not know whether you were going to stay here or go back again  are you going to stay here  i think soat any rate for a time i do not know where the uncle i have told you about is at present at any rate while this war is going on he can do very little trade and can manage very well without me  as long as you stay here i shall stay the burman said if i went back i should have to fight against your people and i dont want to do that i have no quarrel with them and from what i see i am not so sure as i was that we shall drive you into the sea you have beaten us whenever you have fought and i would rather stay with you than be obliged to fight against you  not many men want to fight we heard that in the villages and that those who have not got wives and children held as hostages for them get away from the army and hide in the woods  you will be a great man now and if you will let me stop i will be your servant  i will gladly keep you with me meinik if you are willing to stay and i am sure that you will be better off here than out in the woods and a good deal safer at any rate stay until after your people make their next attack you will see then how useless it is for them to fight against us when we can attack them in their stockades although they are ten to one against us and drive them out after a quarter of an hours fighting you may be sure that in the open ground without defences they will have no chance whatever  i hope they will soon get tired of fighting and that the court will make peace we did not want to fight with themit was they who attacked us but now that we have had all the expense of coming here we shall go on fighting till the emperor agrees to make peace but i dont think that we shall ever go out of rangoon again and believe that we shall also hold the ports in tenasserim that we have captured  the emperor will never agree to that meinik said shaking his head positively  then if he does not he will see that we shall go up the river to ava and in the end if he goes on fighting we shall capture the whole country and rule over it just as we have done the greater part of india  i think that would be good for us the man said philosophically it would not matter much to us to whom we paid our taxesand you would not tax us more heavily than we are nowfor as we came down you saw many villages deserted and the land uncultivated because the people could not pay the heavy exactions it is not the kinghe does not get much of itbut he gives a province or a district or a dozen villages to someone at court and says you must pay me so much and all that you can get out of it besides is for yourself so they heap on the taxes and the people are always in great poverty and when they find that they cannot pay what is demanded and live then they all go away to some other place where the lord is not so harsh  i am sure that it would be a good thing for them meinik the people of india are a great deal better off under us than they were under their native rulers there is a fixed tax and no one is allowed to charge more or to oppress the people in any way  but now we must be going i said that i would be back at the place we started from in half an hour    chapter 7 on the staff   captain cooke had done his best previous to the beginning of the auction to disarm opposition by going about among the officers who dropped in with the intention of bidding telling them something of stanleys capture adventures and escape and saying that the general had himself advised him to obtain an outfit by buying a considerable portion of the young officers kit  i have no doubt that he will put him on his staff he said from his knowledge of the country and the fact that he speaks the language well he would be very useful and as he has gone through all this from serving as a volunteer without pay i hope you fellows wont run up the prices except for things that you really want  his story had the desired effect and when captain cooke met stanley he was able to tell him that he had bought for him the greater portion of the kit including everything that was absolutely necessary  are there any plain clothes stanley asked after thanking him warmly for the trouble he had taken  no of course he left everything of that sort at calcutta no one in his senses would think of bringing mufti out with him especially to such a country as this  then i shall have to go in uniform to the generals stanley said in a tone of consternation it seems to me that it would be an awfully impudent thing to go in staff uniform to dine with the general when i have no right whatever to wear it  well as the general advised you himself to buy the things he cannot blame you for wearing them and i have not the least doubt that he is going to offer you a staff appointment of some sort  i should like it very much as long as the war lasted captain cooke but i dont think that i should care about staying in the army permanently you see my uncle is working up a very good business he has been at it now seven or eight years and he was saying the last time that i was with him that as soon as these troubles were over and trade began again he should give me a fourth share of it and make it a third share when i got to twentyone  then you would be a great fool to give it up captain cooke said heartily a man who has got a good business out here would have an income as much as all the officers of a regiment together he is his own master and can retire when he likes and enjoy his money in england  still as trade is at a standstill at present i think that it would be wise of you to accept any offer that the general might make to you it might even be to your advantage afterwards to have served on campbells staff will be an introduction to every officers mess in the country and you may be sure that not only shall we hold rangoon in future but there will be a good many more british stations between assam and here than there now are and it would be a pull for you even in the way of trade to stand on a good footing everywhere  i quite see that stanley agreed and if the general is good enough to offer me an appointment i shall certainly take it  you have almost a right to one brooke in the peninsula lots of men got their commissions by serving for a time as volunteers and having been wounded at ramoo and being one of the few survivors of that fight and having gone through a captivity at no small risk of being put to death the first time that the king was out of temper your claim is a very strong one indeed besides there is hardly a man here who speaks burmese and your services will be very valuable  here are fifty rupees he went on handing the money to stanley it is not much change out of five hundred but i can assure you that you have got the things at a bargain for you would have had to pay more than that for them in england and i fancy most of the things are in very good condition for hitchcock only came out about four months ago of course the clothes are nothing like new but at any rate they are in a very much better state than those of anyone who came here three months ago  i have ordered them all to be sent to my quarters where of course you will take up your abode till something is settled about you which will probably be this evening in that case you will have quarters allotted to you tomorrow  thank you very much i shall devote the best portion of this afternoon to trying to get rid of as much of this stain as i can at least off my face and hands the rest does not matter one way or the other and will wear off gradually but i should like to get my face decent  well you are rather an object stanley he said it would not matter so much about the colour but all those tattoo marks are to say the least of it singular of course they dont look so rum now in that native undress but when you get your uniform on the effect will be startling  we will have a chat with the doctor he may have something in his medicine chest that will at least soften them down a bit of course if they were real tattoo marks there would be nothing for it but as they are only dye or paint of some sort they must wear themselves out before very long  i will try anything that he will give me i dont care if it takes the skin off  on returning to the quarters of captain cooke stanley was introduced to the other officers of the regiment among them the doctor to whom he at once applied for some means of taking off the dye  have you asked the man you brought down with you the surgeon said you say that he put it on and he may know of something that will take it off again  no i have asked him and he knows of nothing he used some of the dye stuffs of the country but he said he never heard of anyone wanting to take the dye out of things that had been coloured  if it were only cotton or cloth the doctor said i have no doubt a very strong solution of soda would take out the greater portion of the dye but the human skin wont stand boiling water however i should say that if you have water as hot as you can bear it with plenty of soda and soap it will do something for you no doubt if you were to take a handful or two of very fine sand it would help a great deal but if you use that i should not put any soda with the water or you will practically take all the skin off and leave your face like a raw beef steak which will be worse than the stain and indeed in so hot a sun as we have might be dangerous and bring on erysipelas so you must be very careful and it will be far better for you to put up with being somewhat singular in your appearance for a bit than to lay yourself up by taking any strong measures to get rid of it  after an hour spent in vigorous washing and aided by several rubs with very fine sand stanley succeeded to his great satisfaction in almost getting rid of the tattoo marks on his face the general dye had faded a little though not much but that with which the marks had been made was evidently of a less stable character and yielded to soap and friction  before he had concluded the work two trunks arrived and finding that his face was now beginning to smart a good deal he abstained for the time from further efforts and turned to inspect his purchases with a good deal of interest the uniforms consisted of two undress suits one with trousers the other with breeches and high boots for riding there was also a suit of mess jacket waistcoat and trousers three suits of white drill half a dozen white shirts for mess and as many of thin flannel and a good stock of general underclothes a pair of thick boots and a light pair for mess there was also the sword belt and other equipments in fact all the necessaries he would require for a campaign  before beginning to dress he began to free his hair from the wax with which it had been plastered up he had obtained from the doctor some spirits of turpentine and with the aid of this he found the task a less difficult one than he had expected and the regimental barber being sent for by captain cooke his hair was soon shortened to the ordinary length  you will do very well now the major said as he went down into the general room you have certainly succeeded a great deal better than i thought you would of course you look very brown but there are a good many others nearly as dark as you are for between the rain showers the sun has tremendous power and some of the mens faces are almost skinned while others have browned wonderfully i am sure that many of them are quite as dark as yours so you will pass muster very well  before beginning to wash and change stanley had given meinik the clothes he had carried down with him and when he went out to take a short look round before tiffinfor which the servants were already laying the clothhe found the man now looking like a respectable burman standing near the door he walked slowly past him but the man did not movenot recognizing him in the slightest degree in his present attire  then stanley turned and faced him  so you dont know me meinik  the burman gave a start of surprise  certainly i did not know you my lord he said who could have known you before you were a poor burmese peasant now you are an english lord  not a lord at all meinik i am simply an english officer and dressed very much the same as i was when your people knocked me on the head at ramoo  i know your voice meinik said but even now that i know it is you i hardly recognize your face of course the tattoo marks made a great difference but that is not all  i think it is the hair that has made most difference meinik you see it was all pulled off the brow and neck before and it will be some time before it will grow naturally again i had great trouble to get it to lie down even when it was wet and it will certainly have a tendency to stick up for a long time  the dress has made a good deal of alteration in you too  they are very good clothes meinik said i have never had such good ones on before i have had money enough to buy them but people would have asked where i got it from and it never does to make a show of being better off than ones neighbour a man is sure to be fleeced if he does  what can i do for my lord  nothing at present meinik i am going to lunch with the officers here and to dine with the general and sleep here tomorrow i daresay i shall move into quarters of my own  you had better buy what you want for today in the market i dont know whether it is well supplied but as we saw some of your people about there must be food to be obtained  they gave me plenty to eat when i came in he said but i will buy something for supper  no i do not want money i have plenty of lead left  you had better take a couple of rupees anyhow there are sure to be some traders from india who have opened shops here and they wont care to take lead in payment you must get some fresh muslin for your turban and you had better close it up at the top this time it will go better with your clothes  meinik grinned  i shall look quite like a person of importance i shall be taken for at least the headman of a large village  he took the two rupees and walked off towards the town while stanley went in to luncheon there were a good many remarks as to his altered appearance  do you know brooke one of the young lieutenants said i did not feel at all sure that cooke was not humbugging us when he introduced you to us and that you were not really a burman who had travelled and had somehow learned to speak english extraordinarily well  clothes and soap and water make a wonderful difference stanley laughed but i shall be a good many shades lighter when the rest of the dye wears off at any rate i can go about now without anyone staring at me  after tiffin stanley had to tell his story again at a very much greater length than before  you certainly have gone through some queer adventures the major said when he had finished his relation and there is no doubt that you have had wonderful luck in the first place if that bullet had gone half an inch lower you would not have been one of the four white survivors of that ugly business at ramoo then you were lucky that they did not chop off your head either when they first took you or when they got you to ava then again it was lucky that bandoola sent a special message that he wanted you kept as an interpreter for himself and that the official in charge of you turned out a decent fellow and aided you to make your escape  as to your obtaining the services of the man you brought down with you i do not regard that as a question of luck you saved the mans life by an act of the greatest braveryone that not one man in ten would perform or try to perform for the life of a total stranger i hope that i should have made the effort had i been in your place but i say frankly that i am by no means sure that i should have done so  the betting was a good twenty to one against its being done successfully if the brute had heard your footstep it would have been certain death and even when you reached him the chances were strongly against your being able to strike a blow at the animal that would for a moment disable him and so give you time to snatch up one of the gunswhich might not after all have been loaded  it was a wonderfully gallant action lad you did not tell us very much about it yourself but while you were getting the dye off i got hold of one of the traders here who happened to be passing and who understood their language and with his assistance i questioned your fellow and got all the particulars from him i say again it was as plucky a thing as i have ever heard of  a few minutes later an orderly came in with a note from the general asking the major and captain cooke also to dine with him that evening stanley was very pleased that the two officers were going with him as it took away the feeling of shyness he felt at the thought of presenting himself in staff uniform at the generals  sir archibald campbell put him at ease at once by the kindness with which he received him stanley began to apologize for his dress but the general stopped him at once  i intended of course that you should wear it mr brooke i am sure that you would not find a dress suit in the camp however we will make matters all right tomorrow judging from what you said that as you cannot join your uncle at present you would be willing to remain here your name will appear in orders tomorrow morning as being granted a commission in the 89th pending the arrival of confirmation from home which of course in such a case is a mere form you will also appear in the orders as being appointed my aidedecamp in place of mr hitchcock with extra pay as interpreter  no do not thank me having served as a volunteer taken part in a severe action and having been wounded and imprisoned you had almost a right to a commission after dinner i hope that you will give us all a full account of your adventures it was but a very slight sketch that i heard from you this morning  the general then introduced stanley to the other members of his staff  if you had seen him as i saw him this morning he said with a smile you certainly would not recognize him now he was naked to the waist and had nothing on but the usual peasant attire of a piece of black cloth reaching to his knees i knew of course that the question of costume would soon be got over but i own that i did not think that i should be able to employ him for some little time not only was his stain a great deal darker than it is now but he was thickly tattooed up to the eyes and one could hardly be sending messages by an aidedecamp so singular in appearance but i see that somehow he has entirely got rid of the tattoo marks and his skin is now very little if at all darker than that of many of us so that i shall be able to put him in harness at once  after dinner was over and cigars lighted stanley told his story as before passing over lightly the manner in which he had gained the friendship of the burman when he had finished however major pemberton said  with your permission general i will supplement the story a little mr brooke has told me somewhat more than he has told you but i gained the whole facts from his guides own lips  no major please stanley said colouring even under his dye the matter is not worth telling  you must permit us to be a judge of that mr brooke the general said with a smile at the young fellows interruption of his superior officer  i beg your pardon major pemberton stanley stammered in some confusion only  only you would rather that i did not tell about your struggle with the leopard i think it ought to be told and i am pretty sure sir archibald campbell will agree with me and major pemberton then gave a full account of the adventure in the forest  thank you major you were certainly quite right in telling the story for it is one that ought to be told and if mr brooke will forgive my saying so is one of those cases in which it is a mistake for a man to try to hide his light under a bushel  you see it cannot but make a difference in the estimation in which we hold you most young fellows would as you did have joined their countrymen when threatened by a greatly superior enemy and again most would if prisoners have taken any opportunity that offered to effect their escape therefore in the brief account that you gave me this morning it appeared to me that you had behaved pluckily and shrewdly and had well earned a commission especially as you have a knowledge of the language you simply told me that you had been able to render some service to the burman who travelled down with you but such service might have been merely that you assisted him when he was in want bound up a wound or any other small matter  now we find that you performed an act of singular courage an act that even the oldest shikaree would have reason to be proud of such an actperformed too for a stranger and that stranger an enemywould of itself give any man a title to the esteem and regard of any among whom he might be thrown and would lead them to regard him in an entirely different light to that in which they would otherwise have held him  i think that you will all agree with me gentlemen  certainly  there was a chorus of assent from the circle of officers his narrative had as the general said shown that the young fellow was possessed of coolness steadiness and pluck but this feat was altogether out of the common and as performed by a mere lad seemed little short of marvellous  you will of course have hitchcocks quarters the quartermaster general said to stanley as the party broke up it is a small room but it has the advantage of being water tight which is more than one can say of most of our quarters it is a room in the upper storey of the next house i fancy the poor fellows card is on the door still the commissariat offices are in the lower part of the house and they occupy all the other rooms upstairs but we kept this for one of the aidesdecamp so that the general could send a message at once night or day  of course i shall want a horse sir  yes you must have a horse i will think over what we can do for you in that way there is no buying one here unless a field officer is killed or dies  by the way hitchcocks horses are not sold yet they were not put up yesterday i have no doubt that some arrangement can be made about them and the saddlery  that would be excellent sir as i told the general this morning i have some rubies and other stones i have no idea what they are worth they were given me by those men i was with in the forest they said that they were very difficult to dispose of as the mines are monopolies of government so when my man meinik proposed it they acceded at once to his request and handed a number of them over to me  i have not even looked at them there may be someone here who could tell me what they are worth  yes i have no doubt some of those parsee merchants who have lately set up stores could tell you i should only take down two or three stones to them if i were you if they are really valuable you might be robbed of them but i am rather afraid that you will not find that they are so brigand fellows will hardly have been likely to give you anything very valuable  i dont think that they looked at them themselves they were the proceeds of one days attack on a number of merchants they found them concealed on them and they were so well satisfied with the loot they got in merchandise that they could dispose of that i doubt whether they even opened the little packages of what they considered the most dangerous goods to keep for if they were captured and gems found upon them it would be sufficient to condemn them at once  do you speak hindustani if not i will send one of the clerks with you  yes sir and three or four other of the indian languages  ah then you can manage for yourself  when you have seen one of these parsees come round to my office i shall have seen the paymaster by that time and have talked over with him how we can arrange about the horses i should think that the best way would be to have a committee of three officers to value them and the saddlery and then you might authorize him to receive your extra pay as interpreter and to place it to hitchcocks account you will find your own staff pay more than ample here as there are no expenses whatever except your share of the mess  thank you very much indeed colonel  in the morning stanley took one of the little parcels from the bag and opened it it contained thirty stones of which twenty were rubies six sapphires and four emeralds they seemed to him of a good size but as they were in the rough state he had no idea what size they would be when cut  there were three of the parsee merchants the first he went to said at once that he did not deal in gems the next he called on examined the stones carefully  it is impossible to say for certain he said how much they are worth until they are cut for there may be flaws in them that cannot be detected now if i were to buy them like this i could not give more than a hundred rupees each if they are all flawless they would be worth much more but it would be a pure speculation and i will not go beyond that sum  stanley then visited the third store the trader here inspected them a little more carefully than the last had done examined them with a magnifying glass held them up to the light then he weighed each stone and jotted down some figures at last he said  the stones are worth five thousand rupees if they are flawless they would be worth double that i will give you five thousand myself or if you like i will send them to a friend of mine at madras he is one of the best judges of gems in india he shall say what he will give for them and you shall pay me five percent commission he is an honest trader you can ask any of the officers from madras  i will accept that offer if you will make me an advance of fifteen hundred rupees upon them and will pay you at the rate of ten percent per annum interest till you receive the money for them  the parsee again took the gems and examined them carefully  do you agree to take the jewellers offer whatever it is  yes that is to say if it is over the five thousand if it is under the five thousand i will sell them to you at that sum  i agree to that the man said but do not fear if the two largest stones are without a flaw they alone are worth five thousand  let us draw up the agreement at once stanley said  and accordingly the terms were drawn up in hindustani and were signed by both parties the parsee then went to a safe unlocked it and counted out the rupees to the value of 150 pounds these he placed in a bag and handed them to stanley who delighted at the sum that he had obtained for but a small portion of the gems went to the quartermaster generals office  we have just finished your business colonel adair said as he entered major moultrie the paymaster colonel watt and myself have examined the horses i know that hitchcock paid sixty pounds apiece for them at calcutta they are both arabs and good ones and were not dear at the money our opinion is that if they were put up to auction here they would fetch 40 pounds apiece and that the saddle and bridle holsters and accoutrements would fetch another 20 pounds there are also a pair of wellfinished pistols in the holsters they were overlooked or they would have been put up in the sale yesterday they value them at 8 pounds the brace in all 108 pounds  will that suit you the major will as i proposed stop the money from your pay as a firstclass interpreterthat is two hundred and fifty rupees a monthso that in four months and a half you will have cleared it off  i am very much obliged to you colonel but i have just received an advance of fifteen hundred rupees on some of my gems which the parsee is going to send to a jeweller of the name of burragee at madras  i congratulate you for i hardly hoped that they would turn out to be worth so much burragee is a firstrate man and you can rely upon getting a fair price from him well that obviates all difficulty  by the way i should recommend you to get a light bedstead and bed and a couple of blankets at one of the parsee stores of course you did not think of it yesterday or you might have bought hitchcocks however i noticed in one of the parsees shops a number of light bamboo bedsteads which are the coolest and best in a climate like this if you lay a couple of blankets on the bamboos you will find that you dont want a mattress  i dont know what my duties are sir or whether the general will be wanting me  he will not want you today anyhow he will know that you will be making your arrangements and moving into your quarters  by the way hitchcock brought a syce with him you must have a man for your horses and i have no doubt he will be glad to stay on with you  two hours later stanley was installed in his quartersa room some twelve feet long by eight wide a bed stood in one corner there was a table for writing on two light bamboo chairs and an indian lounging chair in the corner was a small bamboo table on which was a large brass basin while a great earthenware jar for water stood beside it and a piece of indian matting covered the floor  he learned that the staff messed together in a large room in the next house and that he would there get a cup of coffee and a biscuit at six in the morning breakfast at halfpast eight lunch and dinner so that he would not have to do any cooking whatever for himself he had given meinik a small sum to lay out in cooking pots and necessaries for his own use  the syce had gladly entered his employ stanley had inspected the horses which although light to the eye would be well capable of bearing his weight through a long days work they were picketed with those of the general and staff in a line behind the house devoted to the headquarters after lunch he went into the generals and reported himself as ready for duty  i shall not want you this afternoon mr brooke here is a plan showing the position of the different corps you had better get it by heart when it gets cooler this afternoon i should advise you to ride out and examine the position and the roads so that even at night you can if necessary carry a message to any of the regiments the burmese are constantly creeping up and stabbing our sentries and sometimes they attack in considerable force when anything like heavy firing begins it will be your duty to find out at once what is going on and bring me word as it may be necessary to send up reinforcements  in the morning it will be your duty to examine any prisoners who have been taken during the night and also natives who have made their way into the town in order to ascertain whether any date has been fixed for their next attack and what forces are likely to take part in it you can make your man useful at this work  by the way i will tell colonel adair to put him down on the list of the quartermasters native followers he need not do anything else but this but it is likely that the natives will speak more freely to him than they would to a white officer and he may as well be earning thirty rupees a month and drawing rations as hanging about all day doing nothing  thanking the general stanley took the plan and going back to his quarters studied it attentively he told meinik of the arrangement that had been made for him with which the burman was much pleased thirty rupees a month seemed a large sum to him and he was glad that he should not be costing stanley money for his food  three hours later one of his horses was brought round and he started on his ride through the camp there were two roads leading through the town to the great pagoda both were thickly bordered by religious houses and pagodasthe latter for the most part being in a state of dilapidation houses and pagodas alike had been turned into quarters for the troops and had been invaluable during the wet season  the terrace of the great pagoda was occupied by the 89th regiment and the madras artillery this was the most advanced position and was the key of the defence leaving his horse in charge of his syce at the foot of the pagoda hill stanley went up to the terrace and soon entered into conversation with some of the british officers who at once recognized him as having been that morning put in orders as the generals aidedecamp as he was unknown to everyone and no ship had come in for some days there was naturally much curiosity felt as to who the stranger was who had been appointed to a commission and to the coveted post of aidedecamp in one day  after chatting for two or three minutes they conducted stanley to the colonels quarters a small building at the foot of the pagoda  this is mr brooke colonel the gentleman who was gazetted to us this morning  i am glad to see you mr brooke but i should be more glad still if you had been coming to join for we have lost several officers from sickness and there are others unfit for duty when did you arrive  i arrived only yesterday morning sir i came here in disguise having made my way down from ava  oh indeed we heard a report that a white man had arrived in disguise at the lines of the 45th native infantry but we have had no particulars beyond that  i was captured at ramoo sir while i was acting as an officer of the native levy fortunately i was stunned by the graze of a musket ball and being supposed dead was not killed as were all the other officers who fell into the hands of the burmese their fury had abated by the time i came to myself and i was carried up to ava with some twenty sepoy prisoners after a time i made my escape from prison and took to the forest where i remained some weeks till the search for me had abated somewhat then i made my way down the country for the most part in a fishing boat journeying only at night and so succeeded in getting in here fortunately i speak the mug dialect which is very closely akin to the burmese  well the colonel said i hope that you will consider the regiment your home though i suppose that until the campaign is at an end you will only be able to pay us an occasional visit you are lucky in getting the staff appointment no doubt your being able to talk burmese has a great deal to do with it  everything i think sir the general had no one on his staff who could speak the language and unless he happened to have with him one of the very few men here who can do so often had to wait some time before a prisoner could be questioned  he remained chatting for half an hour and then rode back to the town taking the other road to that which he had before traversed    chapter 8 the pagoda   two days later a prisoner was captured when endeavouring to crawl up the pagoda hillhaving slipped past the outpostsand was sent into headquarters stanley questioned him closely but could obtain no information whatever from him telling him to sit down by the house he placed a british sentry over him  keep your eye he said on the door of the next house you will see a burman come out you are to let him talk with the prisoner but let no one else speak to him dont look as if you had any orders about him but stand carelessly by the fellow will tell us nothing but it is likely enough that he will speak to one of his own countrymen  i understand sir  stanley went into his house and told meinik what he was wanted to do  i will find out meinik said confidently and a minute or two later went out and strolled along past the prisoner as he did so he gave him a little nod and returning again shortly saluted him in burmese the third time he passed he looked inquiringly at the sentry as if to ask whether he might speak to the prisoner the soldier however appeared to pay no attention to him but stood with grounded musket leaning against the wall and meinik went up to the man  you are in bad luck he said how did you manage to fall into the hands of these people  it matters not to you the burman said indignantly since you have gone over to them  not at all not at all meinik replied do you not know that there are many here who like myself have come in as fugitives with instructions what to do when our people attack i am expecting news as to when the soothsayers declare the day to be a fortunate one then we shall all be in readiness to do our share as soon as the firing begins  it will be on the fourth day from this the burman said we do not know whether it will be the night before or the night after the soothsayers say both will be fortunate nights and the invulnerables will then assault the pagoda and sweep the barbarians away the princes and woongees will celebrate the great annual festival there two days later  that is good meinik said we shall be on the lookout never fear  what are they going to do to me will they cut off my head  no you need not be afraid of that these white men never kill prisoners after they are once taken they are safe you will be kept for a time and when our countrymen have destroyed the barbarians and taken the town they will free you from prison  there are some of the white officers coming i must get away or they will be asking questions  as he walked away the sentry put his musket to his shoulder and began to march briskly up and down a moment later the general stepped up to him  what are you doing my man who put you on guard over that prisoner  i dont know his name sir the sentry said standing at attention he was a young staff officer he came to the guard tent and called for a sentry and as i was next on duty the sergeant sent me with him he put me to watch this man  all right keep a sharp lookout over him  i wonder what brooke left the fellow here for instead of sending him to prison the general said to colonel adair we examined him but could get nothing out of him even when i threatened to hang him  i will just run up to his quarters and ask him sir  just as he entered the house stanley was coming down the stairs  the general wants to know mr brooke why you placed a prisoner under a guard by his house instead of sending him to the prison as usual  i was just coming to tell him sir  ah well he is outside so you can tell us both together  well mr brooke what made you put a sentry over the man and leave him here the men are hard enough worked without having unnecessary sentry duty  yes sir i only left him for a few minutes i was convinced the man knew something by his demeanour when i questioned him and i thought i might as well try if my man could not get more out of him than i could so i put a sentry over him and gave him instructions that he was to let a burman who would come out of this house speak to the prisoner but that no one else was to approach him  then i instructed my man as to the part that he was to play he passed two or three times making a sign of friendship to the prisoner then as the sentry had apparently no objection to his speaking to him he came up at first the man would say nothing to him but meinik told him that he was one of those who had been sent to rangoon to aid when the assault took place and that he was anxiously waiting for news when the favourable day would be declared by the astrologers so that he and those with him would be ready to begin their work as soon as the attack commenced the prisoner fell into the snare and told him that it would be made either on the night before or on the night of the fourth day from this when the invulnerables had undertaken to storm the pagoda it seems that the date was fixed partly because it was a fortunate one and also in order that the princes and head officials might properly celebrate the great annual festival of the pagoda which falls it seems on the sixth day from now  excellent indeed mr brooke it is a great relief to me to know when the assault is going to take place and from what point it will be delivered but what made you think of the story that the burman was one of a party that had come in to do something  it was what colonel adair mentioned at dinner last evening sir he was saying how awkward it would be if some of these natives who have come in were to fire the town just as a strong attack was going on and most of the troops engaged with the enemy it was not unlikely that if such a plan had been formed the prisoner would know of it and that he might very well believe what my man said that some men had been sent into the town with that or some similar intention  true enough the idea was a capital one mr brooke and we shall be ready for them whichever night they come  will you please go across to the guard tent and tell the sergeant to send a corporal across to the man on sentry with orders to take the prisoner to the jail and hand him over to the officer in command there when you have done that will you ride out to the pagoda and inform your colonel what you have discovered it will be a relief to him and to the men for as the date of the attack has been uncertain he has been obliged to largely increase his patrols and to keep a portion of his force all night under arms he will be able to decrease the number and let the men have as much sleep as they can for the next two nights  the clouds are banking up and i am very much afraid that the rain is going to set in again they say that we shall have another two months of it  after seeing the prisoner marched away stanley rode to the pagoda and saying that he had come with a message from the general was at once shown into the colonels quarters  any news mr brooke  yes colonel the general has requested me to inform you at once of the news that i have obtained from a prisoner namely that either on the night of the 30th or 31st your position will be attacked by the men who are called the invulnerables  we will give them a chance of proving whether their title is justified the colonel said cheerfully that is very good news the men are getting thoroughly worn out with the extra night duty caused by this uncertainty you think that there is no doubt that the news is correct  none whatever sir i could do nothing with the prisoner but my burman pretended to have a mission here to kick up a row in the town when the attack began and the man believing his story at once told him that the attack will be made on the pagoda by the invulnerables on the early morning of the fourth day from thisor on the next nightthe astrologers having declared that the time would be propitious and also because they were very anxious to have the pagoda in their hands in order that the princes might celebrate the great annual festival that is held it seems two days after  the colonel laughed  i am afraid that they will have to put it off for another year the general gave no special orders i suppose  no sir he had only just received the news and ordered me to ride over at once to you as he was sure that you would be glad to know that it would not be necessary to keep so many men on night duty for the next two days  thank you mr brooke will you kindly tell the general that i am very pleased at the news no doubt he will be up here himself this afternoon or tomorrow  stanley rode back fast and was just in time to escape a tremendous downpour of rain which began a few minutes after he returned he went in at once to the generals but was told that he was engaged with the quartermaster and adjutant generals he therefore went into the anteroom where tollemache his fellow aidedecamp was standing at the window looking out at the rain  this is a beastly climate he grumbled it is awful to think that we are likely to get another two months of it and shall then have to wait at least another before the country is dry enough to make a move you were lucky in getting in just now before it began  i was indeed stanley agreed for i had ridden off without my cloak and should have been drenched had it begun two minutes earlier  i saw you gallop past and wondered what you were in such a hurry about was it like this when you were out in the woods  not in the least there is very little rain near ava though the country is a good deal flooded where it is flat from the rivers being swollen by the rains in the hills we had lovely weather all the time  i should like to see a little lovely weather here the last week has been almost worse than the rainthe steamy heat is like being in a vapour bath if it were not that i am on duty i should like to strip and go out and enjoy a shower bath for half an hour  stanley laughed  it really would be pleasant he said i dont think that i gained much by hurrying back for the gallop has thrown me into such a perspiration that i might almost as well be drenched by the rain except that my clothes wont suffer so much  ah it is all very well for you the other grumbled of course after once having wandered about in the forest painted up like a nigger you feel cheerful under almost any circumstances but for us who have been cooped up doing nothing in this beastly place it is impossible to look at things cheerfully  have you heard that the enemy are going to attack on tuesday or wednesday night  no the other exclaimed with a sudden animation the general only came in a quarter of an hour ago and as he had the two bigwigs with him of course i did not speak to him is it certain how did you hear it  it is quite certainthat is unless the burmese change their mind which is not likely the princes want to celebrate the great annual festival at the pagoda on friday and so the invulnerables are going as they think to capture it either on tuesday or wednesday night i have just been up there to tell the colonel  as to your other questionhow did i learn iti got it or rather my burman did from that prisoner we were questioning this morning he would not say anything then but my man got round him and believing that he was a spy or something of that kind the prisoner told him all about it  are they only going to attack at the pagoda  that i cannot say that is the only point that the man mentioned i should say that it would only be there  why should it only be there  because i should imagine that even the burmese must be beginning to doubt whether they could defeat our whole force and as they particularly wish to occupy the pagoda on friday they would hardly risk an attack on other points which might end in disaster while what with the propitious nature of the day and the fact that the invulnerables have undertaken to capture the pagoda no doubt they look upon that as certain  i suppose that you are right brooke well i do hope that the general will let us go up to see the fun  what even if it is raining  of course the other said indignantly what does one care for rain when there is something to do why i believe that if it was coming down in a sheet and the men had to wade through the swamps waist deep they would all march in the highest spirits if there was the chance of a fight with the burmans at the end of the day  however i am afraid that there is no chance of our getting off unless the chief goes himself there may be attacks in other places as you say it is not likely but it is possible therefore of course we should have to be at hand to carry orders of course if he takes his post at the pagoda it will be all right though the betting is that we shall have to gallop off just at the most interesting moment  presently the two officers left the general the latters bell rang and stanley went in  you saw the colonel mr brooke  yes sir and he begged me to say that he was extremely glad to get the news and much obliged to you for sending it so promptly  there is no occasion for you and mr tollemache to stay here any longer now but at five oclock i shall ride out to the pagoda at any rate should i want you before then i shall know where to send for you  this was the general order for in the afternoon there was when things were quiet a hush for two or three hours the work of the aidesdecamp was indeed generally very light for as there were no movements of troops no useless parades and very few military orders to be carried they had a great deal of time on their hands and usually took it by turns to be on duty for the day the one off duty being free to pay visits to acquaintances in the various camps or on board ship during the rainy season however very few officers or men went beyond shelter unless obliged to do so and from two till four or five no small proportion passed the time in sleep  stanley had intended to pay a visit to the larne as captain marryat who had dined at the staff mess on the previous evening had invited him to go on board whenever it might be convenient to him the larne had performed good service in the operations against the stockades and her boats had been particularly active and successful her captain was one of the most popular as well as one of the most energetic officers in the service and was to become as popular with future generations as the brightest of all writers of sea stories  however the day was not favourable for an excursion on the water stanley therefore went back to his room where divesting himself of his jacket he sat down at the open window and read up a batch of the last newspapers from england that had been lent him by colonel adair  at five oclock meinik came in to say that his horse was at the generals door stanley hastily put on his jacket and cloak and sallied out the general came down in a few minutes followed by tollemache and mounting they rode to the pagoda  here sir archibald had a talk with the colonel of the 89th and the officer commanding the battery of the madras artillery both were of opinion that their force was amply sufficient to resist any attack the only approach to it from the forest was a long road between two swamps which a short distance away had become lakes since the wet weather set in  had they taken us by surprise the colonel said some of them might have got across before we were quite ready for them and might have given us some trouble but as we shall be prepared i dont think that any of them will reach the foot of this hill and if they did none of them would reach this terrace if an attack were made from the other side it would of course be a good deal more serious as the ground is firm and they could attack all along the foot of the hill but as they cannot get there until they have defeated the rest of the army i consider that even without the assistance of the guns we could hold the hill with musket and bayonet against any force that they are likely to bring against us  very well then i shall not reinforce you colonel of course we shall keep a considerable number of troops under arms in case they should attack all along the line at the same time that they make their principal effort here  i rather hope that the rain will keep on until this affair is over  the colonel looked surprised  i am much more afraid the general went on of fire in the town than i am of an attack without the number of natives there is constantly increasing no doubt the greater number of those who come in are natives of the place who have managed since we cleared out their war galleys from some of the creeks and channels to escape from the authorities and to make their way in either on foot or in fishermens boats but some of them may be sent in as spies or to do us harm i have been having a long talk over it with colonel adair this afternoon and he quite agrees with me that we must reckon on the probability of an attempt to fire the town it would be a terrible blow to us if they succeeded for the loss of our stores would completely cripple us they would naturally choose the occasion of an attack upon our lines for the attempt for in the first place most of the troops will be under arms and drawn up outside the town and in the second place the sight of the place on fire would cause much confusion would inspirit our assailants and necessitate a considerable force being withdrawn from the field to fight the fire  if the rains continue we need feel no uneasiness whatever for there would be no getting anything to burn whereas in dry weather a man with a torch might light the thatch as fast as he could run along and a whole street would be in a blaze in two or three minutes and if a wind happened to be blowing it might make a sweep of the whole place in spite of all our efforts  i see that sir i own that i had never given it a thought before  i shall come up here colonel unless we obtain sure news before the time arrives that the attack is going to be a general one indeed it is in any case the best place to post myself for i can see over the whole country and send orders to any point where the enemy may be making progress or where our men can advance with advantage the line of fire flashes will be as good a guide at night as the smoke by day  i will get a cot rigged up for you general as we dont know which night it is to be  thank you yes i may just as well turn in all standing as the sailors say and get a few hours sleep for in this climate one cannot keep at it night and day as we had to do in spain  the two aidesdecamp were kept in suspense as to what the generals intentions were and it was not until the morning of tuesday that he said to them  i am going up to the pagoda this evening mr tollemache and you had better therefore put some provisions and a bottle of brandy into your holsters  at nine in the evening they rode off the rain had ceased the moon was shining through the clouds  it will be down by twelve oclock tollemache said i should think most likely they will wait for that they will think that we shall not be able to take aim at them in the darkness and that they will manage to get to the foot of the hill without loss  when they reached the platform in front of the pagoda their syces took their horses meinik had begged stanley to let him take his grooms place on this occasion and laying aside the dress he ordinarily wore assumed the light attire of an indian syce and had run behind the horses with the others he had a strong desire to see the fighting but his principal motive in asking to be allowed to accompany stanley was that although greatly impressed with what he had seen of the drill and discipline of the white and native regiments he could not shake off his faith in the invulnerables and had a conviction that the pagoda would be captured and therefore wished to be at hand to bring up stanleys horse at the critical moment and to aid him to escape from the assailants  fires were burning as usual at several points on the terrace two companies were under arms and were standing well back from the edge of the platform so as to be out of sight of those in the forest the rest of the men were sitting round the fires their muskets were piled in lines hard by  when he alighted the general proceeded to the battery  have you everything in readiness major he asked the officer in command  yes sir the guns are all loaded with grape and as it will be very dark when the moon has set i have pegged a white tape along just under each gun so that they can be trained upon the causeway however dark it may be  that is a very good idea the general said there is nothing more difficult than laying guns accurately in the dark  the colonel now arrived a soldier having brought the news to him as soon as the general reached the platform  i see that you are well prepared to give them a hot reception colonel  i hope so sir i have a strong patrol out beyond the causeway my orders are that they are to resist strongly for a minute or two so as to give us time to have the whole of our force in readiness here then they are to retreat at the double to the foot of the hill and then to open fire again so that we may know that they are out of the way and that we can begin when we like we have been making some port fires this afternoon and i have a dozen men halfway down the hill and directly the outposts are safely across they are to light the port fires which will enable us to take aim these white tapes will be guide enough for the artillery but my men would make very poor shooting if they could not make out the muzzles of their guns anyhow i dont think that it is likely that the enemy will get across the causeway however numerous they may be  i dont think they will colonel certainly so far they have shown themselves contemptible in attack and have never made a successful stand even for a minute when we once entered their stockades though they defend them pluckily enough until we have once got a footing inside  still these fellows ought to fight well tonight for if they are beaten it will be a death blow to their reputation among their countrymen besides many of them do believe in the power they claim and as we have found before now in india fanatics are always formidable  after taking a look round with the colonel the general accompanied him to his quarters while the two aidesdecamp remained on the terrace chatting with the officers and then after a time went with some of them to the mess tent where they sat smoking and talking until midnight when all went out  the troops were formed up under arms and all listened impatiently for something that would show that the longdelayed assault would take place that night at halfpast twelve there was the sound of a shot which sent an electrical thrill through the troops it was followed almost immediately by others the troops were at once marched forward to the edge of the platform a babel of wild shouts went up at the sound of the first shots followed by a burst of firing  the two aidesdecamp had taken their places close to the general who was standing in the gap between the infantry and the guns and was looking intently through his night glasses at the forest  they are in a dense mass he said i cannot see whether they are in any regular order but they are certainly packed a great deal closer than i have ever before seen them those in front have got lanterns they are coming along fast  as yet the enemy were half a mile away but the lanterns and the flash of their guns showed their exact position while the fire of the outposts was kept up steadily as the latter fell back along the causeway the interval between the two forces decreased and then the fire of the outposts ceased as in accordance with their orders they broke into the double  illustration the burmese make a great effort to capture pagoda hill  the uproar of the advancing crowd was prodigious every man was yelling at the top of his voice imprecations upon the defenders of the pagoda who were standing in absolute silence waiting eagerly for the word of command suddenly the firing broke out again at the foot of the hill and immediately a bright light shot up from its face  the edge of the dense mass of burmese was now but some fifty yards from the wall that surrounded the foot of the hill and the causeway behind was occupied by a solid mass of men then came the sharp order to the artillerymen and gun after gun poured its charge of grape into the crowd while at the same moment the infantry began to fire by companies in steady volleys for an instant the din of the assailants was silenced then their shouts rose again and after a moments hesitation they continued their advance  but not for long none but the most disciplined soldiers could have advanced under that storm of grape and bullets and in ten minutes they fled in wild confusion leaving the causeway thickly covered with the dead again and again the british cheers rose loud and triumphant then the infantry were told to fall out but the guns continued their fire until the fugitives were well in the forest  between the shots the general listened attentively and examined the country towards the town through his glasses  everything is quiet he said it is probable that if those fellows had carried the hill they would have made a signal and there might have been a general attack as it is the affair is over for the night and the invulnerables will have some difficulty in accounting for their failure and loss  now gentlemen we may as well have up the horses and ride back we hardly expected to get away as soon as this  well meinik what do you think of your invulnerables now stanley said as the burman after picketing his horse came up to his room to see if he wanted anything before lying down on his bed in the passage  i dont know the burman replied gravely they may be holy men and proof perhaps against native weapons but they are no good against your cannon and muskets i understand now how it is that you beat us so easily your men all stood quiet and in order one only heard the voices of the officers and the crash as they fired together  then your guns are terrible i have seen ours firing but though our pieces are smaller than yours your men fire five shots to our one i stood by while they were loading it was wonderful nobody talked and nobody gave orders each man knew what he had to doone did something and directly another did something and almost before the smoke of the last shot was out of the gun it was ready to be fired again  it is clear to me that we have not learnt how to fight and that your way of having only a few men well taught and knowing exactly what they have to do is better than ours of having great numbers and letting everyone fight as he pleases it is bad every way the brave men get to the front and are killed and then the others run away  you were right we shall never turn you out of rangoon till bandoola comes he has all our best troops with him and he has never been beaten all the troops know him and will fight for him as they will not fight for these princeswho know nothing of war and are chosen only because they are the kings brothers when he comes you will see  no doubt we shall meinik and you will see that although they may make a better fight of it than they have done tonight it will be just the same in the end  for the next two months the time passed slowly no attacks were made by the enemy after the defeat of the assault upon the pagoda peasants and deserters who came in reported that there was profound depression among the burmese troops great numbers had left the colours and there was no talk of another attack  the troops being therefore relieved of much of their arduous night duty the english took the offensive the stockades on the dalla river and those upon the panlang branchthe principal passage into the main stream of the irrawaddywere attacked and carried the enemy suffering heavily and many pieces of artillery being captured  the rains continued almost unceasingly and the troops suffered terribly in health scarce three thousand remained fit for duty and the greater portion of these were so emaciated and exhausted by the effects of the climate that they were altogether unfit for active operations  three weeks after the fight at the pagoda a vessel came up the river with a letter from the officer in command of the troops assembled to bar the advance of bandoola against chittagong saying that the burmese army had mysteriously disappeared it had gone off at night so quietly and silently that our outposts which were but a short distance from it heard no sign or movement whatever the burmese had taken with them their sick tents and stores and nothing but a large quantity of grain had been found in their deserted stockades  the news was received with satisfaction by the troops there was little doubt that the court of avafinding that their generals had all failed in making the slightest impression upon our lines and had lost vast numbers of menhad at last turned to the leader who had conquered province after province for it and had sent him orders to march with his whole army to bring the struggle to a close the soldiers rejoiced at the thought that they were at last to meet a real burmese army hitherto they had generally stood on the defensive and had to fight the climate rather than the foe and it seemed to them that the campaign was likely to be interminable  the march of the burmese from ramoo to sembeughewn the nearest point of the river to the former town must have been a terrible one the distance was over two hundred miles the rains were ceaseless and the country covered with jungles and marshes and intersected by rivers no other army could have accomplished such a feat the burmans however accustomed to the unhealthy climate lightly clad and carrying no weight save their arms and sixteen days supply of rice passed rapidly over it  every man was accustomed to the use of an axe and to the formation of rafts and in an incredibly short time rivers were crossed deep swamps traversed on roads made by closelypacked faggots and but a few days after hearing that bandoola had started the general learned from peasants that the news had come down that he and a portion of his army had arrived at sembeughewn  almost at the same time other parties who travelled down along the coast reached donabew a town on the irrawaddy some forty miles in direct line from rangoon this had been named as the rendezvous of the new army and to this a considerable proportion of bandoolas force made their way direct from ramoo it being the custom of the burmese to move when on a march through a country where no opposition was to be looked for in separate detachments each under its own leader choosing its own way and making for a general rendezvous travelling in this manner they performed the journey far more rapidly than they could have done moving in one body and could better find shelter and food  other forces from prome tannoo and other quarters were known to be marching towards donabew it was soon reported that the dejected forces around rangoon had gained courage and confidence at the news that bandoola and his army were coming to their aid and that the deserters were returning in large numbers from their villages the british sick were sent away in the shipping to mergy and tavoy two coast towns of which we had taken possession and both of which were healthily situated  the change had a marvellous effect and men who would have speedily succumbed to the poisonous exhalations of the swamps round rangoon rapidly regained their strength in their new quarters    chapter 9 victories   in the meantime negotiations had been going on with siam between which state and burma there was the bitterest enmity it had been thought that siam would have willingly grasped the opportunity to revenge itself for the many losses of territory that it had suffered at the hands of burma this there was no doubt that it would have been glad to do but our occupation of several points on the coast of tenasserim roused the fears of siam and inclined it to the belief that we might prove an even more dangerous neighbour than burma  the court of ava had on its part also sent urgent messages to the king of siamwhen misfortunes had to some extent lowered its pridecalling upon him to make common cause with burma and to join it in repelling an enemy who would doubtless be as dangerous to him as to burma  siam however determined to steer a middle course an army was assembled in readiness for any contingency but siam believed as little as burma itself that the british could possibly be victorious over that power and feared its vengeance if she were to ally herself with us while upon the other hand siam had a long sea coast and feared the injury our fleet might inflict upon it were it to join burma the king therefore gave both powers an assurance of his friendship and marched his army down to the frontier of the province of martaban which bordered on the great salween river on the tenasserim coast and lay some two hundred miles from rangoon across the gulf of martaban  the intentions of the king being so doubtful the advance of the siamese army in this direction could not be regarded with indifference by the british the town of martaban was the centre of the burmese military power in tenasserim and the advance towards it of the siamese army would place it in direct communication with that of burma on the 13th of october therefore a force consisting of a wing of the 41st regiment and the 3rd madras infantry sailed from rangoon against the town the expedition was delayed by light winds and when it arrived at the mouth of the river found that every preparation had been made for an obstinate defence they learned from a peasant that strong works had been erected on every eminence round the town and that the road from the coast had been cut and stockaded  approach by this route was impossible for there were twenty miles of country to be traversed and much of this was under water from the inundations it was therefore determined to go up the river although this was so shallow and full of shoals that the navigation was extremely difficult at last after great labourincurred by the ships constantly getting ashorethey succeeded in making their way up to martaban and anchored off the town  a heavy cannonade was carried on for some time between the ships and the enemys works then the troops were embarked in boats which rowed for the shore under a very heavy fire from the enemy as soon as they landed and advanced to attack the stockades the burmese lost heart and hastily retreated while the inhabitants received the troops as they entered with the warmest welcomefor they were for the most part natives of pegu and still entertained a deep hatred for the burmese because of the long oppression that they had suffered at their hands  throughout the rest of tenasserim however and indeed throughout the whole country traversed by the troops later on the inhabitants appeared to have entirely forgotten their ancient nationality and the conquest of their country by the burmans and to have become completely absorbed by them throughout the whole time that we occupied martaban the people gave no trouble whatever and indeed offered to raise a force for service with us if we wished it  at the end of october the rain ceasedto the intense delight of the troopsand the cold season set in november was however an exceptionally deadly monththe occasional days of fine weather drawing up the exhalations from the swampsand the number of deaths was greater than they had been at any previous time there was too no prospect of a forward movement at present the expedition had come unprovided with boats or other means of transport making sure that an abundant supply would be obtained in a country where the whole trade was carried on by the rivers the promptness with which the native authorities had on the first appearance of the fleet sent every boat away had disappointed this anticipation and although the opening of some of the other rivers had enabled the local fishermen to bring their boats to rangoon where fish were eagerly purchased the british troops were still up to the end of november without the means of sending a hundred men up the river save in the boats of the fleet  the indian authoritiesbelieving that when the burmese found themselves impotent to turn us out of rangoon the court of ava would be glad to negotiatehad not until the autumn was drawing to a close thought of making any preparations to supply the army with water carriage they now however began to bestir themselves five hundred boatmen were sent from chittagong bringing many boats down with them and building others at rangoon transports with draft cattle sailed from bengal and a considerable reinforcement of troops was on its way to join at the end of decemberfor all the natives agreed that no movement could be made by land until the end of january  in november even bandoolas army was obliged to make its approach by water early in that month it was learned that the burmese general had given orders for the advance and preparations were at once begun to meet what none doubted would be a very serious attack the reinforcements had not yet arrived and the greatly diminished force was far too small for the length of the line that had to be defended redoubts were therefore thrown up pagodas and other buildings were fortified and two complete lines of works constructed from the great pagoda to the city one facing east and the other west  the post at kemmendine was strengthened and was supported by h m sloop sophie a companys cruiser and a strong division of gunboats the retention of this post was of great importance as it barred the river approach to rangoon and prevented the enemy sending down a huge fleet of war galleys and fire rafts to attack the town and set fire to the merchant shipping lying off it  in the last week of november smoke was seen to rise from many points in the forest many fugitives came in from their villages and reported that bandoolas army were all on their way down the river and by the end of the month some sixty thousand men with a large train of artillery and a body of cavalry were assembled round our position of this force thirty thousand were armed with muskets they had with them too a great number of jingals these little guns carried ball of from six to twelve ounces and were mounted on a light carriage which two men could wheel with ease the cannon were carried to the scene of action on elephants the cavalry were seven hundred strong drawn from the borders of manipur  the rest of the army were armed with swords and spears and carried implements for stockading and entrenching the force was accompanied by a number of astrologers and by the invulnerableswho had doubtless satisfactorily explained their failure to capture the pagoda  a great semicircle of light smoke rising from the trees showed that the position taken up by bandoola extended from the river above kemmendine to the neighbourhood of rangoon on the night of the 31st the troops at the pagoda heard a loud and continuous stir in the forest it gradually approached and by morning great masses of troops had gathered at the edge of the jungle within musket shot of the post the garrison there were drawn up in readiness to repel a sudden rush but just as the sun rose a din made by thousands of men engaged in cutting down the trees began and it was evident that the burmese were going to adopt their usual plan of entrenching themselves behind stockades  during the time that had elapsed between the repulse of the invulnerables and the arrival of bandoolas army stanleys work was light and the life dull and monotonous an hour was spent every morning in examining the fugitives who had by the retreat of the burmese been enabled to make their way back to the town and of women who had escaped from the vigilance of the burmese police and had come in from the villages where they had been held as hostages for their husbands once or twice a week he went off with the general to the hospital ship to inquire into the state of the sick and to pay a visit to the long line of cots along the main and lower deck almost every day he rode in spite of the weather to one or other of the regimental camps and soon came to know most of the officers of the force his previous experience on the rivers had done much to acclimatise him and his health continued good  on the evening of the 30th he had at the generals order ridden up to the pagoda it was considered likely that the attack would be delivered there in the first place and at three oclock in the morning when it became evident that a large body of men were approaching through the forest he galloped back to rangoon with the news and at five rode out again with sir a campbell  among the garrison there was much disappointment when the sound of wood chopping announced that the burmese did not intend to attack but the general who had been watching the edge of the jungle through his glasses lowered them and put them into their case with an expression of satisfaction  i dont want them to attack colonel he said if they do and we beat them off we are no nearer the end than before that sort of thing might be carried on for months as long in fact as there remains a man to bring up what we want is to inflict such a heavy blow upon them that even the court at ava may become convinced that they cannot hope to drive us out of rangoon in which case they may consent to negotiate and we may bring the war to an end  heaven knows that we have suffered enough loss at present and i dont want to have to undertake such a difficult operation as an advance against ava i am glad to see that they have begun to construct stockades i do not intend to interfere until they have completely finished their work and gained sufficient confidence to make a general attack on us then we shall be able to give them a heavy lesson  ah there they are at work  as he spoke a roar of musketry and artillery broke out suddenly from kemmendine and all eyes were turned in that direction the spot was two miles distant but the forest shut out alike the view of the river and of the works held by us the exact position however was indicated by the masts of the two war vessels rising above the trees  soon great wreaths of heavy white smoke rose above the forest in and around kemmendine shutting out all view the fire continued without abatement and it was evident that the attack was a hot and determined one confident as all felt that the little fort would be able to defend itself successfully the great smoke clouds were watched with some feeling of anxiety for the garrison was after all but a handful in momentary intervals of the firing the yells and shouts of the natives could be distinctly heard and once or twice after a heavy broadside from the ships of war the cheers of the british sailors could be plainly recognized  after two hours fighting the din gradually ceased the clouds of smoke rolled away and the masts of the ships became visible and the garrison of the pagoda raised three hearty cheers to tell the defenders that their successful defence had been watched and welcomed  presently some heavy columns of the enemy issued from the forest on the other side of the river and marched across the plain to dalla which faced rangoon they moved with great regularity and order led by their chiefs on horseback their gilded umbrellas glittering in the rays of the sun on reaching the bank of the river opposite rangoon they began entrenching themselves and throwing up stockades and batteries with the evident intention of opening fire on the shipping soon afterwards large bodies of men issued from the forest facing the pagoda and marching along a slight ridge that extended from that point to the creek below rangoon took up their position there and began entrenching themselves all along the line thus the british position was now completely surrounded there was however no doubt that the main body of the enemy was still facing the pagoda  we must see what they are doing the general said this is too important a point for us to allow them to erect a strongly fortified position close at hand  accordingly tollemache was sent down with an order to the 18th madras infantrysupported by a detachment of the 13th regiment under major saleto advance against the enemy in the jungle the movements of this force were eagerly watched from the terrace of the pagoda at a rapid pace they crossed the intervening ground and a rattle of musketry broke out from the jungle as they approached the british made no response but charged with a cheer and were soon lost to sight in the trees their regular volleys could be heard at short intervals above the scattered rattle of the burmese musketeers and their cheers frequently rose loud and triumphant in half an hour the red line emerged again from the jungle having destroyed the stockades the burmese had erected captured several guns a quantity of muskets and entrenching tools thrown away by the burmese and killed a large number of the enemy  during the day the enemy made repeated efforts to send fire rafts down the river from above kemmendine these rafts were constructed of bamboos upon which were placed great numbers of earthenware pots filled with petroleum these rafts were skilfully constructed and made in sections so that when they drifted against an anchor chain they would dividethose on each side swinging round so as to envelop the ship on both sides with fire  the sailors from the sloops and gunboats rowed up to meet the rafts and although a heavy fire was kept up by the enemy from the jungles lining the banks they succeeded in towing most of them safely to shore while the rest grounded on a projecting spit off kemmendine  so diligently did the burmese work at all points throughout the day that by the afternoon their whole line of circumvallation was covered with earthworks behind which they lay entirely hidden from sight  if they could fight as well as they dig and build stockades sir a campbell remarked they would be one of the most formidable enemies in the world no european army ever accomplished the work of entrenching themselves so speedily as they have done their arrangements have been admirable everything has been done without confusion and each body has taken up the position allotted to it as is evident by the fact that there is no gap in their lines  as to bandoolas tactics i cannot say so much for them in the first place he has divided his force into two parts separated by a river and incapable of helping each other in the next place great as are his numbers his lines are far too extended  well we will let them go on for a time and then show them the mistake that they have committed  major sales reports of the entrenchments were that they consisted of a long line of holes each capable of containing two men the earth was dug out on one side so as to form a sort of cave in this was a bed of straw or brushwood on which one man could sleep while the other watched each hole contained a sufficient supply of rice water and even fuel for its inmates one line of these holes had been completed and another was being dug a short distance in advance  the burmese do not relieve their men in the trenches those who occupy the line first made remain there fresh men dig and occupy the next line and so the advance is continued until close to the work to be attacked the system has the great advantage that a shell falling into one of these holes only kills its two occupants instead of destroying many as it might do if it fell in a continuous trench  in the afternoon the general returned to rangoon leaving stanley at the pagoda with orders to ride down should there be any change of importance in the evening a considerable force of burmese issued from the jungle and prepared to entrench themselves near the northeast angle of the pagoda hill major piper therefore took two companies of the 38th and descending the hill drove the burmese in confusion back to the jungle  in the morning it was found that the enemy had entrenched themselves upon some high and open ground within musket shot of the north gate of the pagoda it was separated from the gate by a large tank but as their jingals and musketry were able from the point they occupied to sweep the plateau and the huts occupied by the troops a party of the 38th and the 28th madras infantry went out and drove them off as soon however as our troops fell back the burmese reoccupied the position and for the next few days a constant skirmishing went on at this point while an artillery fire was maintained by the assailants and defenders along the whole line down to rangoon and the enemys batteries at dalla kept up an incessant fire on the shipping kemmendine was attacked time after time and many attempts made to launch fire rafts down the river  the work was very harassing for the troops night and day they were expecting an attack in force and there was a general feeling of delight when on the evening of the 4th orders were issued for a general movement against the enemy  the latter had by this time brought the greater portion of their guns up from the jungle and placed them in their entrenchments and it was therefore in the power of the british to strike a heavy blow a division of the flotilla of gunboats was ordered up the creek by the town these opened a heavy fire upon the enemys flank thus attracting their attention to that point and after the cannonade had continued for some little time the two columns of attackthe one eight hundred strong under major sale the other five hundred under major walker of the madras armyissued out the latter was to attack the enemy facing the town the former to force his way through the centre of their position he had with him a troop of horse that had landed only the previous day  major walkers force was the first to encounter the enemy their resistance was for a time obstinate major walker and several other officers fell in the attack on the first line of entrenchments but the soldiers carried it at the point of the bayonet and as the enemy broke and retreated followed them so hotly that the works in the rear fell into their hands with but slight opposition  major sales column now began its attack on the enemys centre here the resistance was more feeble and bursting through the enemys lines the british drove them before them in headlong flight then turning they swept along the line of entrenchments carrying all before them until they effected a junction with the other column which was advancing to meet them they then drove the burmese from every part of their works into the jungle leaving the ground behind them covered with dead and wounded  except at the point first attacked by major walker the resistance of the burmese was very feeble and the british loss inconsiderable and a large number of guns entrenching tools and muskets fell into the hands of the victors the next day bandoola rallied the troops that had been driven from the plain and gathered the greatest part of his force in the forest round the pagoda where they continued to push forward their works with unabated energy  the british had a day of rest given them and on the 7th prepared to attack the enemy at this point four columns of attack were formed composed of detachments drawn from all the corps of the army in the morning a heavy cannonade was opened upon the jungle the artillery being assisted by several heavy guns which had with great labour been brought up by the sailors from the ships to the pagoda the enemy returned it with a steady fire of light artillery jingals and musketry  while the firing was still going on the four columns were already in motion one had entered the jungle on the enemys left and another on the right one of the central columns advanced from the foot of the pagoda hill while the 38th regiment descended the stairs from the north gate and advanced one wing on each side of the tank against the enemys entrenchments on the high ground as the four columns approached the enemy our artillery fire ceased  the burmese appeared for a moment bewildered at the sight of their foes advancing against them from so many directions but they soon opened a very heavy fire upon the assailants and kept it up with undiminished steadiness until our troops advancing at the charge dashed into their entrenchments and drove them headlong before them into the thick forest behindwhere pursuit which would at any time have been difficult was now impossible the troops exhausted by their seven days and nights watching being wholly incapable of following their active and lightlyarmed enemies  there now remained but the force at dalla to cope with and in the evening a force composed of the 89th and 43rd madras infantry under colonel parlby embarked in boats the night was dark and the troops crossed unobserved the alarm was not given until the british actually entered the entrenchments and opened fire upon the enemy who were sitting unsuspicious of danger round their fires scarcely any opposition was encountered and the whole of the works with the guns and the stores were soon in our hands while the enemy were flying towards the forest  in the actions during these three days the burmese lost some 5000 men 240 pieces of artillery of every kind and a great number of muskets and vast supplies of ammunition while the british had but 50 killed and 300 wounded great numbers of bandoolas men never rejoined the army and the whole force was dispersed through the country  bandoola himself was retiring towards donabew with but a remnant of his army when he met considerable reinforcements on their way to join him during his operations he had left a reserve corps at the village of kokein four miles from the pagoda and these had been busily entrenching the position which commanded the road leading from rangoon to donabew the ground was elevated and on his arrival there bandoola set his troopsnow some 25000 in numberto aid in the work in a marvellously short time the heights were completely stockaded with trunks of trees and with a broad deep ditch in front beyond this were lines of felled trees their heads pointing outwards and each branch sharpenedforming a very formidable abattisand believing this to be impregnable bandoola awaited the attack of the british  as soon as his army had been dispersed great numbers of deserters and of the inhabitants of the villages poured into rangoon with the deserters were mingled a good many of the troops sent in by bandoola himself with instructions to fire the town in order to lull the suspicions of the british he caused a report to be spread that an imperial commissioner from the court of ava would arrive in the course of a few days to treat for terms of peace  the general however determined to attack bandoola before the commissioner could arrive as it was evident that better terms could be obtained after the total dispersion of the burmese than if their famous general remained with 25000 men in a formidable position close at hand he was uneasy at the presence of so large a number of natives in the town and the precautions that had been taken against fire some time before were now redoubled were one to break out not only might the whole of the stores collected for the advance of the army be destroyed but if bandoola had his force gathered in readiness at the edge of the jungle he might take advantage of the confusion that would be caused by the fire and rush forward to the attack of the town  numbers of troops and of sailors from the fleet patrolled the streets in every direction at night but in spite of their efforts a week after the retreat of bandoola the dreaded cry of fire was raised at a dozen points on the windward side of the town fires had been lighted by incendiaries and as there was a brisk wind blowing the danger was extreme the drums beat to arms along the whole of the british lines orders had already been issued as to what was to be done in such an emergency and while a portion of the troops lined the trenches the rest were marched at once to the town and formed up between it and the jungle to repel any attack that might be made there leaving the troops quartered in the town and the sailors of the fleet to battle with the flames  for a time it seemed as if the whole place would be swept away but by levelling lines of huts and beating out the flames at the barrier so formed their progress was at length checked but not until more than half the town had been destroyed fortunately this was the half farthest from the river andwith the exception of the commissariat stores for the supply of the troops of the madras presidencythe buildings containing the food ammunition and necessaries for the army escaped unharmed  what had happened once might however happen again in spite of all precautions the general therefore determined to attack bandoola at once as were his force once scattered the motive for these incendiary fires would cease to operate  the difficulties were formidable one or two light field pieces could at the most be taken with the column they would have to march by a narrow and winding footpath through a thick forest exposed at any moment to a desperate attack by the enemy moreover it would be necessary to leave a strong force for the defence of rangoon as bandoola would be sure to learn from his spies of the intended movement and having with him men intimately acquainted with every forest track could make a rush down upon the town during the absence of so many of its defenders  the general felt it imperative however to attack without delay and early on the morning of the 15th he moved out with a force of 1500 men against kokein they marched without molestation through the forest and on reaching its confines could see the truly formidable nature of the works that they were to attack the moment they issued from the forest a dropping fire was opened upon them by parties of the enemy in flank and rear and no time was lost in preparing for the assault  the 13th light infantry and the 18th madras with 60 cavalry under brigadier general cotton were ordered to move round the stockade and assault it on the left rear while the rest of the troops some 800 strong with 100 cavalry under the general himself were to attack in front the enemys works consisted of a central entrenchment connected with two large entrenched stockades on its flank but somewhat advanced in front of it  as soon as the force under general cotton had gained its position in the rear of the enemy a gun was fired and the whole force moved forward to the assault the burmans regarded the attack by so insignificant a force upon their works with such contempt that they did not for some time fire a shot but continued chanting a war song swaying themselves to its cadence stamping and beating time with their hands on their breasts  this delay proved fatal to them when they opened fire their assailants were already close to the ditch and leaping down into this were sheltered from the fire of the defenders scaling ladders were speedily placed and the troops running up them leaped down into the entrenchment astounded at this sudden entry into the works they had deemed impregnable the burmese hesitated and the assailants being joined by their comrades from behind rushed impetuously upon the enemy  the column in the rear had greater difficultyfor they had several strong stockades to carry before they reached the central workand lost four officers and eight men killed and fortynine officers and men wounded in the 13th regiment alone fifteen minutes after the first shot was fired the whole of the works were in our possession and the burmese who gathered in a confused mass had been decimated by our volleys they were now in full flight many being cut down by the cavalry before they reached the shelter of the woods the british troops marched back to rangoon while the burmese retreated to donabew leaving strong posts on the two rivers leading in that direction  their retirement left it free to the country people to return to rangoon and very large numbers came in including very many of the villagers who had been forced to fight against us all had alike suffered from famine and hardship even the women had been compelled to labour in the work of stockading and the sufferings of all had been terrible the work of rebuilding the town began at once and the wooden huts sprang up with great rapidity markets were opened and in a short time supplies of fish fruit game and vegetables poured in sufficient not only for the native population but to effect a most welcome change in the diet of the troops  as most of the natives were accustomed to the construction and management of boats the work of preparing the flotilla by which the troops were to proceed up the rivers went on rapidly and numbers of men were hired as servants and drivers for the commissariatwith which the force was very insufficiently supplied as the natives of india of that class for the most part refused on account of their caste prejudices to engage themselves for service across the sea reinforcements arrived and rangoon which but six weeks before presented a miserable and deserted appearance was towards the beginning of january a cheerful and bustling town  preparations were being made in other quarters to assume the offensive some 3000 men were driving the burmese out of assam and a force 7000 strong was marching from sylhet to expel them from cachar and capture manipur while 11000 men were assembled at chittagong and were advancing into aracan with the intention of driving the burmese from that provinceand they meant if possible to cross the mountains and effect a junction with sir archibald campbells force the first part of the operations were conducted with complete success and aracan wrested from burma but it was found impossible to perform the terrible journey across mountain and swamp or to afford any aid to the main expedition    chapter 10 the advance   but while the preparations for the advance were being made the generals aidesdecamp had been kept at work from morning until night there were constant communications between the military and naval authorities for the expedition was to be a mixed one transports were daily arriving with troops and stores innumerable matters connected with the organization both of the land and water transport required to be arranged and the general himself was indefatigable in superintending every detail of the work it had been settled that the advance could not take place until the second week in february as the roads would be impassable until that time and the 11th was fixed for the commencement of operations  upon the day after his arrival at rangoon stanley had written a letter to his uncle giving him a brief account of his adventures and stating that he had been appointed one of the generals aidesdecamp he said that he should of course be guided by his uncles wishes but that now that he had entered on the campaign as an officer he should certainly like to remain till the end when he would at once resign his commission and rejoin him  he sent this to his uncles agent at calcutta but received no answer until the end of december after expressing his delight at hearing that stanley had not as he had supposed been killed at ramoo but was now safe and well in the british camp he went on  i only received your letter this morning for i have been moving about from point to point and owing to the falling off of trade had no occasion to go to calcutta until now and was indeed astounded at finding your letter lying for me here as they had not forwarded it having no idea where i was and knowing that the chance of any letter sent on reaching me was extremely small  by all means lad stop where you are trade is improving again for now that bandoolas army has marched away from ramoo the scare among the natives has pretty well subsided still i can manage very well without you and it will certainly be a great advantage to you to serve for a year in the army and to have been one of campbells aidesdecamp will be a feather in your cap and will give you a good position at all the military stations  i am very glad now that i abstained from writing to your mother after the battle at ramoo i thought it over and over and concluded that it was just as well to leave the matter alone for a time not that i had the slightest idea or even a hope that you were alive but because i thought that the cessation of letters from you would to some extent prepare her mind for the blow when it came it would be very improbable that she would see the gazette with the list of killed and wounded at ramoo and even if she did so she would not associate the death of ensign brooke in any way with you when we have been trading up country there have been once or twice no means of sending off a letter for a couple of months and therefore she could not have begun to feel seriously anxious about you before she received your letter from rangoon  everyone says that you will not be able to advance until february so that no doubt this letter will reach you long before you leave i hear the losses have been very heavy from fever but i am not anxious about you on that score for i think that you are thoroughly acclimatised i am trying to get a contract for the supply of a couple of thousand bullocks for the use of the army and as i know all the country so well from chittagong to sylhet and can buy below indian prices i think that i shall not only get the contract but make a very good thing of it and it may lead to other matters  after this stanley was hardly surprised when in the last week of january his uncle walked into his quarters after the first pleasure of meeting was over stanley said  i suppose you have got the contract uncle  i have lad i have come down from ramgur with six dhows packed full i have brought a thousand head down and directly i land them am going back for the remainder which will be ready for me by the time i get there  i have got hold of an uncommonly good fellow he was established as a small trader at chittagong his business was ruined there and he was glad to accept my offer of a berth and he has turned out a very energetic and pushing fellow he will come down with the next consignment  i myself am going to work my way up along the edge of the tipperah forest and shall pick up another thousand head by the time that i get to the goomtee and shall send them by water up to sylhet and then go up by land picking up more on the way i have a contract for five thousand to be sent in a thousand a month for the force that is to move against manipur while johnson is to send another two thousand down here so you see for the present the store business can wait it is a good line that i have got into i shall make a big profit out of it and have hopes that it will be to some extent permanent for i can get the cattle so cheap in the interior on the rivers we know that i can ship them to calcutta at lower terms than they can buy them in india and i was as much as told that if i carried out my present contracts satisfactorily i should get the supply of the troops there of course that would not be a very great thing of itself but as i could work it without trouble in connection with my own business it would make a handsome addition to the profits  but how about money uncle  that is all right lad i had no difficulty whatever in getting an advance at calcutta on the strength of my contract and upon the guarantee of my agents so that i am all right in that respect  i asked uncle because i can let you have eighteen hundred pounds if you want them  tom pearson looked at him in astonishment  why what on earth have you been doingrobbing the treasury of the king of ava  no uncle i had a bag of gems given me by some burmese bandits when i got down here i took a few of them to a merchant he advanced fifteen hundred rupees on them and sent them to burragee the jeweller at madras and six weeks afterwards he paid me another three thousand five hundred i sent up another batch and last week i got an order from the jewellers for fifteen hundred pounds so that i have more than eighteen hundred in hand now and i dont think that i have sent more than a third of the gems away  well that is a piece of luck stanley why on earth did the brigands give you the gems  well uncle they are things that from what they told me there is great difficulty and risk in trying to dispose of they are a royal monopoly and nobody dare buy them or if they do will give next to nothing for them because of the risk of the transaction and because they know that the vendors are in a fix and must sell besides there is a strong chance of their handing over anyone who offers such things to the authorities that was one reason why they gave them to me then too they had made a good haul of merchandise which was to them a great deal more valuable as there was no difficulty in disposing of it lastly they had taken a fancy to me because i saved one of their comrades livesthe man who showed you up here  well lad you shall tell me all about it this evening i must be going down to the commissariat yard to arrange the landing of my beasts i came straight to see you directly i landed we dropped anchor here at daybreak  i will go with you uncle i will run in and see the chief first and get leave off for the day i have earned a holiday for i have been at work pretty well morning noon and night for the last two months you see i have not only the duties of aidedecamp but of interpreter and have helped both the quartermasters department and the commissariat in making their arrangements with the natives i daresay i shall be able to help to hurry your business on quicker than you would be able to get it done alone  the general at once granted stanley leave and he went with his uncle down to the commissariat office and introduced him to the senior officer  we shall be glad to do all in our power to help you mr pearson the officer said we have been expecting your arrival for the last week of course we heard from calcutta that you had the contract for two thousand head at least half of these were to be delivered by the tenth of february we were getting rather anxious about it the force will probably want to start before that time and we shall have to victual both the land and water columns of course i did not know that you were a relation of mr brooke or i should have mentioned to him that you were likely to come  i should like to get off as soon as possible tom pearson said for by the time that i get back to ramgur the rest of the cattle will be in readiness for me  i will write you an order for four large boats at once if you had come three weeks sooner you might have been kept waiting some days but such a number of native craft have of late come down the rivers that we are enabled to get sufficient for our work  the officer gave him a note to the one in charge of the landing arrangements  it is lucky that you have come just at this moment the latter said we have just made our last trip with the baggage of the 47th and i have six boats disengaged you may as well take them all  the craft in question were some of those that had been capturedunwieldy craft that took fish and salt up the river they were almost as large as the dhows in which the cattle had been brought down but drew very much less water they were towed off to the dhows one by one by two captured war canoes each having thirty rowers one was taken to each dhow and the work of transhipping the cattle began at once these were in good condition for although closely packed they had been well supplied with food and water on the way down and a herdsman with four men under him had been sent in each boat to take care of them as tom pearson was very anxious that his first consignment should be reported upon favourably the animals were all landed in the course of the afternoon and with the acknowledgment of their receipt in excellent order in his pocket the contractor went off again with stanley to his own dhow  i have told them to have everything in readiness to drop down the river with the tide tomorrow morning it will turn just about sunrise that is a rare bit of business stanley and i doubt if a contractor ever got his work through so quickly before of course it is principally due to you they would never have pushed things through so quickly had you not gone with me i thought that very likely i might be detained here a week before i could get all the cattle on shoreand by that time if all goes well i shall be at ramgur again  now we can have a comfortable evenings talk which is very much better than my going to dine with you at mess for there is a great deal to hear about and i daresay that i can give you as good a dinner as we should have had on shore  a good deal better stanley said things have improved immensely during the last month still our mess cook is certainly not so good as your man and at any rate the quiet of your cabin makes a very pleasant change after always sitting down with a large party  after dinner was over stanley gave a full account of his adventures from the time that he was taken prisoner  you have done wonderfully well for yourself lad wonderfully well certainly when you picked up burmese from my man we had no idea that it was ever likely to turn out so useful i thought that it would have been an assistance among the mugs on the coast and i had too some idea that the war might lead to the opening of a trade up the irrawaddy but it has turned out infinitely more useful than that if you could not have spoken burmese bandoola would never have thought of asking for you to be spared as an interpreter and if he had not done so you would have had your head chopped off at ava  of course that leopard business was the turning point of your fortunes but though it has turned out so well i must say that i hardly think that you were justified in risking your life in such a desperate act for a native who might for aught you know be already dead of course it was a most gallant action but the betting was ten to one against your succeeding however as it turned out it was a fortunate business altogether i dont say that you might not have made your way down to rangoon unaided but the odds would have been very heavily against it however these rubies were a windfall indeed  will you take the rest of them uncle and sell them at calcuttaor shall i send them to madras or home to england  i will take them with me to calcutta if you like stanley i dont say that there are better men there than the one you sent to at madras but i think some of them do a larger business upcountry with the native princes who dont care what they give for good gems at any rate i will take them there and get them valued by an expert and then try two or three of the leading firms and get their offers if these are as high as the value put on them by the expert i would send them to england through my agents who would do the best they could for you  for us uncle of course it is all in the partnership business you have just got some contracts that will pay well and while you have been doing that i have been getting hold of these rubies  i dont think that that is fair stanley his uncle said gravely  it seems to me perfectly fair and besides the money put into the business will make a lot of difference and will certainly pay me a great deal better than it would in any other way i sent home 100 pounds for my mother directly the money came from calcutta and told her that i hoped to be able to send home at least as much every year  a good deal more lad if you like i calculate these contracts that i have got will bring in a pound a head so that by the time that the war is over i hope to have cleared 8000 pounds which will be about what you will make by your rubies and when trade begins again we shall be in a position to do it on a big scale but i still think that it will not be fair to take that money  well uncle if you wont take it i certainly wont have anything to do with the money that you make while i am away so please dont let us say anything more about it shall i give you that eighteen hundred now or will you have an order upon the paymaster in calcutta  that would be the best way if you will have it so lad i have left money with johnson at ramgur for the next herd that is to come down here and have orders from my agent on their agents at dalla for those that i am going to buy for the manipur column so i dont want the money now and suppose the dhow were to be lost going up the cash might go with it so do you get the order you had better send it straight to bothron and tell him to collect it and credit it to my account  how long do you think that this business is going to last  it depends how far we have to go before the burmese decide that they have had enough of it at present the general hope is that as soon as we arrive at prome they will give in if they dont we may have to go up to ava and in that case we may not finish it until this time next year for i suppose operations will have to come to a stop when the wet season begins again and we could hardly reach ava before that  i expect some day we shall have to take the whole country stanley you may frighten the court into submission when you approach the capital but i fancy they will never keep to the terms that we shall insist upon and that there will have to be another expedition that is generally our wayit was so at mysore it has been so in a dozen other places when we have done all the work and have got them at our mercy we give them comparatively easy terms as soon as they recover from the effects of their defeat they set to work again to prepare for another tussle and then we have all the expense and loss of life to incur again and then end by annexing their territory which we might just as well have done in the first place it may be all very well to be lenient when one is dealing with a european enemy but magnanimity does not pay when you have to do with orientals who dont care a rap for treaty engagements and who always regard concessions as being simply a proof of weakness  there would not be half the difficulty in annexing burma that there would be in the case of a large province in india for all the towns and most even of their villages lie on rivers and a couple of dozen gunboats would suffice to keep the whole country in order you will see that that is what we shall have to do some day but it will cost us two or three expeditions to do what might just as well be done now  well uncle it is nearly twelve oclock and as i shall be on duty at six i think i had better be going i wish that you could have stayed for another two or three days and paid a visit to the pagoda and camps i am very glad that i have had a sight of you again though its a very short one  i should be glad to stay another day or two stanley but it is really of importance for me to get down to ramgur as soon as i can and send johnson off with the cattle for i want to set about buying the herds for the other column as quickly as possible i think i have left myself a fair margin of time but there is nothing like promptitude in delivery and i want to get a good name for future business and if this affair here is going to last another twelvemonth regular supplies must be sent up for as beef is forbidden by the burmese religion they keep no cattle except for draught purposes and the army must get their bullocks by sea  five minutes later stanley was rowed ashore the next morning he accompanied the general and went down to inspect the newlyarrived cattle  they are a capital lot he said to stanley decidedly the best that we have had yet you see it is a good deal shorter voyage from ramgur than from either calcutta or madras and the animals probably had a much shorter land journey before they were shipped then too as your uncle came down himself they were no doubt much better looked after than usual on the voyage however i will take care to mention when i write next to calcutta that the cattle are far above the average and i shall be glad if they will arrange for such further supplies as we may require from the same source  thank you sir that will be a great help to my uncle hitherto he has had very uphill work of it though he was beginning to get on very well when the war put a stop to trade he knows the whole country so thoroughly that he can certainly buy up cattle at many places where no european trader save himself has ever penetrated  no doubt brooke and i hope for your sake that he will succeed well in this contracting business he has certainly made an excellent start and as he is first in the field in the country between assam and ramgur he ought to make a good thing of this opportunity that has fallen in his way i know that it takes a long time to build up a business but when the foundation is laid and a man is quick in taking advantage of an opportunity he can do as much in a year as he might do in twenty without it  now i am going over to the lines of the 47th to see how they have shaken down into them  this regiment had brought out tents for as every building was already occupied it was necessary that they should be put under canvas the general found that everything was arranged in order and the encampment certainly presented a pleasing contrast to the irregular and often crowded quarters of the troops who had passed the wet season there the colonel and three of his officers dined with the general that evening the party being made up of the military staff including the two aidesdecamp  two days later stanley with some of the other members of the staff dined at the 47th mess stanley was introduced to several of the officers and these were specially desirous of making his acquaintance as they had learned that he had been a prisoner at ava and could therefore tell them much more than they had hitherto learned of the country into which they were about to advance  among them was a young lieutenant also of the name of brooke stanley had three weeks before attained the same rank at the time that he was appointed to the 83rd there were already several death vacancies in the regiment and disease and fighting had carried off six more officers the whole of the ensigns had consequently obtained their step at dinner he found himself placed next to his namesake  it is curious our having the same name the other remarked as he sat down it is not a very common one  no i have not met anyone of the same name before stanley said indeed until the affair at ramoo i was nearly three years trading with an uncle of mine up the rivers and was not much in the way of falling in with white men but before that i had been with my father in a good many stations in india but i do not as far as i can remember recollect meeting anyone of the same name  then your father was in the service too  yes he was a captain in the 15th native infantry  indeed the other said in surprise then we are connections but i had no idea that captain brooke was ever married  he was married just after he came out to india stanley said so it is likely enough that you would never have heard of it he died three years ago and my mother and sisters are now in england what is the connection between us i have never heard my father speak much of his family  your father was a cousin of minesecond cousin i think i fancy there was some row between your grandfather and the rest of the family i dont know anything about the right or wrongs of it for it was of course many years before we were born and i never heard of your fathers existence until a fortnight before i left england then there were some inquiries made about the family owing to various deaths that took place in it do you know that your father was relateddistantly of courseto the earl of netherly  i do remember his mentioning it once i know he said that it was a distant connection and that he knew nothing whatever about the earl or his family  well curiously enough it is not so distant now the other said i was a pretty distant connection of his he was childless and the family generally dont seem to have been prolific a good many of them died and the result was that the year before i left england an uncle of mine succeeded to the title he has no son and my father was his next brother my father died two years ago and the result is that to my astonishment i found that i was next heir to the title they wanted me to leave the army when my regiment was ordered out to india but of course i was not going to do that for my aunt may die and my uncle marry again and have children besides i was not going to leave anyhow just as the regiment was ordered abroad and might see service  however there was a great hunting by the lawyers in the genealogical tree and i know it was decided that in case anything happened to me your father would have been the next heir had he been alive i dont know whether any further inquiries were made or whether they ever ascertained that he had married i dont suppose there were for of course as long as i live the matter is of no importance  so that as things stand now if a burmese bullet puts an end to my career you are the next heir to the title  you surprise me indeed stanley said from the way my father spoke of the matter i am sure that he had not the slightest idea there was any likelihood whatever that he would have any chance of succeeding to the title  that i can well imagine for it was not until a few years ago when the deaths of several who stood between him and the succession occurred that my uncle regarded his coming into it as a matter worth thinking about and of course all our family stood between it and your father however as you see we have dwindled away and if i do not get safely through this business you are the next heir  it is curious news to hear at a dinner in burma stanley said thoughtfully at any rate i can assure you honestly that the news gives me no particular satisfaction i suppose it would be a nice thing to come in for a peerage but my prospects out here are good i have no intention of staying in the army after the end of the war and am really in partnership with my uncle with whom i have been for the last three years in business which is turning out very well i like the life and have every chance of making enough to retire on with ample means certainly i should not like to come into the title by the death of anyone that i knew  that is the fortune of war the other said smiling we get our steps by death vacancies we are sorry for the deaths but the steps are not unwelcome  by the way my name is harry i know that yours is stanley i vote that we call each other by them we are cousins you know and i suppose that as you are my heir you must be my nearest male relation at present so i vote that we call each other by our christian names instead of brookeing each other always  i shall be very glad to do so stanley said cordially i hope that we shall be close friends as well as distant relations  then as there was a momentary lull in the conversation harry raised his voice and said to the colonel  a very curious thing has just happened colonel brooke and myself have just discovered that we are cousins and what is still more curious that if anything happens to me he takes my place as next heir to my uncle a fact of which he was entirely ignorant  that is certainly a very curious coincidence brooke very singular then you have not met before  i did not even know of his existence colonel and had indeed no idea that captain brooke his father had been married the cousinship is a distant one but there is no question whatever as to his being next in succession to myself to the peerage  the discovery excited general interest and quite turned the conversation for the time from the subject of the war and of their approaching advance after dinner was finished many of the officers gathered round stanley asking him questions about the nature of the country and his experiences as a captive in the hands of the burmese presently colonel adair who had also dined at the mess joined the group  i suppose mr brooke he said your newlyfound cousin has told you about his adventure with the leopard  no colonel he has not said anything about a leopard  he is grievously afflicted with modesty the colonel went on and so i will tell it for him for i think you ought to know that he is not only able to speak half a dozen languages but that he is capable of doing deeds of exceptional gallantry  you can go and chat with the colonel brooke he is anxious to hear your report as to the country and i will be your trumpeter here  stanley gladly moved away and entered into conversation with the colonel of the 47th while colonel adair related his adventures with the leopard to his cousin and the officers standing round  by jove that was a plucky thing harry brooke said admiringly  it was indeed the colonel agreed as similar exclamations went round the circle i dont think one man in a hundred would have attacked a leopard with no weapon but a knife except to save the life of a comrade even then it would be a most desperate action i have done a good deal of biggame shooting in india but i am certain that nothing but a strong affection for a comrade in the grasp of a leopard would induce me to risk almost certain death in the way your cousin did we should never have heard of it if we had not got the details from the man he saved and who has since attached himself to him as a servant and is the man who as i daresay he did tell you served as his companion and guide in making his way down here at any rate you see brooke your cousin is an uncommonly fine young fellow and you have reason to be proud of the relationship  i feel so colonel and it is really a pleasure to know that if one does go down a thoroughly good fellow will benefit by it instead of some unknown person who might be a very objectionable representative of the family  for the next three or four days the bustle of preparations went on and on the fifth a detachment was sent up with a sloop and gunboats to attack an advanced position of the enemy on the lyne river although the 3000 burmese who were posted in a strong stockade were supported by thirtysix guns the works were carried by storm with little loss  the two branches of the pellang or rangoon river by which the force were to advance against donabew were on the following day reconnoitred for some distance a number of fire rafts were destroyed but the burmese were too disheartened to offer any resistance  to the disappointment of the troops the general was able to take with him only a limited force for the difficulties of carriage were enormous and as experience had shown that the country was likely to be deserted and devastated on their approach it was therefore impossible for the bulk of the army to be taken on by land there were other points however where the troops left behind could be profitably employed the capture of the important town of bassein on the main branch of the irrawaddy would open the river to the passage of our ships and put an entire stop to the trade of ava  the force told off for the advance against donabew was divided into two columns the first 2400 strongconsisting of the 38th 41st and 47th regiments three native battalions the troop of bodyguard a battery of bengal horse artillery and part of the rocket companywas to march by land  the second column which was to proceed by water was 1169 strong and it consisted of the 89th regiment the 10th madras europeans and 250 of the 18th native infantry a body of dismounted artillery and the rest of the rocket company this force was commanded by brigadier general cotton it was to be carried in a flotilla of sixtytwo boats each armed with one or two guns and the boats of all the ships of war at rangoon under the command of captain alexander r n  major sale was at the same time to advance against bassein with 600 men of the 13th regiment and the 12th madras native infantry with some artillery after occupying the town he was to cross the country lying between the two main arms of the irrawaddy and to join the generals force near donabew  the rest of the forcenearly 4000 men chiefly native regiments and europeans who had not as yet recovered sufficient strength to take part in field operationswas to remain at rangoon under brigadier general mcreigh who was to form a reserve column in readiness to move as directed as soon as sufficient transport was collected  it was to the water force that the capture of donabew was intrusted as it lay upon the opposite bank of the irrawaddy while the generals force was directed against tharawa at the junction of the two main branches of the river here they were to be joined by general cottons force after the capture of donabew then unless the court of ava sued for peace a united advance was to be made on the important town of prome    chapter 11 donabew   stanley brooke did not accompany the land column as the general said to him two days before  i have been speaking with general cotton and he said that he should be glad if i would attach you to his staff until the force unites again not one of his staff officers speaks burmese and although he has two or three interpreters with him it will be better if bandoola sends in an officer offering to surrender that he should be met by a british officer  in the next place it may be necessary for him to communicate with me and assuredly with your experience of the country you would be able to get through better than anyone else i do not apprehend that there would be any great danger for we know that every available fighting man has been impressed by bandoola and the passage of our column will completely cow the villagers lying between us and the river  i suppose he said with a smile that you have no objection since it will save you a long and i have no doubt a very unpleasant march and you will also obtain a view of the affairs at the stockades at pellang and donabew  the land column started on the 13th of february the water column on the 16th and the detachment for bassein sailed on the following day stanley was delighted at being appointed to accompany the boat column the march through the country would present no novelty to him and it was probable that the land column would encounter no serious resistance until after being joined by general cottons force it advanced against prome his horses went with those of general cotton and his staff under charge of the syce and meinik  the one steamboat kept at the start in rear of the great flotilla of boats so that in case of any of them striking on a sandbank it could at once move to her assistance and pull her off the scene was a very bright one as in all upwards of a hundred craft of various sizes proceeded together in front were half a dozen gunboats next to these came the two sloops of war followed by the rest of the boats proceeding in irregular order there was very little stream for the rivers were now quite low and although the flat country was still little more than a swamp the rains in the hills that supplied the main body of water to them had long since ceased the ships boats were of course rowed by the bluejackets the other craft were for the most part manned by natives though the soldiers on board occasionally lent a hand  two days after starting the boats destroyed three newlyerected stockades that were found unoccupied and on the 19th reached pellang where three very strong stockades had been erected a battery was thrown up next day from which as well as from the steamboat and sloops of war shells were thrown into the stockade with such effect that two of the enemys works were evacuated as soon as the troops took the offensive and the main pellang stockade was also abandoned without resistance the two smaller works were destroyed and a portion of the 18th madras infantry was left here to maintain communication with rangoon  on the 27th the flotilla entered the main stream and the next day the advance came in sight of donabew it was another five days before the whole force was in position for several of the most heavily laden craft stuck fast on the sandbanks at the fork of the river the next day donabew was summoned to surrender bandoola who was at the head of 15000 men returned a refusal which was given in courteous terms differing very widely from the haughty and peremptory language in which all previous communications had been couched  the next day a party of the 89th landed on the lowlying ground between the main stockade and the river and in spite of the heavy fire succeeded in ascertaining the strength and nature of the defences the main work was in the form of a parallelogram about a mile long and stood on ground rising above the general level and fifty pieces of cannon of various sizes were in position on the river face two outworks constructed of square beams of timber with an outer ditch and a thick abbatis defended the southern face against an attack from an enemy landing below it  it was necessary to leave a strong guard on board the flotilla lest an attack should be made by war canoes and fire rafts the general therefore had not more than 600 men available for the assault as the enemys guns completely commanded the river it was necessary to land below it and on the morning of the 7th the troops were disembarked with two sixpounder guns and a rocket detachment forming in two columns they advanced against the lower of the two covering stockades and after an exchange of fire with the enemy rushed forward and forced an entrance into it although the enemy resisted with more resolution than they had for some time shown 280 prisoners were taken and the rest of the defenders fled to the second work  two more guns and four mortars were landed and placed in position and after the stockades had been shelled for a short time a storming partyunder captain roseadvanced to the assault so heavy a fire was opened upon them that the little column was brought to a standstill and forced to fall back with the loss of its commander and of captain cannon of the 89th while most of the seamen with the storming party were either killed or wounded  this want of success against a mere outwork showed general cotton thatwith the small force at his disposalit would be worse than useless to renew the attack for were the outwork carried the loss would be so great that it would be hopeless to think of attacking bandoolas main position he therefore determined to abstain from further attack until reinforced  now mr brooke he said as soon as the troops had been taken on board the boats again i must bring your services into requisition this is just the contingency that we thought might possibly occur i cannot advance up the river until donabew is taken and i cannot attack the place with the force at my command therefore i will at once write a despatch to general campbell for you to carry you will be accompanied by the two men of the bodyguard who have come with me as orderlies i shall have no use for them here and three of you together need not fear any molestation from the few people remaining in their villages and may be able to cut your way through any of the bands of deserters or beaten troops dispersed over the country  very well general i shall also take my burman on my second charger he may be useful in getting news as to roads from the natives who will as likely as not fly into the jungle when they see us approaching however there is not much fear of our losing our way as it will be along the river as far as tharawa  a boat was at once sent off to the craft carrying the two orderlies and the horses of the staff as soon as the despatch was written stanley after shaking hands with his companions was also rowed to the horse barge this was at a signal of the general taken in tow by the steamer and piloted to the opposite bank a boat sounding ahead presently found a spot where there was enough water for the barge to get alongside the bank the horses were led ashore and stanley the two troopers and meinik mounted  the burmese are poor riders but during the wet season stanley had often taken meinik on his spare horse when riding about in the camp partly because he could trust him to look after the horses carefully and in the second place to accustom him to ride on horseback so as to act if required as an orderly meinik was quite of opinion that there would be no risk whatever in passing through villages but thought it probable that they might fall in with disbanded troops as it was known that the land column had soon after starting captured the fort of mophi and that its garrison between two and three thousand strong had taken to the jungle and dispersed  still master he said i dont think it likely that they will attack us they will be expecting no one and we shall come upon them by surprise then they will run into the bushes thinking that you must have many more troops behind you no it is not likely that they will have many guns they would throw them away when they fled partly to run faster through the forest partly because most of them will be making off to the villages hoping to lie concealed until the war is over while if they had guns in their hands it would be known that they were deserters and they might be seized and sent across the river to bandoola or up to prome  they rode some fifteen miles before dark and then took up their quarters in a village the few old men women and children inhabiting it fled at their approach but when meinik went to the edge of the jungle and shouted out loudly that they need not fear for that no harm would be done to any of them and good prices would be given for food two or three returned and finding the statements to be true one of them went into the jungle again and brought the others back fowls and eggs were brought into the hut that stanley occupied and a good supply of grain for the horses was also purchased thus stanley was able to avoid breaking into the small stock of provisions they had brought with them  the inhabitants of this part of burma were a tribe known as carians they were the tillers of the soil and were an industrious and hardy race the country was so rich that they not only raised sufficient for their own wants but sent large supplies of grain and rice to ava they were very heavily taxed but as a rule were exempt from conscription nevertheless they had on the present occasion been forced to labour at the stockades and in transporting food for the troops  their forest villages were small they consisted of little huts erected either in trees shorn of their branches or upon very strong poles these abodes were only accessible by rough ladders formed by nailing pieces of wood across the trees or poles this was absolutely necessary on account of the number of tigers that infested the forest the village where they had halted was however built upon the ground but was surrounded by a strong stockade the people assured stanley that none of the fugitives from mophi had come that way  there had they said been many after bandoolas defeat but they had seen none of late they declared that they had far greater fear of these than they had of the english for that they plundered wherever they went and if they could not obtain enough to satisfy their expectations burnt the houses and often killed many of the inhabitants the villagers volunteered to keep watch all night at the gate of the stockade although they said that there was no fear of anyone approaching as strangers could not find their way through the forest in the dark and even could they do so the fear of tigers would prevent them from making the attempt stanley agreed to pay some of them to watch but also stationed one of his own men as sentry relieving him every three hours  an hour after they reached the village they saw one of the war boats rowing rapidly up the stream and had no doubt that it was bearing a message from bandoola saying that he had repulsed the attack of the british beyond hearing the howling of tigers in the forest stanley passed the night undisturbed except when he went to change the sentry meinik took his share of watching and stanley himself relieved him an hour before daybreak  by the time the sun rose the horses had been fed and breakfast taken after riding some miles the country became more open cultivated fields succeeded the dense forest the ground was higher and little groups of huts could be seen wherever a small elevation rose above the general level the change was very welcome for they were able to travel faster and there was less chance of their coming suddenly upon a party of the disbanded troops  presently just as they reached a larger village than usual by the river bank a thick smoke arose from one of the houses and they could hear female screams  come on stanley shouted to the three men riding behind him see that your pistols are ready to hand and draw your swords  illustration stanley cut down the man who was about to fire the hut  this village was not like the last stockaded being some miles away from the forest as they dashed into it they saw some twenty burmese two women lay dead in front of one house and one of the men with a torch was about to fire another absorbed in their own doings the burmese did not notice the coming of the horsemen until the latter were close to them then with a cry of consternation they turned to fly but it was too late stanley cut down the man who was about to fire the hut and he and the others then fell upon the burmans with sword and pistol six of them were killed the rest were pursued but dashing down to the river they plunged in pistol shots being sent after them  stanley remained on the bank until he saw that they had fairly started to cross the river then he reentered the village two or three frightened people came out from their hiding places when meinik shouted to them that all was safe  they have all gone he said you need not fear being disturbed by them again see there are six guns lying in the road and you will find plenty of ammunition on those fellows that have fallen there are some spears and swords too of course you can do nothing if a number of these fellows come but if there are only two or three you and the women ought to be able to dispose of them now we must ride on  on the third day they arrived at tharawa and found that sir a campbell who had been assured by the natives that bandoola had retreated had continued his march the day before the place was so large that stanley thought it unsafe for them to sleep there and they rode on to a little village two miles away here they were received with great deference the passage of the troops the day before having profoundly impressed the villagers after waiting three hours to rest the horses they again mounted and riding all night arrived in the morning at yuadita village twentysix miles from tharawaand found the force on the point of starting  no bad news i hope mr brooke the general said as he rode up to him  i am sorry to say sir that my news is not good here is the brigadiers despatch  this is unfortunate indeed the general said when he had run his eye over the document  mr tollemache please to ride along the line and say that the column is not to get into motion until further orders  colonel adair and the other officers of the staff had been on the point of mounting when stanley rode up the general called two or three of the senior officers to him  cotton can neither take donabew nor get past it he said here is his despatch you see he has lost several officers and a good many men and that in the assault on an outlying work only i am afraid that there is nothing for us to do but go back to his assistance  i am afraid not sir colonel adair said our supplies are running short already and you see we decided upon filling up all the carts at tharawa where we made sure that we should be met by the boats the country round here has been completely stripped and it would be a very serious matter to endeavour to advance to prome without supplies moreover we might expect a much more serious resistance than we have bargained for the news that bandoola has repulsed his assailantsand you may be sure that this has been exaggerated into a great victorywill restore the spirit of the burmese it is evident that we must turn back and finish off with bandoola before we advance further  orders were accordingly sent to the officers commanding the various corps that the column was to retrace its steps and while they passed through the village stanley related in much greater detail than had been given in the despatch the events of the attack and the nature of the defences at donabew  the troops marched along with a cheerful mien it was of course an annoyance to have to plod back along the road they had before traversed but upon the other hand there was a general satisfaction that they were after all to take part in the capture of bandoolas last stronghold  colonel adair rode on with the little troop of cavalry he was to push forward to tharawa and was to offer rewards to the natives there for every boat brought in there was little doubt that many of the fishermen had hauled up their craft into clumps of bushes and brush wood to prevent their being requisitioned by bandoola and although it was not likely that a large number would now be obtained yet even if but a dozen were found it would be of assistance  the rest of the force reached tharawa on the following evening with the exception of a party left to protect the slowmoving waggons they found that nine canoes had been obtained and that a considerable portion of the scanty population had been all day employed in cutting bamboos and timber for rafts  the next morning the troops were all engaged on the same work and in the construction of rafts and at nightfall three hundred men of the 49th were taken across the river to the town of henzada in case bandoola on hearing of the preparations for crossing should send a force to oppose the passage it took four days continuous labour to get the little army across as it was necessary to make large timber rafts to carry the carts horses and bullocks guns and stores  hearing that a force was posted some fifteen miles away to intercept the detachment that was marching from bassein colonel godwin with a party was sent off that night to endeavour to surprise it the burmese however took the alarm before they were attacked and scattered in all directions without firing a shot the army marched along the right bank and arrived before donabew on the 25th of march communications were opened with general cottons force below the town and both divisions set to work to erect batteries  the burmese made several sorties to interrupt the work and one of these was accompanied by bandoolas seventeen elephants the troop of cavalry horse artillery and the rocket company charged close up to the elephants and opened fire upon the howdahs filled with troops that they carried in a short time most of these and the drivers were killed and the elephantsmany of which also had received woundsdashed off into the jungle while the infantry fled back into the stockade into which a discharge of shells and rockets was maintained all day  the next morningthe 1st of aprilthe mortar batteries were completed and these and others armed with light guns kept up a continuous fire into the enemys camp at daybreak on the 2nd the heavy guns of the breaching batteries also opened fire and in a very short time the enemy were seen pouring out in the rear of their works and making their way into the jungle as there had been no idea that they would so speedily evacuate the stockade no preparations had been made for cutting them off and the garrison therefore effected their escape with but little loss  the troops at once occupied the work and found large stores of grain and ammunition there as well as a great number of guns from some of the wounded burmans it was ascertained that the evacuation of the fort was due to the death of bandoola who had been killed by the explosion of a shell while watching the operations from a lookout that had been erected for him at the top of a lofty tree his death had caused the most profound depression among the garrison their leaders in vain endeavoured to reanimate their courage the opening of the fire with the heavy guns completed their discomfiture and they fled without thought of resistance indeed the greater part had stolen away during the night  a portion of the fleet had already passed up beyond the fort under a heavy fire and the rest now came up the supplies of grain were renewed and a guard being left to hold the works which would now serve as a base the army again started up the riverthe water column proceeding to tharawa the land force marching back to henzada whence they were carried across the river in the boats here the force was joined by the reserve column from rangoon consisting of several companies of the royals and the 28th native infantry with a supply of elephants and carriage cattle which had arrived from calcutta  on the 14th yuadit was again reached no opposition whatever was encountered indeed the whole country was deserted the inhabitants having been ordered away by the burmese authorities as soon as the fall of donabew was known when within four days march of prome two native officials came in with a communication to the effect that the burmese were ready to treat for peace as it was known however that reinforcements were on their way down from ava it was evident that this was merely a pretext to gain time and the general sent word that when he arrived at prome he would be ready to open negotiations for peace  the country through which the army was now passing was very beautiful in the far distance on the left the mountains of aracan could be seen while on the right the country was undulating richly cultivated and broken by clumps of timber with a background of the range of hills running along near the pegu river on the 24th the heights of prome eight miles away were visible and the flotilla could be seen lying at anchor a short distance below the town messengers came out that afternoon to endeavour to induce the general not to enter it but a reply was sent that this was out of the question that no harm would befall the inhabitants and thatas soon as he enteredthe general would be ready to receive any persons qualified to treat for peace  some hours before daybreak the army marched forward and by sunrise were close to the town the position was found to be extremely strong every hill commanding the place had been fortified to the very summit strong stockades ran in every direction and it was evident that a great number of men must have been engaged for a long time in attempting to render the place impregnable  not a soldier however was to be found a native of the place presently met them with the news that the governor and troops had evacuated it with the exception of a small party who were firing the town this story was corroborated by wreaths of smoke rising at various points  the troops pressed forward at the top of their speed on entering the town they found that the native population had all been forced to leave and piling their arms they set to work to extinguish the flames which they did not however succeed in doing until nearly half the town was destroyed fortunately the fire was checked before it reached the great magazines of grain and other stores for the army  the belief that the negotiations had been only pretexts to arrest the advance of the troops against the town until the expected reinforcements arrived was confirmed by the natives who presently came in from hiding places where they had taken refuge until their army retired they said that as soon as the news came of the fall of donabew fresh levies were ordered to be collected in every part of upper burma while the whole population of the province had been employed in adding to the defences of the town which had been already very strongly stockaded  it was a disappointment to the force which had hoped that the occupation of prome would bring about the submission of the court of ava and enable them to be taken down the river in boats and embark before the rainy season again set in nevertheless the prospect of passing that season at prome was vastly more pleasant than if it had to be spent at rangoon they were now inland beyond the point where the rains were continuous the town was situated on high ground and the country round was open and healthy although for some little distance round the cattle had been driven off and the villages destroyed it was certain that flying columns would be able to bring in any amount of cattle before the wet season began  for a short time it was thought that the occupation of prome would show the king and court that it was useless to continue the struggle any longer but these hopes were dissipated when it was known that a further levy of 30000 men had been called out the court however was apparently conscious that its commands would no longer be obeyed with the alacrity before manifested the early levies had obeyed the call with cheerfulness believing in their invincibility and confident that they would return home laden with spoil after driving without difficulty the audacious strangers into the sea things however had not turned out so the troops that had left ava in high spirits had been routed with very heavy losses their great general bandoola had been killed and fugitives from the army were scattered over the land bearing with them reports of the extraordinary fighting powers of these white enemies and of the hopelessness of attempting to resist them the consequence was that in issuing the order for the new levy a bounty of twenty pounds which to the burmans was a very large sum was offered to each man who obeyed the call  the first step on the part of the british general was to send proclamations through the country guaranteeing protection to all and inviting the population to return to their towns and villages the troops were employed in erecting with the assistance of as much native labour as could be procured comfortable huts outside the town so that the natives on returning should find their homes unoccupied and untouched it was not long before this excellent policy had its due effect as soon as those who first returned sent the news to their friends the fugitives came out from their hiding places in the forests in great numbers and returned to the city those whose homes were still standing settled down in them and resumed their ordinary avocations just as if their native rulers were still in authority while those whose houses had been burned set to work with a cheerfulness characteristic of their race to reerect their light wooden dwellings  so favourable were the reports spread through the country of our conduct that in a short time the population of prome was considerably larger than it had been before the advance of our army similar results were speedily manifest throughout the whole district below the town from the great forest that covered more than half of it the villagers poured out driving before them herds of cattle and in two or three months the country that had appeared a desert became filled with an industrious population order was established the local civil officers were again appointed to their former posts but their powers of oppression and intimidation were abrogated by the order that no punishment beyond a short term of imprisonment was to be inflicted on any person whatever until the case had been brought before the british authorities and soon the only fear entertained by the people of the rich district of the lower irrawaddy was that the british troops would march away and leave them again to the oppression and tyranny of their former masters  the markets of prome were abundantly supplied with food of all sorts and as everything was liberally paid for any number of bullocks were obtainable for although the burmese are forbidden by their religion to kill cattle and therefore keep them only for draught purposes they had no objection to our killing them or indeed to eat the meat when they could obtain it labour of all kinds was abundant and great numbers of canoes were constructed for the purpose of bringing up supplies from the villages on the river and for the advance of the force at the end of the wet season until this set in in earnest small bodies of troops marched through the forests driving out the bands that infested them and plundered and killed the country people without mercy  the generals aidesdecamp had a busy time of it being constantly employed in carrying orders to the towns and villages in hearing complaints and in stanleys case entering into agreements for the purchase of cattle and grain when in prome he spent a good deal of his spare time with his cousin who having bought a horse frequently obtained leave to accompany him on his excursions on duty a warm friendship had sprung up between them harry was two years older than stanley and had been at eton up to the time that he entered the army he was however in manner no older than his cousin whose work for the three years previous to the outbreak of the war had rendered him graver and more manly than a life spent among lads of his own age could have done  meinik always accompanied stanley wherever he went he had now to the latters quiet amusement modified his burmese costume making it look like that of some of the whites and indeed he would have passed without notice as one of the goaportuguese mess waiters in his suit of white nankeen when riding or on any service away from the headquarter camp he was dressed in a suit of tough brown khaki which he had obtained from one of the traders at rangoon the coat differed but little from that of the suit stanley had handed over to him except that it was somewhat shorter and without the small shoulder cape and in fact resembled closely the modern regimental tunic below he wore knee breeches of the same material with putties or long bands of cloth wound round and round the leg and which possessed many advantages over gaiters he still clung to the turban but instead of being white it was of the same colour as his clothes and was much larger than the burmese turban  burmese are great fools he often said to stanley they think they know a great deal they know nothing at all they think they are great fighters they are no good at fighting for one englishman beats ten of them their government is no goodit keeps everyone very poor and miserable you come here you know nothing of the country and yet you make everyone comfortable we ride through the villages we see everyone rejoicing that they are governed by the english and hoping that the english will never go away again  what do you think sirwill you stay here always you have had much trouble to take the country a great many people have been ill a great many died now you have got it why should you go away again  it is quite certain that we shall not give it all up meinik it has been as you say a troublesome and very expensive business and the farther the king obliges us to go up before he makes peace the more he will have to pay either in money or territory of course i cannot say what the terms of peace will be but i should think that very likely we shall hold the country from the sea up to here with aracan and a strip along the sea coast of tenasserim  that will be good meinik said i shall never go outside the english land again there will be plenty to do and a great trade on the river everyone will be happy and contented i should be a fool to go back to upper burma where they would chop off my head if they knew that i had been down to rangoon when the english were there    chapter 12 harry carried off   early in september stanley was sent to purchase cattle from some of the villages near the foot of the hills and at the same time to make inquiries as to the movements of a large band of marauders who had been making raids in that neighbourhood he had with him four troopers of the bodyguard harry brooke accompanied him although from the healthier situation of prome the amount of illness during the wet season did not approach that which had been suffered at rangoon a great many men were in hospital and there were many deaths harry had had a sharp attack of fever and as he had now recovered to a certain extent the medical officer of his regiment strongly recommended that he should have a change and he therefore without difficulty obtained his colonels leave to accompany stanley as the ground would be much higher than that on the river and the mere fact of getting away from a camp where so many deaths took place every day would in itself be of great value  stanleys daily journeys were not likely to be long ones as he had instructions to stop at all villages and to see how things were going on and whether the people had any complaints to make of oppression and exaction by their local authorities  it is a tremendous pull your being able to speak the language stanley harry said if it hadnt been for that you would have been stuck at prome like the rest of us instead of that you are always about and you look as fresh and healthy as if you were at a hill station in india  yes it has been an immense advantage to me in all ways of course i should never have got my staff appointment if it had not been for that  by the way i have not told you that while you were down with the fever the gazette containing the confirmation of my appointment by the general and the notice of my commission dated on the day of my appointment came out i had quite a lump sum to draw for although i have been paid as interpreter all along the paymaster made a difficulty about my pay as a subaltern until i was gazetted regularly so i have quite a large sum coming to me on my pay and allowances i dont know how you stand for cash but if you are short at all i can let you have anything that you want  i have got really more than i know what to do with stanley i bought an uncommonly good native horse as you know six weeks ago and i am going to ride him for the first time now but really that is almost the first penny that i have spent since we left rangoon there is nothing to buy here except food and of course that is a mess business i had an idea that this was a rich country but so far one has seen nothing in the way of rich dress materials or shawls or carpets or jewelry that one could send home as presents why in india i was always being tempted but here it is certainly the useful rather than the ornamental that meets the eye  i saw some nice things at ava but of course all the upper classes bolted as we came up the country and the traders in rich goods did the same are you going to take a servant with you harry i dont think that there is any occasion to do so for meinik can look after us both well enough  yes i am thinking of taking my native the man i hired just after i got here he is a very good fellow and made himself very useful while i was ill i picked up a tat for him yesterday for a few rupees i know that your man would do very well for us both but sometimes when you make a village your headquarters and ride to visit others from it i may not feel well enough to go with you and then he would come in very handy for he has picked up a good many words of english your man is getting on very well that way  yes he was some time before he began for of course he had no occasion for it but now that he has taken to what he considers an english costume and has made up his mind that he will never settle down again under a burmese government he has been trying hard to pick up the language i found that it was rather a nuisance at first when instead of telling him what was wanted in his own language i had to tell him in english and then translate it for him however he does understand a good deal now and whenever he has nothing else to do he is talking with the soldiers of course from his riding about so much with me he is pretty well known now and as he is a goodtempered merry fellow he makes himself at home with them and if the campaign lasts another six months i think he will speak very fair english  i fancy that you will have to make up your mind that he is a permanency stanley i am sure he intends to follow you wherever you go whether it is to england india or anywhere else  i shant be sorry for that harry certainly not as long as i am out here in the first place he is really a very handy fellow and ready to make himself useful in any way then there is no doubt that he is greatly attached to me and would go through fire and water for me a man of that sort is invaluable to anyone knocking about as i shall be when the war is over and i take up trading again his only fault is that he is really too anxious to do things for me of course when i am on duty there is nothing much he can do but if i am sitting in a room he will squat for hours in the corner and watch me if my cheroot gets low there he is with a fresh one and a light in a moment if i drop my handkerchief or a pen there he is with it before i have time to stoop sometimes i have really to invent errands to send him on so as to give him something to do for me i own that i have not contemplated what position he would occupy if i go trading but i quite recognize that he will go with me and that he would become a portion of my establishment even if that establishment consisted only of himself  will you be ready to start at four in the morning the sun is tremendously hot now on the days between the rain at any rate it will be much better for you till you get your strength to travel in the cool of the morning or in the evening  i shall be ready i will be round here with my servant by that hour by the way what shall i bring with me  nothing at all i shall take a couple of chickens and some bread and coffee and sugar and a bottle of brandy for emergencies but we shall have no difficulty in getting food in the villages the troopers will only carry their days rations with them after that i always act as mess caterer and charge expenses when i get back here  accordingly the next morning they started at four oclock stanley insisted that harry should ride his second horse for the present as his own having been six weeks without exercise and fed very much better than it had been accustomed to was in much too high spirits to be pleasant for an invalid meinik therefore took harrys and the latter rode beside his cousin whose horse had had abundant exercise and was well content to canter quietly along by the side of his companion  by the end of ten days harry had picked up some of his strength they now reached a village which stanley decided to use as his headquarters for a few days while he made excursions to other places within a days ride it was a good place for a halt standing as it did at some height on the hills where the air was much cooler at night than in the flat country it was surrounded by a clearing of about a hundred acres in extent planted with cacao trees pepper and many kinds of vegetables  this is delightful harry said as they sat in front of the hut that had been cleared for them and looked over the plain it must be twenty degrees cooler here than it was at prome i think i shall do nothing tomorrow stanley but just sit here and enjoy myself i know it is very lazy for i am feeling quite myself again still after ten days riding i do think that it will be pleasant to have a days rest  do by all means stanley said i think you had better stay here for the three days that we shall remain your man is a very good cook and there is no lack of food those chickens we had just now were excellent and the people have promised to bring in some game tomorrow there are plenty of snakes too and you lose a good deal i can assure you by turning up your nose at them they are just as good as eels as meinik cooks themstewed with a blade of cinnamon and some hot peppers i cannot see that they can be a bit more objectionable to eat than eels indeed for anything one knows the eel may have been feasting on a drowned man the day before he was caught while the snakes only take a meal once a week or so and then only a small bird of some kind  i dare say that you are quite right stanley and i own that the dishes your man turns out look tempting but i cannot bring myself to try at any rate as long as i can get anything else to eat if i knew that it was a case of snake or nothing i would try it but till then i prefer sticking to birds and beasts  the next morning stanley rode off with two of his escort and meinik who declined altogether to be left behind  no master he said there is never any saying when you may want me and what should i ever say to myself if misfortune were to come to you and i were not to be there  stanley had a long days work as a rule the villagers had few complaints to make but at the place he went to on this occasion the headman had been behaving as in the old times and stanley had to listen to a long series of complaints on behalf of the villagers the case was fully proved both as to extortion and ill treatment stanley at once deprived the man of his office and called upon the villagers to assemble and elect another in his place  if you are not satisfied he said to the fellow you can go to prome and appeal to the general there but i warn you that if you do you must give notice to the villagers of your intention so that they may if they choose send two or three of their number to repeat the evidence that they have given me i have noted this fully down and i can tell you that the general when he reads it will be much more likely to order you a sound flogging than to reinstate you in your office  it was dusk when stanley arrived within two miles of the village where he had left harry meinik who was riding just behind him brought his horse up alongside  do you see that sir there is a light in the sky it is just over where the village is i am afraid there is a fire there  you are right meinik i hope nothing has gone wrong  he touched his horse with his heel and rode on at a gallop he became more and more anxious as he approached the village no flames could be seen leaping up but there was a dull glow in the sky as he rode into the clearing he reined up his horse in dismay a number of glowing embers alone marked the place where the village had stood and no figures were to be seen moving about  there has been foul play meinik  get ready for action men he said to the two troopers and they dashed forward at a gallop  two or three little groups of people were sitting in an attitude of deep dejection by the remains of their houses  what has happened stanley shouted as he rode up  the robbers have been here and have slain many and burned the village  where is my friend  they have carried him off my lord or at least we cannot find his body his servant and one of the soldiers are lying dead but of the other soldier and the officer there are no signs  this is terrible stanley exclaimed tell me exactly how it happened  it was four hours ago my lord the robbers came suddenly out from the plantation and fell upon the people many they killed at once but many also have escaped as we did by running in among the plantations and so into the forest we heard the firing of guns for a little time then everything was silent and we knew that the robbers were searching the houses half an hour later smoke rose in many places and then flames then after a time all was quiet a boy crept up among the bushes and came back with the news that they had all gone  then we came out again twentythree of our people had been killed and eight carried off at least we cannot find the bodies the white officer and one of his soldiers have gone also  which way did they go  the tracks show that they went up the hill most likely they will have gone to toungoo if they have gone to any town at all but indeed we think they have taken the prisoners to get a reward for them  stanley had thrown himself off his horse as he rode up and he stood for some time silently leaning against it then he said to meinik  picket the horses and then come and have a talk with me  then he turned to the two troopers  there is nothing to be done now he said you had better look about and see what you can find in the way of food and then get a grave dug for your comrade and another for mr brookes servant  the two mahommedan troopers saluted and led their horses away meinik after picketing the animals returned to stanley but seeing that the latter was pacing up and down and evidently not disposed to speak he went away  there were a good many fowls walking about in a bewildered way near the huts they had been away as usual searching for food in the plantations and fields when the robber band arrived and on their return home at dusk had found everything changed a boy at once caught and killed two of these plucked them and brought them to meinik who getting some embers from the fires cut the fowls in two and put them on to roast a few minutes sufficed to cook them as soon as they were ready meinik took them to stanley  you must eat master he said you have had nothing since we started this morning and sorrow alone makes a poor supper you will want to do something i know and will need all your strength  you are right meinik yes give me one of them and take the other one yourself and while we eat we can talk of course i must make an effort to rescue my cousin from the hands of this band  yes master i knew that you would do that  did you ask how many there were of them meinik  some say forty some say sixty  if we knew where they are now and could come up to them we might manage to get them off while the robbers were asleep  meinik shook his head  they are sure to keep a strict guard over a white officer he said but if we rushed in and shouted and fired pistols they might all run away  i am afraid not meinik there might be a scare for a minute but directly they saw that there were only two of us they would turn and kill us your people are brave enough they may feel that they cannot stand against our troops owing to our discipline but they fight bravely handtohand however we dont know exactly which way they have gone and it would be hopeless to search for them in the forest during the darkness  what should they go to toungoo for  i have been thinking it over master and it seems to me that many of them may belong there or to the villages near they may not dare return to their homes because they are afraid that they would be punished for having left the army and would certainly be sent off again to it now they may think that if they go back with a white officer and soldier and tell some story of having beaten a great many english they will be rewarded and may even be able to remain some time in their homes before they are sent off or they may be ordered to march with their prisoners to ava where they would get still more reward i can see no other reason for their carrying off the officer  i think very likely that is so meinik anyhow we are more likely to rescue my cousin at toungoo than we should be while on the road it would be next to impossible to find them among all the hills and trees and even if we did come upon them at night and could creep into the midst of them we might find that my cousin is too severely wounded to travel for as there was a fight it is almost certain he must have been wounded before he was captured therefore i think it is best to make straight for toungoo  how many miles is it from here do you think  meinik went over to the natives and asked the question about fortyfive miles they say very bad travelling all mountains but ten miles to the north is a road that runs straight there  then we had better follow that meinik in this broken country and forest we should be losing our way continually  how will you go master on horse or foot  we will go on horseback as far as we can we are not likely to meet people travelling along the road at present another thing is that if we can get the horses as near the town as possible they would be very useful for if mr brooke has been wounded badly he may not be able to walk far  you do not know whether the country near the town is open or whether the forests approach it closely  the natives were again applied to  it is a rich country there they say and well cultivated for five or six miles round the town  i will go and have a talk with them presently it will of course be necessary for me to disguise myself again  meinik nodded  yes you must do that master  do you think that we can get two or three men to go with us from here  if you will pay them master no doubt they will be ready to go they are well content with the white rulers they find that they are not oppressed and everything is paid for and that the white officers treat them kindly and well they have lost many things in this affair today and would be glad to earn a little money  how many would you like to have  four or five meinik i dont exactly know at present what there would be for them to do but they could help to make fires and keep watch while we are doing something at any rate they may be useful  of course i shall get the trooper out too if i can very likely they will be confined together and if we rescue one we can of course rescue the other  now i must do some writing get me a torch of some sort and i will do it while you are speaking to the natives  stanley always carried a notebook and pen and ink to take down statements and complaints as he rode about he now sat down and wrote an account of what had taken place during his absence  we had no previous news of the existence of the band he went on and the natives themselves had certainly no fear of any attack being imminent had i thought that there was the slightest risk i should not have made the village my headquarters or have left mr brooke there with only his servant and two troopers i regret the matter most deeply and am about to set off to toungoo with my man i shall of course go in disguise and shall make every endeavour to free my cousin  i trust general that you will grant me leave for this purpose i am of course unable to say how long it may take me but however long i shall persevere until i learn that my cousin is dead or until i am myself killed i trust that in starting at once on the assumption that you will grant me leave i am not committing a breach of duty but if so and you feel that you cannot under the circumstances in which you are placed grant leave to an officer to be absent on private business i inclose a formal resignation of my commission stating why i feel myself constrained even in the presence of the enemy to endeavour to rescue my cousin from the band that has carried him off at any rate it could not be said that i resigned in order to shirk danger  i sent off two days ago by one of the natives here a report of my proceedings up to that date and have now the honour to inclose the notes i took of my investigations today into the conduct of the headman of pilboora and my reasons for depriving him of his office i shall leave the two troopers of my escort here with orders to remain until either i return or they receive instructions from prome i am taking a few of the villagers with me should anything occur to me at toungoo they will bring back the news to the troopers and i shall leave instructions with them to carry it at once to you if i find that mr brooke has been sent on to ava i shall of course follow and endeavour to effect his rescue on the road  as it is possible general that i may not have another opportunity of thanking you for the many kindnesses that you have shown me allow me to do so most heartily now  when stanley had concluded the letter and written the paper offering his resignation and giving his reasons for so doing he called meinik to him  well meinik have you found men willing to go with us  yes master i have got five men two of them know toungoo well all are stout fellows i offered them the terms that you mentionedfifty ounces of silver to each man if you succeeded by their aid in rescuing the officer they were delighted at the offer which would enable them to replace everything that they have lost  i told them of course that if it were necessary to fight they would have to do so and that as many of their countrymen were enlisted as gun lascars and in other occupations with the english and are of course exposed to the attacks of their countrymen they would only be doing what others have been willing to do  they said that they were ready enough to fight you were the government now and you were a good government and they would fight for you and besides as the officer was carried off from their village it was their duty to help to get him back  one of them said these men who attacked us are burmese soldiers as they attack us there is no reason why we should not attack them  so i think master that you can count upon them the burmese have always been fond of fighting because fighting means booty the troops dont want to fight any more because they get no booty and a number of them are killed but now that the villagers have been forced to go to the war against their will and have been plundered and many killed by burmese soldiers they are quite ready to take sides with you three of them have had wives or children killed today and that makes them full of fight  well you had better tell them to cook at once food for two or three days at four oclock they are to start through the forest to the road you spoke of we will set out at the same time on horseback but we shall have to make a detour so they will be on the road before we are tell them when they get there to stop until we come up  yes master it is a good thing that i rode your second horse yesterday instead of mr brookes animal  yes he is worth a good deal more than the other meinik and i should certainly have been sorry to lose him  one of the men who is going with us says that he knows of the ruins of an old temple eight or nine miles this side of toungoo and that this would be a good place for us to leave our horses it is very very old one of those built by the people who lived in the land before we came to it and the burmans do not like to go near it so that there would be no fear of our being disturbed there even these men do not much like going there but i told them that no evil spirits would come where white men were  it is rather far off meinik but as you say the country is cultivated for some distance round the town we shall certainly have to leave our horses some six or seven miles away and two or three miles will not make much difference we can put on our disguises there  you had better take a couple of boys to look after the horses while we are away  they would not sleep there at night meinik said doubtfully i dont think the men would either if you were not there  that would not matter meinik if as you say there is no fear of anyone else going there  certainly no one else will go there at night master  at any rate if you can get two boys to go we may as well take them they might go there in the day and feed and water the horses and sleep some distance away at night  meinik found two boys sixteen years old who said that they would go with them and at the hour agreed on stanley and meinik started on horseback they descended the hill to the plain at its foot and turning to the right rode for some ten or twelve miles when they struck into the road and following this at an easy pace they came in the course of another hour upon the party of villagers sitting by the roadside  the sun was just rising and they travelled for three hours without meeting anyone then they drew off into the wood at a point where a small stream crossed the road and after eating a meal and giving a good feed to the horses lay down to sleep till the heat of the day abatedthe natives who were all armed with spears and swords keeping watch by turns  at four oclock they started again and at ten approached the spot where in the depth of the wood lay the temple the man who knew its position declared however that he could not find it at night stanley had no doubt that he was really afraid to go there but as he did not wish to press them against their will he said carelessly that it made no difference if they halted there or close by the road and a fire being speedily lit they bivouacked round it  meinik had procured the necessary dyes from a village and stanley was again stained and covered with tattoo marks as before  what am i to do about your hair master he asked it will never do for you to go like this  stanley had not thought of this point and for a time was completely at a loss his own hair was now short and could not possibly be turned up  the only thing that i can see he said after a long pause is for you and the men each to cut off a lock of hair from the top of your heads where it will not show the six locks would be ample but i dont see how you are to fasten it below the turban  there are berries we can get wax from meinik said we boil them in water and the wax floats at the top with that master we could fasten the hair in among yours so that it would look all right  the men had all laughed at the proposal but willingly consented to part with a portion of their hair meinik therefore proceeded to stain stanleys close crop black and the first thing in the morning the boys went out soon returning with a quantity of berries some water was poured over them in an earthenware pot and placed over the fire and in half an hour a thick scum of oil gathered on the surface meinik skimmed it off as fast as it formed and as it cooled it solidified into a tenacious mass somewhat resembling cobblers wax the six locks of hair had already been cut off and the ends were smeared with the wax and worked in among stanleys own hair then a little of the hot wax was rubbed in and the men all declared that no one would notice anything peculiar in his appearance the long tresses were curled round at the top of the head and a ring of muslin tied round the burmans were immensely amused at the transformation that had been wrought in stanleys appearance and followed him through the wood to the temple without any signs of nervousness  the ruins were extensive a considerable portion of the building had been hewn out of the face of a precipitous rock in the manner of some hindoo temples and it was evident that it had been the work of a people more closely allied to the indian race than to the tartar or chinese people from whom the burmese sprung uncouth figures were sculptured on the walls at these the burmese looked with some awe but as stanley laughed and joked over them they soon recovered their usual demeanour  i am a great deal more afraid of tigers than of ghosts stanley said a deserted place like this is just the sort of spot they would be likely to be in at any rate if these caves do not go any further into the hilland there are no signs of their doing soit may be hoped that the tigers have their superstitions about it too at any rate it will be a good thing to pile a great quantity of firewood at the entrance and i think one of you had better stay here with the boys they and the horses would be a great deal safer here with a fire burning than they would be in the woods where a tiger might pounce upon them at any moment as to this folly about spirits it is only old womens chatter  the burmese talked among themselves and one of the men finally agreed to stay with the boys an hour was spent in gathering a pile of brushwood and logs and the man said that he and the two boys would gather plenty more during the day they were at four oclock to take the horses down to the river a mile distant and let them drink their fill they had brought with them a large bag of grainwhich had been carried by the mena quantity of plantains and some fowls therefore the party that were to remain would be well provided  moreover in collecting the wood a score of snakes had been killed some of these and a chicken had been cooking while they were at work and as soon as this was eaten they started for the town when they came within a mile of it stanley entered a plantation of fruit trees and meinik and the four men went on  they returned in two hours with the news that a party of ten men had arrived in the town on the previous day with two prisoners one a coloured man had been able to walk the other a white man had been carried in on a litter they had both been lodged in the jail  by this time the conduct of the english towards the natives at rangoon and the territory they occupied had had one good effect signally as they had been defeated by them the burmese had lost their individual hatred of the strangers they knew that their wounded and prisoners always received kind treatment at their hands and although the court of ava remained as arrogant and bigoted as ever the people in lower burma had learned to respect their invaders and the few prisoners they had taken received much better treatment than those who had been captured at the commencement of the war  as soon as it was dusk stanley went with meinik into the town it was a place of considerable size with buildings at least equal to those at prome toungoo had formed part of the kingdom of pegu before it had been subdued by the burmese the peculiar and characteristic facial outline of the latter was here much less strongly marked and in many cases entirely absent so stanley felt that even in daylight he would pass without attracting any attention  the prison was surrounded by a strong and high bamboo fence and in the space inclosed by this were eight or ten dwellings of the usual wooden construction a dozen armed men were seated by a fire in the yard and two sentries were carelessly leaning against the gate  there should be no difficulty in getting in there with two rope laddersone to climb up with and one to drop on the other side stanley said you may be sure that most of the guard go to sleep at night the first thing to ascertain is which house the prisoners are kept in and in the second place how my cousin is going on we can do nothing until he is able to walk for a short distance  let us move round to the other side of the inclosure it may be that a sentry is posted at their door  on getting to the other side and looking through the crevices between the bamboos they could make out two figures squatted by the door of one of the houses and had no doubt that this was the one in which harry brooke was confined  now meinik the first thing is for you to go and buy a rope when the place gets quite quiet we will make a loop and throw it over the top of the palisade behind that hut then i will climb up and let myself down inside and then crawl up to the hut and see what is going on there if my cousin is alone i will endeavour to speak to him but of course there may be a guard inside as well as at the door if he is very ill there will probably be a light  let me go master  no meinik i would rather go myself i shall be able to judge how he is if i can catch a sight of him    chapter 13 preparing a rescue   stanley remained where he was until meinik returned in half an hour with the rope stanley made a loop at one end and then knotted it at distances of about a foot apart to enable him to climb it more easily then they waited until the guard fire burnt down low and most of the men went off into a hut a few yards distant three only remaining talking before the fire then stanley moved round to the other side of the palisade and choosing a spot immediately behind the hut where the sentries were posted threw up the rope it needed many attempts before the loop caught at the top of one of the bamboos as soon as it did so he climbed up  he found that the position was an exceedingly unpleasant one the bamboos were all so cut that each of them terminated in three spikes and so impossible was it to cross this that he had to slip down the rope again on telling meinik what was the matter the latter at once took off his garment and folded it up into a roll two feet long  if you lay that on the top master you will be able to cross  this time stanley had little difficulty on reaching the top he laid the roll on the bamboo spikes and was able to raise himself on to it and sit there while he pulled up the rope and dropped it on the inside descending he at once began to crawl towards the hut as he had seen before climbing a light was burning within and the window was at the back of the house this was but some twenty yards from the palisade and when he reached it he stood up and cautiously looked in  the indian trooper was seated in a chair asleep without his tunic one arm was bandaged and a bloodstained cloth was wrapped round his head on a bamboo pallet with a dark rug thrown over it was another figure the lamp on the wall gave too feeble a light for stanley to be able to make out whether the figure lying there was harry but he had no doubt that it was so  in a low tone he said in hindustani wake up man  the soldier moved a little stanley repeated the words in a somewhat louder tone and the trooper sprang to his feet and looked round in a bewildered way  come to the window stanley said it is i your officer  the mans glance turned to the window but surprised at seeing a burmese peasantas he supposedinstead of the officer he stood hesitating  come on stanley said i am lieutenant brooke  the soldier recognized the voice drew himself up made the military salute and then stepped to the window  i have come stanley said to try and rescue lieutenant brooke and yourself i have some friends without how is he  he is very ill sir he is badly wounded and is unconscious sometimes he lies for hours without moving sometimes he talks to himself but as i cannot understand the language i know not what he says but sometimes he certainly calls upon you he uses your name often  i do what i can for him but it is very little i bathe his forehead with water and pour it between his lips of course he can eat nothing but i keep the water my rice is boiled in and when it is cool give it him to drink there is some strength in it  then nothing can be done at present stanley said tomorrow night i will bring some fruit you can squeeze the juice of some limes into a little water and give it to him there is nothing better for fever as soon as he is well enough for us to get him through the palisades we will have a litter ready for him and carry him off but nothing can be done until then  how are you treated  they give me plenty of rice sahib and i am at liberty to go out into the courtyard in the daytime and now that i know that you are near i shall have no fear i have been expecting that they would send me to ava where no doubt they would kill me but i have thought most that if they were to send me away from here and there was no one to look after the sahib he would surely die  at this moment stanley felt a hand roughly placed on his shoulder turning round he struck out with all his strength full in a mans face and he fell like a log  if they ask you who was here he said hastily to the trooper say that you know not who it was a burmese came and spoke to you but of course you thought that he was one of the guard  then he ran to the rope climbed up and as he got over pulled it up and threw it down to meinikas he thought that there might be some difficulty in shaking it off from the bamboothen he dropped to the ground bringing down the pad with him  did you kill him master meinik asked as they hurried away i was watching the window and saw you talking to someone inside then i saw a man suddenly come into the light and put his hand upon you and saw you turn round and he fell without a sound being heard  there is no fear of his being killed meinik i simply hit him hard and he went down i have no doubt stunned it is unfortunate but though they may set extra guards for a time i think they will not believe the mans story or at any rate will suppose that it was only one of the guard who not being able to sleep wandered round there and looked into the hut from behind the worst of it is that i am afraid that there is no chance of my being able to take my cousin some limes and other fruit tomorrow night as i said i would he is very ill and quite unconscious  that is very bad master i will try and take him in some fruit tomorrow if they wont let me in i will watch outside the gates and when one of the guard comes out will take him aside and i have no doubt that for a small bribe he will carry in the fruit and give it to the trooper i wonder that they put them into that hut with the window at the back  i dont suppose they would have done so if my cousin had not been so ill that it was evident that he could not for some time attempt to escape  they joined the villagers outside the town and telling them that there was nothing to do that night returned to the temple they found the man and the two boys sitting by a great fire but shivering with terror  what is the matter stanley asked  the spirits have been making all sorts of noises outside and there are other noises at the end of the cave close to the horses  stanley took a brand and went over to them they were both munching their grain quietly  well you see the horses are not frightened so you may be sure that whatever were the noises you heard there was nothing unnatural about them what were they like  the question was not answered for at that moment a sound like a loud deep sigh was heard overhead the natives started back and even stanley felt for a moment uncomfortable  it is only the wind he said there must be some opening above there and the wind makes a noise in it just as it does in a chimney we will see all about it in the morning  now as to the noises outside  they were wailing cries the man said  pooh they must have been tigers or leopards or perhaps only wild cats no doubt they smelt you and the horses but were too much afraid of the fire to come any nearer why you must have heard tigers often enough to know their cries  i thought myself that they were tigers the man said rather shamefacedly but the boys said they were certain that they were not and i was not sure myself one way or the other  sitting down by the fire stanley told the men the exact position of the prisoners and said that he feared it would be altogether impossible to get harry out for the present  i would give anything to have him here he said but it would be impossible to get him over the palisade  we might cut through it master meinik said with a sharp saw we could cut a hole big enough in an hour to carry his litter out the only thing is we could not get his bed through that window  we might get over that by making a narrow litter stanley said and lifting him from the bed on to it the difficulty would be what to do with him when we got him out as to carrying him any distance in his present state it would be out of the question besides the guard are sure to be vigilant for some considerable time i think that the best plan would be for you all to go back to your village tomorrow taking the horses with you and for one of you to come over every other day for orders then there would be no occasion for anyone to watch the horses they certainly will be of no use to us at present for it will be weeks before my cousin is strong enough to ride  meinik and i will take up our abode close to the edge of the forest for that will save us some four or five miles walk each day the first thing in the morning you shall go with me and choose a spot so that you may both know where to find us two of you have got axes and we will make a shelter in a tree so as to be able to sleep without fear of tigers when we go out there though i dare say that we shall generally sleep near the town however one or other of us will always be at the spot at midday on the days when you are to meet us  now that i think of it two of you may as well stay at the shelter for the present while the other three and the two boys go home then there will be no occasion to take the long journey so often when we do get my cousin out we shall have to take up our abode for a time either here or in the forest until he is well enough to bear the journey  in the morning stanley closely examined the roof of the cave but could see no opening to account for the noise that he had heard he had however no doubt that one existed somewhere he left a man with the two boys in charge of the horses and went with the others until they approached the edge of the forest they kept along within the trees for half a mile so that any fire they might light would be unseen by people travelling along the road the men considered this precaution needless as they declared that no one would venture to pass along it after nightfall partly owing to the fear of tigers and partly to the vicinity of the temple  a suitable tree was soon fixed on and the burmese now in their element ascended it by driving in pegs at distances of two feet apart once among the high branches they lopped off all small boughs that would be in the way and then descending cut a number of poles and many lengths of tough creeper and with these they constructed a platform among the higher branches and on it erected a sort of arbour amply sufficient to hold four or five people lying down this arbour would hardly be noticed even by persons searching as it was to a great extent hidden by the foliage beneath it stanley told meinik that they had better buy some rope for a ladder and take out the pegs as these might catch the eye of a passerby and cause him to make a close search above  as soon as the work was finished two of the men went back to the temple to start at once for home with their companion the boys and the horses stanley had brought with him his pistols the two horse blankets and other things that might be useful and when these were stored above he with meinik and the two men went towards the town he stopped as before a short distance outside just as it was dusk the men returned carrying the rope that meinik had bought and a store of food with these they were sent to the shelter and stanley entered the town where he met meinik  i have sent in the fruit the latter said i had no difficulty about it i told the first soldier who came out after i had bought it that i came from the village where the white officer had been captured by the bandits he had been very kind to us all and as we knew that he had been carried off badly wounded i had come over to get some fruit for him but i found that they would not let me in at the gate i said i would give an ounce of silver to him if he would hand the things to the prisoner for me  he said at once that he would do so he had heard that the whites always treated their wounded prisoners very well and that there would be no difficulty about it for that there was a window at the back of the hut where he was lying and he could easily pass things in there without anyone noticing it if the prisoner was as i said a good man it was only right that he should be helped  i told him that i should look out for him and might want him to do the same another day i think that he was an honest fellow and might have passed the fruit in even without a reward still everyone is glad to earn a little money  he told me that a strange thing had happened last night one of his comrades had declared that he had found a giant standing at the window where the prisoner was he put his hand upon him when he was struck down by lightning no one would have believed his tale at all if it had not been that his nose was broken the other prisoner had been questioned but as he did not understand burmese they could learn nothing from him two guards were in future to be placed at the back of the house as well as in the front  that part of the business is bad meinik  i dare say we shall be able to bribe them master you may be sure that most of them are eager to get back to their own villages and for a few ounces of silver they would be glad enough to help us and then to make their escape and go off to their homes the man i saw today might find one among them ready to do so with him especially if their homes happened to be on the other side of the hills and there would then be no chance of their being seized and sent back again by their headman the sentry would only have to let us know what night he would arrange for them both to be on guard together behind the hut then we should be able to manage it well  it would be a capital plan that meinik if it could be arranged  well it is a great comfort to know that the fruit has got in safely the limes especially will be a great help to my cousin next time you see the man you must try and get him to find out how he is going on  for a fortnight stanley remained in the forest meinik met the soldier every other day and sent in fruit and at the end of the ten days he heard that the prisoner had recovered his senses it was said that as soon as he was well enough to move he was to be sent to ava  now you had better begin to sound the man as to his willingness to aid him to escape  i have very little doubt about it master for i have already learned that his home is on the other side of the hills he went down with bandoola and returned after his defeat with a number of others travelling up the bank of the pegu river if they had not had their military chief with them they would have started straight for home but they were marched here and have been kept on duty in the town ever since he has heard how well off the people are on the other side of the hills under english rule so i feel sure that he will be glad to escape if he sees a chance of getting off  that is good in the first place let him know that the other english officer who was at the village with the one they captured had said that he would be ready to pay well anyone who would aid in his escape if he says that he would willingly do so if he also could get away tell him that one man would be of no use but that if he could get another to join him so that they could both go on guard together behind the house it could be managed  but say that in the first place i must myself speak to the white officer and learn exactly how he is and whether he can endure a journey as far as this tree or the templewhichever we may decide upon as best when i have seen him i will send for the other men from the village i am in no hurry to get him away for the longer he stays quiet the better but at any moment the governor may decide that he is sufficiently recovered to be carried and may send him off to ava under a strong escort therefore although we will put off moving him as long as possible we must not run the risk of his being sent away  four days later meinik said that the man had arranged with another to join him and that both would be on duty behind the hut that evening between nine and midnight accordingly at ten oclock stanley arrived with meinik and the two villagers at the palisade meinik had insisted upon accompanying him to the hut  i believe that the man is to be trusted master indeed i am sure he is but i do not know the second man he may have pretended to accept the offer only on purpose to betray his comrade and to obtain honour and reward for preventing the escape of the white man therefore i must be with you in case you are attacked our other two men may be useful to give the alarm if a party is sent round to cut us off  stanley who had brought a horse blanket with him to lay on the top of the palisade was the first to drop into the inclosure meinik followed him closely nothing had been said to the guard as to the white officer of whom meinik had spoken being himself of the party and stanley had purposely left his pistols behind him lest he should be tempted to use them in case he was attacked he carried a spear and a long burmese knife  meinik had begged to be allowed to go forward first while stanley remained by the rope he pointed out that some change might possibly have been made and that other men might have been placed on sentry  i know you master he said if you got there and found two strangers and they attacked you you would fight then they would give the alarm and others would come up before you could cross the palisade i shall steal up when i am close i shall make a noise like the hiss of a snake if my men are both there they will repeat the sound if they are not and one comes forward to look for and kill the snake i shall slay him before he has time to utter a sound if the other runs forward at the sound of his fall i shall kill him also  if no alarm is given you can come forward and speak to your cousin if there is an alarm you must climb the rope they will not know which way i have run and i shall have plenty of time to get over the palisade and pull up the rope then they will think that the guards have been killed by some of their comrades  i hope no such misfortune will happen stanley said gravely for there would then be no chance whatever of our getting him away he would probably be moved to some other place and our one hope would be that we might rescue him on the road which would be a difficult matter indeed if he were sent as he certainly would be under a strong escort however your plan is no doubt the best for if i were killed or captured there would be an end of any chance of his being rescued  meinik crawled forward and in a minute or two stanley heard a low hissing sound followed by two others he walked forward a step or two to meet meinik as he came back  it is all right master you can go on fearlessly  meinik returned with him to the window and posted himself outside standing in the shadow while stanley stepped in through the open casement which indeed was provided only with a shutter outside this would ordinarily have been closed but owing to the illness of the prisoner and the strong desire of the governor that he should live to be sent to ava it had been opened to allow a free passage of air  the trooper sprung from his couch as stanley made a slight sound before attempting to enter but stanley said in hindustani  silence it is i mr brooke  the trooper stared doubtfully at the dark tattooed halfnaked figure  it is i runkoor but i am disguised i was like this when i spoke to you through the window a fortnight since but you could not then see my figure  are you awake harry he asked in english as he approached the pallet  yes i am awake at least i think so is it really you stanley  it is i sure enough man stanley replied as he pressed the thin hands of the invalid did not runkoor tell you that i had been here before  but harry had broken down altogether the surprise and delight was too much for him in his weak state  of course stanley went on quietly i knew that he could not speak english but i thought that he might make signs  he did make a sign each time he gave me fruit he said sahib brooke pointed outside and waved his arms about but i could not make head or tail of what he meant why he should keep on repeating my name each time he gave me the fruit was a complete puzzle for me as to the signs that he made it seemed to me that he had gone off his head i have been too weak to think it over so i gave up worrying about it and it never once struck me that it was you who sent me the fruit  what an awful figure you are  never mind about that harry i have come in to see how strong you are i have bribed the two guards stationed behind  i can just sit up in bed to take my food stanley that is all i could not walk a step to save my life  i did not expect you to walk what i want to know is whether you are strong enough to be carried a few miles on a litter i have five men from the village where we were and they can cut through the palisading behind the hut i want to give you as long a time as possible but i am afraid that any day the governor may have you taken out and sent in a litter to ava under a strong escort  i could bear being carried out no doubt but if i could not i should think it would do me no harm so long as my wounds do not break out afresh i suppose the worst that could happen to me would be that i should faint before i got to the end of the journey  are you sure old man that this is not a dream  quite certain if you were well enough i would give you a sharp pinch if you are willing to venture i will make my preparations at once i have to send to the village but in three days i shall be ready and the first night after that the men manage to be on guard together behind we shall be here it may be a week it may be more but at any rate dont worry about it if they take you away suddenly i shall try to get you out of their hands somehow  my dear stanley harry said with a feeble laugh do you know that you are spoiling your chance of an earldom  you may take it that if you dont succeed to the title old fellow i shant for if you go under i shall too  now goodbye it would be fatal were i to be caught here try to get yourself as strong as you can but dont let them notice that you are doing so  without giving harry time to reply stanley pressed his hand and left his bedside he paused for a minute to inform the trooper of the plans for the escape and then he got through the window meinik joined him at once and without a word being spoken they crossed the palisade threw down the rope and blankets and dropped after them to the ground  on their way back to their tree stanley told the two men that the officer was better and that the next morning at daybreak one of them must start for the village to fetch their three comrades the boys were also to come back with him as they were big fellows and carried spears and might as stanley thought be useful either in a fight or in assisting to carry harry  on the following morning after the man had started stanley went with meinik to examine the temple more closely than he had done before he thought that it would be a far better hiding place than their hut in the tree there would certainly be a hot pursuit and the next day they might be discovered whether in the temple or in the tree but in the latter they would be powerless to defend themselves for the burmese with their axes would be able to fell it in a few minutes whereas in the temple a stout defence might be made for a time moreover the rock chambers would be far cooler in the middle of the day than the hut  his chief object in visiting the temple was to find a chamber with a narrow entrance that could be held by half a dozen men against a number of foes and it was desirable if possible to find one so situated that they might in case of necessity retreat into another chamber or into the open air meinik was so confident in the white mans power to combat even evil spirits that he approached the temple with stanley without betraying any nervousness they had provided themselves with some torches of resinous wood and meinik carried a couple of brands from their fire  the chamber they had before been in was apparently the largest in the temple but there were several other openings in the rock  that is the entrance we will try first stanley said pointing to one some ten feet from the ground you see there were once some steps leading up to it no doubt where we are standing there was a temple built against the face of that rock and probably that doorway led into one of the priests chambers  it was necessary to pile three or four blocks of stone on the top of the two steps that alone remained intact in order to enable them to reach the entrance  let me light the torches before you go in meinik said there may be snakes  that is hardly likely meinik you see the face of the rock has been chiselled flat and i dont think any snake could climb up to that entrance  perhaps not master but it is best to be ready for them  they lighted two torches and passed through the doorway there was an angry hiss some distance away  that is a snake sure enough meinik i wonder how it got here  holding their torches above their heads they saw that the chamber was some fourteen feet wide and twenty long in the corner to the left something was lying and above it a dark object was moving backwards and forwards  it is a big boa meinik said now master do you take the two torches in one hand and have your knife ready in the other if it coils round you cut through it at once this is a good place for fighting it for there is nothing here for it to get its tail round and a boa cannot squeeze very hard unless he does that  stanley feeling that in a combat of this sort the burman would be perfectly at home while he himself knew nothing about it did as he was told determining to rush in should it attack his follower  you can advance straight towards him master i will steal round he will be watching you and i may get a cut at him before he notices me  illustration the great snake moved his head higher and higher hissing angrily  stanley moved slowly forward as he did so the great snake moved its head higher and higher hissing angrily with its eyes fixed on the torches stanley did not take his gaze from it but advanced grasping his knife he knew that the boas bite was harmless and that it was only its embrace that was to be feared  he was within some eight feet of the reptile when there was a spring the snakes head disappeared and in a moment it was writhing twisting and lashing its tail so quickly that his eyes could hardly follow its contortions  stand back master meinik shouted if its tail strikes you it might do you an injury it is harmless otherwise i have cut its head off  stanley stepped back a pace or two and stood gazing in awe at the tremendous writhing of the headless snake  it is a monster meinik he said  it is a big snake master indeed i should say that it must be about forty feet long and it is as thick as my body it would be more than a match for a tiger  well i hope there are not many more of them about meinik  that depends master it may have its mate but it is more likely there will be no other it would eat any smaller ones of its own kind of course but there may be some small poisonous ones about  as the writhing of the snake ceased stanley looked round and saw a narrow doorway in the corner opposite that in which it had been lying  here is a passage meinik let us see where it goes to  meinik had by this time lighted two more torches  the more light the better he said when you are looking for snakes and holding them in one hand and his knife in the other he passed through the doorway which was about four feet high  stanley followed him the apartment was similar to the last but narrower and was lighted by an opening not more than a foot square  see meinik there is a staircase in the corner facing us  the steps were very narrow but in perfect preservation without staying to examine the room meinik led the way up examining every step carefully and holding the knife in readiness to strike they mounted some forty steps and then entered a room about ten feet square except a window some eighteen inches by three feet there was no apparent exit from the chamber  i should think that there must be some way out of this place meinik why should they have taken the trouble to cut that long flight of steps through the rock just to reach this miserable little chamber  meinik shook his head the ways of these ancient builders were beyond him  there must be an outlet somewhere if we could but find it besides we have not found where the snake came in yet  he could have come in at the door master a small snake could not have climbed up but that big fellow could rear his head up and come in quite easily we have found no little snakes at all  well that may be so but i still think that there must be some way out from here why should men go to the labour of cutting this long stair and excavating this chamber here without any reason whatever let us look through the window meinik  it was a passage rather than a window for the rock face had been left four feet in thickness crawling out stanley saw that he was fifty feet above the foot of the cliff a yard below him was a ledge of rock some two feet wide it was level and had deep grooves cut at regular intervals across it he had no doubt that the roof of the outside temple had started from this point and that the grooves were made for the ends of massive rafters of teak or stone at that time the passage to the chamber that he had left was doubtless used for an exit on to the flat roof  stepping on to the ledge he called meinik to him  now meinik he said we will follow this ledge there may be some way up from it  walking with a good deal of care stanley made his way along to a point where the ledge stopped abruptly looking down he saw the remains of a wall of solid masonry and perceived that he had been correct in his surmise as to the purpose of the ledge then they turned and went back to the other end of the ledge a few feet before they reached this meinikwho was now leading the waystopped  here is a passage master  the entrance was about the same size as that through which they had stepped out on to the ledge but instead of going straight in it started upwards  another flight of steps meinik i am beginning to hope that we shall find some way out at the top if we can do so it will make us safe we could defend those stairs and the entrance for a long time and when we wanted to get away we could make quietly off without anyone knowing that we had left    chapter 14 in the temple   they went up the flight of steps for a considerable distance then they found the passage blocked by a number of great stones stanley uttered an exclamation of disgust  it has fallen in he said no doubt we are near the top of the rock either the staircase was roofed in or there was a building erected over the entrance and either the roof or building whichever it was has fallen in that is very unlucky when we go down we will climb up the hill and see if we can discover anything about it  with plenty of food and water he went on as they descended into the lowest chamber one could hold this place for any time  yes master one could store away the food but where should we store the water we might bring skins in that would last us for a week perhaps two weeks but after that  after that we should make our way off somehow meinik stanley said confidently well there is no doubt that this is the place to shelter in they are less likely to find us here than anywhere and if they do find us we can defend ourselves stoutly i should say too that if we think it over we ought to be able to hit upon some plan for making noises that would frighten them you know how scared the man and the two boys were at that sighing sound in the other chamber we certainly could make more alarming noises than that  meinik nodded  that we could master with some reeds of different sizes i could make noises some as deep as the roar of a tiger and others like the singing of a bird  then we will certainly bring some reeds in here with us meinik i dont suppose they will mind in the daytime what sounds they hear but at night i dont think even their officers would care to move about here if we can but make a few noises they do not understand  well for the present we have done our work here and you had best go off with the burman to buy food to serve in case of a siege you had better go to some of the cultivators houses near the edge of the wood for rice and fruit if you can get the food there you will be able to make two or three journeys a day instead of one  but before we start back we will climb round to the top of the hill and see what has happened to shut up the staircase  it took them a quarter of an hours climbing through the forest and undergrowth before they reached the upper edge of the rock wall in which the chambers had been excavated it had evidently in the first place been a natural cliff for when on the ledge stanley had noticed that while below that point the rock was as smooth as a built wall above it was rough and evidently untouched by the hand of man following the edge of the cliff until standing as nearly as they could guess above the entrance to the steps they walked back among the trees at a distance of some thirty yards they came upon a ruin it was built of massive stones like those which strewed the ground where the temple had stood a great tree rose on one side and it was evident that its growth had in the first place overthrown the wall at this point climbers and shrubs had thrust their roots in between the blocks that had been but slightly moved by the growth of the tree and had in time forced them asunder and so gradually the whole building had collapsed  this tree must be a very old one stanley said looking up at it for it is evident that this wall was thrown down a great many years ago  very old master it is one of our hardest woods and such trees live they say five or six hundred years there are some which are known to be even older than that  well it is clear that the staircase came up here but we have no means of knowing how far the point we reached is below this i should say that the stones we saw are the remains of the pavement and roof for you see these great blocks that formed the walls dont go as far as the middle where there is a great depression still of course the steps may have come up on one side or the other and not just in the middle of this little templefor no doubt it was a temple  now you see the reason for the steps up to that little square room are explained probably those three chambers were the apartments of the principal priests and from them they could either go out on to the roof of the temple or could by taking the upper staircase to this point leave or enter without observation  now let us be off  on arriving at their tree shelter they found that the burman had got a meal ready and after partaking of this meinik with the man started to buy provisions it was fortunate that stanley had before starting from prome drawn some twenty pounds worth of silver from the paymaster he had expected to be away for three or four weeks and during that time would have had to buy provisions for himself harry and the four troopers and might possibly have occasion for money for other matters he had not paid the men from the village for he knew that one of these would willingly accompany him to prome to receive payment for them all  a very small amount of silver sufficed for the purchase of a considerable quantity of food in burma fruit of which many kinds grew wild in the woods was extremely cheap as was rice and grain therefore as yet with the exception of the small sum expended in toungoo his money was virtually untouched  the two burmans made three journeys before nightfall and returned each time with large baskets of fruit grain and rice on the following morning they went into the town and bought six of the largest sized water skinssuch as are carried for the use of the troops in india one on each side of a bullock as soon as they returned with these they started for the temple at a stream about a hundred yards from the entrance they partially filled one of the skins and placing a strong bamboo through the straps sewn on it for the purpose meinik and the burmans carried it to the temple and with stanleys assistance lifted it into the lower chamber the others were one by one placed beside it then water was carried in the smaller skins and poured in until they were all as full as they could hold  there is water enough to last us for a month if needs be stanley said as after securely tying up the mouths they laid the skins down side by side  the smaller mussucks were then filled and placed with the large skins and then having done a long days work they returned to their tree just as the sun was setting the four men and two boys were already there they having done the sixty miles from the village without a halt they had already cooked some rice and some slices of venisonwhich meinik had brought with the water skins from the town that morningand were now lying smoking their cigars with placid contentment  for the next six days meinik went to the town every afternoon on his return on the last evening he said that the guard had told him that the governor had paid a visit to the prison that day and had seen the white captive and had decided that he was now well enough to travel and that in two days time he was to start for ava the court having sent down an urgent order that he should be carried there as soon as he was well enough to bear the fatigue  then tomorrow we must get him out stanley said will our two men be on duty  yes master they have not been on since the last night we were there they will form the second watch and will go on guard at midnight i have bought two very sharp saws and have cut two strong bamboos for the litter  this was constructed the next day it was very simple being formed by sewing a blanket strongly to the two bamboos two slighter bamboos each four feet long were tied loosely to the main poles these were to be lashed across as soon as they had got beyond the palisade so as to keep the poles three feet apartwhich as the blanket was four feet from pole to pole would allow it to bag comfortably the cross pieces could not be attached until they were beyond the palisade for the window was but two feet wide and it was therefore proposed to make the gap through the palisade the same width only  late in the evening they entered the town and sat down in a deserted corner until the time came for them to begin their work at last meinik said that by the stars it was already past midnight and they then proceeded to the spot where they had before climbed the palisade here they at once set to work the saws were well oiled and in a very few minutes five bamboos were cut away at the level of the ground and six feet above it as the stockade was bound together by cross pieces behind the other portions of the bamboos remained in their places  meinik and stanley went first followed by three of the burmans one of whom carried the litter the other two burmans with the boys remained on guard at the opening all were barefooted except that stanley wore a pair of the lightest leather sandals they went noiselessly up to the window the guard as before responding to meiniks hiss without a word one after another entered the chamber the trooper had been sitting at the table evidently anxiously expecting their arrival  stanley went up to the bed  are you better harry he asked in a whisper  better but still weak  everything had been arranged beforehand the litter was laid down on the ground with the poles as far apart as possible then stanley made a sign to the trooper to take one end of the rug on which harry was lying while he took the other the burmans ranged themselves on each side and the blanket was lifted up with the occupant and the pillow composed of his clothes and laid quietly on to the blanket of the litter then two burmans went outside while the other four men lifted the poles and carried one end to the window  the burmans outside held the ends well above their heads stanley and the trooper raising their hands similarly the other burmans then crawled under it out of the window as the litter was moved forward through the window they took the places of stanley and the trooper at the poles and silently moved on towards the palisade stanley and meinik followed joined by the two burmese guards  not the slightest sound was made as the eight men crossed the short distance to the palisade and passed through the opening where the others spear in hand were awaiting them ready to rush in and take part in the fray should an alarm be given stanley breathed a great sigh of relief as they passed out a few paces further they halted and the cross pieces were lashed to the poles  thank god that you are out harry stanley said as soon as they did this has it hurt you much  nothing to speak of harry replied you managed it marvellously am i really outside the place altogether  yes fairly out you will be more comfortable when we have lashed these cross pieces you will not be lying then at the bottom of a bag as you are now  when the work was completed they proceeded at a rapid pace for harrys weight reduced by fever as he had been was a trifle to his bearers the others followed close behind and in a quarter of an hour they were well beyond the town stanley spoke to harry once or twice but received no answer so he had no doubt that his cousin had dozed quietly off to sleep the gentle motion of the litter would be likely to have that effect especially as harry had probably been lying awake for the last night or two listening for the friends who might arrive at any time  when they reached the confines of the forest the torches which had been carried by the boys were all lit and each carried twowith the exception of the bearers who had but one eachwhile all kept close together round the litter they waved their torches as they went and although they heard the cries of several tigers in the forest they had no fear of being attacked as so many waving lights would deter the most hungry beast from venturing near  once in the chamber at the temple the litter was laid down on a pile of reeds and leaves that had been gathered the day before together with a great store of brushwood and logs harry still sleeping quietly in a short time a bright fire was blazing and with this and the light of the torches the chamber assumed quite a cheerful appearance on the way stanley had spoken to the two guards thanked them for their service and assured them that they would receive the reward promised by meinik  i am the british officer he said who was at the village with my friend though i was absent when he was carried off as you see i am disguised  both had shown signs of uneasiness when they approached the temple but meinik had assured them that the spirits would not venture to approach a party having a white man with them and that a night had already been passed in the temple without any harm coming of it a meal consisting of slices of venison was at once prepared and when this was eaten and the whole party had lighted cigars their spirits rose at the success of the enterprise the soldiers however had been disappointed at hearing that there was going to be a stay for some little time there to enable the wounded man to gain strength  we may not stop long stanley said but you see with the litter we could not travel fast and you may be sure by this time the alarm has been given for when they came to relieve you at the end of three hours it would be found that you were missing and then they would at once discover that the captives had gone too by daybreak the whole garrison will be out how many are there of them  there are three thousand men in the town the guard said after a party of your soldiers came within a short distance of it two months ago fifteen hundred men were added to the garrison  well you see with three thousand men they could scour all the woods and if they overtook us we should be unable to make any defence here we may hope that they will not discover us but if they do we can make a desperate resistance for as only one man can enter that door at a time it would be next to impossible for them to force their way in you have your guns and i have a brace of pistols and as all the others have spears it will be as much as the three thousand men could do to get in through that door if they did there is a still narrower door in the corner to defend and beyond that there is a long narrow steep flight of stairs that one man could hold against a host  the first thing in the morning we will carry our stores to the upper chamber we have water and rice enough to last us for a month if we are careful so that although i hope they wont find us i shall not be at all afraid of our beating them off if they do so  as soon as it was daylight the stones that had been added to the steps at the doorway were flung down and then by their united efforts the two remaining steps were removed then they helped each other up the last man being aided by two of his comrades above  there stanley said if they do come to search for us they are not likely to suspect that we have got a badly wounded man up here they may search the big chamber that we were in before and any others there may be on the same level but this narrow entrance ten feet above them is scarcely likely to attract their attention if it does as i said we must fight it out but it will be a wonderfully hard nut for them to crack  he then ordered the men to carry all the stores to the upper chamber just as they began the work there was a slight movement on the bed stanley at once went up to it harry was looking round in a bewildered way  well harry how are you feeling you have had a capital sleep  oh is it you stanley i was not quite sure but that i was dreaming where am i i must have gone off to sleep directly we started for i dont remember anything after you spoke to me when they were making the hammock more comfortable  you are in a templesome four or five thousand years old i should sayand this is a rock chamber the temple itself is in ruins we are ten miles from toungoo and shall wait here till the pursuit for you has slackened in another week you will be more fit to move than you are at present i should not like to carry you far as you are now besides if we had pushed on they would have been sure to overtake us for these fellows can run like hares  but why should not they find us here stanley  well of course they may do so but the entrance to this chamber is ten feet above the ground and another thing is they have all sorts of superstitions about the place nothing would induce them to approach it after nightfall and even in the daytime they dont like coming near it lastly if they do find us it will take them all their time to force their way in i have five men and two young fellows quite capable of fighting then there are your two guards meinik the trooper and myself so you see we muster twelve we have two guns and a brace of pistols and spears for us all and if we cannot defend that narrow passage against any number of burmans we shall deserve our fate  besides there is another and even narrower door in the corner behind you they would have to force that and in the chamber beyond there is a narrow straight staircase some forty feet high which a man with an axe ought to be able to hold against an army they are taking the stores up there now we have got provisions and water for a month when everything is straight there we shall carry you up and unless they sit down in front of this place and regularly starve us out we are as safe as if we were in prome  i wish to goodness you had that hideous dye off you stanley i know it is you by your voice but what with the colour and all that tattooing and your extraordinary hair i dont know you in the least  i am in just the same disguise as that in which i made my way down from ava stanley laughed i felt very uncomfortable at first with nothing on but this short petticoat thing but i have got accustomed to it now and i am bound to say that it is cool and comfortable  now tell me about your wounds  they are not very serious stanley i had a lick across the head with a swordthat was the one that brought me downand a slice taken out of my arm from the elbow nearly up to the shoulder also a spearwound in the side but that was a trifle as it glanced off the ribs if i had been left as i fell and somebody had bound up my wounds at once i should have been all right by this time the fellows did bandage them up to some extent but the movement of the litter set them off bleeding again and i fancy that i lost pretty nearly all the blood in my body i think that it was pure weakness rather than fever that kept me unconscious so long for i gather from the pantomime of the trooper that i must have been nearly a fortnight unconscious  yes you were certainly so when i came the first time harry but i think perhaps on the whole it is lucky that you were you would probably have had a great deal more fever if you had not been so very weak and if you had escaped that and had gone on well you might have been sent off to ava before i could get all the arrangements made for your escape  tell me all about it harry said it seems to me wonderful how you managed it  stanley told him the whole story by the time that he had finished the stores had all been taken upstairs and the fire most carefully extinguished as the smoke would at once have betrayed them the cross pieces of the litter had been taken off to allow harry to be carried in through the door and he was now lifted two of the men took off their cloths and wrapped the materials of the bed into these carrying them up at once as soon as they had gone on harry was slowly and carefully taken to the upper chamber and laid down again on the bed stanley took his place beside him and the rest of the party went down to the lower room having received the strictest orders not to show themselves near the entrance and not to smoke until well assured that their pursuers must have passed on ahead  the bamboos of the litter were converted into a rough ladder and on this meinik took his post at the little window in the second of the lower rooms owing to the immense thickness of the rock wall he did not get an extensive view but he could see the path by which anyone coming up through the forest would approach the temple it was now about halfpast seven and by this time the pursuers might be at hand in ten minutes indeed distant shouts could be heard and stanley at once went down and joined the men below  he placed himself in the line of the doorway as the wall here was four feet thick the room was in semidarkness and standing well back he was certain that his figure could not be perceived by anyone standing in the glare of sunshine outside the sounds grew louder and louder and in a minute or two an officer followed by some twenty men emerged from the trees all paused when they saw the temple the men would have drawn back at once but the officer shouted to them to advance although showing small inclination to do so himself  they were still standing irresolute when a superior officer on horseback followed by some fifty footmen came up the path he shouted orders for them to search the temple and as the fear of him was even greater than their dread of the spirits the whole of the men made their way over the fallen stones and up to the face of the rock they first entered the chamber where the horses had been stabled the officer who had first arrived went in with his men and coming out reported to his senior that there had been a fire made and that some horses had also been there but that three weeks or a month must have passed since then  are you sure of that  quite certain my lord it is extraordinary that anyone should have dared to enter there still less to stable horses when as everyone knows the temple is haunted by evil spirits  i care nothing for spirits the officer said it is men we are in search of go and look into any other chambers there may be  at this moment a deep mournful sound was heard louder and louder it rose and then gradually died away the soldiers stood as if paralysed even the high officialwho had been obliged to leave his horse and make his way across the fallen blocks on footstepped back a pace with an expression of awe he soon recovered himself and shouted angrily to the men to go on but again the dirgelike noise rose louder and louder it swelled and then as gradually died away but this time with a quavering modulation  the men looked up and round some gazed at the upper part of the rock some straight ahead while others turned round and faced the forest  search the officer shouted furiously evil spirits or no evil spirits not a man shall stir from here until the place is searched  then rose a shrill vibrating sound as if of eerie laughter not even the officers authority or the fear of punishment could restrain the soldiers with cries of alarm they rushed across the ruins and plunged into the forest followed at a rate which he tried in vain to make dignified by the officer who as soon as he reached his horse leapt upon it and galloped away  the burmese keenly appreciate a joke and as soon as the troops had fled the villagers and guards inside the temple threw themselves down on the ground and roared with laughter stanley at once made his way into the upper room  splendidly done meinik it was like the note of an organ although i knew what you were going to do i felt almost startled myself when that deep note rose no wonder they were frightened  well at any rate master we are safe for the present  for the present no doubt meinik but i question if we shant hear of them again that officer was a determinedlooking fellow and though he was scared too he stuck to it like a man  that is the governor of the town master i saw him carried through the streets in his chair everyone was bending to the ground as he passed he was a famous general at one time and they say that he is likely to command a part of the army again when fighting begins  well i think that we shall hear of them again meinik i dont suppose that he really thought that we were here for certainly no burman would take up his abode in this place even to save his life they will push on the chase through the woods all day and by that time they will feel sure that they would have overtaken us had we gone straight on then i should not be at all surprised if he tries here again  perhaps he will master like enough he will chop off the heads of some of the men that ran away and pick out some of his best troops for the search still i hope he wont think of it  stanley shook his head  i hope so too meinik there is one thing about which i feel certainif he does find us here he will stay here or at any rate leave some troops here until he gets us he would know that he would get into trouble at ava for letting the prisoners escape and it would be all important for him to recapture them  now we are up here meinik we will go and have a look at that upper staircase again if we are besieged that is our only hope of safety  they again went along the ledge and up the staircase stanley examined the stones that blocked the passage for some time and at last exclaimed  there meinik look along by the side of this stone i can see a ray of light yes and some leaves i dont think they are more than thirty feet above us  meinik applied his eye to the crevice  i see them master yes i dont think those leaves are more than that distance away  that is what i came to look for stanley said it was evident that this rubbish could only be the stones of the root and pavement over the depression in the middle of the ruin and that these could not block up this staircase very far the question is will it be possible to clear them away evidently it will be frightfully dangerous work one might manage to get one stone out at a time in safety but at any moment the loosening of one stone might bring a number of others down with a run and anyone on this narrow staircase would be swept away like a straw  meinik agreed as to the danger  well we need not think it over now meinik but if we are really besieged it is by this way that we must escape if at all we must hope that we shant be beset but if we are we must try here i would rather be killed at once by the fall of a stone on my head than tortured to death  meinik nodded and they descended the stairs put out the torches that they had used there and returned along the ledge to the chamber where harry was lying  so meinik scared them away the latter said as stanley sat down beside him i could not think what he was going to do when he came up here with that long reed as thick as my leg he showed it to me and i saw that it had a sort of mouthpiece fixed into it and he made signs that he was going to blow down it when he did it was tremendous and as it got louder and louder i put my hands to my ears everything seemed to quiver the other rowthat diabolical laughing noisehe made with a smaller one it was frightful but the big note was more like a trombone only twenty times louder  well do you think that we have done with them  i hope so harry at any rate you can be assured that they will never fight their way up here and long before our provisions are finished i have no doubt that i shall be able to hit on some plan of escape  the day passed quietly the woods were as silent as usual the burmans were all in high spirits at the success of meiniks horn when it became dark they hung a blanket before the entrance placed one of the lads on watch just outside it and then lighted a fire stanley took a couple of torches and went up to harry taking the precaution to hang a cloth before the window  i have not said much about thanking you old fellow harry said but you must know how i feel  you had better say nothing about it harry i have only done what you would have done had you been in my place had you been in charge of that party and i had been carried off i know you would have done all in your power to rescue me you might not have succeeded quite so well because you do not know their language but i know that you would have tried after all i have not run anything like so much risk as i did when i rescued meinik from the leopard and he of course was an absolute stranger to me  besides you are not rescued yet and we wont holloa until we are out of the wood  it is very cool and pleasant here harry said after lying without speaking for a few minutes it was dreadfully hot in that hut in the middle of the day and i used to feel that i lost almost as much strength in the day as i picked up at night i am wonderfully better this evening of course that long sleep had something to do with it and the pleasure of being free and with you had still more but certainly the coolness and the air blowing through that opening have counted for something  well we shall feed you up as long as you are here harry and i hope in a fortnight to see you pretty firm on your legs again and then if there is nothing to prevent it we will carry you off triumphantly  meinik here came in with two bowls of broth for they had bought a few earthenware utensils on one of the visits to toungoo  that is first rate harry said as he finished his first one what is it made of  i never ask questions stanley repliedwho tried successfully to keep down a smile meinik is a capital cook and turns out all sorts of nice little dishes here comes his step again  what have you there meinik he asked as the burman entered with two plates  a slice of mutton done on sticks over the fire master and some rice with it  that is first rate harry said heartily when he had finished they did not give me meat in prison i suppose they thought that i was not strong enough for it  they eat very little meat themselves harry now i fancy your dinner is done except some fruit we have got plenty of that  there were however some fried bananas and harry declared that he had feasted like a king  if this goes on stanley i will wager that i shall be about in a week and shall be offering to run a race with you in a fortnight  you will be a good deal longer than that before you are fit to walk any distance still with a good appetitewhich you are sure to have after your illnessplenty of food and the cool air in these caves i do expect that you will pick up fast  the next day passed quietly  i shall be glad when tomorrow is over stanley said to meinik the last thing before going up to harrys cell today i expect they are all marching back again and if they pay us another visit it will be early tomorrow morning be sure that two men are on watch they can relieve each other every hour and i shall come down myself occasionally to see that all is right but i dont think that even the governor could get his men to come near this place after dark  we will keep good watch master but i have no fear of their coming    chapter 15 the attack   stanley got up several times during the night and went below to the watches as he felt sure they would be nervous for though they had now to a large extent got over their superstitious fears they would still be timid at night they reported that everything was still round the temple but that they had heard distant sounds in the woods and on the first of these occasions he had after returning to the room above gone out on to the ledge and from that height could see the reflection in the sky of a number of fires extending in a semicircle at a distance of a mile or so from the temple from this he felt convinced that the governor was determined to have a thorough search made in the morning  as soon as it was daylight the sound of the blowing of horns and the beating of drums was heard in the forest and half an hour later a large body of men poured out from the trees headed by the governor himself  now he shouted this place is to be searched in every hole and corner  as to the evil spirits there is no fear of them either by day or night did you ever hear of their attacking a large body of men they may strangle a single traveller who ventures into their haunts but no one ever heard of a burmese army being attacked by them now every man has to do his duty and the first who wavers his head is to be struck off at once  forward  the troops rushed impetuously across the ruins penetrated into the various chambers in the rock and in a few minutes all these were reported to be empty  there are chambers higher up the governor said we will search them andlook at that door up there it must lead to somewhere bring stones and make a stair up to it  it was evident now that there was no longer any hope of concealment and stanley stepped to the entrance  my lord governor he shouted there is a strong force here and all your army could not gain an entrance we do not wish to take the lives of brave men but if we are attacked we must defend ourselves and i pray you to withdraw with them and not to throw away life  this address from an apparent peasant excited the wrath of the governor who shouted  shoot him men  but before the order could be obeyed stanley had stepped back into the chamber where he had already ordered the men to stand out of the line of the door a number of muskets were fired and several bullets struck the back wall of the chamber the firing continued and stanley said  keep where you are men until they have finished then approach the door for directly they begin the attack the men behind must stop firing they will be some minutes yet  he ran quickly up to harrys room  they are attacking us harry exclaimed oh how i wish i could come down and help  they can never get in harry british soldiers might do it but not these fellows they can only enter two abreast and with a dozen spear points facing them what can they do i thought that i would just come up and tell you it was all right it will take them five minutes at least to pile up stones level with the doorway  stanley again joined those below meinik the trooper and one of the burmese were to form the first line the four other burmese were to stand behind with their spears between the men in front the two guards with their muskets and the boys were to act as a reserve stanley had armed himself with one of the axes and was to stand by the side of the entrance so that if the spearmen were pressed back and any of the assailants succeeded in passing the entrance he would strike them down  presently there was a silence outside  keep well back he said they have laid their stones and we shall have a rush directly but they will most likely pour in a volley first  the pause lasted for a minute or two then a drum was beaten and a hundred muskets were fired a rain of bullets flew into the cave  now stanley shouted form up  illustration in vain the burmese tried to force their way into the chamber  a wild yell was raised by the burmese now they knew that they were fighting human foes their courage returned and there was a rush of men up the pile of stones to the entrance but in vain they tried to force their way into the chamber those in front fell pierced by the spears and while the defenders could see their figures against the light the assailants coming out from the sunshine could see nothing in the chamber which was now darkened by their filling up the entrance not once was it necessary for stanley to strike the burmans spears did their work thoroughly and in two or three minutes the entrance was nigh choked up with dead bodies adding to the difficulty of the assailants  pressed on by those behind the foremost fell over these obstacles and were instantly pierced by the spears until it was no longer possible to get through the outer entrance much less make their way into the chamber again and again the attack was repeated and as often repulsed before advancing the burmese each time endeavoured to clear the passage by drawing out the bodies of their comrades but the two guards now posted themselves in front and shot man after man who made the attempt at last the burmese drew off but not till some fifty or sixty had been killed  the governor was seen gesticulating furiously to a party of officers and presently a final attack was made led by several officers of rank this was as unsuccessful as the others the bodies indeed of the killed now forming a wellnigh impassable barrier and after several of the officers and many of the bravest men had fallen the remainder withdrew suddenly the governor appeared to recognize that the task was an impossible one and two or three hundred men were at once set to work felling trees and by nightfall a high stockade had been erected round the open ground in front of the temple  they are going to try to starve us out stanley said there is no more chance of fighting tonight  as soon as the stockade was finished musketeers took their place behind it and opened a dropping fire at the entrance while the woodcutters continued to fell trees  we must get rid of these dead bodies if we can stanley said or the place will be uninhabitable in a day or two  get those two bamboos we had for the litter meinik we will push the bodies out one by one beginning with those on the top of the heap we can keep down behind the shelter of the pile till we have got most of them out after that we must take our chance of a shot  it took them some hours work but at last the passage was cleared and the bodies all thrown outside the fire was lighted in the next room and stanley bidding two men listen attentively for any movement went up again to harryto whom he had paid a flying visit as soon as the burmese drew off  we cannot risk having a light here harry he said i dont want them to have any idea that this chamber which is nearly fifty feet above the entrance is in any way connected with the rooms below if such an idea struck them they might lower men from above by ropes and so take us in the rear  did you say that we are regularly shut up in front by that stockade  yes there is certainly no getting out that way behind you know it is a sheer wall of rock and the only possibility that i can see is that we may clear a staircase which runs up through the rock from a ledge on the level of this room to the ruins of a building above at present the upper part is entirely choked up with blocks of stone and rubbish and it will be a very awkward job to get through it but so far it seems to me it is that or nothing  what are they going on chopping down trees for  i believe their general is doing it to bring large numbers of his troops close up to the stockade partly perhaps to keep up the spirits of the front line by their company partly to render impossible any attempt on our part to make our way out by a sudden rush of course they dont know what our strength is but they have had so sharp a lesson today that they will take every precaution in future  well what is it meinik  we have been talking together master and we think that if we were to call out that they might take the bodies away without any interference by us they would do so several officers of rank have fallen there and it is our custom always to carry off the dead when it is possible  it would be worth trying the experiment anyhow meinik but we must all stand to arms while they are doing it as they might make a sudden rush however we would risk that for those bodies have been worrying me very much and i would give anything to have them taken away i will go down with you  meinik accordingly went down to the entrance and shouted out  peace peace i am ordered by the english officer to say that he would wish those who have fought so bravely to be honoured after death and that no shot shall be fired and no interference made with those who come to carry away the dead  there was silence for two or three minutes and then a voice called back  it is well for two hours there shall be peace between us  i have no doubt the governor is as glad to do this as we are it is considered a disgrace if the dead are not carried off the ground to burial and if he sends despatches to ava he will be glad to be able to put in that the brave men who fell have all been buried with due honours besides meinik it would not be encouraging to his troops for them to have that pile of dead bodies before them and indeed would be enough to cause a pestilence in a few days  the men were formed up again round the entrance the burmese did their work silently occasionally a slight movement was heard but no one could have imagined that a hundred men were busy outside a number of them carried torches and all worked steadily and in good order under the direction of two or three officers one of the posts of the stockade had been pulled up and through this the bodies were carried it was less than two hours before a horn sounded and there was a loud call of  the peace is over all is done  beyond the stockade great fires blazed among the trees the work of chopping down the forest continued and by the morning the ground had been cleared for a distance of thirty or forty yards from the paling then the burmese raised another stockade forty feet behind the first so that if by carelessness or treachery the besieged should manage to pass through the first line there would yet be another in front of them  i expect master meinik said as standing well back he watched the men at work the general is building this second line not because he thinks that there is a chance of our getting through the first but to keep the men at work so as to prevent them from thinking anything about the spirits now that they have passed one night there they will have got somewhat over their fear and of course every day that passes without ill befalling them they will think less and less about the evil ones  do you believe in them meinik  meinik hesitated  everyone knows master that evil spirits guard the treasures of the people that lived in the land long long ago no one can doubt that people who have rashly sought the treasures have been found dead with staring eyes and swollen bodies but as at present they must know well that neither we nor those outside are searching for treasure they may not interfere  then you think that there are treasures buried here somewhere  i cannot say master everyone says so the story has been handed down that this was once the greatest of the temples of the old people and that when they were defeated by tribes from the easti know not whether it was us or some people before usthe priests from all the other temples came here the remains of their army came here too and fought outside the temple until all were killed  when the conquerors entered they found the priests all lying in regular lines on the pavements all were dead one story is that they had stabbed themselves another that they had taken poison at any rate no treasures were found although it was known that the riches of the temple were great and that all the other priests that had come here had brought the treasures from their temples with them that was the beginning of the destruction of the place for the pavement was torn up and the walls in some places levelled and the images of the gods broken up in search for the treasures  the work of the guardian spirits had already begun they say that all who took part in the search died of a terrible pestilence that broke out since that time the place has been accursed once or twice kings have sent bodies of troops to search and they say that some could never find the temple but wandered about the forest for days searching in vain for it others found so thick a darkness like the blackest of smoke filling the forest that even the bravest dare not enter i say not that those things were so i only say that these are the stories that have come down to us  well meinik we are not going to search for the treasure and it is evident that the spirits bear us no ill will indeed i feel obliged to them for it is likely enough that the soldiers will put down their misfortune to their influence and that even the governor may feel that it would be useless to try to get them to renew the assault this evening we will go up and have another look at the stairs and see how we can best set to work to clear them there is no great hurry about it but the sooner we set to work the better  all day long a dropping fire was maintained on the entrance by the troops behind the first stockade but as with the exception of three men kept always on watch the defenders were stationed in the next chamber the bullets pattered harmlessly against the wall during the night the accumulated dust of ages had been swept up from the floor and this had been strewn three inches deep in the passage between the outer air and the chamber so as to cover the blood that had been shed there  as soon as it was quite dark stanley meinik and three of the villagers went out on to the ledge in front of the upper opening made their way along it to the entrance of the stairs and mounted they carried with them two or three glowing brands from the fire in one of the earthenware cooking pots which was covered with a cloth to prevent the slightest glow being noticed by the enemy the men by stanleys order brought with them the bamboos of the litter the saw they had used at the stockade a hatchet and some blocks of firewood  when they got to the point where the steps were choked up they lighted the two torchesthe men who brought up the rear of the party holding up a rug to prevent any reflection from the torches being seen outside when stanley and meinik had again examined the obstacle the latter retired and the burmans one by one came up and looked at it  what do you think of it stanley asked them  it would be dangerous to touch it my lord one of them said if only one stone moved out from its place it would be death to us all they are firm now quite firm but if two or three were disturbed the whole might come down at once  i quite see that stanley said can any of you suggest a plan by which we could get out without much risk of setting them in motion  the burmese were silent  i will tell you my scheme then i propose to cut the bamboos into lengths that will just reach across the passage it is the lower stones that one is most afraid of so long as these remain fixed there is no fear of any general movement but if they went the whole mass might come down this passage is less than three feet wide and the bamboos are twelve feet long so that each would make four the width of the passage i propose to drive them tightly in and fix them firmly with wedges they must be put in so that they will actually touch the stones so as to prevent their making the slightest downward movement if they began to slide no doubt they would carry away the bamboos but if these were fixed firmly by wedges they ought to be sufficient to prevent any movement from taking placeespecially as there would be enough of them almost to touch each other extending from this lowest step on which the rocks rest some five feet upwardsthat is to within some two feet of the roof which would be sufficient for us to crawl through and the bamboos would serve as a ladder then i propose that we should work our way along the top passing the small stones and rubbish backwards after filling up all the cracks and crevices below us  i see of course that we should meet with many obstacles great stones may be sticking up perhaps jammed against the roof these would have to be broken off or chipped in pieces no doubt the work will take time but at any rate there is plenty of food for three weeks and working by turns night and day we ought to be able to burrow our way out as we get on we may not find the stones so tightly pressed together as they are here at any rate as we saw the light above us only some thirty feet up there ought not to be above twenty feet of closelypacked stuff to get through  no doubt the work will be dangerous as well as hard but as we know that if we do not succeed all our lives are forfeited we can face the danger everyone of us will take his share in turn i shall do so myself and shall direct the work in general what do you think of the plan  i think that it is possible master meinik said at any rate we must try it since it is the only way that offers us any chance of life  the burmese all agreed and they at once set to work the bamboos were first cut into lengths and then by means of the axe and wedges were jammed so firmly from side to side that it would have required great force to dislodge them these supports were somewhat irregularly placed as it was necessary that they should absolutely touch the stones as they proceeded with the work the spaces behind the bamboos were filled tightly up with rubble so as to solidify the whole  when the last support was in its place stanley said  now meinik do you with these three work tonight four others will take your place before dawn mind at first i dont want you to attempt to move any fixed stones but simply to clear away all small stones and rubble you can stow a good deal behind the two upper bamboos the rest you must put on the stairs i will see tonight what we can manage in the way of tools for chipping away the big stones that cannot be moved you had better relieve each other very often the three who are not at work should sit down on the ledge outside so that any stone accidentally dislodged will not fall on anyone every ten minutes one will come up to take the place of the man at work be sure that each as he passes up or down replaces the blanket carefully  they had indeed before beginning to saw up the bamboos fastened the blanket to one of the cross pieces of the stretcher and cutting this to the width of the passage had jammed it close up to the roof so that the curtain hanging down effectually shut off the light  stanley then descended the steps and rejoined harry below before going down further stanley who had during the day informed harry of his plan told him of the start that they had made  of course it all depends upon what stones you meet with harry said if you come to a big solid block i dont see how you are going to get through it  we have the hatchets and can whittle it away and perhaps we can make some chisels from the ramrods of your guards guns a lot can be done with patience and plenty of hands  stanley then went down below and explained to the others the plan proposed the news gave them great satisfaction for although meinik had told them there was a staircase above blocked with stones it had seemed so impossible to him to clear it that he had placed no stress upon the fact and the preparations made by the enemy to cut off any possible retreat had greatly depressed them  stanley took one of the iron ramrods and raking some of the embers from the fire placed it in them about a foot from one end then he directed the others to fan the embers until they raised them almost to white heat taking the ramrod out he laid the edge of one of their knives upon it and striking its back with a stone soon cut through the glowing rod he repeated the operation and had then three short rods of equal length he now heated one end of each and laying it on an axe on the ground hammered it into chisel shape with the back of a light hatchet repeating this several times until it had the required shape and sharpness then he plunged this into a pot of water he did the same with the other two and had now three chisels with which he hoped to be able to chip away the stones the other ramrod he left intact except that he sharpened one end  then going up to harrys room he lay down and slept for some hours putting the two boys on watch and bidding the trooper look after them the two burmans with one of the guards were to go to work with him several times he woke the last time on looking out he thought that there was a faint light in the sky and going down called up the three men and bidding them bring up the two heavy axes a light hatchet and the three short chisels he led them up the steps to the working party  how have you got on meinik  we have cleared four feet master but there is a big stone sticking up now and we can do nothing with it  we will have a try and do you all go down at once  take off your cloth one of you and fill it with this rubbish on the steps do it as quickly as you can the day will be breaking in a few minutes  stanley now climbed up and investigated the passage the bottom was level every crack and crevice between the stones being filled up with rubbish the obstacle meinik had spoken of evidently formed part of a flat slab it reached within an inch of the roof and at one side touched the rock wall at the other there was an interval of some four or five inches and the earth and rubbish had already been scraped out from behind it putting his hand in he found that the block was some four inches in thickness  he thought that if he could but get a fair blow at it with the back of one of the heavy axes he might break it off but this was impossible the total width of the passage did not exceed three feet and as the men had as they went worked down somewhat there was now about thirty inches between the bed of earth and rubbish on which he was lying and the roof taking the handle of the axe in both hands he used the head as a battering ram but without any success he then called up the slightest of the three men and told him to crawl in beside him and with their united strength they pounded the stone for some time finding that nothing could be done this way stanley sent the man back again and then taking one of the three chisels and a small hatchet he proceeded to mark a line along the bottom of the stone and then for ten minutes worked away on it with the chisel and hammer then he called up one of the others and showed him what he was to do all day they worked by turns and though progress was very slow by nightfall the groove was half an inch deep  stanley and the strongest burman then went in together and lying on their backs again tried the effect of the heavy axe but still without success then stanley told the man to get down and take out the wedge at the top of the axe and to cut away the wood below the head so that the latter would slip down four or five inches then to take off the head of the other heavy axe and put it on above it and replace the wedge in a few minutes the man rejoined him  we must strike it as near the roof as we can stanley said both grasped the handle firmly we will sway it backwards and forwards three times and the third time strike  one two threehooray  as the twoheaded axe driven with their united force struck the stone there was a sharp crack  that has done it stanley said turning over  there was a dark line along the groove and the top of the stone inclined back two inches from the perpendicular being kept in its place by the rubbish behind it stanley put his hand into the hole and got his fingers behind the stone while the burmese put the chisel into the crack and used it as a lever in two or three minutes the stone was moved out of its position taken out of the hole and laid down on the steps  half an hour later meinik came up with a trooper another guard and one of the boys and was delighted to find that the obstacle which had seemed to him fatal to their hopes had been removed stanley showed how they had carried out the work and then with his party went down into the rock chambers  it was pretty tiring work harry he said though we were only at it about a quarter of an hour at a time my wrists and arms and shoulders are aching as if i had been beaten with sticks tomorrow i will take up a good supply of firewood the chisels got blunted before we had worked an hour and we should get on a deal faster if we could sharpen them frequently  is the stone hard  no it is a sort of marble i think we had the underpart of the slab on our side and i did not think of looking when we took it down anyhow it was not very hard and with a good strong chisel and a short heavy hammer i am sure we could have done it in an hour  anyhow it is a comfort that nothing came down on top of us i examined the pile carefully and there had not been the slightest movement among the lower stones so that part of the difficulty seems to have been got over  now i must go down and get something to eat and then i will go in for a good sleep you are feeling all right i hope  could not be doing better stanley i have eaten three solid meals today and have been sitting up on the edge of my bed for some time i tried standing but it was no go still i do think that in a day or two i shall manage it  for six days the work continued one party watched another slept and the third worked by turns some of the stones gave much greater trouble than the first they had met with but having the fire close by proved a great assistance as the chisels could be frequently sharpened the men became more accustomed to the work and the steady progress they made greatly excited their hopes  at the end of the week but one stone barred the way this however was much the most formidable that they had encountered it seemed to have been a pillar or a huge gate post and was square measuring some twenty inches on each face the obstacle was all the more formidable as the upper end was inclined towards them greatly increasing the difficulty in using the chisel beyond this as far as they could see there was merely a mass of smaller stones  the party who had been working upon this block were much disheartened when stanley went up to relieve them owing to the inclination of the stone their chisels could get but little bite and though they had been working for six hours at it they had scarcely made any impression indeed at only one point had they so far broken the face that the chisel would cut meinik had come down two hours before to report to stanley the nature of the obstacle and when he went up he took with him the second ramrod which had not hitherto been used  he saw at once that as meinik had told him it would be impossible to get through this block by the same means as before for as the groove deepened the labour would become greater and greater and from the inclination of the stone they would in time arrive at a point where the axe could no longer be used to strike the chisel  the point at which the slight indentation had been made was nearly at the corner of the stone this was gradually enlarged by hammering upon it with the head of the axe and after an hours work the surface had been so far pounded that the chisel could get a flat hold upon it then stanley and one of the burmans lay down and placed the cutting end of the long ramrod against it and the others by turns struck the end with the back of a light hatchet those holding the rod turning it slightly after each blow every half hour the edge of the chisel was resharpened and by the time the next party relieved them a hole of half an inch in diameter and two inches deep had been drilled in the stone stanley remained with the newcomers for half an hour instructing them in the work and then went below  well stanley what are you going to do with this monstrous stone meinik tells me of  there is only one thing to do with it harry that is to blast it the block is so inclined that one can do nothing with the chisels and we are now drilling a hole i dont know that i shall succeed but at any rate i am going to have a try if it fails i must hit on some other way the provisions are holding out all right and meinik calculates that with a little stinginess we could manage for another three weeks we have drilled the hole in two inches today and as we get more accustomed to the work i dare say we could do three inches in each shift the block is twenty inches through on the straight and may be two feet on the line that we follow so that in four days we shall be nearly through it  in three weeks we shall have made five holes which will weaken it so that we may be able to break it off however i hope we shall find one hole sufficient i shall make it fifteen inches deep and then charge it with the contents of a dozen cartridges i think that ought to do it  in two days and a half the hole was of the required depth harry had progressed so rapidly that he was able that morning to walk across his room  we must try the shot at once stanley said because if it fails we must go on working if it succeeds we can if we like wait for another week before we make off by that time you will be strong enough to be got through that low passage and walk for a little distance when we can cut some poles and rig up that hammock again  do you know anything about mining for i know nothing i only had an idea how to drill the hole from seeing some engineers at work at agra years ago but i am sure i dont know how they fired the shot or prepared it  i can tell you a little about it stanley for i have been down a coal mine once or twice and watched the men doing it they first of all put in the charge then they put in a wooden rod just the thickness of the fuse they use then they dropped in a little dry dust round it which they pressed down very carefully with a small wooden rod then they damped some dust and hammered that down hard after putting in about half an inch of this they used dust slightly moistened beating it down as before when it was quite full they pulled out the centre stick and put the fuse into the hole that it left  we have not got any fuse stanley said but i think that if we take a narrow strip of cloth moisten it and rub gunpowder into it let it dry and then roll it up it would be all right then we could lay a train of damp powder to it set the end alight and bolt  i should think that that would do harry agreed but you would have to bolt very sharp for if it went off before you got to the bottom of the steps it might be very awkward  i dont think the effect of the shock will be as great as that harry it may crack the stone but i should hardly think it would send anything flying out of the hole    chapter 16 rejoining   every day since the siege had begun the defenders had fired an occasional shot at the stockade not with any idea of doing any damage but in order that the assailants should know that they were still in the cavern that evening when the hole had got to the proper depth stanley having prepared his fuse went up with twenty cartridges in his pocket accompanied by meinik the hole was charged and tamped and the fuse inserted this took a considerable time the fuse had been cut so that an inch of it projected outside the hole the other eight cartridges were then broken up and the powder moistened and a train some two feet long laid from the fuse towards the entrance of the hole then a piece of rag was wrapped round one end of the ramrod and this again was tied to a long rod that had the night before been cut by one of the boys who had slipped out noiselessly from the entrance the rag had been moistened and rubbed with gunpowder  now meinik stanley said everything is ready this rod is sixteen feet long so that lying down my feet will be just at the edge of the hole and i shall be able to drop down as soon as i have lighted the train and bolt i shall fix a torch a foot or so from the train then i shall only have to lift the rod to it light the rag set fire to the train and then slide down and bolt  now you must go down first  no master meinik said firmly i will light the train i do not think that there is any danger but whether there is or not i shall undertake it if i am killed it does not matter while if you were killed all would be lost for if the explosion did not burst the stone i am sure that we should never be able to get through it without you to direct us no master if you stay i stay and that would only lessen our chances of running down the steps in time  stanley argued and even ordered but meinik was obstinate and seeing that the faithful burman was not to be moved he reluctantly left the matter in his hands and went downstairs he moved a short distance along the ledge and waited the time seemed an age to him so that he gave an exclamation of delight when meinik suddenly came into sight and took his place beside him  i have lit the train master the powder fizzed up but did not seem to burn very fast  it was indeed another two minutes before a deep muffled roar was heard there was no further noise but they heard shouts from the burmans behind the stockades  they will be wondering what the sound is stanley said but they will not be able to tell from what direction it came for i expect they were pretty nearly all sound asleep now let us go up and see the result  they made their way up the steps which were now in entire darkness the curtain still hung in its place some ten feet below the obstacle they lit a torch from the embers in the pan and then stanley climbed up into the passage and hastily crawled along  he gave a cry of satisfaction as he approached the end the explosion had been completely successfulthe end of the block lay on the ground whether the whole of it had been blown off or not he could not see but he felt sure that the greater portion must have split off it was evident that it would take a considerable amount of time and would require the strength of several men to get the block out they therefore descended at once to gladden the hearts of those below with the news that the way out was now available to them whenever they chose to leave  harry manifested no surprise whatever at the news  i made sure that you would succeed stanley after getting me off as you did and making your own escape before it seems to me that you have got hold of the open sesame of ali baba and have only to use the cabalistic words to walk in and out wherever you want to go  i dont feel by any means so certain of my own powers as you seem to be harry and i can assure you i was very doubtful whether that shot would succeed i hoped at any rate that it would blow a good bit of the stone out and in that case we could have got the chisels to work again it was the slanting position of the block that beat us however thank goodness the work is done now and you have only to get a bit stronger and we will be off  i am quite ready to start now stanley i think it is absurd waiting any longer for there is never any saying what might take place that burmese general who seems to be an obstinate beggar might take it into his head to place a guard on the top of the hill and then all your labour will have been thrown away  that is true enough harry and as i really dont think that travelling now would be likely to do you any serious harm i will decide on tomorrow at any rate i will take some men up at once and get that stone out  the task was a difficult one the block of stone was so nearly the size of the passage that they could not get a rope round behind it and after trying for two hours in vain they determined that the only course was to push it before them they soon found however that this was impossible and that a part at least of the stone was remaining in its place finally they succeeded in pushing a loop in the rope over the top of the block and then by main force eight of them pulled it out of the hole and lowered it on to the top step  by the time that they had done this dawn was approaching and they therefore returned at once to the chambers below  the men were all much pleased when stanley told them that they would leave that night confident as they felt that the burmese could not force their way in a new feeling of nervousness seized them now that the way was open lest some unforeseen circumstances might occur to prevent their going the rice that remained was made up into three or four packages the meat had long before been finished  stanley had a discussion with meinik as to how harry had best be taken through the passage he could they agreed walk along the ledge with one before and one behind to steady him and could then be carried up the steps in a blanket by four men he must of course be lifted into the passage and dragged through it to the end after that it would be easy enough six men could carry him in a blanket until far enough away for them to chop poles without the sound of the axes being heard by the burmese  from the time they began their work every pains had been taken to deaden sounds the blanket hung across the passage had acted as a muffler to some extent but a piece of cloth had always been tied over the hammer heads of the axes to prevent the sharp clinking sounds of the blows on the chisels or stone being heard  as soon as it was dark enough for them to pass along the ledge meinik went with stanley to examine the ground fortunately the portion of stone that remained above the level and prevented the rock from being rolled back was but small and they were able to break it up in half an hour with the axes then making their way along without difficulty for another four feet they found themselves standing upright in the depression in the centre of the ruin mounting six more steps they were among the bushes that covered the site of the temple  they now carefully cleared away every fragment of stone from the floor of the passage and returning stanley gave orders for the start to be made two or three shots were fired from the lower entrance to show the enemy that they were there and on the watch and then all went up to harrys room he had been dressed for the first time and was ready for the start two of the strongest of the burmans went on first  now harry you are to put your hands on my shoulders meinik will follow close behind you and will keep his arms round you in case you need help of course we shall go along very slowly  i dont think that all these precautions are necessary harry said i am sure that i can walk that distance easily enough why you say the stair is only about forty feet  i dare say you could harry but we dont want to run any risks your head is not very strong at present and you might turn giddy or you might stumble so at present you will have just to do as you are told  let us start  harry did not find it as easy as he had expected getting out through the lower opening and he was by no means sorry to have the support of stanley and meinik as he proceeded along the ledge they moved very carefully and slowly and all were greatly relieved when he sat down on a blanket laid on the steps  now lie back harry we shall have no difficulty in getting you up here  two burmans took the upper end of the blanket stanley and meinik the lower and they were soon at the top of the steps  you are not very heavy now harry but you are a good deal heavier than you were when we brought you in below  now the next is the most difficult part of the workonce we get you through this passage it will be plain sailing you see you will have to be dragged the place is only two feet high so that it would be impossible to lift you at all we have made the floor as smooth as we can but i am afraid that there are a good many projecting corners that will try you a good deal  it cannot be helped stanley fire away as soon as you like  the rest of the party were now all gathered on the steps below and meinik and stanley getting up first into the hole received harry as the others lifted him and with the aid of two of the burmans laid him on his blanket in the passage  now stanley said to the two men who took the other end of the blanket keep it as tight as you can and when i say lift we will all lift together and move him forward a few inches do not hurry over itwe have plenty of time before us  they were packed so closely that they had each but one arm available little by little they moved him along gaining some six inches each time then all had to move so as to place themselves for the next effort however in five or six minutes they had him through and carried him up into the open air the rest of the party at once joined them and with three of the natives on each side of the blanket they were soon beyond the circle of ruins and making at a brisk pace through the forest after going for a quarter of a mile they stopped cut some poles for the hammock and in a short time were on their way again having placed in it one of the bags of rice as a pillow for harry  they travelled for some hours and then halted to cook some rice all had slept a good deal during the day so that after resting for an hour they proceeded on their way again they had no fear whatever of pursuit and the only danger that they could incur was from meeting with a band similar to that which had carried harry off when they rigged up the hammock they had cut wood for torches to protect themselves from tigers these were thrown away as soon as daylight broke  at midday they halted again for another hour and then continuing their journey arrived at the village before nightfall they were received with great joy the villagers setting up a shout of welcomethe friends of the men and boys being especially exuberant in their joy for they had become extremely anxious at their long absence the two troopers were still there and these saluted stanley with less than the usual stiff formality of the mohammedan soldier  he himself laughed  i dont look much like a british officer at present he said in their language well has everything been quiet here  yes sahib a sowar brought us orders from the general to remain here and to send at once if we heard any news of you we sent off one of the villagers when the man came back to fetch the others and said that you had good hopes of getting lieutenant brooke sahib out of the hands of the burmese  i will write a note stanley said get your horse saddled at once directly we have made mr brooke comfortable i will give you the letter  during the time that stanley had been absent the houses had been reerected and the village had assumed its general appearance a hut was at once handed over to them and harry laid on a bamboo pallet he had not slept most of the way down  you see i was quite right stanley i told you that the journey would be nothing  fortunately it has turned out so meinik has already killed a chicken and will make it into broth for you it will be a change for you after your diet of rice the cooking was excellent for the first three or four days but it fell off sadly that was one of the reasons why i gave way to your wish to start at once you have done wonderfully well but a constant diet of rice is not quite the thing for building up a sick man  now i am going to write a few lines to the general to say that you have got safely down but will need at least another week before you are able to sit on a horse of course you can be carried on but i think that the air here is a great deal more healthy and bracing than it is at prome and the longer you stay here the better  stanleys note was a short one it merely said that he had succeeded in getting his cousin and the trooper who was carried off at the same time from the hands of the burmese but that harry was still very weak and that if he himself could be spared he would stay with him at the village for another week or ten days at the end of which time he would ride by easy stages to prome  three days later the trooper returned with a note from the general  i congratulate you most heartily on having rescued your cousin he wrote by all means stay where you are until he is quite strong again this place is not at all healthy at present we shall not be moving forward for another three weeks  stanley remained at the village for another fortnight and at the end of that time harry had so far recovered that he was quite capable of making a short days journey on horseback two of the men who had aided in the rescue had gone to prome with an order from stanley on the staff paymaster for the rewards that had been promised to the villagers and the two burmese soldiers they returned with the money and the men were all highly delighted at the result of the expedition  stanley retained the services of the two soldiers as long as he remained in the village he had no fear whatever of the same band returning that had before visited the village and he learned that no others had been heard of in the neighbourhood but at the same time he thought it as well that a man should be on guard night and day at each end of the village the peasants agreed to watch at one end while the two burmese soldiers and the troopers took charge of the other end the bulk of the villagers were engaged in forming a strong stockade round it to defend themselves in case of further attack and stanley promised to send them down twenty muskets and a supply of ammunition as soon as he got to prome  there was real regret on the part of the burmese when the time came for the party to start it had been something altogether new to them to have officials among them who paid for everything these englishmen had treated them kindly and were pleased and contented with everything the money that the five men and two boys had earned had enriched the village and had enabled them to more than replace their losses by the recent raid and if stanley had accepted all the presents of fruit fowls and eggs they would have given him he would have needed a couple of extra horses to convey them a strong pony had been purchased for meinik and after taking a hearty leave of the villagers the party rode off  i wish we had such a good cook as your man is stanley harry said as they journeyed along at a walk i never tasted better soup than he serves up i must really get him to teach our mess cook how to make it  do you know what it is harry  i have not the least idea it might be anything i think that it tasted to me more like stewed eels than anything else  you are not very far out it is made of the creatures you turned up your nose atsnakes  nonsense stanley  it is i can assure you i would not tell you before because it might have set you against it that soup you had in the cave was made from snake flesh the recesses in parts of the caves swarmed with them and the men laid in quite a store of them before we were besieged unfortunately they would not keep well even in these cool chambers so we had to fall back on rice you liked it so much that though there was no occasion to have gone on with snake soup after we got to the village i continued to give it to you for it is very nourishing  well i am glad you did not tell me at the time but i must own that it was excellent and i think that in future i shall have no objection to snake in that form  they are just as good in other ways stanley replied the burmans are no fools and i consider that snake and lizards are very much better eating than their mutton which is tasteless stuff at the best  we shall have to have a big settlement when we get back stanley of course all those men you paid and the guards you bribed are entirely my account to say nothing of my share of the general expenditure  the general expenses are practically nothing harry i invited you to come with me and of course you were my guest as to the other matter that also is my business i would not say so if i had not plenty of funds but what with my pay as interpreter and the year of back pay that i got when the gazette came out i have plenty out of my income to pay for it without breaking in upon the amount i told you i had got for those rubies  i should pay you stanley if you were rolling in money not that i should mind taking money from you if i wanted it but my expenses since i landed here have not been anything approaching my pay and allowances and i have besides as i told you an income of 500 pounds a year of my own you have risked your life for me and i am not going to let you pay the piper as well  all right if it pleases you harry i am delighted at having been able to save you and just at present money does not seem an important matter one way or the other so if it really would be a satisfaction to you to pay i will certainly not deprive you of it  although they only travelled ten miles the first day harry acknowledged that he was as tired as a dog when he dismounted and was so stiff the next morning that he had to be helped on to his horse however this gradually wore off and on the evening of the fourth day they arrived at prome leaving harry at his regimental camp stanley rode to the headquarters and there dismounted meinik had led the second horse after harry dismounted and now took them both across to the lines with the air of a man who has only been away a few hours stanley at once went up to the general  welcome back lad sir archibald said you have been longer away than we expected when you started i am glad indeed that you succeeded in rescuing your cousin and we are all burning to hear about it i wrote that note to you in a hurry for i was on the point of going on a round of inspection of the camp when your sowar arrived i intended to question him concerning you on my return for i had no idea that after making such a long journey he would start back at once but i found that he had ridden straight off directly the note was handed to him you must dine with me today and tell me all the story i see from the colour of your skin that you have been in disguise again  yes sir there were materials for dyeing the skin in the village but nothing that availed to take it off it is gradually going and as i shall be now able to get some strong alkali from the doctor i hope i shall be presentable by tomorrow  they are honourable marks the general said with a smile i dont think any of us would mind being so coloured for a bit if we had done such good work as you have but i wont detain you now for dinner will be ready in half an hour  stanley hurried to his room took a bath donned his mess uniform and was ready by the time the bugle sounded three or four of the staff were as usual members of the party after the meal was over he was requested to narrate his adventures at full length the story was necessarily a long one and when he concluded all joined the general in hearty commendation for the manner in which he had carried out the adventure  your last story was a stirring one mr brooke the general said but this is even more so when i received your first note i thought it next door to madness for you to try to get your cousin badly wounded as you knew him to be from the hands of the burmese it is not an easy thing to get any man out of prison but when the man was unable to help himself it seemed wellnigh impossible and i was greatly afraid that instead of saving his life you would lose your own of course the fact that you had successfully traversed the country before was strongly in your favour but then you were unencumbered and the two things were therefore not to be compared with each other i shall of course put you in orders tomorrow as having performed a singularly gallant action in rescuing lieutenant brooke of the 47th and a sowar from their captivity by the burmese in a prison at toungoo  you have arrived just in time for after endeavouring to fool us for the past three months by negotiations never meant to come to anything the enemy are now advancing in great force and are within a few miles of the town so we are likely to have hot work of it for from all accounts they have got nearly as large an army together as bandoola had i dont know whether they have learned anything from his misfortunes but i am bound to say that the court does not seem to have taken the lesson in the slightest degree to heart and their arrogance is just as insufferable as it was before a shot was fired  stanley learnt that there had already been one fight the enemy were advancing in three columns their rightconsisting of 15000 men commanded by sudda woonhad crossed the irrawaddy and was marching down the other bank with the apparent object of recrossing below prome and cutting the british line of communication the centrefrom 25000 to 30000 strong commanded by the kee wongeewas coming down the left bank of the river accompanied by a great fleet of war boats the left division15000 strong led by an old and experienced general maha nemiowwas moving parallel with the others about ten miles distant from the centre but separated from it by a thick and impenetrable forest a reserve of 10000 men commanded by the kings halfbrother occupied a strongly fortified post at melloon  in addition to these a large force was gathered near pegu and threatened an attack upon rangoon  on the 10th of november a fortnight before stanleys return two brigades of native infantryunder colonel mdowallhad marched out to dislodge maha nemiow whose division threatened to turn the british right and to move round to its rear the force was divided into three columns one moving directly towards the enemys position the othersmarching by circuitous routes so arranged as to arrive at the point of attack at the same timewere to attack in flank and rear while the main body assailed the enemy in front the burmese had however obtained information from spies of the intended movement and advancing boldly met the british columns half way skirmishing with them hotly in the woods and threatening an attack by large bodies of horse  the centre drove the burmese before them and reached their stockaded position colonel mdowall while reconnoitring it was killed by a ball from a musket and as the two flanking columns did not arrive as expected the force was compelled to fall back the retreat was conducted in good order but the loss was heavy as the burmese pressed hotly upon them for several miles  since this unfortunate affair the enemy had steadily advanced maha nemiow had moved directly upon prome advancing slowly and constantly stockading himself the centre had also advanced and was now fortifying some heights above the river five miles away within sight of prome sudda woon was intrenching himself on the opposite bank all these divisions were working day and night advancing steadily but slowly and erecting formidable lines of intrenchments as they went and it seemed to be the intention of the burmese general to proceed in that manner until the whole of his troops were gathered within a very short distance of the town and then to rush upon it from all sides  in the morning stanley went to the lines of the 47th harry had of course told his story on his arrival and the tale had circulated generally through the regiment and as he rode in the men ran out from their huts and cheered him heartily no less warm a greeting did he receive from the officers in spite of his protest that there had really been no great difficulty or danger in the affair  what i specially admire one of the officers said laughing is that any man should have run all this risk on purpose to prevent himself from coming into an earldom you had only to leave the matter alone and there you wereheir to title and estates  i should have been haunted by harrys ghost stanley laughed it would have been as bad as banquo and macbeth he would have sat at my table and stood at the head of my bed no no that would have been a much more serious affair to face than a party of burmese the title and estates would have been too dear at the price  well you behaved like a brick anyhow the colonel said and there is not a man in the regiment who would not have been proud indeed if he had accomplished such a feat half my subalterns were talking at dinner last night of learning the language so that if the chance fell in their way they might emulate your doings  it is rather a tough language to master stanley replied it gave me more trouble than the four or five indian languages i speak i am afraid the campaign will be over a long time before any of your officers learn to talk burmese well enough to pass as natives  after the failure of the expedition of the 10th no further effort had been made against the enemy indeed the troops had been withdrawn from their outlying positions and there had even been a feint made of embarking stores as if with the intention of retiring down the river in hopes of tempting the burmese to make an attack  the season had now come when operations could again be carried on and the general was anxious to strike a decisive blow at the enemy and then to set forward on the march towards ava as to the result of the fight no one entertained the slightest doubt although the disparity in numbers was very great for while the burmese commander had nearly 70000 men at his disposal sir archibald campbell had no more than 6000 of whom about one half were british  it was determined that the main attack should be made on the division of maha nemiow this was now some six or seven miles away and beyond the fact that it was very strongly intrenched in the jungle no information whatever could be gained for the most vigilant watch was kept up by them and all efforts to pass native spies into their lines failed but it was known that among his division were 8000 shans from upper burma and as these men had not hitherto come in contact with us it was expected that they would fight with more courage and resolution than those who had become acquainted with our power  a large number of princes and nobles were with the force and great reliance was placed by the burmese upon three young ladies of high rank who were believed by them to be endowed with supernatural gifts and to have the power of rendering the missiles of the english innocuous these young women dressed in warlike costume constantly rode among the troops animating them by their presence and exhorting them to deeds of courage the english had received vague rumours of the doings of these burmese joans of arc and thought it probable that the enemy would fight better than usual  on november 30th arrangements were made for attacking the enemy on the following morning the flotilla were to open a furious cannonade upon their works on both sides of the river a body of native infantry were to drive in the advance posts of the centre while the main force was to attack their left in two columns one moving directly against it while the other was to attack on the right flankthus preventing the enemy from retreating in the direction of the centre four regiments of native infantry were left in prome  general cotton commanded the main attack and soon after the column moved out from the camp a tremendous cannonade showed that the flotilla was engaged with the burmese on both sides of the river the column which was composed of the 41st and 89th regiments with two battalions of native infantry proceeded some distance before becoming engaged with the enemys outposts as the burmese had been deceived by the cannonade and believed that the attack was entirely upon the centre the troops therefore reached their main position around two native villages without serious opposition  illustration the old burmese general was carried from point to point in a litter  as they issued from the jungle into the cleared space in front of the stockade they rapidly formed up under a tremendous fire and rushed forward to the attack the old burmese generalwho was too infirm to walkcould be seen carried from point to point in a litter cheering on his men while the three amazons exposed themselves fearlessly to the fire the ladder parties however rushed forward unchecked and in spite of the opposition of the enemy scaled the stockade at one point and won a footing on the rampart of earth behind it others pressed after them and soon a destructive fire was opened upon the crowded mass pent up between the outer stockade and the next the burmese method of forming stockade behind stockade was useful against a foe of no greater dash and energy than themselves but was absolutely fatal when opposed to english troops who gave them no time to fall back through the narrow openings in the palings these were soon blocked by the dying and dead  some of the shans led by their chiefs fought with desperate courage but were unable to stand the advance of the british whose steady volleys poured in at distances of a few yards swept them away wounded horses rushing wildly about in the throng added to the terrible confusion groups of men endeavoured to cut a way through the stockades behind others strove to climb over maha nemiow was killed while bravely exhorting his men to stand their ground and one of the heroic amazons was shot as soon as the troops reached the spot where she fell and saw that she was a woman she was carried into a cottage and there died a few hours afterwards stockade after stockade was carried until the whole position fell into our hands  in the meantime the other column commanded by general campbell himself and consisting of the 13th 38th 47th and 87th regiments and the 38th madras infantry had moved down on the other side of the nawine river and taken up a position to command the ford there by which the fugitives from the stockade must cross on their way to join the centre as the crowd of frightened men issued from the jungle and poured across the ford the artillery opened upon them with shrapnel and completed their discomfiture all thought of joining the centre was abandoned and reentering the jungle they scattered and the greater portion of them started for their homes intent only on avoiding another contest with their foes another of the burmese heroines was killed at the ford  three hundred men had been killed at the storming of the stockade but a far greater loss took place in the retreatvery few of the shans ever regaining their country the greater portion perishing from starvation in the great forests through which they travelled in order to escape the burmese authorities who would have forced them to rejoin the army    chapter 17 the pride of burma humbled   as soon as the victory was completed the troops piled arms and were allowed two hours rest then they marched back to the point where general campbells division had forded the nawine river in the morning from this point a path led towards the enemys centre this it was determined to attack at daybreak on the following morning before the news of the defeat of its left could reach it  the day had been a long and fatiguing one and it was late before the troops all reached their halting place a meal was served out and then all lay down to rest a messenger was sent to prome to announce the success that had been gained and to request the commander of the flotilla to open fire in the morning as soon as the foe was seen to issue from the jungle in front of the wongees main position at napadee  long before daylight the troops were in motion general campbells division led the way along the narrow track leading towards the river while general cotton who followed was ordered to break off at any path which led towards the burmese division to make his way through the forest and to attack the stockades directly he reached them the main division would attack as soon as they heard his guns  after a two hours march the first division came out on open ground by the river side signalled their arrival to the flotilla and formed up in front of the stockaded heights of napadee the position was an extremely strong one the enemy occupied three ranges of hills rising one behind the other and each commanding the one in front of it one flank of these hills was protected by the river the other by the almost impenetrable forest the hills were all covered with stockades and as they moved forward the troops were exposed to so heavy a fire from an enemy entrenched at the edge of the jungle on the right that before they could advance further it was necessary to first drive them from this position six companies of the 87th were sent back into the forest and making their way through this came down in the rear of the stockades speedily cleared them of their defenders and compelled the advance force of the enemy to join their main body  the troops then moved forward to the foot of the first hill where two strong redoubts had been erected by the enemy the fleet opened fire but the column was halted for a time awaiting the sound of firing that should tell them general cottons column was engaged no sound however was heard for this force had been unable to make its way through the dense forest and general campbell at last gave the order for the attack  it was commenced by the 47th and 38th native infantry under colonel elvington who pushed through the jungle and forest until they reached some of the flanking outworks on the hill these they attacked with such dash and determination that they speedily obtained possession of them and thus produced a favourable diversion for the main attack  this consisting of the 13th 38th and 87th regiments advanced steadily without returning a shot to the incessant fire from the enemys various entrenchments captured the two redoubts at the bottom of the hill and then pressed upwards carrying position after position at the point of the bayonet till they arrived at the summit of the first hill  the burmese fugitives as they fled to the next line of defence shook the courage of the troops there and the british pushing forward hotly on the rear of the flying crowd carried work after work until in the course of an hour the whole position nearly three miles in extent was entirely in their possession between forty and fifty guns were captured and the enemys loss in killed and wounded was very great while by desertion alone the wongee lost a third of his army while the attack had been going on the flotilla had passed the works protecting the river face of the hills and had captured all the boats and stores filled with supplies for the use of the burmese army  thus two of the three burmese divisions had now been completely routed and there remained only that of sudda woon on the other side of the river the troops were allowed two days rest and on the morning of the 5th a force advanced on board the flotilla their passage across the river was covered by the fire of a rocket brigade and a mortar batterywhich had on the previous night been established on an islandand they landed at some distance above the enemys stockades they then marched round and attacked these in flank and rear while the batteries and boats of the flotilla cannonaded them in front  the enemys troops were already disheartened by the defeat they had seen inflicted upon the wongees army and after a feeble resistance fled to a second line of stockades in the jungle to their rear the troops however pressed so hotly upon them that they were unable to make any effectual opposition here numbers fell while endeavouring to pass through the narrow entrances of the work and the rest fled in terror into the woods  these extensive operations had been carried out with the loss of six officers and some seventy or eighty men only  it was known that the enemy had very strongly fortified several positions in and around meaday and it was determined to push forward at once on the long march of three hundred miles to ava before the enemy could rally from their defeat and gather for the defence of these positions on the 9th the first division under general campbell himself started from prome the roads were extremely bad and they were able to move but slowly  their course was first directed inland as it was intended to turn the enemys position at meaday by following a road several miles from the river and thus forcing them to fall back as we advanced on the next day the force reached the spot where colonel mdowall had been killed in the unsuccessful attack upon maha nemiow and it then turned north and followed the road parallel to the river  on the 12th tremendous rains for some hours converted the road into a morass and although the march was but five miles long the greater portion of the column failed to reach its destination this however was not the worst cholera broke out at once and carried off a large number of victimstwo of the british regiments being rendered almost unfit for service by its ravages  on the 14th the division encamped on dry ground on a ridge of wooded hills and waited for a couple of days to allow the baggage train to come up the change greatly benefited the health of the troops and amusement was afforded by the partridges jungle fowl and deer which abounded in the neighbourhood of the camp  up to this point no single native had been seen the villages were all destroyed and the country was completely deserted on the 16th a strong burmese fortification was taken it being unoccupied save by a small picket which retired on our advance this had evidently been erected for the purpose of preventing the river fortifications from being turned and its abandonment proved that the object of the land march had been gained and that the enemy had abandoned the positions they had with so much care prepared for the defence of the river  on the 18th they joined general cottons column and the next day entered meaday here a terrible spectacle was met with the town and the ground within the stockades was strewn with dead and dying some from wounds others from cholerafor the ravages of this plague had been as great among the burmese as in the british force a number of men were found crucified on gibbets doubtless as a punishment for attempting to desert the air was pestilent and the force was glad indeed to march on the next morning from the locality  they gained something but not much from the change for the next fifty miles dead bodies were met with at very short intervals and each day before camping many corpses had to be removed before the tents could be fixed  it was now known that the burmese army in its retreat had been concentrated at melloon where the reserve of 10000 men had been posted on the 27th the division encamped within four miles of that town they had now marched a hundred and forty miles from prome without meeting a single inhabitant of the country or being enabled to obtain any cattle whatever for the supply of the troops so effectually had the enemy wasted the country as they retired  melloon stood on the opposite bank of the irrawaddy and letters had arrived from that town saying that a commissioner had arrived from ava with full powers from the king to conclude a treaty of peace colonel adair and stanley accordingly were sent off the next morning to melloon to arrange for an immediate meeting for the commissioners however they could come to no arrangement the burmese leaders insisting that so important a business could only be carried on when a favourable day arrived and that no time could at present be stated seeing that the principal object of the burmese was to gain time the colonel informed them through stanley that as no arrangements had been made the troops would recommence their advance as soon as he returned to the camp and accordingly the next morning the division moved forward to a town immediately opposite melloon  that place stood on the face of a sloping hill and as the irrawaddy was here but 600 yards broad a good view was obtained of the fortifications the principal stockade was in the form of a square about a mile on each face mounting a considerable number of gunsespecially on the side facing the river and a succession of stockades extended for a mile farther along the banks the great work was crowded with men in front of the town lay a large fleet of war boats and larger craft with stores  a short time after the troops reached the spot a great noise of gongs drums and other warlike instruments arose on the other side and crowds of boatmen were seen running down to the vessels these were soon manned and oars got out and they began to row up the river as owing to the intricacy of the channel the steamboat and flotilla had not yet arrived a few shots were fired at the boats by the field guns this had the desired effect many of the boatmen jumping overboard leaving their craft to drift down the river while the great bulk hastily turned their vessels about and anchored in their former position  as soon as the steamer with the flotilla came up two war boats pushed off from shore saluted the steamer and rowed alongside of her until she and the flotilla were safely anchored above the town this was so evidently a mark of a real desire for the suspension of hostilities that the two officers were again sent across the river a truce was agreed upon and an arrangement made for the meeting of the negotiators upon the following day  four meetings were held between the two commissioners and those appointed by the british general the meetings taking place on boats moored in the centre of the river at length the treaty was accepted and signed by the burmese and fifteen days truce allowed for the ratification of the treaty by the king as the end of that period approached the burmese protested that they had not yet received an answer and asked for further time which was refused unless on the condition that melloon was evacuated and the burmese army fell back until the ratification of the treaty reached them as had been for some time strongly suspected the negotiations were simply a device to arrest our advance and the treaty was afterwards found in the burmese camp it never having been forwarded to ava  at midnight on the 18th when the armistice came to a conclusion the troops began throwing up earthworks the heavy guns were landed from the flotilla and at ten oclock the next morning twentyeight guns were in position ready to open fire in spite of remonstrances that had been made the burmese had night after night during the armistice continued to work surreptitiously at their entrenchments it was hoped for a moment that when they saw the speed with which our batteries had been thrown up and armed they would offer no farther resistance as however they were evidently preparing for action our guns opened fire at eleven oclock  this was kept up for two hours while it was going on the troops intended for the assault were embarked in boats some distance up the river so as to ensure their not being carried by the force of the stream across the face of the burmese works and exposed to the concentrated fire of the enemy they were divided into four brigades the first of whichconsisting of the 13th and 38th regiments under lieutenant colonel salewere to land below the stockade and to attack its southwestern angle while the other three brigades were to land above it to carry some outworks there and to attack the northern face  a strong northerly wind and the violent current prevented the assaults being made simultaneously the first brigade was carried too far across and as it passed the stockade was exposed to the fire of the guns and musketry of the river defences while the three other brigades were unable for some time to reach their intended landing places colonel sale was among those wounded by the burmese fire but directly the first brigade reached the shore they formed up under the partial cover of a shelving bank and led by lieutenant colonel frith moved forward to the assault in admirable order when within a short distance there was a forward rush in spite of the storm of shot the ladder party gained the foot of the stockade and placing the ladders climbed up and leapt down among the surging crowd of the enemy others followed and soon a firm footing was obtained in the works then the men of the two regimentswhose total strength did not exceed five hundredadvanced steadily drove before them some 10000 armed men and expelled them from the works that the burmese had deemed impregnable  while this was going on the other three brigades had landed above the stockade and now falling upon the enemy as they poured out from their works completed their defeat all the stockades were carried and the whole of the artillery and stores fell into our possession  four days later the army again began its advance they were met by four englishmen who had been taken prisoners and an american who had also been held in confinement these had been sent to assure the english general that the king was in earnest in his desire for peace it was but too evident however that no confidence could be placed in burmese negotiations and it was moreover known that another army was being assembled in the greatest haste to bar the advance  on the 14th of february the british reached pakangyay having passed sembeughewn on the opposite shore this was the point where the road from aracan reached the irrawaddy and it had been arranged that the force that had been operating in aracan should if possible effect a junction with sir archibald campbell here a message brought down by a native was however received stating that the force had suffered very severely from fever and cholera and that the natural obstacles were found to be too great to be overcome by troops debilitated by diseasethat the attempt had therefore been abandoned fortunately the english general was well able to do without this addition to his strength he had already proved that his command was perfectly capable of defeating any burmese force that could be brought against him and an addition would only have increased the difficulty of transport  on the 9th of march the british force which owing to the necessity for leaving strong bodies to hold melloon and other points that had been captured now mustered less than 2000 fighting men advanced to attack the enemy whose numbers were estimated at 16000  the new commander of the burmese adopted other tactics than his predecessors his stockaded position was in front of the town of pagahn but he occupied the jungle in great force and attacked our advance guard five miles from the town as the enemy occupied the hills on both sides of the main road sir a campbell divided his force and led half of it through the jungle on the right while general cotton led the other half through the woods on the left  the burmese fought with considerable obstinacy general campbell and his staff with thirtyeight troopers and fifty men of the 13th were somewhat in advance of the column when the enemy closed in on both flanks and even got in their rear these were however dispersed by the rest of the 13th and driving back the burmese on the flanks the advance was continued presently however as the british issued from the jungle a mass of the enemys horse charged down drove back the skirmishers and for a time the position of the general and his staff was one of great peril his little body of troopers however dashed boldly at the assailants and held them in check until the guns that had followed the staff were brought forward from the jungle then the troopers divided and rode right and left and the guns opening fire checked the assailants until the infantry came up  the burmese army was now seen drawn up in the form of a semicircle in the open the two british columns were united and together moved forward to attack the centre of the crescent disregarding the fire from its wings when within charging distance they went forward with a rush and cheering lustily fell upon the burmese and broke their centre thus isolating the two wings the burmese at once retreated with the greatest haste to the stockaded position in their rear as usual the narrow entrances to the stockades caused great delay and the british were upon them before they were in any way prepared to resist the assault  heralding their advance by sweeping volleys they fell upon the burmese with the bayonet and drove them out of their works the enemy made an attempt to rally behind the walls and in the pagodas of the town but the effort was vain they were driven out with great slaughter hundreds were drowned in eudeavouring to swim the river and the army was finally dispersed in all directions  the effect of this victory was at once apparent the country peoplewho had on the advance of the british force from prome been cleared out from the villages along the whole line of routebeing now freed from the restraint of their troops came flocking back in great numberssome by the roads and some in boatsand it was evident that they regarded the struggle as definitely terminated there was indeed no possibility of further resistance as the armies of burma raised with immense difficulty and by heavy bounties and the promises of great reward were hopelessly scattered and ava lay open to the british advance  in other directions their position was equally desperate aracan had been wholly rescued from their grasp a british force in pegu had marched up the river sitang and after the repulse of a party of a hundred and fifty men imprudently sent to attack sitang itself captured the place after a sharp fight and receiving reinforcements from rangoon continued their way up the river and captured toungoo while the northern force had driven the burmese out of manipur and had reached the river ningti by the 2nd of february and were in a position to advance direct upon ava  after a halt of two days general campbell advanced on the 12th of february mr price the american who had been sent down after the capture of melloon went forward to ava with the treaty that had been drawn up before the capture of that place and the king had no longer any hesitation in complying with its termsand was indeed delighted to find that the recent victory of the invaders had not increased their demands he at once sent down to accept them but as no official ratification was sent the march continued while mr price again returned to ava when the force was within four days march of the capital the latter returned with the burmese commissioners and other high functionaries with the ratified treaty and the first instalment of the money that was to be paid  it was a disappointment to the army that after their long march and many sufferings they were not to be allowed to enter the enemys capital in triumph undoubtedly however the course taken was the wisest ava was regarded as a sacred city and it was to save it from the humiliation of being occupied by the invaders that the king had brought himself to accept the terms of the treaty had the english general insisted upon entering the capital and signing the treaty there he would have found no one to meet him the population would have been driven out the king and court would have retired farther up the country and the war might have continued for an indefinite time  already its cost had been enormous exceeding 5000000 pounds sterling during the first eleven months after landing at rangoon nearly half of the europeans died and from the time they advanced from that town with fresh reinforcements from india to the arrival near ava a similarly heavy loss was sustained four percent of the number engaged was killed in action the climate of aracan was still more deadly as threefourths of the white troops employed there died and very few of the survivors were ever fit for service afterwards the sepoys suffered less in aracan losing only ten percent of their number though nearly half the force were in hospital for some time  according to agreement the burmese as soon as peace was concluded sent down a large number of boats for the conveyance of the troops down the river as they descended it the garrisons left at melloon and other places were withdrawn one of the native regiments with some elephants and guns left the force at sembeughewn and marched thence to aracan for the purpose of investigating the country and proving whether it was practicable for the passage of troops in case another advance upon ava should ever be necessary they found the road unexpectedly good and met with no resistance whatever except in the passage of some passes over the mountains  at melloon stanley was very glad to meet his cousin again for the 47th had been left in garrison there harry had been down again with a sharp attack of fever but was now recovering  so it is all over stanley and your chances of an earldom have nearly slipped through your fingers  i am glad indeed that it is so stanley laughed in the first place because i could only have succeeded to it at your death and in the second place because i have no ambition whatever for a title i am not nineteen yet and should greatly prefer to make my own way than to find myself with nothing whatever to do except to spend money as it dropped into my lap  now that everything is settled and that aracan has become english and we have the seaports on the tenasserim coast trade will increase tremendously you may be sure that the burmese will be only too glad to flock into our provinces and to live under a fair rule to escape the tyranny of their own officials and my uncle is just the man to take advantage of the new openings i dont say that i want to live out here all my life at any rate i hope by the time that i am thirty to be able to come home for a years holiday and it is just possible that by then we may have grown into such a big firm that we may establish headquarters in london instead of getting all our goods from calcutta  there is certain to be a very big trade here in teak alone the price in pegue is a great deal below that in india and if we had a house in london we should avoid having to pay commissions and perhaps get better prices for our wood of course my uncle may by that time think of retiring himself and in that case i might have to stay somewhat longer out here but i know that he likes the climate and i have heard him say that as he has very few acquaintances in england he thinks that he should prefer a life in calcutta to one in london  i should not wonder if i go home very shortly harry said my last letter told me that my uncle was in failing health and that he would like to have me at home with him if the next letter confirms that i am afraid i shall have either to resign my commission or exchange into a regiment at home of course at his death i should have to leave the army anyhow it would be ridiculous for a subaltern to be an earl besides there are things one would have to do i suppose there are estates to be looked after and all sorts of nuisances  anyhow i shall always be glad i have had my share in this expedition i have learned what campaigning is and i must say that under such circumstances as we have gone through it is not quite so pleasurable as i had expected half ones friends are dead or invalided home and one never knows when one wakes in the morning whether one may not be down with cholera before night the fighting is all well enough but after all that takes up but a very small portion of ones time and marching and i may say living generally in this hot sweltering climate with its six months of rain is not enviable work however i have gone through one regular campaign and that as severe a one as british troops have ever performed and above all old man i have met you and we have come to be great friends and i have learned what one fellow will do for another  i am sure i am very glad to have gone through it too i have been fortunate indeed in never having been laid up for a single day and there is no doubt that having served on the staff will be of great advantage to me even as a trader i own that i should like to have retired a captain of course promotion has been tremendously fast owing to the death vacancies but i have still two lieutenants over me  you are sure to get the step stanley you have been in general orders twice besides that notice you got for my rescue also the doctors say that a number of the men who have been sent down to the coast are not likely to live many weeks and as five of your seniors have been invalided you may get your step in the natural course of things at any moment  if i were you i should ask for three months leave before rejoining your regiment there will be no difficulty about that after you have been upwards of two years in constant work and the general will certainly not refuse before the end of that time you will have seen your uncle and talked matters over then if you choose to resign your commission you can of course do so but as you are pretty sure to get your step by death before the end of the three months and as the generals despatches strongly recommend your services you may get your brevet majority before your resignation reaches england a man who has been mentioned two or three times in despatches and is specially recommended for honours is sure to get his brevet majority directly he gets his company  on reaching rangoon stanley learned that two of the invalids had died either on the way down or before they could be put on board a ship and that one of the majors who had been sent to india for change four months before had also succumbed so that he had already obtained his companya promotion which would have been at any other time extraordinary but which in a campaign where half those engaged were carried off was nothing remarkable being still on the headquarter staff he embarked with sir archibald campbell  you still hold firm to your determination to leave the service captain brooke the general said in the course of the passage to calcutta  yes sir i am sure that it is best for me  i think it is brooke of course you have been exceptionally fortunate in getting such rapid promotion still a good business is a great deal better than soldiering i wrote very strongly in your favour when i sent off my despatches the day we came down to the coast and you are certain of your brevet still it is just as well that the news of your resignation should not get home before the gazette comes out with your name in it i think the best thing that i can do is to give you leave for a time as soon as we get to calcutta i am sure that you deserve a rest for your work has been terribly heavy  thank you sir that was just the favour that i was going to ask you i shall find out as soon as i get there where my uncle is and join him my own mind is quite made up but he has certainly a right to be consulted before i take any final step  quite right i feel no doubt that his opinion will agree with yours and i think that you are showing a good deal more wisdom than most fellows would do to give up the service when you have distinguished yourself and have a much better chance than falls to the lot of one man in a hundred still there can be no real doubt that a man in a good business out here can retire early and go home with a fortune while in the army you are liable at any time after you get to the rank of colonel to be laid on the shelf for years  besides you will be your own master which is more than anyone in the army can say you can go home when you like either for a stay or for a permanency and you are not liable to have to run the risk of another campaign such as this has been  if one was sure of campaigns i dont think that i could possibly bring myself to leave the service but it is the probability of being kept for three or four years at a time doing nothing at calcutta or madras that decided me  the general nodded  you are quite right brooke on active service a soldiers life is indeed a stirring one but there is nothing more dull and monotonous than garrison life in peace time  accordingly as soon as they landed in calcutta stanley was put in orders for absence on leave for three months he learned from his uncles agent that they had heard from him only a few days before at chittagong and that he was then on the point of leaving for aracan whither he had ordered a large consignment of goods to be forwarded to him by the next ship  three days later stanley started to join him leaving his address at aracan with sir archibald campbell in case there should be need to recall him before the three months leave expired the vessel in which he was sailing carried the consignment of goods to his uncle and he had therefore no fear of finding that the latter had left aracan before his arrival meinik was still with him he had left the army after the last battle had been fought and had travelled to the spot where he had buried his money before embarking with stanley in the canoe and after an absence of three days rejoined the force on the way down to rangoon stanley had a long talk with him as to his future plans  i have only one plan master and that is to stay with you as long as i live  but you will have plenty to live comfortably upon now meinik for after all that you have done for me of course i shall arrange for you to have a sum that will keep you in comfort  meinik shook his head  burma is a bad country master after living with the english i would not go back to live under the kings officers in any case any money that i had would be squeezed out of me before long no master i will go with you unless you drive me from you if you do i will go to chittagong and live there but i do not think that you will do that  certainly not meinik as long as you are willing to remain with me i shall be very glad indeed to have you but if at any time you wish to marry and settle down on land of your own i shall give you five hundred poundswhich is only a small portion of the sum those rubies which you got your band to give me brought me in  i daresay i shall marry meinik said but that will make no difference as long as i live i shall stay with you  meinik had been astounded at calcutta which presented a strong contrast indeed to the city which as a burman he had regarded as the most important place in the world  the burmese are fools master they should have sent two or three men here before they made up their minds to go to war if they had been truly told what calcutta was like they would never have ventured to make war with the english    chapter 18 in business again   when the vessel arrived at the mouth of the aracan river a canoe was seen coming out from akyaha town situated at the entrance to the principal of the several channels by which the river makes its way through a number of sand banks and islands into the sea as it approached stanley recognized his uncle sitting in the stern  well uncle how are you he called out as the boat approached the side  what is it you stanley i am glad indeed to see you i have watched the papers anxiously to see if your name appeared among those who have been killed or have died not seeing it i hoped that you were all right of course we heard from the madras regiment that came across from sembeughewn that it was all over and that all the troops would be shipped off as soon as they went down to rangoon but i have not seen any papers lately and so have not had a chance of learning any news of you i fancied though that you would be back at calcutta by this time and thought that i might get a letter from you by this ship  by this time he was on deck and after a hearty shaking of hands stanley asked what he was doing here  i did not expect to see you until we got to aracan  i have been up there lad it is a decaying old place and the stream is in many places shallow so that it would be very difficult to take up a ship of any size i foresee therefore that this is going to be the chief port of the provincetimber will be floated down here and rice brought down in native boatsso i shall make my headquarters here as far as this district is concerned and put johnson in charge i doubt whether for a time we shall do as much trade as we shall higher up the coast but everyone expects a great burmese immigration and a large trade is likely to spring up in time  i have not quite determined on my next move and it is not improbable that i shall go down in this ship and establish myself for a time at martaban and open a trade in tenasserim if i decide on that i shall only get on shore a portion of my goods and take the rest on with me there  now what are you going to do stanley  just what you think best uncle i should have thought that as i speak the language it would be better for me to go on to martaban and for you to work chittagong and the district up to assam  then you are going to stay with me lad his uncle exclaimed in a tone of much satisfaction i was afraid that you would have got so fond of soldiering that you would have thrown this over altogether  not a bit of it uncle i am on three months leave at present and at the end of that time i shall resign you know i am a captain nowthat is to say that i have got my rank by death vacancies though until the gazette comes out from england i can hardly be said to be a pucka captain and what is more the general himself assured me that after being mentioned in despatches two or three times and at his strong commendation of my services i was sure of the brevet rank of major  his uncle took off his hat gravely  i must apologize to you he said for addressing you as lad i had no idea that you were a fullgrown captain still less that you might soon be a major  i dont care a snap for the title uncle stanley said laughing except that it may be an advantage to me in places where there are garrisons and indeed generally where there are white officials  a very great advantage stanley  well lad i have been coining money since i saw you at rangoon i have been sending a consignment of bullocks down there every week and have done almost as much with the manipur force i have also got the contract regularly now for the supply of the troops at calcutta other trade has of course been at a standstill now that everything has quieted down there will be a perfect rush and i have been sorely troubled in my mind whether it would be best to stay up here and take advantage of it or to be one of the first to open trade at these new ports of course if you are ready to take martaban that will decide me and i shall take passage in the first ship going up to chittagong my own boat and the dhow are both there and i shall at once work up all the rivers and set things going again  i have a capital fellow a native who is carrying on the cattle business for me and at chittagong i shall try and get hold of three or four more trustworthy fellows to take charge of depots i see a big future before us and that before long i did well with those gems of yoursthey fetched 3500 pounds which i used besides what you handed over to mefor there was no buying up the cattle without cash and as i generally have to wait two months after they are shipped before i get paid ready money was invaluable and indeed i could not have gone into the thing on anything like the same scale if it had not been for your money the calcutta people would have helped me to a certain point but they would never have ventured upon such advances as i required your 5000 pounds has doubled itself since i met you at rangoon i calculate that our stores at the different depots are worth 4000 pounds so that at the present moment the firm of pearson  brooke have at their command a capital of 14000 pounds  a portion of the cargo was landed at akyah stanley went down with the rest to martaban and his uncle sailed for chittagong a few months later a store was opened at rangoon parsee storekeepers were sent from calcutta by tom pearson and these were placed in control of the stores there and at martabanstanley being in charge of these two stations and akyah and having a native craft of his own and a boat for river work similar to that of his uncle  a year later he received a letter from harry saying that his uncle had died a month after his return to england and that he was now established as one of the pillars of the state  as i went through london on my arrival he said i looked up your mother at the address you gave me at dulwich i found her very well and very comfortable she was full of your praises and as i was equally so your ears ought to have tingled while we were together of course they wanted to hear all about you and most of it was new to them for you had said nothing of your adventure with that leopard and only a few lines about the rescue of your humble servant though you had told them that i stood in your way of the earldom your mother said that she was prouder of you than if you were an earl only that she would have liked to have you at home i told her that you and your uncle were shaking the pagoda tree and that you would come home as yellow as a guinea and as rich as a nabob in the course of a few years  your sisters are older than i expected to find them of course you always spoke of them as when you saw them last they are both growing into very pretty girls the elder especially i made your mother promise to bring them down to stay with me for a bit when i came into the title which i knew could not be long for i had called that morning on my uncles solicitors and they told me that he was not expected to live many weeks as it is only a month since he died i suppose i ought not to have visitors just yet but in a few weeks i shall go up to town and bring them down with me i cannot help thinking that it is a little selfish for when they see this place they would not be human if they did not feel that it would have been yours if it had not been for your getting me out of the hands of those burmese  i see that you are gazetted captain this week i suppose long before this you have settled down to your old work of going up sluggish streams and trying to stir up the equally sluggish native to a sense of the advantages of british goods at present i am quite content to do nothing particularto ride and drive about return calls and so onbut i expect before very long i shall get restless and want to be doing something however there is the continent open to one and decent hotels to stop at no fevers there and no burmese brigands  a month later he had a letter from his mother which had been written before that of harry but had been sent to calcutta and thence to akyah and had there lain until his return two months later from a boat journey up to pegu she said how kind it was of his cousin to come in to give them news of him the very day he arrived in london  of course we were delighted with all that he told us about you but it made us anxious to think of your running into so many dangers we like him very much we could not help laughing because he seemed quite concerned that you should not have the peerage instead of him he seems likely to come into it soon for he tells us that the earl is very ill he says that we must come down and pay him a visit as soon as he is master there but i dont know whether that can be of course it would be a nice change and i believe that it is a very fine place i said that it would seem strange our going there when there are no ladies and that bachelors did not generally entertain but he said that in the first place he should have his sisters there who were about the same age as my girls and that as we were his nearest relations and you were at present his heir it would be quite the right and proper thing for us to come down he seemed quite in earnest about it and i should not be surprised if we go  three months later stanley heard that the visit had been paid and that they had stayed a fortnight there  it feels quite funny settling down here again after being in that big house with all those servants and grandeur not that there is any grandeur about harry he insists being relations that we shall call him by his christian name everything was delightful every afternoon we used to go driving and of a morning he generally rode with the girls he had a very pretty gentle horse for agnes and a gray pony a beauty for kate i have a strong suspicion that he had bought them both on purpose i should not be surprisedbut no i wont say anything about it  stanley puzzled over this sentence which was followed by  his sisters are very nice girls  it is evidently something about harry he said to himself possibly she has taken the idea into her head that he may fall in love with agnes that certainly would be a very nice thing but i dont suppose it is anything more than an idea of mothers  however four months later he received a letter from harry announcing his engagement  i told your mother that she must let me write by the mail before she did as it was only right that i should have the pleasure of telling you the news myself it is splendid old man upon my word i dont know which i ought to feel most grateful to youfor saving my life or for getting me to know your sister it seems to me a regular dispensation of providence you did everything you could to prevent yourself from coming into a title and now your sister is going to take it and me it is quite right that we should come to be brothersinlaw for we are quite like brothers already  we are to be married in the spring how i wish you could be with us your absence will be the only thing wanting to make everything perfect i do hope you dont mean to stay grilling out there many years it seems to me monstrous that i should be having estates and a big income and all that sort of thing when i have done nothing to deserve it and that you should be toiling in that beastly climate if i thought that there was the least chance of your rushing home when you get this letter i declare that i would put off the marriage for a month or so so that you should be here in time but as i feel sure that you wont do anything of the sort it will be of no use for me to make such a noble sacrifice  stanley had received the news that he was gazetted brevetmajor a month after he was promoted to the rank of captain and two months before his name appeared as having retired from the army he derived as he expected much benefit from his connection with the army in his position at his three receiving ports as it placed him on a very pleasant footing with the military and civil officials and it rendered his occasional visits to calcutta and madras exceedingly pleasant for in both towns he found many officers whose acquaintance he had made during the expedition he was always made an honorary member of the messes and clubs during his stays there  the business grew rapidly the work of the earlier years had so well paved the way for larger operations that they were able to more than hold their own against other traders who after the troubles were at an end sought to establish themselves at various points on the western coast of the peninsula and after six more years of hard and continuous work the business came to be a very large and important one  i think it more than probable stanley wrote to his mother that before very long i shall be returning home my uncle spoke about it the last time that i saw him and said that we were outgrowing calcutta and ought to establish ourselves in london  we can hold on a bit longer he said but we must come to that sooner or later and when it does you must be the one to go to england and take charge i may go home before that for a few months but i have no wish or desire to stop there we have now got a good staff and i shall probably fix myself permanently at calcutta  two years later tom pearson on his return from england brought back a wife with him and established himself at calcutta stanley joined him there three weeks after his return they had a long talk together that evening  i see stanley his uncle said that things have gone on improving since i have been away and that our turnover last year was 150000 pounds and the profits close upon 15000 pounds i think now that it is high time we opened a place in london we have almost a monopoly of the teak trade in burma and it would be much more advantageous for us to make our purchases in england instead of here we should save in carriage and in transshipment besides the profits that the people here make out of their sales to us i have made a great many inquiries at home as to the prices for cash in manchester and birmingham and find that we should get goods there some fifteen percent cheaper than we pay at calcutta even after putting on the freights so you see it is an important matter besides there would be a better choice of goods and you know exactly the sort of thing that we require and the quantities that we can get rid of and would be able therefore to send consignments each month without waiting for advices from me and so we should get the things just as readily as we do now from here  i will give you the names of some of the firms that i have visited and with whom i have already paved the way for opening extensive transactions during the eighteen months that i have been away you have learned all about the banking business and will find no more difficulty in managing in london than here your brotherinlaw netherly went with me to the bank of england and introduced me to one of the directors i told him that we intended to open a house in london and that as soon as we did so we should open an account with them by paying in 30000 pounds and that we should of course require some facilities but probably not to a large extent as our payments for teak there would fairly balance our exports from england and that i reckoned our trade to be as a minimum 50000 pounds each way  the matter was made extremely easy by netherly saying to my astonishment  you can let them draw what they like mr townshend for i will give my personal guarantee up to 50000 pounds  i remonstrated but he would not hear anything said  ridiculous he exclaimed hotly stanley is my brotherinlaw he risked his life for me and you dont suppose that i should mind risking 50000 pounds for him  not he went on turning to the director that there is any risk in the matter i know all about the business they do in india and that there is not a shadow of risk in it i know that my guarantee will be a mere form but as it may put them on a better footing with you to begin with i shall be very pleased to do it  of course we know that there will be no risk in it the greater portion of our business is a readymoney one and although of late we have been dealing more with native local firms instead of selling direct from our own stores the amounts are never large and so far we have never lost a penny of course i shall let you know by every mail how things are going on at all our depots and you will then be able to form an estimate as to the amount of goods you will have to despatch to eachsending them direct of course if there happens to be a ship going  but all these things of course we shall go into at length before you start for england  did you go down to harrys place  yes i stopped there a week your sister seems perfectly happy and plays the part of queen of the county admirably the four youngsters are jolly little things as to your mother you will find very little change in her i really dont think that she looks a day older than when we saw her off at calcutta something like ten years ago of course then she was cut up with her loss but quiet and comfort have agreed with her and the climate is a good deal less trying than it is out here at any rate i should not take her for a day over forty and she is something like five years older than that  three months later stanley sailed for england there was the same argument between him and meinik that there had been when stanley first left rangoon but this time it terminated differently  you would be out of your element in england meinik of course my life there will be very different from what it is here i shall go away from home to business every morning and not get back until perhaps seven o clock in the evening as a consequence there would be nothing for you to do for me and we should see very little of each other you know i should like to have you with me and would do all that i could to make you comfortable but i am sure that you would not like the life here you have always been on the move and there is always something for you to do and think of  i have spoken to my uncle about you and he will be glad to appoint you to the position of purchaser for our house of teak and other native products in these provinces besides being buyer you would go up the country and see to the felling and getting the timber down to the coast as you have often done before he knows how absolutely i trust you and how much you have done for me and he said that he should be very glad to have you in charge of the buying side of the work here besides you know you have now a wife and children and even if you could make yourself comfortable in england they would never be able to do so and the bitter cold that we sometimes have in winter would try them terribly and might even carry them all off  to these arguments meinik had reluctantly yielded he was somewhat proud of the position that he occupied as one of some authority in the establishment of the principal merchants on the coast he was fond of his wife and little children and felt that to be established among strangers of different habits and race would be very terrible for them stanley bought him a nice house at rangoon and as his rate of pay which had been gradually increased was now sufficient to cause him to rank high among the native population he himself came to feel that he had done wisely in accepting stanleys advice  the voyage to england was an uneventful one and to stanley after the active life he had had for ten years the five months spent at sea seemed almost interminable  i should not have known you in the least his mother said after the first joyful greetings were over how much you have gone through since we parted at calcutta  i had a pretty rough time of it for two years mother during the war but with that exception my life has been a very pleasant one and i have had nothing whatever to grumble about  this is a pretty house that you have chosen mother and the garden is charming how i have longed sometimes for the sight of an english garden of course i have never seen one before but i have heard you talk of them and thought how delightful the green grass must be of course we had flowers in burmaplenty of themand shrubs but it was not green like this it is charming  yes it is a pretty house stanley we moved in here five years agothanks to you dear boyand it has been a very quiet happy time we have a good many friends now among our neighbours and have quite as much society as i care for  i suppose you have not yet decided whether you will live here with us she said a little anxiously or set up an establishment of your own  of course i shall stay here mother i never thought of anything else i see that you have some stables i shall get a couple of horses and drive into town in the mornings i have got out of the way of walking altogether  and where is kate  you will see her presently she will be here to dinner with agnes and harry i sent her off because i wanted to have you all to myself for the first hour the others came up to town three days ago on purpose to be here when you arrived of course we heard when your ship called at plymouth we had been looking for her for your last letter told us the name of the vessel that you were coming by so i wrote to them and they came up at once they wanted us to go and dine with them but i would not hear of it i was sure that you would much rather dine quietly here than in state in portman square with three or four footmen behind our chairs  ever so much better mother i suppose i shall hardly know agnes but harry cannot have altered much besides i have seen him four years later than her  harrys greeting was of the heartiest kind stanleys sisters felt at first a little strange with this brother of whom they had but a faint remembrance  it does not seem to me harry that your dignities have tamed you down much  no indeed harry laughed i find it sometimes very difficult to act up to my position i never quite feel that i am an earl except on the rare occasions when i go to the house of lordswhich i only do when my vote is wanted on an important division  the gloom of that place is enough to sober anyone i can assure you that when i heard of the fire i felt absolutely pleased of course they will build another one perhaps grander than the last and as gloomy but thank goodness it must be years before it can be finished and until then we shall have to put up with temporary premises  your chances of an earldom are getting more and more remote stanley there are three boys barring the way already i had proposed to myself not to marryin which case you or a son of yours would have followed mebut your sister overpersuaded me  agnes tossed her head as she said  at any rate harry if you made that resolution it was not worth much as you gave it up at the first opportunity i was the first girl you met when you arrived in england and i doubt whether you had seen another before we came down to stay at netherly i had not been there two days before you began to make love to me  the temptation would excuse anything my dear harry laughed besides you see i saw at once that it was but fair and right to stanley that if he could not get the peerage himself he might some day have the satisfaction of being uncle to an earl  and so you are home for good old fellow  yes and just at present i feel very much at sea as to how to get to work as tom pearson arranged nothing except as to the banking account everything else he has left to me i know nothing of london and have no idea of the situation where i should look for offices  i will put you up to all that stanley i dont know anything about it myself as you may suppose but if you will go with me to my solicitors tomorrow they will be able to tell you but i do know that leadenhall street is the centre of the indian trade and its somewhere about there that you will have to fix yourself  of course when you have taken a place you will have to get hold of some clerks if you put an advertisement in the paper you will get any number of applicants or possibly my men may through their connection with merchants be able to hear of some to suit you anyhow i am sure that you will find no difficulty  thanks to harrys introductions stanley was established in a handsome suite of offices with three clerks with much greater ease than he had anticipated being thoroughly versed in business he was not long before he was at home in his new life  three years after his return he married harrys youngest sister the firm flourished greatly and became one of the leading houses in the eastern trade at the age of sixty stanley retired from business with a large fortune he could do this comfortably as his eldest son and a nephew had become active partners in the firm he still lives at the age of eightysix in a noble mansion near staines and retains all the faculties even at advanced age
