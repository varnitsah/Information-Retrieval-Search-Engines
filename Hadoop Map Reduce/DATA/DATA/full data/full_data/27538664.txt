conscientious methods it may seem strange that a volume of 160 pages is necessary to contain those poems written and published by him during his active literary career and ultimately rejected as unsatisfactory of this considerable body of verse a great part was written not in youth or old age but while tennysons powers were at their greatest whatever reasons may once have existed for suppressing the poems that follow the student of english literature is entitled to demand that the whole body of tennysons work should now be open without restriction or impediment to the critical study to which the works of his compeers are subjected  the bibliographical notes prefixed to the various poems give in every case the date and medium of first publication  jct     timbuctoo  a poem which obtained the chancellors medal at the cambridge commencement  mdcccxxix  by a tennyson of trinity college  printed in cambridge chronicle and journal of friday july 10 1829 and at the university press by james smith among the prolusiones academicæ præmiis annuis dignatæ et in curia cantabrigiensi recitatæ comitiis maximis mdcccxxix republished in cambridge prize poems 1813 to 1858 by messrs macmillan in 1859 without alteration and in 1893 in the appendix to a reprint of poems by two brothers   timbuctoo      deep in that lionhaunted inland lies     a mystic city goal of high emprizea       chapman    i stood upon the mountain which oerlooks   the narrow seas whose rapid interval   parts afric from green europe when the sun   had falln below th atlantick and above   the silent heavens were blenchd with faery light   uncertain whether faery light or cloud   flowing southward and the chasms of deep deep blue   slumberd unfathomable and the stars   were flooded over with clear glory and pale   i gazd upon the sheeny coast beyond   there where the giant of old time infixed   the limits of his prowess pillars high   long time erasd from earth even as the sea   when weary of wild inroad buildeth up   huge mounds whereby to stay his yeasty waves   and much i musd on legends quaint and old   which whilome won the hearts of all on earth   toward their brightness evn as flame draws air   but had their being in the heart of man   as air is th life of flame and thou wert then   a centerd glorycircled memory   divinest atalantis whom the waves   have buried deep and thou of later name   imperial eldorado rootd with gold   shadows to which despite all shocks of change   all onset of capricious accident   men clung with yearning hope which would not die   as when in some great city where the walls   shake and the streets with ghastly faces throngd   do utter forth a subterranean voice   among the inner columns far retird   at midnight in the lone acropolis   before the awful genius of the place   kneels the pale priestess in deep faith the while   above her head the weak lamp dips and winks   unto the fearful summoning without   nathless she ever clasps the marble knees   bathes the cold hand with tears and gazeth on   those eyes which wear no light but that wherewith   her phantasy informs them                     where are ye   thrones of the western wave fair islands green   where are your moonlight halls your cedarn glooms   the blossoming abysses of your hills   your flowering capes and your goldsanded bays   blown round with happy airs of odorous winds   where are the infinite ways which seraphtrod   wound thro your great elysian solitudes   whose lowest depths were as with visible love   filld with divine effulgence circumfusd   flowing between the clear and polishd stems   and ever circling round their emerald cones   in coronals and glories such as gird   the unfading foreheads of the saints in heaven   for nothing visible they say had birth   in that blest ground but it was playd about   with its peculiar glory then i raisd   my voice and cried wide afric doth thy sun   lighten thy hills enfold a city as fair   as those which starrd the night o the elder world   or is the rumour of thy timbuctoo   a dream as frail as those of ancient time    a curve of whitening flashing ebbing light   a rustling of white wings the bright descent   of a young seraph and he stood beside me   there on the ridge and lookd into my face   with his unutterable shining orbs   so that with hasty motion i did veil   my vision with both hands and saw before me   such colourd spots as dance athwart the eyes   of those that gaze upon the noonday sun   girt with a zone of flashing gold beneath   his breast and compassd round about his brow   with triple arch of everchanging bows   and circled with the glory of living light   and alternations of all hues he stood   o child of man why muse you here alone   upon the mountain on the dreams of old   which filld the earth with passing loveliness   which flung strange music on the howling winds   and odours rapt from remote paradise   thy sense is cloggd with dull mortality   thy spirit fetterd with the bond of clay   open thine eye and see                      i lookd but not   upon his face for it was wonderful   with its exceeding brightness and the light   of the great angel mind which lookd from out   the starry glowing of his restless eyes   i felt my soul grow mighty and my spirit   with supernatural excitation bound   within me and my mental eye grew large   with such a vast circumference of thought   that in my vanity i seemd to stand   upon the outward verge and bound alone   of full beatitude each failing sense   as with a momentary flash of light   grew thrillingly distinct and keen i saw   the smallest grain that dappled the dark earth   the indistinctest atom in deep air   the moons white cities and the opal width   of her small glowing lakes her silver heights   unvisited with dew of vagrant cloud   and the unsounded undescended depth   of her black hollows the clear galaxy   shorn of its hoary lustre wonderful   distinct and vivid with sharp points of light   blaze within blaze an unimagind depth   and harmony of planetgirded suns   and moonencircled planets wheel in wheel   archd the wan sapphire nay the hum of men   or other things talking in unknown tongues   and notes of busy life in distant worlds   beat like a far wave on my anxious ear    a maze of piercing trackless thrilling thoughts   involving and embracing each with each   rapid as fire inextricably linkd   expanding momently with every sight   and sound which struck the palpitating sense   the issue of strong impulse hurried through   the rivn rapt brain as when in some large lake   from pressure of descendant crags which lapse   disjointed crumbling from their parent slope   at slender interval the level calm   is ridgd with restless and increasing spheres   which break upon each other each th effect   of separate impulse but more fleet and strong   than its precursor till the eyes in vain   amid the wild unrest of swimming shade   dappled with hollow and alternate rise   of interpenetrated arc would scan   definite round                    i know not if i shape   these things with accurate similitude   from visible objects for but dimly now   less vivid than a halfforgotten dream   the memory of that mental excellence   comes oer me and it may be i entwine   the indecision of my present mind   with its past clearness yet it seems to me   as even then the torrent of quick thought   absorbed me from the nature of itself   with its own fleetness where is he that borne   adown the sloping of an arrowy stream   could link his shallop to the fleeting edge   and muse midway with philosophic calm   upon the wondrous laws which regulate   the fierceness of the bounding element   my thoughts which long had grovelld in the slime   of this dull world like dusky worms which house   beneath unshaken waters but at once   upon some earthawakening day of spring   do pass from gloom to glory and aloft   winnow the purple bearing on both sides   double display of starlit wings which burn   fanlike and fibred with intensest bloom   een so my thoughts erewhile so low now felt   unutterable buoyancy and strength   to bear them upward through the trackless fields   of undefind existence far and free    then first within the south methought i saw   a wilderness of spires and chrystal pile   of rampart upon rampart dome on dome   illimitable range of battlement   on battlement and the imperial height   of canopy oercanopied                               behind   in diamond light upsprung the dazzling cones   of pyramids as far surpassing earths   as heaven than earth is fairer each aloft   upon his renownd eminence bore globes   of wheeling suns or stars or semblances   of either showering circular abyss   of radiance but the glory of the place   stood out a pillard front of burnishd gold   interminably high if gold it were   or metal more ethereal and beneath   two doors of blinding brilliance where no gaze   might rest stood open and the eye could scan   through length of porch and lake and boundless       hall   part of a throne of fiery flame wherefrom   the snowy skirting of a garment hung   and glimpse of multitudes of multitudes   that ministerd around itif i saw   these things distinctly for my human brain   staggerd beneath the vision and thick night   came down upon my eyelids and i fell    with ministering hand he raisd me up   then with a mournful and ineffable smile   which but to look on for a moment filld   my eyes with irresistible sweet tears   in accents of majestic melody   like a swoln rivers gushings in still night   mingled with floating music thus he spake   there is no mightier spirit than i to sway   the heart of man and teach him to attain   by shadowing forth the unattainable   and step by step to scale that mighty stair   whose landingplace is wrapt about with clouds   of glory of heavenb with earliest light of spring   and in the glow of sallow summertide   and in red autumn when the winds are wild   with gambols and when fullvoiced winter roofs   the headland with inviolate white snow   i play about his heart a thousand ways   visit his eyes with visions and his ears   with harmonies of wind and wave and wood   of winds which tell of waters and of waters   betraying the close kisses of the wind   and win him unto me and few there be   so gross of heart who have not felt and known   a higher than they see they with dim eyes   behold me darkling lo i have given thee   to understand my presence and to feel   my fullness i have filld thy lips with power   i have raisd thee higher to the spheres of heaven   mans first last home and thou with ravishd sense   listenest the lordly music flowing from   th illimitable years i am the spirit   the permeating life which courseth through   all th intricate and labyrinthine veins   of the great vine of fable which outspread   with growth of shadowing leaf and clusters rare   reacheth to every corner under heaven   deeprooted in the living soil of truth   so that mens hopes and fears take refuge in   the fragrance of its complicated glooms   and cool impleachèd twilights child of man   seest thou yon river whose translucent wave   forth issuing from darkness windeth through   the argent streets o the city imaging   the soft inversion of her tremulous domes   her gardens frequent with the stately palm   her pagods hung with music of sweet bells   her obelisks of rangèd chrysolite   minarets and towers lo how he passeth by   and gulphs himself in sands as not enduring   to carry through the world those waves which bore   the reflex of my city in their depths   oh city oh latest throne where i was raisd   to be a mystery of loveliness   unto all eyes the time is well nigh come   when i must render up this glorious home   to keen discovery soon yon brilliant towers   shall darken with the waving of her wand   darken and shrink and shiver into huts   black specks amid a waste of dreary sand   lowbuilt mudwalled barbarian settlement   how changd from this fair city                     thus far the spirit   then parted heavenward on the wing and i   was left alone on calpe and the moon   had fallen from the night and all was dark   the following review of timbuctoo was published in the athenæum of 22nd july 1829 we have accustomed ourselves to think perhaps without any very good reason that poetry was likely to perish among us for a considerable period after the great generation of poets which is now passing away the age seems determined to contradict us and that in the most decided manner for it has put forth poetry by a young man and that where we should least expect itnamely in a prize poem these productions have often been ingenious and elegant but we have never before seen one of them which indicated really firstrate poetical genius and which would have done honour to any men that ever wrote such we do not hesitate to affirm is the little work before us and the examiners seem to have felt it like ourselves for they have assigned the prize to the author though the measure in which he writes was never before we believe thus selected for honour we extract a few lines to justify our admiration 50 lines 62112 quoted how many men have lived for a century who could equal this at the time when this highly eulogistic notice of the youthful unknown poet

experiences of converse lives   the linkèd woes of many a fiery change   had purified and chastened and made free   always there stood before him night and day   of wayward vary coloured circumstance   the imperishable presences serene   colossal without form or sense or sound   dim shadows but unwaning presences   fourfacèd to four corners of the sky   and yet again three shadows fronting one   one forward one respectant three but one   and yet again again and evermore   for the two first were not but only seemed   one shadow in the midst of a great light   one reflex from eternity on time   one mighty countenance of perfect calm   awful with most invariable eyes   for him the silent congregated hours   daughters of time divinely tall beneath   severe and youthful brows with shining eyes   smiling a godlike smile the innocent light   of earliest youth pierced through and through with all   keen knowledges of lowembowèd eld   upheld and ever hold aloft the cloud   which droops low hung

remaining from the body and apart   in intellect and power and will hath heard   time flowing in the middle of the night   and all things creeping to a day of doom   how could ye know him ye were yet

hope    you cast to ground the hope which once was mine       but did the while your harsh decree deplore   embalming with sweet tears the vacant shrine       my heart where hope had been and was no

night till morn   in darkness weeps as all ashamed to weep   because the earth hath made her state forlorn   with selfwrought evils of unnumbered years   and doth the fruit of her dishonour reap   and

spring   hues of fresh youth and mightily outgrow   the wan dark coil of faded suffering   forth in the pride of beauty issuing   a sheeny snake the light of vernal bowers   moving his crest to all

originally intended by tennyson that this poem should form part of his 1833 volume it was put in type and according to custom copies were distributed among his friends when on the eve of publication he decided to omit it again in 1869 it was sent to press with a new third part added and was again withdrawn the third part onlythe golden supper founded on a story in boccaccios decameronbeing published in the volume the holy grail in 1866 1870 and 1875 attempts had been made by mr herne shepherd to publish editions of the lovers tale reprinted from stray proof copies of the 1833 printing each of these attempts was repressed by tennyson and at last in 1879 the complete poem as now included in the collected works was issued with an apologetic reference to the necessity of reprinting the poem to prevent its circulation in an unauthorised form but the 1879 issue is considerably altered from the original issue of 1833 as written by tennyson in his nineteenth year since only as a product of tennysons youth does the poem merit any attention it has seemed good to reprint it here as originally written  a fragment  the poem of the lovers tale the lover is supposed to be himself a poet was written in my nineteenth year and consequently contains nearly as many faults as words that i deemed it not wholly unoriginal is my only apology for its publicationan apology lame and poor and somewhat impertinent to boot so that if its infirmities meet with more laughter than charity in the world i shall not raise my voice in its defence i am aware how deficient the poem is in point of art and it is not without considerable misgivings that i have ventured to publish even this fragment of it enough says the old proverb is as good as a feasttennysons original introductory note    here far away seen from the topmost cliff   filling with purple gloom the vacancies   between the tufted hills the sloping seas   hung in midheaven and halfway down rare sails   white as white clouds floated from sky to sky   oh pleasant breast of waters quiet bay   like to a quiet mind in the loud world   where the chafed breakers of the outer sea   sunk powerless even as anger falls aside   and withers on the breast of peaceful love   thou didst receive that belt of pines that fledged   the hills that watchd thee as love watcheth love   in thine own essence and delight thyself   to make it wholly thine on sunny days   keep thou thy name of lovers bay see sirs   even now the goddess of the past that takes   the heart and sometimes toucheth but one string   that quivers and is silent and sometimes   sweeps suddenly all its halfmoulderd chords   to an old melody begins to play   on those firstmoved fibres of the brain   i come great mistress of the ear and eye   oh lead me tenderly for fear the mind   rain thro my sight and strangling sorrow weigh   mine utterance with lameness tho long years   have hallowed out a valley and a gulf   betwixt the native land of love and me   breathe but a little on me and the sail   will draw me to the rising of the sun   the lucid chambers of the morning star   and east of life                     permit me friend i prithee   to pass my hand across my brows and muse   on those dear hills that nevermore will meet   the sight that throbs and aches beneath my touch   as tho there beat a heart in either eye   for when the outer lights are darkend thus   the memorys vision hath a keener edge   it grows upon me nowthe semicircle   of dark blue waters and the narrow fringe   of curving beachits wreaths of dripping green   its pale pink shellsthe summerhouse aloft   that opend on the pines with doors of glass   a mountain nest the pleasure boat that rockd   lightgreen with its own shadow keel to keel   upon the crispings of the dappled waves   that blanched upon its side                                o love o hope   they come they crowd upon me all at once   moved from the cloud of unforgotten things   that sometimes on the horizon of the mind   lies foldedoften sweeps athwart in storm   they flash across the darkness of my brain   the many pleasant days the moolit nights   the dewy dawnings and the amber eyes   when thou and i camilla thou and i   were borne about the bay or safely moord   beneath some low browd cavern where the wave   plashd sapping its worn ribs the while without   and close above us sang the windtost pine   and shook its earthly socket for we heard   in rising and in falling with the tide   close by our ears the huge roots strain and creak   eye feeding upon eye with deep intent   and mine with love too high to be expressd   arrested in its sphere and ceasing from   all contemplation of all forms did pause   to worship mine own image laved in light   the centre of the splendours all unworthy   of such a shrinemine image in her eyes   by diminution made most glorious   moved with their motions as those eyes were moved   with motions of the soul as my heart beat   twice to the melody of hers her face   was starryfair not pale tenderly flushd   as twere with dawn she was darkhaird darkeyed   oh such dark eyes a single glance of them   will govern a whole life from birth to death   careless of all things else led on with light   in trances and in visions look at them   you lose yourself in utter ignorance   you cannot find their depth for they go back   and farther back and still withdraw themselves   quite into the deep soul that evermore   fresh springing from her fountains in the brain   still pouring thro floods with redundant light   her narrow portals                        trust me long ago   i should have died if it were possible   to die in gazing on that perfectness   which i do bear within me i had died   but from my farthest lapse my latest ebb   thine image like a charm of light and strength   upon the waters pushed me back again   on these deserted sands of barren life   tho from the deep vault where the heart of hope   fell into dust and crumbled in the dark   forgetting who to render beautiful   her countenance with quick and healthful blood   thou didst not sway me upward could i perish   with such a costly casket in the grasp   of memory he that saith it hath oersteppd   the slippery footing of his narrow wit   and falln away from judgment thou art light   to which my spirit leaneth all her flowers   and length of days and immortality   of thought and freshness ever selfrenewd   for time and grief abode too long with life   and like all other friends i the world at last   they grew aweary of her fellowship   so time and grief did beckon unto death   and death drew nigh and beat the doors of life   but thou didst sit alone in the inner house   a wakeful portress and didst parle with death   this is a charmed dwelling which i hold   so death gave back and would no further come   yet is my life nor in the present time   nor in the present place to me alone   pushed from his chair of regal heritage   the present is the vassal of the past   so that in that i have lived do i live   and cannot die and am in having been   a portion of the pleasant yesterday   thrust forward on today and out of place   a body journeying onward sick with toil   the lithe limbs bowd as with a heavy weight   and all the senses weakend in all save that   which long ago they had gleand and garnerd up   into the granaries of memory   the clear brow bulwark of the precious brain   now seamd and chinkd with yearsand all the while   the light soul twines and mingles with the growths   of vigorous early days attracted won   married made one with molten into all   the beautiful in past of act or place   even as the allenduring camel driven   far from the diamond fountain by the palms   toils onward thro the middle moonlight nights   shadowd and crimsond with the drifting dust   or when the white heats of the blinding noons   beat from the concave sand yet in him keeps   a draught of that sweet fountain that he loves   to stay his feet from falling and his spirit   from bitterness of death                              ye ask me friends   when i began to love how should i tell ye   or from the after fulness of my heart   flow back again unto my slender spring   and first of love tho every turn and depth   between is clearer in my life than all   its present flow ye know not what ye ask   how should the broad and open flower tell   what sort of bud it was when pressd together   in its green sheath close lapt in silken folds   it seemed to keep its sweetness to itself   yet was not the less sweet for that it seemd   for young life knows not when young life was born   but takes it all for granted neither love   warm in the heart his cradle can remember   love in the womb but resteth satisfied   looking on her that brought him to the light   or as men know not when they fall asleep   into delicious dreams our other life   so know i not when i began to love   this is my sum of knowledgethat my love   grew with myselfand say rather was my growth   my inward sap the hold i have on earth   my outward circling air wherein i breathe   which yet upholds my life and evermore   was to me daily life and daily death   for how should i have lived and not have loved   can ye take off the sweetness from the flower   the colour and the sweetness from the rose   and place them by themselves or set apart   their motions and their brightness from the stars   and then point out the flower or the star   or build a wall betwixt my life and love   and tell me where i am tis even thus   in that i live i love because i love   i live whateer is fountain to the one   is fountain to the other and wheneer   our god unknits the riddle of the one   there is no shade or fold of mystery   swathing the other                        many many years   for they seem many and my most of life   and well i could have lingerd in that porch   so unproportioned to the dwelling place   in the maydews of childhood opposite   the flush and dawn of youth we lived together   apart alone together on those hills   before he saw my day my father died   and he was happy that he saw it not   but i and the first daisy on his grave   from the same clay came into light at once   as love and i do number equal years   so she my love is of an age with me   how like each other was the birth of each   the sister of my mothershe that bore   camilla close beneath her beating heart   which to the imprisoned spirit of the child   with its true touched pulses in the flow   and hourly visitation of the blood   sent notes of preparation manifold   and mellowd echoes of the outer world   my mothers sister mother of my love   who had a twofold claim upon my heart   one twofold mightier than the other was   in giving so much beauty to the world   and so much wealth as god had charged her with   loathing to put it from herself for ever   crownd with her highest act the placid face   and breathless body of her good deeds past   so we were born so orphand she was motherless   and i without a father so from each   of those two pillars which from earth uphold   our childhood one had falln away and all   the careful burthen of our tender years   trembled upon the other he that gave   her life to me delightedly fulfilld   all lovingkindnesses all offices   of watchful care and trembling tenderness   he worked for both he prayd for both he slept   dreaming of both nor was his love the less   because it was divided and shot forth   boughs on each side laden with wholesome shade   wherein we rested sleeping or awake   and sung aloud the matinsong of life    she was my fostersister on one arm   the flaxen ringlets of our infancies   wanderd the while we rested one soft lap   pillowd us both one common light of eyes   was on us as we lay our baby lips   kissing one bosom ever drew from thence   the stream of life one stream one life one blood   one sustenance which still as thought grew large   still larger moulding all the house of thought   perchance assimilated all our tastes   and future fancies tis a beautiful   and pleasant meditation what whateer   our general mother meant for me alone   our mutual mother dealt to both of us   so what was earliest mine in earliest life   i shared with her in whom myself remains   as was our childhood so our infancy   they tell me was a very miracle   of fellowfeeling and communion   they tell me that we would not be alone   we cried when we were parted when i wept   her smile lit up the rainbow on my tears   stayd on the clouds of sorrow that we loved   the sound of one anothers voices more   than the grey cuckoo loves his name and learnd   to lisp in tune together that we slept   in the same cradle always face to face   heart beating time to heart lip pressing lip   folding each other breathing on each other   dreaming together dreaming of each other   they should have added till the morning light   sloped thro the pines upon the dewy pane   falling unseald our eyelids and we woke   to gaze upon each other if this be true   at thought of which my whole soul languishes   and faints and hath no pulse no breath as tho   a man in some still garden should infuse   rich attar in the bosom of the rose   till drunk with its own wine and overfull   of sweetness and in smelling of itself   it fall on its own thornsif this be true   and that way my wish leaneth evermore   still to believe ittis so sweet a thought   why in the utter stillness of the soul   doth questiond memory answer not nor tell   of this our earliest our closest drawn   most loveliest most delicious union   oh happy happy outset of my days   green springtide april promise glad new year   of being which with earliest violets   and lavish carol of clearthroated larks   filld all the march of lifei will not speak of thee   these have not seen thee these can never know thee   they cannot understand me pass on then   a term of eighteen years ye would but laugh   if i should tell ye how i heard in thought   those rhymes the lion and the unicorn   the fourandtwenty blackbirds banbury cross   the gander and the man of mitylene   and all the quaint old scraps of ancient crones   which are as gems set in my memory   because she learnd them with me or what profits it   to tell ye that her father died just ere   the daffodil was blown or how we found   the drowned seaman on the shore these things   unto the quiet daylight of your minds   are cloud and smoke but in the dark of mine   show traced with flame move with me to that hour   which was the hinge on which the door of hope   once turning opend far into the outward   and never closed again                          i well remember   it was a glorious morning such a one   as dawns but once a season mercury   on such a morning would have flung himself   from cloud to cloud and swum with balanced wings   to some tall mountain on that day the year   first felt his youth and strength and from his spring   moved smiling toward his summer on that day   love working shook his wings that charged the winds   with spiced maysweets from bound to bound and blew   fresh fire into the sun and from within   burst thro the heated buds and sent his soul   into the songs of birds and touchd faroff   his mountainaltars his high hills with flame   milder and purer up the rocks we wound   the great pine shook with lovely sounds of joy   that came on the seawind as mountain brooks   our blood ran free the sunshine seemd to brood   more warmly on the heart than on the brow   we often paused and looking back we saw   the clefts and openings in the hills all filld   with the blue valley and the glistening brooks   and with the low dark grovesa land of love   where love was worshippd upon every height   where love was worshippd under every tree   a land of promise flowing with the milk   and honey of delicious memories   down to the sea as far as eye could ken   from verge to verge it was a holy land   still growing holier as you neard the bay   for where the temple stood when we had reachd   the grassy platform on some hill i stoopd   i gatherd the wild herbs and for her brows   and mine wove chaplets of the selfsame flower   which she took smiling and with my work there   crownd her clear forehead once or twice she told me   for i remember all things to let grow   the flowers that run poison in their veins   she said the evil flourish in the world   then playfully she gave herself the lie   nothing in nature is unbeautiful   so brother pluck and spare not so i wove   even the dullblooded poppy whose red flower   hued with the scarlet of a fierce sunrise   like to the wild youth of an evil king   is without sweetness but who crowns himself   above the secret poisons of his heart   in his old agea graceful thought of hers   graven on my fancy as i said with these   she crownd her forehead o how like a nymph   a stately mountainnymph she lookd how native   unto the hills she trod on what an angel   how clothed with beams my eyes fixd upon hers   almost forgot even to move again   my spirit leapd as with those thrills of bliss   that shoot across the soul in prayer and show us   that we are surely heard methought a light   burst from the garland i had woven and stood   a solid glory on her bright black hair   a light methought broke from her dark dark eyes   and shot itself into the singing winds   a light methought flashd even from her white robe   as from a glass in the sun and fell about   my footsteps on the mountains                        about sunset   we came unto the hill of woe so calld   because the legend ran that long time since   one rainy night when every wind blew loud   a woful man had thrust his wife and child   with shouts from off the bridge and following plunged   into the dizzy chasm below below   sheer thro the blackwalld cliff the rapid brook   shot down his inner thunders built above   with matted bramble and the shining gloss   of ivyleaves whose lowhung tresses dippd   in the fierce stream bore downward with the wave   the path was steep and loosely strewn with crags   we mounted slowly yet to both of us   it was delight not hindrance unto both   delight from hardship to be overcome   and scorn of perilous seeming unto me   intense delight and rapture that i breathed   as with a sense of nigher deity   with her to whom all outward fairest things   were by the busy mind referrd compared   as bearing no essential fruits of excellence   save as they were the types and shadowings   of hersand then that i became to her   a tutelary angel as she rose   and with a fearful selfimpelling joy   saw round her feet the country far away   beyond the nearest mountains bosky brows   burst into open prospectheath and hill   and hollow lined and wooded to the lips   and steep down walls of battlemented rock   girded with broom or shiverd into peaks   and glory of broad waters interfused   whence rose as it were breath and steam of gold   and over all the great wood rioting   and climbing starrd at slender intervals   with blossom tufts of purest white and last   framing the mighty landskip to the west   a purple range of purple cones between   whose interspaces gushd in blinding bursts   the incorporate light of sun and sea                              at length   upon the tremulous bridge that from beneath   seemed with a cobweb firmament to link   the earthquakeshattered chasm hung with shrubs   we passed with tears of rapture all the west   and even unto the middle south was ribbd   and barrd with bloom on bloom the sun beneath   held for a space twixt cloud and wave showerd down   rays of a mighty circle weaving over   that varied wilderness a tissue of light   unparalleld on the other side the moon   halfmelted into thin blue air stood still   and pale and fibrous as a witherd leaf   nor yet endured in presence of his eyes   to imbue his lustre most unloverlike   since in his absence full of light and joy   and giving light to others but this chiefest   next to her presence whom i loved so well   spoke loudly even into my inmost heart   as to my outward hearing the loud stream   forth issuing from his portals in the crag   a visible link unto the home of my heart   ran amber toward the west and nigh the sea   parting my own loved mountains was received   shorn of its strength into the sympathy   of that small bay which into open main   glowd intermingling close beneath the sun   spirit of love that little hour was bound   shut in from time and dedicate to thee   thy fires from heavn had touchd it and the earth   they fell on became hallowd evermore    we turnd our eyes met hers were bright and mine   were dim with floating tears that shot the sunset   in light rings round me and my name was borne   upon her breath henceforth my name has been   a hallowd memory like the names of old   a centerd glorycircled memory   and a peculiar treasure brooking not   exchange or currency and in that hour   a hope flowd round me like a golden mist   charmd amid eddies of melodious airs   a moment ere the onward whirlwind shatter it   waverd and floatedwhich was less than hope   because it lackd the power of perfect hope   but which was more and higher than all hope   because all other hope hath lower aim   even that this name to which her seraph lips   did lend such gentle utterance this one name   in some obscure hereafter might inwreathe   how lovelier nobler then her life her love   with my life love soul spirit and heart and strength    brother she said let this be calld henceforth   the hill of hope and i replied o sister   my will is one with thine the hill of hope   nevertheless we did not change the name    love lieth deep love dwells not in lipdepths   love wraps her wings on either side the heart   constraining it with kisses close and warm   absorbing all the incense of sweet thoughts   so that they pass not to the shrine of sound   else had the life of that delighted hour   drunk in the largeness of the utterance   of love but how should earthly measure mete   the heavenly unmeasured or unlimited love   which scarce can tune his high majestic sense   unto the thundersong that wheels the spheres   scarce living in the aeolian harmony   and flowing odour of the spacious air   scarce housed in the circle of this earth   be cabind up in words and syllables   which waste with the breath that made em                           sooner earth   might go round heaven and the straight girth of time   inswathe the fullness of eternity   than language grasp the infinite of love   o day which did enwomb that happy hour   thou art blest in the years divinest day   o genius of that hour which dost uphold   thy coronal of glory like a god   amid thy melancholy mates farseen   who walk before thee and whose eyes are dim   with gazing on the light and depth of thine   thy name is ever worshippd among hours   had i died then i had not seemd to die   for bliss stood round me like the lights of heaven   that cannot fade they are so burning bright   had i died then i had not known the death   planting my feet against this mound of time   i had thrown me on the vast and from this impulse   continuing and gathering ever ever   agglomerated swiftness i had lived   that intense moment thro eternity   oh had the power from whose right hand the light   of life issueth and from whose left hand floweth   the shadow of death perennial effluences   whereof to all that draw the wholesome air   somewhile the one must overflow the other   then had he stemmd my day with night and driven   my current to the fountain whence it sprang   even his own abiding excellence   on me methinks that shock of gloom had falln   unfelt and like the sun i gazed upon   which lapt in seeming dissolution   and dipping his head low beneath the verge   yet bearing round about him his own day   in confidence of unabated strength   steppeth from heaven to heaven from light to light   and holding his undimmed forehead far   into a clearer zenith pure of cloud   so bearing on thro being limitless   the triumph of this foretaste i had merged   glory in glory without sense of change    we trod the shadow of the downward hill   we passd from light to dark on the other side   is scooped a cavern and a mountainhall   which none have fathomd if you go far in   the country people rumour you may hear   the moaning of the woman and the child   shut in the secret chambers of the rock   i too have heard a soundperchance of streams   running faroff within its inmost halls   the home of darkness but the cavern mouth   half overtrailed with a wanton weed   gives birth to a brawling stream that stepping lightly   adown a natural stair of tangled roots   is presently received in a sweet grove   of eglantine a place of burial   far lovelier than its cradle for unseen   but taken with the sweetness of the place   it giveth out a constant melody   that drowns the nearer echoes lower down   spreads out a little lake that flooding makes   cushions of yellow sand and from the woods   that belt it rise three dark tall cypresses   three cypresses symbols of mortal woe   that men plant over graves                     hither we came   and sitting down upon the golden moss   held converse sweet and lowlow converse sweet   in which our voices bore least part the wind   told a lovetale beside us how he wood   the waters and the crispd waters lispd   the kisses of the wind that sick with love   fainted at intervals and grew again   to utterance of passion ye cannot shape   fancy so fair as is this memory   methought all excellence that ever was   had drawn herself from many thousand years   and all the separate edens of this earth   to centre in this place and time i listend   and her words stole with most prevailing sweetness   into my heart as thronged fancies come   all unawares into the poets brain   or as the dewdrops on the petal hung   when summer winds break their soft sleep with sighs   creep down into the bottom of the flower   her words were like a coronal of wild blooms   strung in the very negligence of art   or in the art of nature where each rose   doth faint upon the bosom of the other   flooding its angry cheek with odorous tears   so each with each inwoven lived with each   and were in union more than doublesweet   what marvel my camilla told me all   it was so happy an hour so sweet a place   and i was as the brother of her blood   and by that name was wont to live in her speech   dear name which had too much of nearness in it   and heralded the distance of this time   at first her voice was very sweet and low   as tho she were afeard of utterance   but in the onward current of her speech   as echoes of the hollowbanked brooks   are fashioned by the channel which they keep   his words did of their meaning borrow sound   her cheek did catch the colour of her words   i heard and trembled yet i could but hear   my heart pausedmy raised eyelids would not fall   but still i kept my eyes upon the sky   i seemd the only part of time stood still   and saw the motion of all other things   while her words syllable by syllable   like water drop by drop upon my ear   fell and i wishd yet wishd her not to speak   but she spoke on for i did name no wish   what marvel my camilla told me all   her maiden dignities of hope and love   perchance she said returnd even then the stars   did tremble in their stations as i gazed   but she spake on for i did name no wish   no wishno hope hope was not wholly dead   but breathing hard at the approach of death   updrawn in expectation of her change   camilla my camilla who was mine   no longer in the dearest use of mine   the written secrets of her inmost soul   lay like an open scroll before my view   and my eyes read they read aright her heart   was lionels it seemd as tho a link   of some light chain within my inmost frame   was riven in twain that life i heeded not   flowd from me and the darkness of the grave   the darkness of the grave and utter night   did swallow up my vision at her feet   even the feet of her i loved i fell   smit with exceeding sorrow unto death    then had the earth beneath me yawning given   sign of convulsion and tho horrid rifts   sent up the moaning of unhappy spirits   imprisond in her centre with the heat   of their infolding element had the angels   the watchers at heavens gate pushd them apart   and from the golden threshold had downrolld   their heaviest thunder i had lain as still   and blind and motionless as then i lay   white as quenchd ashes cold as were the hopes   of my lorn love what happy air shall woo   the witherd leaf falln in the woods or blasted   upon this bough a lightning stroke had come   even from that heaven in whose light i bloomd   and taken away the greenness of my life   the blossom and the fragrance who was cursed   but i who miserable but i even misery   forgot herself in that extreme distress   and with the overdoing of her part   did fall away into oblivion   the night in pity took away my day   because my grief as yet was newly born   of too weak eyes to look upon the light   and with the hasty notice of the ear   frail life was startled from the tender love   of him she brooded over would i had lain   until the pleached ivy tress had wound   round my worn limbs and the wild briar had driven   its knotted thorns thro my unpaining brows   leaning its roses on my faded eyes   the wind had blown above me and the rain   had falln upon me and the gilded snake   had nestled in this bosomthrone of love   but i had been at rest for evermore   long time entrancement held me all too soon   life like a wanton tooofficious friend   who will not hear denial vain and rude   with proffer of unwished for services   entering all the avenues of sense   passd thro into his citadel the brain   with hated warmth of apprehensiveness   and first the chillness of the mountain stream   smote on my brow and then i seemd to hear   its murmur as the drowning seaman hears   who with his head below the surface dropt   listens the dreadful murmur indistinct   of the confused seas and knoweth not   beyond the sound he lists and then came in   oerhead the white light of the weary moon   diffused and molten into flaky cloud   was my sight drunk that it did shape to me   him who should own that name or had my fancy   so lethargised discernment in the sense   that she did act the stepdame to mine eyes   warping their nature till they ministerd   unto her swift conceits twere better thus   if so be that the memory of that sound   with mighty evocation had updrawn   the fashion and the phantasm of the form   it should attach to there was no such thing   it was the man she loved even lionel   the lover lionel the happy lionel   all joy who drew the happy atmosphere   of my unhappy sighs fed with my tears   to him the honey dews of orient hope   oh rather had some loathly ghastful brow   halfbursten from the shroud in cere cloth bound   the dead skin withering on the fretted bone   the very spirit of paleness made still paler   by the shuddering moonlight fixd his eyes on mine   horrible with the anger and the heat   of the remorseful soul alive within   and damnd unto his loathed tenement   methinks i could have sooner met that gaze   oh how her choice did leap forth from his eyes   oh how her love did clothe itself in smiles   about his lips this was the very archmock   and insolence of uncontrolled fate   when the effect weighd seas upon my head   to twit me with the cause                           why how was this   could he not walk what paths he chose nor breathe   what airs he pleased was not the wide world free   with all her interchange of hill and plain   to him as well as me i know not faith   but misery like a fretful wayward child   refused to look his author in the face   must he come my way too was not the south   the east the west all open if he had falln   in love in twilight why should he come my way   robed in those robes of light i must not wear   with that great crown of beams about his brows   come like an angel to a damned soul   to tell him of the bliss he had with god   come like a careless and a greedy heir   that scarce can wait the reading of the will   before he takes possession was mine a mood   to be invaded rudely and not rather   a sacred secret unapproached woe   unspeakable i was shut up with grief   she took the body of my past delight   narded and swathed and balmd it for herself   and laid it in a newhewn sepulchre   where man had never lain i was led mute   into her temple like a sacrifice   i was the highpriest in her holiest place   not to be loudly broken in upon   oh friend thoughts deep and heavy as these wellnigh   oerbore the limits of my brain but he   bent oer me and my neck his arm upstayd   from earth i thought it was an adders fold   and once i strove to disengage myself   but faild i was so feeble she was there too   she bent above me too her cheek was pale   oh very fair and pale rare pity had stolen   the living bloom away as tho a red rose   should change into a white one suddenly   her eyes i saw were full of tears in the morn   and some few drops of that distressful rain   being wafted on the wind drove in my sight   and being there they did break forth afresh   in a new birth immingled with my own   and still bewept my grief keeping unchanged   the purport of their coinage her long ringlets   drooping and beaten with the plaining wind   did brush my forehead in their toandfro   for in the sudden anguish of her heart   loosed from their simple thrall they had flowed abroad   and onward floating in a full dark wave   parted on either side her argent neck   mantling her form half way she when i woke   after my refluent health made tender quest   unanswerd for i spoke not for the sound   of that dear voice so musically low   and now first heard with any sense of pain   as it had taken life away before   choked all the syllables that in my throat   strove to uprise laden with mournful thanks   from my full heart and ever since that hour   my voice hath somewhat falterdand what wonder   that when hope died part of her eloquence   died with her he the blissful lover too   from his great hoard of happiness distilld   some drops of solace like a vain rich man   that having always prosperd in the world   folding his hands deals comfortable words   to hearts wounded for ever yet in truth   fair speech was his and delicate of phrase   falling in whispers on the sense addressd   more to the inward than the outward ear   as rain of the midsummer midnight soft   scarceheard recalling fragrance and the green   of the dead springsuch as in other minds   had filmd the margents of the recent wound   and why was i to darken their pure love   if as i knew they two did love each other   because my own was darkend why was i   to stand within the level of their hopes   because my hope was widowd like the cur   in the childs adage did i love camilla   ye know that i did love her to this present   my fullorbd love hath waned not did i love her   and could i look upon her tearful eyes   tears wept for me for meweep at my grief   what had she done to weeplet my heart   break ratherwhom the gentlest airs of heaven   should kiss with an unwonted gentleness   her love did murder mine what then she deemd   i wore a brothers mind she calld me brother   she told me all her love she shall not weep    the brightness of a burning thought awhile   battailing with the glooms of my dark will   moonlike emerged lit up unto itself   upon the depths of an unfathomd woe   reflex of action starting up at once   as men do from a vague and horrid dream   and throwing by all consciousness of self   in eager haste i shook him by the hand   then flinging myself down upon my knees   even where the grass was warm where i had lain   i prayd aloud to god that he would hold   the hand of blessing over lionel   and her whom he would make his wedded wife   camilla may their days be golden days   and their long life a dream of linked love   from which may rude death never startle them   but grow upon them like a glorious vision   of unconceived and awful happiness   solemn but splendid full of shapes and sounds   swallowing its precedent in victory   let them so love that men and boys may say   lo how they love each other till their love   shall ripen to a proverb unto all   known when their faces are forgot in the land   and as for me camilla as for me   think not thy tears will make my name grow green   the dew of tears is an unwholesome dew   the course of hope is driedthe life o the plant   they will but sicken the sick plant more   deem then i love thee but as brothers do   so shalt thou love me still as sisters do   or if thou dreamst aught farther dream but how   i could have loved thee had there been none else   to love as lovers loved again by thee    or this or somewhat like to this i spoke   when i did see her weep so ruefully   for sure my love should neer induce the front   and mask of hate whom woful ailments   of unavailing tears and heart deep moans   feed and envenom as the milky blood   of hateful herbs a subtlefanged snake   shall love pledge hatred in her bitter draughts   and batten on his poisons love forbid   love passeth not the threshold of cold hate   and hate is strange beneath the roof of love   o love if thou best love dry up these tears   shed for the love of love for tho mine image   the subject of thy power be cold in her   yet like cold snow it melteth in the source   of these sad tears and feeds their downward flow   so love arraignd to judgment and to death   received unto himself a part of blame   being guiltless as an innocent prisoner   who when the woful sentence hath been past   and all the clearness of his fame hath gone   beneath the shadow of the curse of men   first falls asleep in swoon wherefrom awaked   and looking round upon his tearful friends   forthwith and in his agony conceives   a shameful sense as of a cleaving crime   for whence without some guilt should such grief be   so died that hour and fell into the abysm   of forms outworn but not to be outworn   who never haild another worth the life   that made it sensible so died that hour   like odour wrapt into the winged wind   borne into alien lands and far away   there be some hearts so airyfashioned   that in the death of love if eer they loved   on that sharp ridge of utmost doom ride highly   above the perilous seas of change and chance   nay more holds out the lights of cheerfulness   as the tall ship that many a dreary year   knit to some dismal sandbank far at sea   all through the lifelong hours of utter dark   showers slanting light upon the dolorous wave   for me all other hopes did sway from that   which hung the frailest falling they fell too   crushd link on link into the beaten earth   and love did walk with banishd hope no more   it was illdone to part ye sisters fair   loves arms were wreathed about the neck of hope   and hope kissd love and love drew in her breath   in that close kiss and drank her whisperd tales   they said that love would die when hope was gone   and love mourned long and sorrowed after hope   at last she sought out memory and they trod   the same old paths where love had walked with hope   and memory fed the soul of love with tears    ii    from that time forth i would not see her more   but many weary moons i lived alone   alone and in the heart of the great forest   sometimes upon the hills beside the sea   all day i watched the floating isles of shade   and sometimes on the shore upon the sands   insensibly i drew her name until   the meaning of the letters shot into   my brain anon the wanton billow washd   them over till they faded like my love   the hollow caverns heard methe black brooks   of the midforest heard methe soft winds   laden with thistledown and seeds of flowers   paused in their course to hear me for my voice   was all of thee the merry linnet knew me   the squirrel knew me and the dragonfly   shot by me like a flash of purple fire   the rough briar tore my bleeding palms the hemlock   brow high did strike my forehead as i pasd   yet trod i not the wildflower in my path   nor bruised the wildbirds egg                         was this the end   why grew we then together i the same plot   why fed we the same fountain drew the same sun   why were our mothers branches of one stem   why were we one in all things save in that   where to have been one had been the roof and crown   of all i hoped and feard if that same nearness   were father to this distance and that one   vauntcourier this double if affection   living slew love and sympathy hewd out   the bosomsepulchre of sympathy    chiefly i sought the cavern and the hill   where last we roamd together for the sound   of the loud stream was pleasant and the wind   came wooingly with violet smells sometimes   all day i sat within the cavernmouth   fixing my eyes on those three cypresscones   which spired above the wood and with mad hand   tearing the bright leaves of the ivyscreen   i cast them in the noisy brook beneath   and watchd them till they vanished from my sight   beneath the bower of wreathed eglantines   and all the fragments of the living rock   huge splinters which the sap of earliest showers   or moisture of the vapour left in clinging   when the shrill stormblast feeds it from behind   and scatters it before had shatterd from   the mountain till they fell and with the shock   half dug their own graves in mine agony   did i make bear of all the deep rich moss   wherewith the dashing runnel in the spring   had liveried them all over in my brain   the spirit seemd to flag from thought to thought   like moonlight wandering through a mist my blood   crept like the drains of a marsh thro all my body   the motions of my heart seemd far within me   unfrequent low as tho it told its pulses   and yet it shook me that my frame did shudder   as it were drawn asunder by the rack   but over the deep graves of hope and fear   the wreck of ruind life and shatterd thought   brooded one masterpassion evermore   like to a low hung and a fiery sky   above some great metropolis earth shockd   hung round with raggedrimmed burning folds   embathing all with wild and woful hues   great hills of ruins and collapsed masses   of thundershaken columns indistinct   and fused together in the tyrannous light    so gazed i on the ruins of that thought   which was the playmate of my youthfor which   i lived and breathed the dew the sun the rain   unto the growth of body and of mind   the blood the breath the feeling and the motion   the slope into the current of my years   which drove them onwardmade them sensible   the precious jewel of my honourd life   erewhile close couchd in golden happiness   now proved counterfeit was shaken out   and trampled on left to its own decay     the lovers tale    sometimes i thought camilla was no more   some one had told me she was dead and askd me   if i would see her burial then i seemd   to rise and thro the forestshadow borne   with more than mortal swiftness i ran down   the sleepy seabank till i came upon   the rear of a procession curving round   the silversheeted bay in front of which   six stately virgins all in white upbare   a broad earthsweeping pall of whitest lawn   wreathed round the bier with garlands in the distance   from out the yellow woods upon the hill   lookd forth the summit and the pinnacles   of a grey steeple all the pageantry   save those six virgins which upheld the bier   were stoled from head to foot in flowing black   one walkd abreast with me and veiled his brow   and he was loud in weeping and in praise   of the departed a strong sympathy   shook all my soul i flung myself upon him   in tears and cries i told him all my love   how i had loved her from the first whereat   he shrunk and howld and from his brow drew back   his hand to push me from him and the face   the very face and form of lionel   flashd through my eyes into my innermost brain   and at his feet i seemed to faint and fall   to fall and die away i could not rise   albeit i strove to follow they passd on   the lordly phantasms in their floating folds   they passd and were no more but i had falln   prone by the dashing runnel on the grass    always th inaudible invisible thought   artificer and subject lord and slave   shaped by the audible and visible   moulded the audible and visible   all crisped sounds of wave and leaf and wind   flatterd the fancy of my fading brain   the stormpaviliond element the wood   the mountain the three cypresses the cave   were wrought into the tissue of my dream   the moanings in the forest the loud stream   awoke me not but were a part of sleep   and voices in the distance calling to me   and in my vision bidding me dream on   like sounds within the twilight realms of dreams   which wander round the bases of the hills   and murmur in the lowdropt eaves of sleep   but faint within the portals oftentimes   the vision had fair prelude in the end   opening on darkness stately vestibules   to cares and shows of death whether the mind   with a revenge even to itself unknown   made strange division of its suffering   with her whom to have suffering viewd had been   extremest pain or that the cleareyed spirit   being blasted in the present grew at length   prophetical and prescient of whateer   the future had in store or that which most   enchains belief the sorrow of my spirit   was of so wide a compass it took in   all i had loved and my dull agony   ideally to her transferred became   anguish intolerable                  the day waned   alone i sat with her about my brow   her warm breath floated in the utterance   of silverchorded tones her lips were sunderd   with smiles of tranquil bliss which broke in light   like morning from her eyesher eloquent eyes   as i have seen them many hundred times   filld all with clear pure fire thro mine down raind   their spiritsearching splendours as a vision   unto a haggard prisoner ironstayd   in damp and dismal dungeons underground   confined on points of faith when strength is shockd   with torment and expectancy of worse   upon the morrow thro the ragged walls   all unawares before his halfshut eyes   comes in upon him in the dead of night   and with th excess of sweetness and of awe   makes the heart tremble and the eyes run over   upon his steely gyves so those fair eyes   shone on my darkness forms which ever stood   within the magic cirque of memory   invisible but deathless waiting still   the edict of the will to reassume   the semblance of those rare realities   of which they were the mirrors now the light   which was their life burst through the cloud of thought   keen irrepressible                         it was a room   within the summerhouse of which i spoke   hung round with paintings of the sea and one   a vessel in midocean her heaved prow   clambering the mast bent and the revin wind   in her sail roaring from the outer day   betwixt the closest ivies came a broad   and solid beam of isolated light   crowded with driving atomies and fell   slanting upon that picture from prime youth   wellknown wellloved she drew it long ago   forth gazing on the waste and open sea   one morning when the upblown billow ran   shoreward beneath red clouds and i had pourd   into the shadowing pencils naked forms   colour and life it was a bond and seal   of friendship spoken of with tearful smiles   a monument of childhood and of love   the poesy of childhood my lost love   symbold in storm we gazed on it together   in mute and glad remembrance and each heart   grew closer to the other and the eye   was riveted and charmbound gazing like   the indian on a stilleyed snake low crouchd   a beauty which is death when all at once   that painted vessel as with inner life   gan rock and heave upon that painted sea   an earthquake my loud heartbeats made the ground   roll under us and all at once soul life   and breath and motion passd and flowd away   to those unreal billows round and round   a whirlwind caught and bore us mighty gyves   rapid and vast of hissing spray winddriven   far through the dizzy dark aloud she shriekd   my heart was cloven with pain i wound my arms   about her we whirld giddily the wind   sung but i claspd her without fear her weight   shrank in my grasp and over my dim eyes   and parted lips which drank her breath down hung   the jaws of death i screaming from me flung   the empty phantom all the sway and whirl   of the storm dropt to windless calm and i   down welterd thro the dark ever and ever     index to first lines   a gate and a field half ploughed all thoughts all creeds all dreams are true angels have talked with him and showed him thrones as when a man that sails in a balloon blow ye the trumpets gather from afar but she tarries in her place check every outflash every ruder sally could i outwear my present state of woe ere yet my heart was sweet loves tomb every day hath its night first drink a health this solemn night god bless our prince and bride heaven weeps above the earth all night here far away seen from the topmost cliff his eyes in eclipse home they brought him slain with spears
