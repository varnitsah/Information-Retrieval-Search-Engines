60451998	the u p trail   by zane grey    when i think how the railroad has been pushed through this unwatered wilderness and haunt of savage tribes how at each stage of the construction roaring impromptu cities full of gold and lust and death sprang up and then died away again and are now but wayside stations in the desert how in these uncouth places chinese pirates worked side by side with border ruffians and broken men from europe gambling drinking quarreling and murdering like wolves and then when i go on to remember that all this epical turmoil was conducted by gentlemen in frockcoats with a view to nothing more extraordinary than a fortune and a subsequent visit to parisit seems to me as if this railway were the one typical achievement of the age in which we live as if it brought together into one plot all the ends of the world and all the degrees of social rank and offered to some great writer the busiest the most extended and the most varied subject for an enduring literary work if it be romance if it be contrast if it be heroism that we require what was troy to this                 robert louis stevenson                  in across the plains      1  in the early sixties a trail led from the broad missouri swirling yellow and turgid between its greengroved borders for miles and miles out upon the grassy nebraska plains turning westward over the undulating prairie with its swales and billows and long winding lines of cottonwoods to a slow vast heave of rising groundwyomingwhere the herds of buffalo grazed and the wolf was lord and the campfire of the trapper sent up its curling blue smoke from beside some lonely stream on and on over the barren lands of eternal monotony all so gray and wide and solemn and silent under the endless sky on ever on up to the bleak black hills and into the waterless gullies and through the rocky gorges where the deer browsed and the savage lurked then slowly rising to the pass between the great bold peaks and across the windy uplands into utah with its verdant valleys green as emeralds and its hazefilled canons and wonderful windworn cliffs and walls and its pale salt lakes veiled in the shadows of stark and lofty rocks dim lilaccolored austere and isolated ever onward across nevada and ever westward up from desert to mountain up into california where the white streams rushed and roared and the stately pines towered and seen from craggy heights deep down the little blue lakes gleamed like gems finally sloping to the great descent where the mountain world ceased and where out beyond the golden land asleep and peaceful stretched the illimitable pacific vague and grand beneath the setting sun     2  deep in the wyoming hills lay a valley watered by a stream that ran down from cheyenne pass a band of sioux indians had an encampment there viewed from the summit of a grassy ridge the scene was colorful and idle and quiet in keeping with the lonely beautiful valley cottonwoods and willows showed a bright green the course of the stream was marked in dark where the water ran and light where the sand had bleached brown and black dots scattered over the valley were in reality grazing horses lodgepole tents gleamed white in the sun and tiny bits of red stood out against the white lazy wreaths of blue smoke rose upward  the wyoming hills were split by many such valleys and many such bare grassy ridges sloped up toward the mountains upon the side of one ridge the highest there stood a solitary mustang haltered with a lasso he was a ragged shaggy wild beast and there was no saddle or bridle on him nothing but the halter he was not grazing although the bleached white grass grew long and thick under his hoofs he looked up the slope in a direction indicated by his pointing ears and watched a wavering movement of the long grass  it was wild up on that ridge bare of everything except grass and the strange wavering had a nameless wildness in its motion no stealthy animal accounted for that tremblingthat forward undulating quiver it wavered on to the summit of the ridge  what a wide and wonderful prospect opened up to view from this lofty point ridge after ridge sloped up to the wyoming hills and these in turn raised their bleak dark heads toward the mountains looming pale and gray with caps of snow in the distance out beyond the ridges indistinct in the glare stretched an illimitable expanse gray and dullthat was the prairieland an eagle lord of all he surveyed sailed round and round in the sky  below this grassy summit yawned a valley narrow and long losing itself by turns to distant east and west and through it ran a faint white winding line which was the old st vrain and laramie trail  there came a moment when the wavering in the grass ceased on the extreme edge of the slope then it parted to disclose the hideous visage of a sioux indian in war paint his dark piercing malignant glance was fixed upon the st vrain and laramie trail his halfnaked body rested at ease a rifle lay under his hand  there he watched while the hours passed the sun moved on in its course until it tipped the peaks with rose far down the valley black and white objects appeared crawling round the bend the indian gave an almost imperceptible start but there was no change in his expression he watched as before  these moving objects grew to be oxen and prairieschoonersa small caravan traveling east it wound down the trail and halted in a circle on the bank of a stream  the indian scout slid backward and the parted grass slowly closing hid from his dark gaze the camp scene below he wormed his way back well out of sight then rising he ran over the summit of the ridge to leap upon his mustang and ride wildly down the slope     3  bill horn leader of that caravan had a large amount of gold which he was taking back east no one in his party except a girl knew that he had the fortune  horn had gone west at the beginning of the gold strikes but it was not until 53 that any success attended his labors later he struck it rich and in 1865 as soon as the snow melted on the mountain passes he got together a party of men and several women and left sacramento he was a burly miner bearded and uncouth of rough speech and taciturn nature and absolutely fearless  at ogden utah he had been advised not to attempt to cross the wyoming hills with so small a party for the sioux indians had gone on the warpath  horn was leading his own caravan and finding for himself the trail that wound slowly eastward he did not have a scout or hunter with him eastwardtraveling caravans were wont to be small and poorly outfitted for only the homesick the failures the wanderers and the lawless turned their faces from the golden state at the start horn had eleven men three women and the girl on the way he had killed one of the men and another together with his wife had yielded to persuasion of friends at ogden and had left the party so when horn halted for camp one afternoon in a beautiful valley in the wyoming hills there were only nine men with him  on a long journey through wild country strangers grow close together or far apart bill horn did not think much of the men who had accepted the chance he offered them and daily he grew more aloof they were not a responsible crowd and the best he could get out of them was the driving of oxen and camp chores indifferently done he had to kill the meat and find the water and keep the watch upon entering the wyoming hills region horn showed a restlessness and hurry and anxiety this in no wise affected the others they continued to be aimless and careless as men who had little to look forward to  this beautiful valley offered everything desirable for a camp site except natural cover or protection in case of attack but horn had to take the risk the oxen were tired the wagons had to be greased and it was needful to kill meat here was an abundance of grass a clear brook wood for campfires and sign of game on all sides  haul roundmake a circle horn ordered the drivers of the oxen  this was the first time he had given this particular order and the men guffawed or grinned as they hauled the great clumsy prairieschooners into a circle the oxen were unhitched the camp duffle piled out the ring of axes broke the stillness fires were started  horn took his rifle and strode away up the brook to disappear in the green brush of a ravine  it was early in the evening with the sun not yet out of sight behind a lofty ridge that topped the valley slope high grass bleached white shone brightly on the summit soon several columns of blue smoke curled lazily aloft until catching the wind high up they were swept away meanwhile the men talked at their tasks  say pard did you come along this here laramie trail goin west asked one  nope i hit the santa fe trail was the reply  how about you jones  same fer me  wal said another i went round to california by ship an id hev been lucky to drown  an now were all goin back poorer than when we started remarked a third  pard youve said somethin  wal i seen a heap of gold if i didnt find any  jones has this here bill horn any gold with him  he acts like it answered jones an i heerd he struck it rich out thar  the men appeared divided in their opinions of bill horn from him they drifted to talk of possible indian raids and scouted the idea then they wondered if the famous pony express had been over this laramie trail finally they got on the subject of a rumored railroad to be built from east to west  no railroad cant be built over this trail said jones bluntly  sure not but couldnt more level ground be dug asked another  dug across them utah deserts an up them mountains hell men sure hev more sense than thet exclaimed the third  and so they talked and argued at their tasks  the women however had little to say one the wife of the loquacious jones lived among past associations of happy years that would not come againa soberfaced middleaged woman the other woman was younger and her sad face showed traces of a former comeliness they called her mrs durade the girl was her daughter allie she appeared about fifteen years old and was slight of form her face did not seem to tan it was pale she looked tired and was shy and silent almost ashamed she had long rich chestnutcolored hair which she wore in a braid her eyes were singularly large and dark and violet in color  its a long long way we are from home yet sighed mrs jones  you call east home replied mrs durade bitterly  for lands sake yes i do exclaimed the other if there was a home in that california i never saw it tents and log cabins and mudholes such places for a woman to live oh i hated that california a lot of wild men all crazy for gold gold that only a few could find and none could keep i pray every night to live to get back home  mrs durade had no reply she gazed away over the ridges toward the east with a haunting shadow in her eyes  just then a rifleshot sounded from up in the ravine the men paused in their tasks and looked at one another then reassured by this exchange of glances they fell to work again but the women cast apprehensive eyes around there was no life in sight except the grazing oxen presently horn appeared carrying a deer slung over his shoulders  allie ran to meet him she and horn were great friends to her alone was he gentle and kind she saw him pause at the brook then drop the deer carcass and bend over the ground as if to search for something when allie reached his side he was on his knees examining a moccasin print in the sand  an indian track exclaimed allie  allie it sure aint anythin else he replied thet is what ive been lookin fer a day oldmebbe more  uncle bill is there any danger she asked fearfully gazing up the slope  lass were in the wyoming hills an i wish to the lord we was out he answered  then he picked up the deer carcass a heavy burden and slung it hoofs in front over his shoulders  let me carry your gun said allie  they started toward camp  lass listen began horn earnestly mebbe theres no need to fear but i dont like injun tracks not these days now im goin to scare this lazy outfit mebbe thetll make them rustle but dont you be scared  in camp the advent of fresh venison was hailed with satisfaction  wal ill gamble the shot thet killed this meat was heerd by injuns blurted out horn as he deposited his burden on the grass and whipped out his huntingknife then he glared at the outfit of men he had come to despise  horn i reckon you pear more set up about injuns than usual remarked jones  fresh sioux track right out thar along the brook  no  sioux exclaimed another  go an look fer yourself  not a man of them moved a step horn snorted his disdain and without more talk began to dress the deer  meanwhile the sun set behind the ridge and the day seemed far spent the evening meal of the travelers was interrupted when horn suddenly leaped up and reached for his rifle  thets no injun but i dont like the looks of how hes comin  all gazed in the direction in which horn pointed a horse and rider were swiftly approaching down the trail from the west before any of the startled campers recovered from their surprise the horse reached the camp the rider hauled up short but did not dismount  hello he called the man was not young he had piercing gray eyes and long hair he wore fringed gray buckskin and carried a long heavy muzzleloading rifle  im slingerlandtrapper in these hyar parts he went on with glance swiftly taking in the group whos boss of this caravan  i ambill horn replied the leader stepping out  thars a band of sioux redskins on your trail  horn lifted his arms high the other men uttered exclamations of amaze and dread the women were silent  did you see them asked horn  yes from a ridge back hyar ten miles i saw them sneakin along the trail an i knowed they meant mischief i rode along the ridges or id been hyar sooner  how many injuns  i counted fifteen they were goin along slow like as not theyve sent word fer more theres a big sioux camp over hyar in another valley  are these sioux on the warpath  i saw dead an scalped white men a few days back replied slingerland  horn grew as black as a thundercloud and he cursed the group of palefaced men who had elected to journey eastward with him  youll hev to fight he ended brutally an thetll be some satisfaction to me  horn theres soldiers over hyar in camp went on slingerland do you want me to ride after them  soldiers ejaculated horn  yes theyre with a party of engineers surveyin a line fer a railroad reckon i could git them all hyar in time to save youif them sioux keep comin slow ill go or stay hyar with you  friend you goan ride thet hoss  all right you hitch up an break camp keep goin hard down the trail an ill fetch the troops an head off the redskins  any use to take to the hills queried horn sharply  i reckon not youve no hosses youd be tracked down hurry along thets best an say i see youve a young girl hyar i can take her up behind me  allie climb up behind him said horn motioning to the girl  ill stay with mother she replied  go childgo entreated mrs durade  others urged her but she shook her head horns big hand trembled as he held it out and for once there was no trace of hardness about his face  allie i never had no lass of my own i wish youd go with him youd be safean you could take my  no interrupted the girl  slingerland gave her a strange admiring glance then turned his quick gray eyes upon horn anythin i can take  horn hesitated no it was jest somethin i wanted the girl to hev  slingerland touched his shaggy horse and called over his shoulder rustle out of hyar then he galloped down the trail leaving the travelers standing aghast  break camp thundered horn  a scene of confusion followed in a very short while the prairieschooners were lumbering down the valley twilight came just as the flight got under way the tired oxen were beaten to make them run but they were awkward and the loads were heavy night fell and the road was difficult to follow the wagons rolled and bumped and swayed from side to side camp utensils and blankets dropped from them one wagon broke down the occupants frantically gathering together their possessions ran ahead to pile into the one in front  horn drove on and on at a gait cruel to both men and beasts the women were roughly shaken hours passed and miles were gained that valley led into another with an upgrade rocky and treacherous horn led on foot and ordered the men to do likewise the night grew darker by and by further progress became impossible for the oxen failed and a wild barrier of trees and rocks stopped the way  then the fugitives sat and shivered and waited for dawn no one slept all listened intently to the sounds of the lonely night magnified now by their fears horn strode to and fro with his riflea grim dark silent form whenever a wolf mourned or a cat squalled or a night bird voiced the solitude or a stone rattled off the cliff the fugitives started up quiveringly alert expecting every second to hear the screeching yell of the sioux they whispered to keep up a flickering courage and the burly horn strode to and fro thoughtful as though he were planning something and always listening allie sat in one of the wagons close to her mother she was wide awake and not so badly scared all through this dreadful journey her mother had not seemed natural to allie and the farther they traveled eastward the stranger she grew during the ride that night she had moaned and shuddered and had clasped allie close but when the flight had come to a forced end she grew silent  allie was young and hopeful she kept whispering to her mother that the soldiers would come in time  that brave fellow in buckskinhell save us said allie  child i feel ill never see home again finally whispered mrs durade  mother  allie i must tell youi must cried mrs durade very low and fiercely she clung to her daughter  tell me what whispered allie  the truththe truth oh ive deceived you all your life  deceived me oh mother then tell menow  childyoull forgive meand neverhate me cried the mother brokenly  mother how can you talk so i love you and allie clasped the shaking form closer then followed a silence during which mrs durade recovered her composure  allie i ran off with durade before you were born began the mother swiftly as if she must hurry out her secret durade is not your father your name is lee your father is allison lee ive heard hes a rich man now oh i want to get backto give you to himto beg his forgiveness we were married in new orleans in 1847 my father made me marry him i never loved allison lee he was not a kind mannot the sort i admired i met durade he was a spaniarda blueblooded adventurer i ran off with him we joined the goldseekers traveling to california you were born out there in 1850 it has been a hard life but i taught youi did all i could for you i kept my secret from youand his lately i could endure it no longer ive run off from durade  oh mother i knew we were running off from him cried allie breathlessly and i know he will follow us  indeed i fear he will replied the mother but lord spare me his revenge  mother oh it is terrible he is not my father i never loved him i couldnt but mother you must have loved him  child i was durades slave she replied sadly  then why did you run away he was kindgood to us  allie listen durade was a gamblera man crazy to stake all on the fall of a card he did not love gold but he loved games of chance it was a terrible passion with him once he meant to gamble my honor away but that other gambler was too much of a man there are gamblers who are men i think i began to hate durade from that time he was a dishonest gambler he made me share in his guilt my face lured miners to his dens my facefor i was beautiful once oh i sunk so low but he forced me thank god i left himbefore it was too latetoo late for you  mother he will follow us cried allie  but he shall never have you ill kill him before i let him get you replied the mother  hed never harm me mother whatever he is murmured allie  child he would use you exactly as he used me he wanted me to let him have youalready he wanted to train youhe said youd be beautiful some day  mother gasped allie is that what he meant  forget him child and forget your mothers guilt ive suffered ive repented all i ask of god is to take you safely home to allison leethe father whom you have never known  the night hour before dawn grew colder and blacker a great silence seemed wedged down between the ebony hills the stars were wan no cry of wolf or moan of wind disturbed the stillness and the stars grew warmer the black east changed and paled dawn was at hand an opaque and obscure grayness filled the world all had changed except that strange oppressive and vast silence of the wild  that silence was broken by the screeching bloodcurdling yell of the sioux  at times these bloody savages attacked without warning and in the silence of the grave again they sent out their warcries chilling the hearts of the bravest perhaps that warning yell was given only when doom was certain  horn realized the dread omen and accepted it he called the fugitives to him and choosing the bestprotected spot among the rocks and wagons put the women in the center  now menif its the last for uslet it be fight mebbe we can hold out till the troops come  then in the gray gloom of dawn he took a shovel prying up a piece of sod he laid it aside and began to dig and while he dug he listened for another warscreech and gazed often and intently into the gloom but there was no sound and nothing to see when he had dug a hole several feet deep he carried an armful of heavy leather bags and deposited them in it then he went back to the wagon for another armful the men grayfaced as the gloom watched him fill up the hole carefully replace the sod and stamp it down  he stood for an instant gazing down as if he had buried the best of his life then he laughed grim and hard  theres my gold if any man wins through this he can have it  bill horn divined that he would never live to touch his treasure again he who had slaved for gold and had risked all for it cared no more what might become of it gripping his rifle he turned to await the inevitable  moments of awful suspense passed nothing but the fitful beating of hearts came to the ears of the fugitivesears that strained to the stealthy approach of the red foeears that throbbed prayerfully for the tramp of the troopers horses but only silence ensued a horrible silence more nerveracking than the clash of swift sure death  then out of the gray gloom burst jets of red flame rifles cracked and the air suddenly filled with hideous clamor the men began to shoot at gliding shadows grayer than the gloom and every shot brought a volley in return smoke mingled with the gloom in the slight intervals between rifleshots there were swift rustling sounds and sharp thuds from arrows then the shrill strife of sound became continuous it came from all around and closed in upon the doomed caravan it swelled and rolled away and again there was silence     4  in 1865 just after the war a party of engineers was at work in the wyoming hills on a survey as hazardous as it was problematical they had charge of the laying out of the union pacific railroad  this party escorted by a company of united states troops under colonel dillon had encountered difficulties almost insurmountable and now having penetrated the wild hills to the eastern slope of the rockies they were halted by a seemingly impassable barriera gorge too deep to fill too wide to bridge  general lodge chief engineer of the corps gave an order to one of his assistants put young neale on the job if we ever survey a line through this awful place well owe it to him  the assistant baxter told an irishman standing by and smoking a short black pipe to find neale and give him the chiefs orders the irishman casey by name was rawboned redfaced and hardfeatured a man inured to exposure and rough life his expression was one of extreme and fixed good humor as if his face had been set masklike during a grin he removed the pipe from his lips  gineral the flag ive been holdin fer thot dom young surveyor is the wrong color i want a green flag  baxter waved the irishman to his errand but general lodge looked up from the maps and plans before him with a faint smile he had a dark stern face and the bearing of a soldier  casey you can have any color you like he said maybe green would change our luck  gineral well niver git no railroad built an if we do itll be the irish thot builds it responded casey and went his way  truly only one hope remainedthat the agile and daring neale with his eye of a mountaineer and his genius for estimating distance and grade might run a line around the gorge  while waiting for neale the engineers went over the maps and drawings again and again with the earnestness of men who could not be beaten  lodge had been a majorgeneral in the civil war just ended and before that he had traveled through this part of the west many times and always with the mighty project of a railroad looming in his mind it had taken years to evolve the plan of a continental railroad and it came to fruition at last through many men and devious ways through plots and counterplots the wonderful idea of uniting east and west by a railroad originated in one mans brain he lived for it and finally he died for it but the seeds he had sown were fruitful one by one other men divined and believed despite doubt and fear until the day arrived when congress put the government of the united states the army a group of frockcoated directors and unlimited gold back of general lodge and bade him build the road  in all the length and breadth of the land no men but the chief engineer and his assistants knew the difficulty the peril of that undertaking the outside world was interested the nation waited mostly in doubt but lodge and his engineers had been seized by the spirit of some great thing to be in the making of which were adventure fortune fame and that strange call of life which foreordained a heritage for future generations they were grim they were indomitable  warren neale came hurrying up he was a new englander of poor family selfeducated wild for adventure keen for achievement eager ardent bronzefaced and keeneyed under six feet in height built like a wedge but not heavya young man of twentythree with strong latent possibilities of character  general lodge himself explained the difficulties of the situation and what the young surveyor was expected to do neale flushed with pride his eyes flashed his jaw set but he said little while the engineers led him out to the scene of the latest barrier it was a rugged gorge old and yellow and crumbled cedarfringed at the top bare and white at the bottom the approach to it was through a break in the walls so that the gorge really extended both above and below this vantagepoint  this is the only pass through these foothills said engineer henney the eldest of lodges corps  the passage ended where the break in the walls fronted abruptly upon the gorge it was a wild scene only inspired and dauntless men could have entertained any hope of building a railroad through such a place the mouth of the break was narrow a rugged slope led up to the left to the right a huge buttress of stone wall bulged over the gorge across stood out the seamed and cracked cliffs and below yawned the abyss the nearer side of the gorge could only be guessed at  neale crawled to the extreme edge of the precipice and lying flat he tried to discover what lay beneath evidently he did not see much for upon getting up he shook his head then he gazed at the bulging wall  the side of that can be blown off he muttered  but whats around the corner if its straight stone wall for miles and miles we are done said boone another of the engineers  the opposite wall is just that added henney a straight stone wall  general lodge gazed at the baffling gorge his face became grimmer harder it seems impossible to go on but we must go on he said  a short silence ensued the engineers faced one another like men confronted by a last and crowning hindrance then neale laughed he appeared cool and confident  it only looks bad he said well climb to the top and ill go down over the wall on a rope  neale had been let down over many precipices in those stony hills he had been the luckiest the most daring and successful of all the men picked out and put to perilous tasks no one spoke of the accidents that had happened or even the fatal fall of a lineman who a few weeks before had ventured once too often every rod of road surveyed made the engineers sterner at their task just as it made them keener to attain final success  the climb to the top of the bluff was long and arduous the whole corps went and also some of the troopers  ill need a long rope neale had said to king his lineman  it was this order that made king take so much time in ascending the bluff besides he was a cowboy used to riding and could not climb well  walishorerustledall the lineaboot heah he drawled pantingly as he threw lassoes and coils of rope at neales feet  neale picked up some of the worn pieces he looked dubious is this all you could get he asked  shore is an thet includes what casey rustled from the soldiers  help me knot these went on neale  wal i reckon this heah time ill go down before you drawled king  neale laughed and looked curiously at his lineman back somewhere in nebraska this cowboy from texas had attached himself to neale they worked together they had become friends larry red king made no bones of the fact that texas had grown too hot for him he had been born with an itch to shoot to neale it seemed that king made too much of a service neale had renderedthe mere matter of a helping hand still there had been danger  go down before me exclaimed neale  i reckon replied king  you will not rejoined the other bluntly i may not need you at all whats the sense of useless risk  wal im goinelse i throw up my job  oh hell burst out neale as he strained hard on a knot again he looked at his lineman this time with something warmer than curiosity in his glance  larry red king was tall slim hard as iron and yet undeniably graceful in outlinea singularly handsome and picturesque cowboy with flaming hair and smooth red face and eyes of flashing blue from his belt swung a sheath holding a heavy gun  wal go ahaid added neale mimicking his comrade an i shore hope thet this heah time youall get aboot enough of your job  one by one the engineers returned from different points along the wall and they joined the group around neale and king  test that rope ordered general lodge  the long rope appeared to be amply strong when king fastened one end round his body under his arms the question arose among the engineers just as it had arisen for neale whether or not it was needful to let the lineman down before the surveyor henney who superintended this sort of work decided it was not necessary  i reckon ill go ahaid said king like all texans of his type larry king was slow easy cool careless moreover he gave a singular impression of latent nerve wildness violence  there seemed every assurance of a deadlock when general lodge stepped forward and addressed his inquiry to neale  larry thinks the rope will break so he wants to go first replied neale  there were broad smiles forthcoming yet no one laughed this was one of the thousands of strange human incidents that must be enacted in the building of the railroad it might have been humorous but it was big it fixed the spirit and it foreshadowed events  general lodges stern face relaxed but he spoke firmly obey orders he admonished larry king  the loop was taken from larrys waist and transferred to neales then all was made ready to let the daring surveyor with his instrument down over the wall  neale took one more look at the rugged front of the cliff when he straightened up the ruddy bronze had left his face  theres a bulge of rock i cant see whats below it he said no use for signals ill go down the length of the rope and trust to find a footing i cant be hauled up  they all conceded this silently  then neale sat down let his legs dangle over the wall firmly grasped his instrument and said to the troopers who held the rope all right  they lowered him foot by foot  it was windy and the dust blew up from under the wall black canon swifts like swallows darted out with rustling wings uttering frightened twitterings the engineers leaned over watching neales progress larry king did not look over the precipice he watched the slowly slipping rope as knot by knot it passed over it fascinated him  hes reached the bulge of rock called baxter craning his neck  there hes downout of sight exclaimed henney  casey the flagman leaned farther out than any other phwat a dom sthrange way to build a railroad i sez he remarked  the gorge lay asleep in the westering sun silent full of blue haze seen from this height far above the break where the engineers had first halted it had the dignity and dimensions of a canon its walls had begun to change color in the sunset light  foot by foot the soldiers let the rope slip until probably two hundred had been let out and there were scarcely a hundred feet left by this time all that part of the cable which had been made of lassoes had passed over the remainder consisted of pieces of worn and knotted and frayed rope at which the engineers began to gaze fearfully  i dont like this said henney nervously neale surely ought to have found a ledge or bench or slope by now  instinctively the soldiers held back reluctantly yielding inches where before they had slacked away feet but intent as was their gaze it could not rival that of the cowboy  hold he yelled suddenly pointing to where the strained rope curved over the edge of the wall  the troopers held hard the rope ceased to pay out the strain seemed to increase larry king pointed with a lean hand  its agoin to break  his voice hoarse and swift checked the forward movement of the engineers he plunged to his knees before the rope and reached clutchingly as if he wanted to grasp it yet dared not  ropes was my job old an rotten its breakin  even as he spoke the rope snapped the troopers thrown off their balance fell backward baxter groaned boone and henney cried out in horror general lodge stood aghast dazed then they all froze rigid in the position of intense listening  a dull sound puffed up from the gorge a low crash then a slowrising roar and rattle of sliding earth and rock it diminished and ceased with the hollow cracking of stone against stone  casey broke the silence among the listening men with a curse larry red king rose from his knees holding the end of the snapped rope which he threw from him with passionate violence then with action just as violent he unbuckled his belt and pulled it tighter and buckled it again his eyes were blazing with blue lightning they seemed to accuse the agitated engineers of deliberate murder but he turned away without speaking and hurried along the edge of the gorge evidently searching for a place to go down  general lodge ordered the troopers to follow king and if possible recover neales body  that lad had a future said old henney sadly well miss him  boones face expressed sickness and horror  baxter choked too bad he murmured but whats to be done  the chief engineer looked away down the shadowy gorge where the sun was burning the ramparts red to have command of men was hard bitter death stalked with his orders he foresaw that the building of this railroad was to resemble the war in which he had sent so many lads and men to bloody graves  the engineers descended the long slope and returned to camp a mile down the narrow valley fires were blazing columns of smoke were curling aloft the merry song and reckless laugh of soldiers were ringing out so clear in the still air horses were neighing and stamping  colonel dillon reported to general lodge that one of the scouts had sighted a large band of sioux indians encamped in a valley not far distant this tribe had gone on the warpath and had begun to harass the engineers neales tragic fate was forgotten in the apprehension of what might happen when the sioux discovered the significance of that surveying expedition  the sioux could make the building of the u p impossible said henney always nervous and pessimistic  no indiansnothing can stop us declared his chief  the troopers sent to follow larry king came back to camp saying that they had lost him and that they could not find any place where it was possible to get down into that gorge  in the morning larry king had not returned  detachments of troopers were sent in different directions to try again and the engineers went out once more to attack their problem success did not attend the efforts of either party and at sunset when all had wearily returned to camp larry king was still absent then he was given up for lost  but before dark the tall cowboy limped into camp dusty and torn carrying neales long tripod and surveying instrument it looked the worse for a fall but apparently was not badly damaged king did not give the troopers any satisfaction limping on to the tents of the engineers he set down the instrument and called boone was the first to come out and his summons brought henney baxter and the younger members of the corps general lodge sitting at his campfire some rods away and bending over his drawings did not see kings arrival  no one detected any difference in the cowboy except that he limped slow cool careless he was yet somehow vital and impelling wal we run the line aroundfour miles up the gorge whar the crossin is easy only ninetyfoot grade to the mile  the engineers looked at him as if he were crazy  but neale he fellhes dead exclaimed henney  daid wal no neale aint daid drawled larry  where is he then  i reckon hes comin along back heah  is he hurt  shore an hungry too which is what i am replied larry as he limped away  some of the engineers hurried out in the gathering dusk to meet neale while others went to general lodge with the amazing story  the chief received the good news quietly but with intent eyes bring neale and king hereas soon as their needs have been seen to he ordered then he called after baxter ninety feet to the mile you said  ninetyfoot grade so king reported  by all thats lucky breathed the chief as if his load had been immeasurably lightened send those boys to me  some of the soldiers had found neale down along the trail and were helping him into camp he was crippled and almost exhausted he made light of his condition yet he groaned when he dropped into a seat before the fire  some one approached larry king to inform him that the general wanted to see him  wal im hungryan he aint my boss replied larry and went on with his meal it was well known that the southerner would not talk  but neale talked he blazed up in eloquent eulogy of his lineman before an hour had passed away every one in camp knew that larry had saved neales life then the loquacious casey intruding upon the cowboys reserve got roundly cursed for his pains  gwan out among thim sooz injuns an be a dead hero thin retorted casey as the cowboy stalked off to be alone in the gloom evidently casey was disappointed not to get another cursing for he turned to his comrade mcdermott an axman say mac phwot do you make of cowboys  i tell ye pat i make of thim thet youll be full of bulletholes before this railroads built  thin bgosh ill hould drink fer a long time yit replied casey  later general lodge visited neale and received the drawings and figures that made plain solution of what had been a formidable problem  it was easy once i landed under that bulge of cliff said neale theres a slope of about fortyfive degreesnot all rock and four miles up the gorge peters out we can cross i got to where i could see the divideand oh there is where our troubles begin the worst is all to come  youve said it replied the chief soberly we cant follow the trail and get the grade necessary weve got to hunt up a pass  well find one said neale hopefully  neale youre ambitious and youve the kind of spirit that never gives up ive watched your work from the start youll make a big position for yourself with this railroad if you only live through the building of it  oh ill live through it all right replied neale laughing im like a catalways on my feetand have nine lives besides  you surely must how far did you fall this time  not far i landed in a tree where my instrument stuck but i crashed down and got a hard knock on the head when larry found me i was unconscious and sliding for another precipice  that texan seems attached to you  well if he wasnt before he will be now said neale feelingly ill tell you general larrys redheaded a droll lazy southerner and hes made fun of by the men but they dont understand him they certainly cant see how dangerous he is only i dont mean that i do mean that hes true like steel  yes he showed that when the rope snapped i was sure hed pull a gun on us neale i would like to have had you and larry red king with me through the war  thank you general lodge but i like the prospects now  neale youre hungry for wild life  yes replied neale simply  i said as much i felt very much the same way when i was your age and you like our prospects well youve thought things out neale the building of the u p will be hell  general i can see that it sort of draws metwo waysthe wildness of it and then to accomplish something  my lad i hope you will accomplish something big without living out all the wildness  you think i might lose my head queried neale  you are excitable and quicktempered do you drink  yesa little answered the young man but i dont care for liquor  dont drink neale said the chief earnestly of course it doesnt matter now for were only a few men out here in the wilds but when our work is done over the divide we must go back along the line you know ground has been broken and rails laid west of omaha the works begun i hear that omaha is a beehive thousands of idle men are flocking west the work will be military we must have the army to protect us and we will hire all the soldiers who apply but there will be hordes of othersthe dregs of the war and all the bad characters of the frontier they will flock to the construction camp millions of dollars will go along with the building gold where its all coming from i have no idea the government backs us with the armythats all but the gold will be forthcoming i have that faith and think lad what it will mean in a year or two ten thousand soldiers in one camp out here in these wild hills and thousands of othershonest merchants and dishonest merchants whisky men gamblers desperadoes bandits and bad women niggers greasers indians all together moving from camp to camp where there can be no law  it will be great exclaimed neale with shining eyes  it will be terrible muttered the elder man gravely then as he got up and bade his young assistant good night the somberness had returned to his eyes and the weight to his shoulders he did not underestimate his responsibility nor the nature of his task and he felt the coming of nameless and unknown events beyond all divining  henney was neales next visitor the old engineer appeared elated but for the moment he apparently forgot everything else in his solicitude for the young mans welfare  presently after he had been reassured the smile came back to his face  the chief has promoted you he said  what exclaimed neale starting up  its a fact he just talked it over with baxter and me this last job of yours pleased him mightily and so you go up  go up to what queried neale eagerly  well thats why he consulted us i guess laughed henney you see we sort of had to make something to promote you to for the present  oh i see i was wondering what job there could be replied neale and he laughed too what did the chief say  he said a lot figured youd land at the top if the u p is ever built chief engineer superintendent of maintenance of way  good lord breathed neale youre not in earnest  wal i shore am as your cowboy pard says returned henney and then he spoke with real earnestness listen neale heres the matter in a nutshell you will be called upon to run these particular and difficult surveys just as yesterday but no more of the routine for you added to that you will be sent forward and back inspecting figuring you can make your headquarters with us or in the construction camps as suits your convenience all this of course presently when we get farther on so you will be in a way freeyour own boss a good deal of the time and fitting yourself for that maintenance of way job in fact the chief said thathe called you maintenanceofway neale well i congratulate you and my advice is keep on as youve begungo straightlook out for your wildness and temper thats all good night  then he went out leaving neale speechless  neale had many callers that night and the last was larry red king the cowboy stooped to enter the tent  wal how aboot youall he drawled  not so good red replied neale my heads hot and ive got a lot of pain i think im going to be a little flighty would you mind getting your blankets and staying with me tonight  i reckon id be glad answered king he put a hand on neales face you shore have fever he left the tent to return presently with a roll of blankets and a canteen then he awkwardly began to bathe neales face with cold water there was a flickering campfire outside that threw shadows on the wall of the tent by its light neale saw that kings left hand was bandaged and that he used it clumsily  whats wrong with your hand he queried  i reckon nawthin  why is it bound up then  wal some one sent thet fool army doctor to me an he said i had two busted bones in it  he did i had no idea you were hurt you never said a word and you carried me and my instrument all daywith a broken hand  wal i aint so shore its broke  neale swore at his friend and then he fell asleep king watched beside him ever and anon rewetting the hot brow  the campfire died out and at length the quietness of late night set in the wind mourned and lulled by intervals a horse thudded his hoofs now and then there were the soft steady footsteps of the sentry on guard and the wild cry of a night bird     5  neale had not been wrong when he told the engineers that once they had a line surveyed across the gorge and faced the steep slopes of the other side their troubles would be magnified  they found themselves deeper in the wyoming hills a range of mountains that had given general lodge great difficulty upon former exploring trips and over which a pass had not yet been discovered  the old st vrain and laramie trail wound along the base of these slopes and through the valleys but that trail was not possible for a railroad a pass must be founda pass that would give a grade of ninety feet to the mile these mountains had short slopes and they were high  it turned out that the line as already surveyed through ravines and across the gorge had to be abandoned the line would have to go over the hills to that end the camp was moved east again to the first slopes of the wyoming hills from there the engineers began to climb they reached the base of the mountains where they appeared to be halted for good and all  the second line so far as it went overlooked the laramie trail which fact was proof that the old trailfinders had as keen eyes as engineers  with a large band of hostile sioux watching their movements the engineer corps found it necessary to have the troops close at hand all the time the surveyors climbed the ridges while the soldiers kept them in sight from below day after day this futile search for a pass went on many of the ridges promised well only to end in impassable cliffs or breaks or ascents too steep there were many slopes and they all looked alike it took hard riding and hard climbing the chief and his staff were in despair must their great project fail because of a few miles of steep ascent they would not give up  the vicinity of cheyenne pass seemed to offer encouragement camp was made in the valley on a creek from here observations were taken one morning the chief with his subordinates and a scout ascended the creek and then through the pass to the summit again the old st vrain and laramie trail lay in sight and again the troops rode along it with the engineers above  the chief with his men rode on and up farther than usual farther than they ought to have gone unattended once the scout halted and gazed intently across the valley  smoke signals over thar he said  the engineers looked long but none of them saw any smoke they moved on but the scout called them back  thet bunch of redskins has split on us fust thing well run into some of them  it was neales hawk eye that first sighted indians look look he cried in great excitement as he pointed with shaking finger  down a grassy slope of a ridge indians were riding evidently to head off the engineers to get between them and the troops  wal were in fer it now declared the scout we cant get back the way we come up  the chief gazed coolly at the indians and then at the long ridge sloping away from the summit he had been in tight places before  ride was his order  lets fight cried neale  the band of eight men were well armed and well mounted and if imperative could have held off the sioux for a time but general lodge and the scout headed across a little valley and up a higher ridge from which they expected to sight the troops they rode hard and climbed fast but it took a quarter of an hour to gain the ridgetop sure enough the troops were in sight but far away and the sioux were cutting across to get in front  it was a time for quick judgment the scout said they could not ride down over the ridge and the chief decided they must follow along it the going got to be hard and rough one by one the men dismounted to lead their horses neale who rode a mettlesome bay could scarcely keep up  take mine called larry king as he turned to neale  red ill handle this stupid beast or  wal you aint handlin him interrupted king hosses is my job you know  red took the bridle from neale and in one moment the balky horse recognized a master arm  by heaven weve got to hurry called neale  it did seem that the indians would head them off neale and king labored over the rocky ground as best they could and by dint of hard effort came up with their party the indians were quartering the other ridge riding as if on level ground the going grew rougher baxters horse slipped and lamed his right fore leg henneys saddle turned and more valuable time was lost all the men drew their rifles at every dip of ground they expected to come to a break that would make a stand inevitable  from one point on the ridge they had a good view of the troops  signal ordered the chief  they yelled and shot and waved hats and scarfs no usethe soldiers kept moving on at a snail pace far below  ondown the ridge was the order  wal general thet looks bad to me objected the scout red king shoved his lean brown hand between them there was a flame in his flashing blue glance as it swept the slowly descending ridge  judgin the lay of land is my job he said in his cool way well git down heah or not at all  neale was sore lame and angry as well he kept gazing across at the sioux lets stopand fight he panted we canwhipthat bunch  we may have to fight but not yet replied the chief come on  they scrambled on over rocky places up and down steep banks here and there were stretches where it was possible to ride and over these they made better time the indians fell out of sight under the side of the ridge and this fact was disquieting for no one could tell how soon they would show up again or in what quarter this spurred the men to sterner efforts  meanwhile the sun was setting and the predicament of the engineers grew more serious a shout from neale who held up the rear warned all that the indians had scaled the ridge behind them and now were in straightaway pursuit thereupon general lodge ordered his men to face about with rifles ready this move checked the sioux they halted out of range  theyre waitin fer dark to set in said the scout  come on well get away yet said the chief grimly they went on and darkness began to fall about them this increased both the difficulty and the danger on the other hand it enabled them to try and signal the troops with fire one of them would hurry ahead and build a fire while the others held back to check the indians if they appeared and at length their signals were answered by the troops thus encouraged the little band of desperate men plunged on down the slope and just when night set in blackthe fateful hour that would have precipitated the indian attackthe troops met the engineers on the slope the indians faded away into the gloom without firing a shot there was a general rejoicing neale however complained that he would rather have fought them  wal i shore was achin fer trouble drawled his faithful ally king  the flagman casey removed his black pipe to remark all thet cloimb without a foight  general lodges first word to colonel dillon was evidently inspired by caseys remark  colonel did you have steep work getting up to us  yes indeed straight up out of the valley was the rejoinder  but general lodge did not go back to camp by this short cut down the valley he kept along the ridge and it led for miles slowly down to the plain there in the starlight he faced his assistants with singular fire and earnestness  men weve had a bad scare and a hard jaunt but weve found our pass over the wyoming hills tomorrow well run a line up that long ridge well name it sherman pass thanks to those red devils  on the following morning neale was awakened from a heavy dreamless sleep by a hard dig in the ribs  nealeair you daid larry was saying wake up an listen to thet  neale heard the clear ringing notes of a buglecall he rolled out of his blankets whats up red he cried reaching for his boots  wal i reckon them injuns drawled red  it was just daylight they found the camp astirtroopers running for horses saddles guns  red you get our horses and ill see whats up cried neale  the cowboy strode off hitching at his belt neale ran forward into camp he encountered lieutenant leslie whom he knew well and who told him a scout had come in with news of a threatened raid colonel dillon had ordered out a detachment of troopers  im going shouted neale wheres that scout  neale soon descried a buckskinclad figure and he made toward it the man evidently a trapper or hunter carried a long brown rifle and he had a powderhorn and bulletpouch slung over his shoulder there was a knife in his belt neale went directly up to the man  my names neale he said can i be of any help  he encountered a pair of penetrating gray eyes  my names slingerland replied the other as he offered his hand are you an officer  no im a surveyor but i can ride and shoot ive a cowboy with mea texan hell go whats happened  wal i aint sure yet but i fear the wust i got wind of some sioux thet was trailin some prairieschooners up in the hills i warned the bosstold him to break camp an run then i come fer the troops but the troops had changed camp an i jest found them reckon well be too late  was it a caravan inquired neale intensely interested  six wagons only a few men two wimmen an one girl  girl exclaimed neale  yes i reckon she was about sixteen a pretty girl with big soft eyes i offered to take her up behind me on my hoss an they all wanted her to come but she wouldnt i hate to think  slingerland did not finish his thought aloud just then larry rode up leading neales horse slingerland eyed the lithe cowboy  howdy drawled larry he did not seem curious or eager and his cool easy reckless air was in sharp contrast to neales fiery daring  red you got the rifles i see said neale  sure an i rustled some biscuits  in a few moments the troops were mounted and ready slingerland led them up the valley at a rapid trot and soon started to climb when he reached the top he worked up for a mile and then crossing over went down into another valley up and down he led over ridge after ridge until a point was reached where the st vrain and laramie trail could be seen in the valley below from there he led them along the top of the ridge and just as the sun rose over the hills he pointed down to a spot where the caravan had been encamped they descended into this valley there in the trail were fresh tracks of unshod horses  we aint fur behind but i reckon fur enough to be too late said slingerland and he clenched a big fist  on this level trail he led at a gallop with the troops behind in the clattering roar they made short work of that valley then rougher ground hindered speedy advance  presently slingerland sighted something that made him start it proved to be the charred skeleton of a prairieschooner the oxen were nowhere to be seen  then they saw that a little beyond blankets and camp utensils littered the trail still farther on the broad wheeltracks sheered off the road where the hurried drivers had missed the way in the dark this was open undulating ground rockstrewn and overgrown with brush a ledge of rock a few scraggy trees and more black charred remains of wagons marked the final scene of the massacre    neale was the first man who dismounted and larry king was the second they had outstripped the more cautious troopers  my gawd breathed larry  neale gripped his rifle with fierce hands and strode forward between two of the burned wagons naked mutilated bodies bloody and ghastly lay in horrible positions all had been scalped  slingerland rode up with the troops and all dismounted cursing and muttering  colonel dillon ordered a search for anything to identify the dead there was nothing all had been burned or taken away of the camp implements mostly destroyed there were two shovels left one with a burnt handle these were used by the troopers to dig graves  neale had at first been sickened by the ghastly spectacle he walked aside a little way and sat down upon a rock his face was wet with clammy sweat a gnawing rage seemed to affect him in the pit of the stomach this was his first experience with the fiendish work of the savages a whirl of thoughts filled his mind  suddenly he fancied he heard a low moan he started violently well im hearing things he muttered soberly  it made him so nervous that he got up and walked back to where the troopers were digging he saw the body of a woman being lowered into a grave and the sight reminded him of what slingerland had said he saw the scout searching around and he went over to him  have you found the girl he asked  not yet i reckon the devils made off with her theyd take her if she happened to be alive  god i hope shes dead  wal son so does al slingerland  more searching failed to find the body of the girl she was given up as lost  ill find out if she was took captive said slingerland this sioux band has been friendly with me  man theyre on the warpath rejoined dillon  wal ive traded with them same sioux when they was on the warpath this massacre sure is awful an the sioux will hev to be extarminated but they hev their wrongs an injuns is injuns  slabs of rock were laid upon the graves then the troopers rode away  neale and slingerland and larry king were the last to mount and it was at this moment that neale either remembered the strange low moan or heard it again he reined in his horse  im going back he called  what fer slingerland rejoined  larry king wheeled his mount and trotted back to neale  red im not satisfied said neale and told his friend what he thought he had heard  boy youre oot of yur haid expostulated red  maybe i am but im going back are you coming  shore replied red with his easy good nature  slingerland sat his horse and watched while he waited the dustcloud that marked the troops drew farther away  neale dismounted threw his bridle and looked searchingly around but larry always more comfortable on horseback than on land kept his saddle suddenly neale felt inexplicably drawn in a certain directiontoward a rocky ledge still he heard nothing except the wind in the few scraggy trees all the ground in and around the scene of the massacre had been gone over there was no need to examine it again neale had nothing tangible upon which to base his strange feeling yet absurd or not he refused to admit it was fancy or emotion some voice had called him he swore it if he did not make sure he would always be haunted so with clear deliberate eyes he surveyed the scene then he strode for the ledge of rock  tufts of sage grew close at its base he advanced among them the surface of the rock was unevenand low down a crack showed at that instant a slow sobbing gasping intake of breath electrified neale  redcome here he yelled in a voice that made the cowboy jump  neale dropped to his knees and parted the tufts of sage lower down the crack opened up on the ground just inside that crack he saw the gleam of a mass of chestnut hair his first flashing thought was that here was a scalp the red devils did not get  then red king was kneeling beside himbending forward its a girl he ejaculated  yesthe one slingerland told me aboutthe girl with big eyes replied neale he put a hand softly on her head it was warm her hair felt silky and the touch sent a quiver over him probably she was dying  slingerland came riding up wal boys what hev you found he asked curiously  that girl replied neale  the reply brought slingerland sliding out of his saddle  neale hesitated a moment then reaching into the aperture he got his hands under the girls arms and carefully drew her out upon the grass she lay face down her hair a tumbled mass her body inert neales quick eye searched for bloodstains but found none  i remember thet hair said slingerland turn her over  i reckon well see then where shes hurt muttered red king  evidently neale thought the same for he was plainly afraid to place her on her back  slingerland shes not such a little girl he said irrelevantly then he slipped his hands under her arms again suddenly he felt something wet and warm and sticky he pulled a hand out it was bloodstained  aw exclaimed red  son whatd you expect demanded slingerland she got shot or cut an in her fright she crawled in thar come over with her lets see she might live  this practical suggestion acted quickly upon neale he turned the girl over so that her head lay upon his knees the face thus exposed was deathly pale set like stone in horror the front of her dress was a bloody mass and her hands were red  stabbed in the breast exclaimed king  no replied slingerland if shed been stabbed shed been scalped too mebbe thet blood comes from an arrow an she might hev pulled it out  neale bent over her with swift scrutiny no cut or hole in her dress  boys thar aint no marks on heronly thet blood added slingerland hopefully  neale tore open the front of her blouse and slipped his hand in upon her breast it felt round soft warm under his touch but quiet he shook his head  those moans i heard must have been her last dying breaths he said  mebbe but she shore doesnt look daid to me replied king ive seen daid people put your hand on her heart  neale had been feeling for heart pulsations on her right side he shifted his hand instantly through the soft swell of her breast throbbed a beatbeatbeat the beatings were regular and not at all faint  good lord what a fool i am he cried shes alive her hearts going theres not a wound on her  wal we cant see any thets sure replied slingerland  she might hev a fatal hurt all the same suggested king  no exclaimed neale that bloods from some one elsemost likely her murdered mother red run for some water fetch it in your hat slingerland ride after the troops  slingerland rose and mounted his horse wal ive an idee lets take the girl to my cabin thets not fur from hyar its a long ride to the camp an if she needs the troop doctor we can fetch him to my place  but the sioux  wal shed be safer with me the injuns an me are friends  all right good but you ride after the troops anyhow and tell dillon about the girlthat were going to your cabin slingerland galloped away after the dust cloud down the trail  neale gazed strangely down at the face of the girl he had rescued her lips barely parted to make again the low moan so that was what had called to him nonot all there was something more than this feeble cry that had brought him back to search there had been some strong and nameless and inexplicable impulse neale believed in his impulsesin those strange ones which came to him at intervals so far in his life girls had been rather negative influences but this girl or the fact that he had saved her or both impressions together struck deep into him life would never again be quite the same to warren neale  red king came striding back with a sombrero full of water  take your scarf and wash that blood off her hands before she comes to and sees it said neale  the cowboy was awkward at the task but infinitely gentle poor kid ill bet shes alone in the world now  neale wet his scarf and bathed the girls face if shes only fainted she ought to be reviving now but im afraid  then suddenly her eyes opened they were large violethued covered with a kind of veil or film as though sleep had not wholly gone and they were unseeingly staringly set with horror her breast heaved with a sharply drawn breath her hands groped and felt for something to hold her body trembled suddenly she sat up she was not weak her motions were violent the dazed horrorstricken eyes roved around but did not fasten upon anything  aw gone crazy muttered king pityingly  it did seem so she put her hands to her ears as if to shut out a horrible sound and she screamed neale grasped her shoulders turned her round and forced her into such a position that her gaze must meet his  youre safe he cried sharply the indians have gone im a white man  it seemed as though his piercing voice stirred her reason she stared at him her face changed her lips parted and her hand shaking like a leaf covered them clutched at them the other hand waved before her as if to brush aside some haunting terror  neale held that gaze with all his powerdominant masterful masculine he repeated what he had said  then it became a wonderful and terrible sight to watch her to divine in some little way the dark and awful state of her mind the lines the tenseness the shade the age faded out of her face the deepset frown smoothed itself out of her brow and it became young neale saw those staring eyes fix upon his he realized a dull opaque blackness of horror hideous veils let down over the windows of a soul images of hell limned forever on a mind then that film that unseeing cold thing like the shade of sleep or of death passed from her eyes now they suddenly were alive great darkviolet gulfs full of shadows dilating changing into exquisite and beautiful lights  im a white man he said tensely youre saved the indians are gone  she understood him she realized the meaning of his words then with a low agonized and broken cry she shut her eyes tight and reached blindly out with both hands she screamed aloud shock claimed her again horror and fear convulsed her and it must have been fear that was uppermost she clutched neale with fingers of steel in a grip he could not have loosened without breaking her bones  red you sawshe was right in her mind for a momentyou saw burst out neale  shore i saw shes only scared now replied king it must hev been hell fer her  at this juncture slingerland came riding up to them did she come around he inquired curiously gazing at the girl as she clung to neale  yes for a moment replied neale  wal thets good i caught up with dillon told him he was mighty glad we found her cussed his troopers some said hed explain your absence an we could send over fer anythin  lets go then said neale he tried to loosen the girls hold on him but had to give it up taking her in his arms he rose and went toward his horse king had to help him mount with his burden neale did not imagine he would ever forget that spot but he took another long look to fix the scene indelibly on his memory the charred wagons the graves the rocks over which the naked gashed bodies had been flung the three scraggy trees close together and the ledge with the dark aperture at the basehe gazed at them all and then turned his horse to follow slingerland     6  some ten miles from the scene of the massacre and perhaps fifteen from the line surveyed by the engineers slingerland lived in a wild valley in the heart of the wyoming hills  the ride there was laborsome and it took time but neale scarcely noted either fact he paid enough attention to the trail to fix landmarks and turnings in his mind so that he would remember how to find the way there again he was however mostly intent upon the girl he was carrying  twice that he knew of her eyes opened during the ride but it was to see nothing and only to grip him tighter if that were possible neale began to imagine that he had been too hopeful her body was a dead weight and cold those two glimpses he had of her opened eyes hurt him what should he do when she did come to herself she would be frantic with horror and grief and he would be helpless in a case like hers it might have been better if she had been killed  the last mile to slingerlands lay through a beautiful green valley with steep sides almost like a canontrees everywhere and a swift clear brook running over a bed of smooth rock the trail led along this brook up to where the valley boxed and the water boiled out of a great spring in a green glade overhung by bushy banks and gray rocks above a rude cabin with a redstone chimney and claychinked cracks between the logs stuffed to bursting with furs and pelts and horns and traps marked the home of the trapper  wal were hyar sung out slingerland and in the cheery tones there was something which told that the place was indeed home to him  shore is a likelylookin camp drawled red throwing his bridle been heah a long time thet cabin  me an my pard was the first white men in these hyar hills replied slingerland hes gone now then he turned to neale son you must be tired thet was a ways to carry a girl nigh onto dead look how white hand her down to me  the girls hands slipped nervelessly and limply from their hold upon neale slingerland laid her on the grass in a shady spot the three men gazed down upon her all sober earnest doubtful  i reckon we cant do nothin but wait said the trapper  red king shook his head as if the problem were beyond him  neale did not voice his thought yet he wanted to be the first person her eyes should rest upon when she did return to consciousness  wal ill set to work an clean out a place fer her said slingerland  well help rejoined neale red you have a look at the horses  ill slip the saddles an bridles replied king an let em go hosses couldnt be chased out of heah  slingerlands cabin consisted really of two adjoining cabins with a door between one part being larger and of later construction evidently he used the older building as a storeroom for his pelts when all these had been removed the room was seen to be small with two windows a table and a few other crude articles of homemade furniture the men cleaned this room and laid down a carpet of deer hides fur side up a bed was made of a huge roll of buffalo skins flattened and shaped and covered with indian blankets when all this had been accomplished the trapper removed his fur cap scratched his grizzled head and appealed to neale and king  i reckon you can fetch over some comfortablelike necessariesfixins fer a girl he suggested  red king laughed in his cool easy droll way shore well rustle fer a lookinglass an hairbrush an such as girls hev to hev our camp is full of them things  but neale did not see any humor in slingerlands perplexity or in the cowboys facetiousness it was the girls serious condition that worried him not her future comfort  run out thar called slingerland sharply  neale who was the nearest to the door bolted outside to see the girl sitting up her hair disheveled her manner wild in the extreme at sight of him she gave a start sudden and violent and uttered a sharp cry when neale reached her it was to find her shaking all over terrible fear had never been more vividly shown yet neale believed she saw in him a white man a friend but the fear in her was still stronger than reason  who are you she asked  my names nealewarren neale he replied sitting down beside her he took one of the shaking hands in his he was glad that she talked rationally  where am i  this is the home of a trapper i brought you here it was the bestin fact the only place  you saved mefromfrom those devils she queried hoarsely and again the cold and horrible shade veiled her eyes  yesyesbut dont think of themtheyre gone replied neale hastily the look of her distressed and frightened him he did not know what to say  the girl fell back with a poignant cry and covered her eyes as if to shut out a hateful and appalling sight mymother she moaned and shuddered with agony theymurderedher oh the terrible yells i sawkilledevery manmrs jones my mothershe fellshe never spoke her blood was on me i crawled awayi hid the indiansthey torehackedscalpedburned i couldnt diei saw ohohoh then she fell to moaning in inarticulate fashion  slingerland and king came out and looked down at the girl  wal the lifes strong in her said the trapper i reckon i know when life is strong in any critter shell git over thet all we can do now is to watch her an keep her from doin herself harm take her in an lay her down  for two days and nights neale watched over her except for the hours she slept when he divided his vigil with king she had periods of consciousness in which she knew neale but most of the time she raved or tossed or moaned or lay like one dead on the third day however neale felt encouraged she awoke weak and somber but quiet and rational neale talked earnestly to her in as sensible a way as he knew how speaking briefly of the tragic fate that had been hers bidding her force it out of her mind by taking interest in her new surroundings she listened to him but did not seem impressed it was a difficult matter to get her to eat she did not want to move at length neale told her that he must go back to the camp of the engineers where he had work to do he promised that he would return to see her soon and often she did not speak or raise her eyes when he left her  outside when red brought up the horses slingerland said to neale see hyar son i reckon you neednt worry shell come around all right  shore she will corroborated the cowboy timell cure her im from texas whar sudden death is plentiful in all families  neale shook his head im not so sure he said that girls more sensitively and delicately organized than you fellows see i doubt if shell ever recover from the shock itll take a mighty great influence but lets hope for the best now slingerland take care of her as best you can shut her in when you leave camp ill ride over as often as possible if she gets so she will talk then we can find out if she has any relatives and if so ill take her to them if not ill do whatever else i can for her  wal son i like the way youre makin yourself responsible fer thet kid replied the trapper i never had no wife nor daughter but im thinkinwouldnt it jest be hell to be a girltender an young an like neale saidan sudden hev all you loved butchered before your eyes  it shore would said red feelingly an thets what she sees all the time  slingerland do we run any chance of meeting indians queried neale  i reckon not them sioux will git fur away from hyar after thet massacre but you want to keep sharp eyes out an if you do meet any jest ride an shoot your way through youve the best horses ive seen whard you git them  they belong to king hes a cowboy  hosses was my job an we can shore ride away from any redskins replied king  wal good luck an come back soon was slingerlands last word  so they parted the cowboy led the way with the steady easy trotting walk that saved a horse yet covered distance in three hours they were hailed by a trooper outpost and soon they were in camp  shortly after their arrival the engineers returned tired dusty workstained and yet in unusually good spirits they had run the line up over sherman pass and now it seemed their difficulties were to lessen as the line began to descend from the summit of the divide neales absence had been noticed for his services were in demand but all the men rejoiced in his rescue of the little girl and were sympathetic and kind in their inquiries it seemed to neale that his chief looked searchingly at him as if somehow the short absence had made a change in him neale himself grew conscious of a strange difference in his inner nature he could not forget the girl her helplessness her pathetic plight  well its curious he soliloquized butits not so either im sorry for her  and he remembered the strange change in her eyes when he had watched the shadow of horror and death and blood fade away before the natural emotions of youth and life and hope  next day neale showed more than ever his value to the engineering corps and again won a word of quiet praise from his chief he liked the commendation of his superiors he began to believe heart and soul in the coming greatness of the railroad and that strenuous week drove his faithful lineman king to unwonted complaint  larry tugged at his boots and groaned as he finally pulled them off they were full of holes at which he gazed ruefully shore ill be done with this heah job when theyre gone he said  why do you work in highheeled boots inquired neale you cant walk or climb in them no wonder theyre full of holes  wal i couldnt wear no boots like yours declared red  youll have to another day will about finish them and your feet too  red eyed his boss with interest youall cussed me today because i was slow he complained  larry you always are slow except with a horse or gun and lately youve beenwell you dont move out of your tracks  neale often exaggerated out of a desire to tease his friend nobody else dared try and banter king  wal i didnt sign up with this heah outfit to run up hills all day replied red  ill tell you what ill get casey to be my lineman no ive a better idea casey is slow too ill use one of the niggers  red king gave a hitch to his belt and a cold gleam chased away the lazy blue warmth from his eyes go ahaid he drawled an theyll bury the nigger tomorrow night  neale laughed he knew red hated darkieshe suspected the texan had thrown a gun on more than a fewand he knew there surely would be a funeral in camp if he changed his lineman  all right red i dont want blood spilled he said cheerfully ill be a martyr and put up with you what do you say to a day off lets ride over to slingerlands  the cowboys red face slowly wrinkled into a smile wal i shore was wonderin what in the hell made you rustle so lately i reckon nothin would suit me better ive been wonderin too about our little girl  red lets wade through camp and see what we can get to take over  man you mean jest steal queried king in mild surprise  no well ask for things but if we cant get what we want that waywhy well have to do the other thing replied neale thoughtfully slingerland did not have even a towel over there think of that girl shes been used to comfort if not luxury i could tell lets see ive a mirror and an extra brush red come on  eagerly they went over their scant belongings generously appropriating whatever might be made of possible use to an unfortunate girl in a wild and barren country then they fared forth into the camp every one in the corps contributed something the chief studied neales heated face and a smile momentarily changed his stern featuresa wise smile a little sad and full of light  i suppose youll marry her he said  neale blushed like a girl itthat hadnt occurred to me sir he stammered  lodge laughed but his glance was kind sure youll marry her he said you saved her life and boy youll be a big man of the u p some day chief engineer or superintendent of maintenance of way or some other big job what could be finer romance boy the little waif of the caravanyoull send her back to omaha to school shell grow into a beautiful woman shell have a host of admirers but youll be the king of the lotsure  neale got out of the tent with tingling ears he was used to the badinage of the men and had always retaliated with a sharp and ready tongue but this halfkind halfhumorous talk encroached upon what he felt to be the secret side of his naturethe romantic and the dreamful sideto which such fancies were unconscionably dear  early the next morning neale and king rode out on the way to slingerlands  the sun was warm when they reached the valley through which ran the stream that led up to the cabin spring was in the air the leaves of cottonwood and willow added their fresh emerald to the darker green of the pine bluebells showed in the grass along the trail there grew lavender and yellow flowers unfamiliar to neale trout rose and splashed on the surface of the pools and the way was melodious with the humming of bees and the singing of birds  slingerland saw them coming and strode out to meet them with hearty greeting  is she all right queried neale abruptly  no she aint replied slingerland shaking his shaggy head she wont eat or move or talk shes wastin away she jest sits or lays with that awful look in her eyes  cant you make her talk  wal shell say no to most anythin there was three times she asked when you was comin back then she quit askin i reckon shes forgot you but shes never forgot thet bloody massacre its there in her eyes  neale dismounted and untying the pack from his saddle he laid it down removed saddle and bridle then he turned the horse loose he did this automatically while his mind was busy  where is she he asked  over thar under the pines whar the brook spills out of the spring thets the only place shell walk to i believe she likes to listen to the water an shes always afraid  ive fetched a pack of things for her said neale come on red  shore you go alone replied the cowboy hanging back girls is not my job  so neale approached alone the spot was green fragrant shady bright with flowers musical with murmuring water presently he spied hera drooping forlorn little figure the instant he saw her he felt glad and sad at once she started quickly at his step and turned he remembered the eyes but hardly the face it had grown thinner and whiter than the one he had in mind  my lord shes going to die breathed neale what can i dowhat can i say to her  he walked directly but slowly up to her aware of her staring eyes and confused by them  hello little girl ive brought you some things he said and tried to speak cheerfully  ohisit you she said brokenly  yes its neale i hope youve not forgotten me  there came a fleeting change over her but not in her face he thought because not a muscle moved and the white stayed white it must have been in her eyes though he could not certainly tell he bent over to untie the pack  ive brought you a lot of things he said hope youll find them useful here  she did not look at the open pack or pay any attention to him the drooping posture had been resumed together with the somber staring at the brook neale watched her in despair and watching he divined that only the most infinite patience and magnetism and power could bring her out of her brooding long enough to give nature a chance he recognized how unequal he was to the task but the impossible or the unattainable had always roused neales spirit defeat angered him this girl was alive she was not hurt physically he believed she could be made to forget that tragic night of blood and death he set his teeth and swore he would display the tact of a woman the patience of a saint the skill of a physician the love of a fatheranything to hold back this girl from the grave into which she was fading reaching out he touched her  can you understand me he asked  yes she murmured her voice was thin far away an evident effort  i saved your life  i wish you had let me die her reply was quick with feeling and it thrilled neale because it was a proof that he could stimulate or aggravate her mind  but i did save you now you owe me something  what  why gratitudeenough to want to live to try to help yourself  nono she whispered and relapsed into the somber apathy  neale could scarcely elicit another word from her then by way of change he held out different articles he had broughtscarfs a shawl a mirrorand made her look at them her own face in the mirror did not interest her he tried to appeal to a girls vanity she had none  your hair is all tangled he said bringing forth comb and brush here smooth it out  nonono she moaned  all right ill do it for you he countered surprised at finding her passive when he had expected resistance he began to comb out the tangled tresses in his earnestness he did not perceive how singular his action might seem to an onlooker she had a mass of hair that quickly began to smooth out and brighten under his hand he became absorbed in his task and failed to see the approach of larry king  the cowboy was utterly amazed and presently he grinned his delight evidently the girl was all right and no longer to be feared  wal shore thets fine he drawled neale i always knowed you was a ladys man and larry sat down beside them  the girls face was half hidden under the mass of hair and her head was lowered neale gave larry a warning glance meant to convey that he was not to be funny  this is my cowboy friend larry red king said neale he was with me when ii found you  larryredking murmured the girl my name isallie  again neale had penetrated into her closelocked mind what she said astounded him so that he dropped the brush and stared at larry and larry lost his grin he caught a glimpse of her face and his own grew troubled  alliei shoream glad to meet you he said and there was more feeling in his voice than neale had ever before heard larry was not slow of comprehension he began to talk in his drawling way neale heard him with a smile he tried to hide but he liked larry the better for his simplicity this gunthrowing cowboy had a big heart  larry however did not linger for long his attempts to get the girl to talk grew weaker and ended then after another glance at the tragic wan face he got up and thoughtfully slouched away  so your name is allie said neale well allie what  she did not respond to one out of a hundred questions and this query found no lodgment in her mind  will you braid your hair now he asked  the answer was the low and monotonous negative but nevertheless her hands sought her hair and parted it and began to braid it mechanically this encouraged neale more than anything else it showed him that there were habits of mind into which he could turn her finally he got her to walk along the brook and also to eat and drink  at the end of that day he was more exhausted than he would have been after a hard climb yet he was encouraged to think that he could get some kind of passive unconscious obedience from her  reckon youd better stay over tomorrow suggested slingerland his concern for the girl could not have been greater had she been his own daughter alliethet was her name you said wal its pretty an easy to say  next day allie showed an almost imperceptible improvement it might have been neales imagination leading him to believe that there were really grounds for hope the trapper and the cowboy could not get any response from her but there was certain proof that he could the conviction moved him to deep emotion  an hour before sunset neale decided to depart and told larry to get the horses then he went to allie undecided what to say feeling that he must have tortured her this day with his ceaseless importunities how small the chance that he might again awaken the springs of life interest yet the desire was strong within him to try  allie he repeated her name before she heard him then she looked up the depthsthe tragic lonesomenessof her eyeshaunted neale  im going back ill come again soon  she made a quick movementseized his arm he remembered the close tight grip of her hands  dont go she implored black fear stared out of her eyes  neale was thunderstruck at the suddenness of her speechat its intensity also he felt an unfamiliar kind of joy he began to explain that he must return to work that he would soon come to see her again but even as he talked she faded back into that dull and somber apathy  neale rode away with only one conviction gained from the developments of the two days it was that he would be restless and haunted until he could go to her again something big and movingsomething equal to his ambition for his work on the great railroadhad risen in him and would not be denied     7  neale rode to slingerlands cabin twice during the ensuing fortnight but did not note any improvement in allies condition or demeanor the trapper however assured neale that she was gradually gaining a little and taking some slight interest in things he said that if neale could only spend enough time there the girl might recover this made neale thoughtful  general lodge and his staff had decided to station several engineers in camp along the line of the railroad for the purpose of studying the drift of snow it was important that all information possible should be obtained during the next few winters there would be severe hardships attached to this work but neale volunteered to serve and the chief complimented him warmly he was to study the action of the snowdrift along sherman pass  upon his next visit to slingerland neale had the project soberly in mind and meant to broach it upon the first opportunity  this morning when neale and king rode up to the cabin allie did not appear as upon the last occasion of their arrival neale missed her  slingerland came out with his usual welcome  wheres allie asked neale  wal she went in jest now she saw you comin an then run in to hide i reckon girls is queer critters  she watched for mefor usand then ran queried neale curiously  wal she aint done nothin but watch fer you since you went away last an son thets a new wrinkle fer allie an run wal like a skeered deer  wonder what that means pondered neale whatever it meant it sent a little tingle of pleasure along his pulses red i want to have a serious talk with slingerland he announced thoughtfully  shore go ahaid an talk drawled the southerner as he slipped his saddle and turned his horse loose with a slap on the flank i reckon ill take a gun an stroll off fer a while  neale led the trapper aside to a shady spot under the pines and there unburdened himself of his plan for the winter  son youll freeze to death ejaculated the trapper  i must build a cabin of course and prepare for severe weather replied neale  slingerland shook his shaggy head i reckon you aint knowin these winters hyar as i know them but thet long ridge you call sherman passit aint so fur we couldnt get thar on snowshoes except in the wust weather i reckon you can stay with me hyar  good exclaimed neale and now about allie  wal what about her  shall i leave her here or send her back to omaha with the first caravan or let her go to fort fetterman with the troops  son shes your charge but i say leave her hyar specially now you can be with us shed die or go crazy if you sent her why she wont even say if shes got a livin relation i reckon she haint shed be better hyar ive come to be fond of allie shes strange shes like a spirit but shes more human lately  im glad you say that slingerland replied neale what to do about her had worried me ill decide right now ill leave her with you and i hope to heaven im doing best by her  wal she aint strong enough to travel fur we didnt think of thet  that settles it then said neale in relief time enough to decide when she is well again tell me about her  son thars nuthin to tell

all she ever thinks of an mostly of it  then itll be a fight between me and that memory  so i take it son but recollect i aint no minddoctor i jest feel you could make her fergit thet hell if you

bloody murder of all she loved to make her mind clear againwhy sooner or later shes agoin to breathe an live through you jest as a flower lives offen the sun thets all i reckon  neales bronze cheek had paled a little well if thats all thats easy he replied with a cool bright smile which showed the latent spirit in him if its only thatwhy she can have me slingerland ive no ties now the last one was broken when my mother diednot long ago im alone too id do as much for any innocent girlbut for this poor child alliewhose life i savedid do anything  slingerland shoved out a horny hand and made a giant grip express what evidently just then he could not express in speech  upon returning to the cabin they found allie had left her room from appearances neale concluded that she had made little use of the things he had brought her he was conscious of something akin to impatience he was not sure what he did feel the situation had subtly changed and grown all in that brief talk with slingerland neale slowly walked out toward the brook where he expected to find her it struck him suddenly that if she had watched for him all week and had run when he came then she must have wanted to see him but was afraid or shy or perverse how like any girl possibly in the week past she had unconsciously grown a little away from her grief  ill try something new on you allie he muttered and the boy in him that would never grow into a man meant to be serious even in his fun  allie sat in the shady place under the low pine where the brook spilled out of the big spring she drooped and appeared oblivious to her surroundings a stray gleam of sunlight touching her hair made it shine bright neales quick eye took note of the fact that she had washed the bloodstain from the front of her dress he was glad what hope had there been for her so long as she sat hour after hour with her hands pressed to that great black stain on her dressthat mark where her mothers head had rested neale experienced a renewal of hope he began to whistle and drawing his knife he went into the brush to cut a fishingpole the trout in this brook had long tempted his fishermans eye and upon this visit he had brought a line and hooks he made a lot of noise all for allies benefit then tramping out of the brush he began to trim the rod within twenty feet of where she sat he whistled he even hummed a song while he was rigging up the tackle then it became necessary to hunt for some kind of bait and he went about this with pleasure both because he liked the search and because out of the corner of his eye he saw that allie was watching him therefore he redoubled his efforts at pretending to be oblivious of her presence and at keeping her continually aware of his he found crickets worms and grubs under the dead pine logs and with this fine variety of bait he approached the brook  the first cast neale made fetched a lusty trout and right there his pretensions of indifference vanished together with his awareness of allies proximity neale loved to fish he had not yet indulged his favorite pastime in the west he saw trout jumping everywhere it was a beautiful little stream rocky swift here and eddying there clear as crystal murmurous with tiny falls and bordered by a freshness of green and gold there were birds singing in the trees but over all seemed to hang the quiet of the lonely hills neale forgot allieforgot that he had meant to discover if she could be susceptible to a little neglect the brook was full of trout voracious and tame they had never been angled for he caught three in short order  when his last bait a large and luscious grub struck the water there was a swirl a splash a tug neale excitedly realized that he had hooked a father of the waters it leaped that savage leap the splash the amazing size of the fish inflamed in neale the old boyish desire to capture and forgetting what little skill he possessed he gave a mighty pull the rod bent double out with a vicious splash lunged the huge glistening trout to dangle heavily for an instant in the air neale thought he heard a cry behind him he was sitting down in awkward posture but he lifted and swung the line snapped the fish dropped in the grass and began to thresh frantically neale leaped to prevent the escape of the hugest trout he had ever seen there was a dark flasha commotion before him then he stood staring in bewilderment at allie who held the wriggling trout by the gills  you dont know how to fish she exclaimed with great severity  i dont eh ejaculated neale blankly  you should play a big trout you lifted him right out he broke your line hed havegottenawaybut for me  she ended panting a little from her exertion and quick speech a red spot showed in each white cheek her eyes were resolute and flashing it dawned upon neale that he had never before seen a tinge of color in her face nor any of the ordinary feelings of life glancing in her eyes now she seemed actually pretty he had made a discoveryperhaps he had now another means to distract her from herself then the squirming trout drew his attention and he took it from her  what a whopper oh say allie isnt he a beauty i could hugiyou bet im thankful you were quick he certainly is slippery  allie dropped to her knees and wiped her hands on the grass while neale killed the fish and strung it upon a willow with the others he had caught then turning to allie he started to tell her how glad he was to see her again to ask her if she were glad to see him but upon looking at her he decided to try and keep her mind from herself she was different now and he liked the difference he feared he might frighten it away  will you help me get more bait he asked  allie nodded and got up then neale noticed her feet were bare poor child she had no shoes and he did not know how to procure any suitable footwear in that wilderness  have you ever fished for trout he asked as he began to dig under a rotting log  yes in california she replied with sudden shadowing of her eyes  lets go down the brook said neale hastily fearful that he had been tactless there are some fine holes below  she walked beside him careful of the sharp stones that showed here and there presently they came to a likelylooking pool  if you hook another big one dont try to pull him right out admonished allie  neale could scarcely conceal his delight and in his effort to appear natural made a poor showing at this pool losing two fish and scaring others so they would not rise  allie wont you try he asked offering the rod  id rather look on you like it so much  how do you know that he asked more to hear her talk than from curiosity  you grow so excited she said  thankfully he accepted the realization that after all these weeks of silence it was possible to make her speak but he must exercise extreme caution one wrong word might send her back into that apathythat senseless voiceless trance  in every pool where neale cast he caught or lost a trout he was enjoying himself tremendously and at the same time feeling a warmth in his heart that was not entirely due to the exhilaration of fishing below the head of the valley where the stream began and the cabin nestled the ground was open like a meadow with grass and flowers growing to the edge of the water there were deep swirling pools running under the banks and in these neale hooked fish he could not handle with his poor tackle and they broke away but he did not care there was a brightness a beauty a fragrance along the stream that seemed to enhance the farther down he went presently they came to a place where the water rushed over a rocky bed and here neale wanted to cross he started to wade curious and eager to see what allie would do  i cant wade that she called  neale returned to her side ill carry you he said you hold the rod well leave the fish here then he lifted her in his arms how light she washow much lighter than upon that first occasion of his carrying her he slipped in the middle of the brook and nearly fell with her allie squealed the sound filled neale with glee after all and whatever she had gone through she was feminineshe was a girlshe was squeamish thereupon he slipped purposely and made a heroic effort to save himself she clasped his neck convulsively with her free arm and as he recovered his balance her head bumped into his and her hair got into his eyes he laughed this was great fun but it could scarcely have been the exertion that made his heart beat out of time at last he gained the opposite bank  you nearly fell with me she said  well id have got wet too he replied wondering if it were possible to make her laugh or even smile if he could do that today even in the smallest degree he would be assured that happiness might come back to her  soon they met larry who came stooping along burdened with a deer carcass on his shoulder relieving himself he hailed them  how air youall he drawled addressing himself mostly to allie  whats your name she asked  allie hes my friend and partner replied neale larry king but i call him redfor obvious reasons  wal miss allie i reckon no tall kick would be acomin if you was to call me red drawled larry or betterreddy no other lady ever had thet honor  allie looked at him steadily as if this was the first time she had seen him but she did not reply and larry easily disconcerted gathered up his burden and turned toward camp  wal im shore wishin youall good luck he called significantly  neale shot a quick glance at allie to see if the cowboys goodhumored double meaning had occurred to her but apparently she had not heard she seemed to be tiring her lips were parted and she panted  are you tired shall we go back he asked  noi like it she returned slowly as if the thought were strange to her  they fished on and presently came to a wide shallow place with smooth rock bottom where the trail crossed neale waded across alone and he judged that the water in the middle might come up to allies knees  come on he called  allie hesitated she gathered up her faded skirt slowly waded in and halted uncertain of her footing she was not afraid neale decided and neither did she seem aware that her slender shapely legs gleamed white against the dark water  wont you come and carry me she asked  indeed i wont replied neale carry a big girl like you  she took him seriously and moved a little farther my feet slip so she said  it became fascinating to watch her the fun of itthe pleasure of seeing a girl wade a brook innocently immodest suddenly ceased for neale there was something else he had only meant to tease he was going to carry her he started back and then he halted there was a strange earnestness in allies facea deliberateness in her intent out of all proportion to the exigency of the moment it was as if she must cross that brook but she kept halting come on neale called and she moved again every time this happened she seemed to be compelled to go on when she got into the swift water nearly to her knees then she might well have faltered yet she did not falter all at once neale discovered that she was weak she did not have the strength to come on it was that which made her slip and halt what then made her try so bravely how strange that she tried at all stranger than all was her peculiar attitude toward the taskearnest sober grave forced  neale was suddenly seized with surprise and remorse that which actuated this girl allie was merely the sound of his voicethe answer to his demand he plunged in and reached her just as she was slipping he carried her back to the side from which she had started it cost him an effort not to hold her close whatever she wasorphan or waif left alone in the world by a murdering band of siouxan unfortunate girl to be cared for succored pitiednone of these considerations accounted for the change that his power over her had wrought in him  youre not strong he said as he put her down  was that it she asked with just a touch of wonder i used to wadeanywhere  he spoke little on the way back up the brook for he hesitated to tell her that he must return to his camp so as to be ready for important work on the morrow and not until they were almost at the cabin did he make up his mind she received the intelligence in silence and upon reaching the cabin she went to her room  neale helped larry and slingerland with the task of preparing a meal that all looked forward to having allie share with them however when slingerland called her there was no response  neale found her sunk in the old hopeless staring brooding mood he tried patience at first and gentleness but without avail she would not come with him the meal was eaten without her later neale almost compelled her to take a little food he felt discouraged again time had flown all too swiftly and there was larry coming with the horses and sunset not far off it might be weeks even months before he would see her again  allie are you ever going to cheer up he demanded  nono she sighed  he put his hand under her chin and forcing her face up studied it earnestly strained white bloodless thin with drooping lips and tragic eyes it was not a beautiful not even a pretty face but it might have been onevery easily the veiled mournful eyes did not evade his indeed they appeared to stare deeply hopelessly yearningly if he could only say and do the right thing to kill that melancholia she needed to be made to live suddenly he had the impulse to kiss her that no doubt was owing to the proximity of her lips but he must not kiss her she might care for him some dayit was natural to imagine she would but she did not care now and that made kisses impossible  you just wont cheer up he went on  nono  but you were so different out there by the brook  she made no reply the veil grew darker more shadowy over her eyes neale divined a deadness in her  im going away he said sharply  yes  do you care he went on with greater intensity  she only stared at him  you must care he exclaimed  why she asked dully  why becausebecause he stammered angry with himself after all why should she care  i wishyoudleft meto die she moaned  oh allie allie began neale in distress then he caught the different quality in her voice it carried feeling she was thinking again he swore that he would overcome this malady of hers and he grew keen subtle on fire with his resolve he watched her he put his hands on her shoulders and pulled her gently she slid off the pile of buffalo robes to her knees before him then she showed the only hint of shyness he had ever noted in her perhaps it was fear at any rate she half averted her face so that her loosened hair hid it  allie allie listen have you nothing to live for he asked  no  why yes you have  what  why ithe thing isallieyou have me he said a little hoarsely then he laughed how strange his laugh sounded he would always remember that rude room of logs and furs and the kneeling girl in the dim light  you  yes me he replied with a ring in his voice never before had she put wonder in a word he had struck the right chord at last now it seemed that he held a live creature under his hands as if the deadness and the dread apathy had gone away forever with the utterance of that one syllable this was a big moment if only he could make up to her for what she had lost he felt his throat swell and speech was difficult  allie do you understand me now youhave somethingto live for do you hear  when his ear caught the faint yes he suddenly grew glad and strong with what he felt to be a victory over her gloom and despair  listen im going to my work he began swiftly ill be gone weeksmaybe more but ill come back early in the fall ill be with you all winter im to work here on the pass thenthenwell ill be a big man on the u p some day chief engineer or superintendent of maintenance of way youre all alonemaybe youll care for me some day ill work hard its a great ideathis railroad when its doneand ive my big jobwill youyoull marry me then  neale heard her gasp and felt her quiver he let go of her and stood up for fear he might suddenly take her in his arms his words had been shock enough he felt remorse anxiety tenderness and yet he was glad some delicate and fine consciousness in him told him he had not done wrong even if he had been dominating she was alone in the world he had saved her life his heart beat quick and heavy  goodby allie ill come back never forget  she stayed motionless on her knees with the mass of hair hiding her face and she neither spoke nor made a sign  neale went out the air seemed to wave in his face cool and relieving larry was there with the horses slingerland stood by with troubled eyes both men stared at neale he was aware of that and conscious of his agitation and suddenly as always at a climax of emotion he swiftly changed and grew cool  red old pard congratulate me im engaged to marry allie he said with a low laugh that had pride in it  wal damn me ejaculated larry king then he shot out the hand that was so quick with rope and gun put her thar shore if you hadnt made up to her id have an neale if you say pard im yours till im daid  pard replied neale as he met the outstretched hand  slingerlands hard and wrinkled face softened  strange how we all cottoned to thet girl noi reckon it aint so strange wal its as it oughter be you saved her may you both be happy son  neale slipped a ring from his little finger  give allie this tell her its my pledge ill come back to her and she must think of that     8  that summer the engineers crossed the wyoming hills and ran the line on into utah where they met the surveying party working in from the pacific  the initial step of the great construction work was done the engineers with hardship and loss of life had proved that a railroad across the rockies was a possibility only they had little conception of the titanic labor involved in the building  for neale the months were hard swift full it came to him that love of the open and the wild was incorporated in his ambition for achievement he wondered if he would have felt the one without the other camp life and the daily climbing over the ridges made of him a lithe strong surefooted mountaineer they made even the horseriding cowboy a good climber though nothing neale averred would ever straighten larrys bow legs  only two incidents or accidents marred the work and pleasure of those fruitful weeks  the first happened in camp there was a surly stakedriver by the name of shurd who was lazy and otherwise offensive among hardworking men having been severely handled by neale he had nursed a grievance and only waited for an opportunity for revenge neale was quicktempered and prone to sharp language and action when irritated or angered shurd passing through the camp either drunk or unusually surly had kicked neales instrument out of his way some one saw him do it and told neale thereupon neale in high dudgeon had sought out the fellow larry king always neales shadow came slouching after with his cowboys gait they found shurd at the camp of the teamsters and other laborers neale did not waste many words he struck shurd a blow that staggered him and would have followed it up with more had not the man suddenly furious plunged away to pick up a heavy stake with which he made at neale to brain him  neale could not escape he yelled at shurd trying to intimidate him  then came a shot from behind it broke shurds arm the stake fell and the man began to bawl curses  get out of heah called larry king advancing slowly the maddened shurd tried to use the broken arm perhaps to draw on king thereupon the cowboy with gun low and apparently not aiming shot again this time almost tearing shurds arm off then he prodded shurd with the cocked gun the man turned ghastly he seemed just now to have realized the nature of this gaunt flamingeyed cowboy  shore your mind aint workin said larry get out of heah mozey over to thet camp doctor or youll never need one  shurd backed away livid and shaking and presently he ran  red expostulated neale youyou shot him all up you nearly killed him  why in hell dont you pack a gun drawled larry  red youreyourei dont know what to call you id have licked him club and all  mebbe replied the cowboy as he sheathed the big gun neale im used to what you aint shore i can see death acomin wal every day the outfit grows wilder a little whisky ll burn hell loose along this heah up line  larry strode on in the direction shurd had taken neale pondered a moment perplexed and grateful to his comrade he heard remarks among the laborers and he saw the flagman casey remove his black pipe from his lipsan unusual occurrence  mac it wus thot redhead cowboy wot onct pinted his gun at me burst out casey  did yez see him shoot replied mac with round eyes niver aimed an yit he hit  mike shane the third of the trio of irish laborers in neales corps was a little runt of a sandyhaired wizened man and he spoke up begorra hes wan of thim texas jacks hed loike to kill yez pat casey an if he ever throwed thot cannon at yez why runnin d be slow to phwat yez d do  i niver run in me loife declared casey doggedly  neale went his way it was noted that from that day he always carried a gun preferably a rifle when it was possible in the use of the long gun he was an adept but when it came to larrys kind of a gun neale needed practice larry could draw his gun and shoot twice before neale could get his hand on his weapon  it was through neales habit of carrying the rifle out on his surveying trips that the second incident came about  one day in early summer neale was waiting near a spring for larry to arrive with the horses on this occasion the cowboy was long in coming neale fell asleep in the shade of some bushes and was awakened by the thud of hoofs he sat up to see larry in the act of kneeling at the brook to drink at the same instant a dark moving object above larry attracted neales quick eye it was an indian sneaking along with a gun ready to level quick as a flash neale raised his own weapon and fired the indian fell and lay still  larrys drink was rudely disturbed by plunging horses when he had quieted them he turned to neale  so youall was heah shore you scared me whatd you shoot at  neale stared and pointed his hand shook he felt cold sick hard yet he held the rifle ready to fire again larry dropped the bridles and pulling his gun he climbed the bank with unusual quickness for him neale saw him stand over the indian  wal plumb center he called with a new note in his usually indolent voice come heah  no shouted neale violently is he dead  daid wal i should smile an mebbe he aint alone  the cowboy ran down to his horse and neale followed suit they rode up on the ridge to reconnoiter but saw no moving objects  i reckon thet redskin was shore agoin to plug me drawled larry as they trotted homeward  he certainly was replied neale with a shudder  larry reached a long hand to neales shoulder he owed his life to his friend but he did not speak of that instead he glanced wisely at neale and laughed  kinda weak in the middle eh he said i felt thet way once pard if you ever get riled youll be shore bad  for neale shooting at an indian was strikingly different from boyish dreams of doing it he had acted so swiftly that it seemed it must have been instinctive yet thinking back slowly realizing the nature of the repellent feeling within him he remembered a bursting gush of hot blood a pantherish desire to leap to strikeand then cool stern watchfulness the whole business had been most unpleasant  upon arriving at camp they reported the incident and they learned indians had showed up at various points along the line troopers had been fired upon orders were once more given that all work must be carried on under the protection of the soldiers so that an ambush would be unlikely meanwhile a detachment of troops would be sent out to drive back the band of sioux  these two hard experiences made actuality out of what neales chief had told him would be a mans game in a wild time this work on the u p was not play or romance but the future unknown called alluringly to him in his moments of leisure by the campfire at night he reflected and dreamed and wondered and these reflections always turned finally to memory of allie  the girl he had saved seemed far away in mind as well as in distance he tried to call up her faceto see it in the ruddy embers but he could visualize only her eyes they were unforgettablethe somber haunting shadows of thoughts of death yet he remembered that once or twice they had changed had become wonderful with promise of exceeding beauty  it seemed incredible that he had pledged himself but he had no regrets time had not made any difference only it had shown him that his pity and tenderness were not love still there had been another emotion connected with alliea strange thing too subtle and brief for him to analyze when away from her he lost it could that have been love he thought of the day she waded the brook the feel of her as he carried her in his arms and of that last sight of her on her knees in the cabin her face hidden her slender form still as a statue his own heart was touched yet this was not love it was enough for neale to feel that he had done what he would have applauded in another man that he seemed the better for his pledge that the next meeting with allie was one he looked forward to with a strange new interest  september came and half sped by before neale with larry and an engineer named service arrived at the head of sherman pass with packburros and supplies ready to begin the long vigil of watching the snow drift over the line in winter  they were to divide the pass between them service to range the upper half and neale the lower as there were but few trees up in that locality and these necessary for a large supply of firewood they decided not to attempt building a cabin for service but to dig a dugout this was a hole hollowed out in a hillside and covered with a roof of branches and earth  no small job indeed was it to build a satisfactory dugoutone that was not conspicuous from every ridge for indian eyes to spy outand warm and dry and safe they started several before they completed one  itll be lonesomer for youand colder observed neale  i wont mind that replied the other  well see each other before the snow flies surely  not unless you come up im no climber ive got a bad leg  ill come then we may have weeks of fine weather yet im going to hunt some  good luck to you  so these comrades parted they were only two of the intrepid engineers selected to brave the perils and hardships of that wild region in winter to serve the great cause  the golds and purples of autumn mingled with the predominating green of slingerlands valley in one place beaver had damned the stream forming a small lake and here cranes and other aquatic birds had congregated neale saw beaver at work and deer on the hillside  its been three months he soliloquized as he paused at the ford which allie had so bravely and weakly tried to cross at his bidding three months so much can have happened but slingerland is safe from indians i hopei believe ill find her well  he was a prey to dread and yet he did not hurry larry driving the packtrain drew on ahead and passed out of sight in a green bend of the brook at length neale saw a column of blue smoke curling up above the trees and that sight relieved him if the trapper was there the girl would be with him  at this moment his horse shot up his long ears and snorted  a gray form glided out of the green and began to run down the trail toward hima lithe swift girl in buckskin  an indian girl ejaculated neale  but her face was white her hair tawny and flying in the wind could that be allie it must be she it was  lord im in for it muttered neale dismounting and he gazed with eager eyes she was approaching quickly  neale youve come she cried and ran straight upon him  he hardly recognized her face or her voice but what she said proclaimed her to be allie she enveloped him her arms strong convulsive clasped him up came her face white gleaming joyous strange to neale but he knew somehow that it was held up to be kissed dazedly he kissed herfelt cool sweet lips touch his lips again and then again  allie ii hardly knew you was his greeting now he was holding her and he felt her press her head closely to his breast felt the intensity of what must have been her need of physical contact to make sure he was here in the flesh and as he held her looking down upon her he recognized the little head and the dull gold and ripple of chestnut hair yesit was allie but this new allie was tallerup to his shoulderand lithe and fullbosomed and strong this was not the frail girl he had left  i thoughtyoudnever never come she murmured clinging to him  it waspretty long he replied unsteadily but ive come and im very glad to see you  you didnt know me she said shyly you lookedit  well no wonder i left a thin pale little girl all eyesand what do i find let me look at you  she drew back and stood before him shy and modest but without a trace of embarrassment surely the sweetest and loveliest girl he had ever beheld some remembered trace he found in her features perhaps the look the shape of her eyesall else was unfamiliar and that all else was a white face blueveined with rich blood slowly mantling to the broad brow with sweet red lips haunting in their sadness with glorious eyes like violets drenched in dew shadowy exquisite mournful and deep yet radiant with beautiful light  neale recognized her beauty at the instant he realized her love and he was so utterly astounded at the one and overwhelmed with the other that he was mute a powerful reaction took place within him so strong that it helped to free him from the other emotions he found his tongue and controlled his glance  i took you for an indian girl in all this buckskin he said  dress leggings moccasins i made them all myself she replied sweeping a swift hand from fringe to beads not a single button oh it was hardso much work but theyre more comfortable than any clothes i ever had  so youve not beenaltogether idle since i left  since that day and she blushed exquisitely at the words ive been doing everything under the sun except that grieving which you dislikedeverythingcooking sewing fishing bathing climbing riding shootingand watching for you  that accounts he replied musingly  for what  youryour improvement you seem happyand well  do you mean the activity accounts for thator my watching for you she queried archly she was quick bright roguish neale had no idea what qualities she might have possessed before that fateful massacre but she was bewilderingly different from the sickminded girl he had tried so hard to interest and draw out of her gloom he was so amazed so delighted with her and so confused with his own peculiar state of mind that he could not be natural then his mood shifted and a little heat at his own stupidity aroused his wits  allie i want to realize whats happened he said lets sit down here we sat here once before if you remember slingerland can wait to see me  neales horse grazed along the green border of the brook the water ran with low swift rush there were bees humming round the autumn flowers and a fragrance of woodsmoke wafted down from the camp over all lay the dreaming quietness of the season and the wild  allie sat down upon the rock but neale changing his mind stood beside her still he did not trust himself to face her he was unsettled uncertain all this was like a dream  so you watched for me he asked gently  for hours and days and weeks she sighed  then youcaredcared a little for me  she kept silence and he wanting intensely to look up did not  tell me he insisted with a hint of the old dominance he remembered again the scene at the crossing of the brook could he control this wonderful girl now  of course she replied  buthow do you care he added more forcibly he felt ashamed yet he could not resist it what was happening to him  ii love you her voice was low almost faltering rich with sweetness and full of some unutterable emotion  neale sustained a shock he never could have told how that affected him except in his sudden fury at himself then he stole a glance at her her eyes were downcast hidden under long lashes her face was soft and sweet dreaming and spiritual singularly pure her breast heaved under the beaded buckskin neale divined she had never dreamed of owing him anything except the maiden love which quivered on her tremulous lips and hovered in the exquisite light of her countenance and now he received a great and impelling change in his spirit an uplift a splendid and beautiful consciousness of his good fortune but what could he say to her if only he could safely pass over this moment so he could have time to think to find himself another glance at her encouraged him she expected nothingnot a word she took all for granted she was lost in dreams of her soul  he looked down again to see her handsmall shapely strong and brown and upon the third finger he espied his ring he had forgotten to look to see if she wore it then softly he touched it and drew her hand in his  my ring oh allie he whispered  the response was a wonderful purple blaze of her eyes he divined then that his ring had been the tangible thing upon which she had reconstructed her broken life  you rode awayso quicklyi had no chance totell she replied haltingly and lowvoiced all was sweet shame about her now and he had to fight himself to keep from gathering her to his breast verily this meeting between allie and him was not what he had anticipated  he kissed her hand  youve all the fall and all the winter to tell me such sweet things he said perhaps tomorrow ill find my tongue and tell you something  tell me now she said quickly  well youre beautiful he replied with strong feeling  really she smiled and that smile was the first he had ever seen upon her face it brought out the sadness the very soul of her great beauty i used to be pretty she went on naively but if i remember how i used to look im not pretty any more  neale laughed he had begun to feel freer and to accept this unparalleled situation with some composure  tell me he said with gentle voice and touchtell me your name alliewhat  didnt you ever know she asked  you said allie that was all  he feared this call to her memory yet he wanted to put her to a test her eyes dilatedthe light shaded they grew sad dark humid gulfs of thought but the old somber veil the insane brooding stare did not return  allie what he repeated  then the tears came softening and dimming the pain allie lee she said     9  slingerland appeared younger to neale the burden of loneliness did not weigh upon him and the habit of silence had been broken neale guessed why and was actually jealous  wal its beyond my calculatin the trapper said out by the spring where neale followed him she jest changed thets all not so much at first though she sparked up after i give her your ring i reckon it come little by little an one day why the cabin was full of sunshine since then ive seen how shes growed an brightened workin runnin after mean always watchin fer you allies changed to what she is now onct fur back i recollect she said she had you to live fer mebbe thets the secret anyhow she loves you as i never seen any man loved an son i reckon you oughter be somewhars near the kingdom of heaven  neale stole oil by himself and walked in the twilight the air was warm and sultry full of fragrance and the low chirp of crickets within his breast was a full uneasy sensation of imminent catastrophe something was rising in himgreatterribleprecious it bewildered him to try to think of himself of his strange emotions when his mind seemed to hold only allie  what then had happened after a long absence up in the mountains he had returned to slingerlands valley home and to the little girl he had rescued and left there he had left her frail sickminded silent somber a pale victim to a horrible memory he had found her an amazing contrast to what she had been in the past she had grown strong active swift she was as lovely as a wild rose no dream of his idle fancy but a fact then laststirring him even as he tried to clarify and arrange this magic this mysteryhad come the unbelievable the momentous and dazzling assurance that she loved him it was so plain that it seemed unreal while near her he saw it yet could not believe his eyes he felt it but doubted his sensibilities but now away from the distraction of her presence and with slingerlands eloquent words ringing in his ears he realized the truth love of him had saved the girls mind and had made her beautiful and wonderful he had heard of the infinite transforming power of love here in allie lee was its manifestation whether or not he deserved such a blessing was not the question it was his and he felt unutterably grateful and swore he would be worthy of this great gift  darkness had set in when neale returned to the cabin the interior of which was lighted by blazing sticks in a huge stone fireplace  slingerland was in the shadow busy as usual but laughing at some sally of larrys the cowboy and allie however were in plain sight neale needed only one look at larry to divine what had come over that young man allie appeared perplexed  he objects to my calling him mr king and even larry she said  larry suddenly looked sheepish  allie this cowboy is a bad fellow with guns ropes horsesand i suspect with girls replied neale severely  neale he doesnt look bad she rejoined youre fooling me he wants me to call him reddy  ahuh grunted neale he laughed grimly at himself for again he had felt a pang of jealousy he knew what to expect from larry or any other young man who ever had the wonderful good luck to get near allie lee all right call him reddy he went on i guess i can allow my future wife so much familiarity with my pard  this confused allie out of her sweet gravity and she blushed  shore youre mighty kind drawled larry recovering more n i reckoned on from a fellar whos shore lost his haid  ive lost more n that retorted neale and im afraid a certain wild young cowboy i know has lost as much  wal i reckon somethin abbot this heah place of slingerlands draws on a fellar admitted larry resignedly  allie did not long stay embarrassed by their sallies  neale tell me  see heah allie if you call me reddy an him only nealewhy hes agoin to pitch into me interrupted larry with twinkling eyes an hes shore a bad customer when hes riled  only neale what does he mean inquired allie  beyond human conjecture replied neale laughing  wal dont you know his front name asked larry  neale i call him that she replied  haw haw but it aint thet  allie my name is warren said neale youve forgotten  oh well its always been nealeand always will be  larry rose and stretched his long arms for the pipe on the rude stone chimney  slingerland he drawled these heah young people need to find out who they are an i reckon wed do wal to go out an smoke an talk  the trapper came forth from the shadows and as he filled his pipe his keen bright gaze shifted from the task to his friends  its good to see you an hyar you he said i was a youngster once i missedbut thets no matter live while you may larry come with me ive got a trap to set yit  allie flashed a glance at them  its not so you never set traps after dark  wal child any excuse is better n none neale wouldnt never git to hyar you say all thet sweet talk as is comin to himif two old fools hung round  slingerland ive throwed a gun for less n thet drawled larry aboot the fool part i aint shore but i was twentyfive yesterdayan im sixteen today  they lit their pipes with red embers scraped from the fire and with wise nods at neale and allie passed out into the dark  allies eyes were upon neale with shy eloquent intent and directly the others had departed she changed her seat to one close to neale she nestled against his shoulder her face to the fire  they thought we wanted to make love didnt they she said dreamily  i guess they did replied neale  he was intensely fascinated did she want him to make love to her a look at her face was enough to rebuke him for the thought the shadows from the flickering fire played over her  tell me all about yourself she said then about your work  neale told all that he thought would interest her about his youth in the east with a widowed mother the home that was broken up after she died and his working his way through a course of civil engineering  i was twenty when i first read about this u p railroad project he went on that was more than three years ago it decided me on my career i determined to be an engineer and be in the building of the road no one had any faith in the railroad i used to be laughed at but i stuck andwell i had to steal some rides to get as far west as omaha  that was more than a year ago i stayed therewaiting nothing was sure except that the town grew like a mushroom it filled with soldiersand the worst crowd i ever saw you can bet i was shaky when i finally got an audience with general lodge and his staff they had an office in a big storehouse the place was full of mensoldiers and tramps it struck me right off what a grim and discouraged bunch those engineers looked i didnt understand them but i do now well i asked for a job nobody appeared to hear me it was hard to make yourself heard i tried againlouder an old engineer whom i know nowhenneywaved me aside just as if a job was unheard of  neale quickened and warmed as he progressed aware now of a little hand tight in his of an interest that would have made any storytelling a pleasure  well i felt sick then mad when i get mad i do things i yelled at that bunch here you men ive walked and stole rides to get here im a surveyor youre going to build a railroad i want a job and im going to get it  my voice quieted the hubbub the old engineer henney looked queerly at me  young man theres not going to be any railroad  then i blurted out that there was going to be a railroad some one spoke up who said that fetch him here pretty soon i was looking at majorgeneral lodge he was just from the war and he looked it stern and dark with hard lines and keen eyes he glanced me over  there is going to be a railroad he questioned sharply  of course there is i replied i felt foolish disappointed  youre right he said and ill never forget his eyes  i can use a few more young fellows like you and thats how i got on the staff  well we ran a quick survey west to the bad landsfor it was out here that we must find success or failure and allie its all been like the biggest kind of an adventure the troops and horses and camps and trailsthe indian country with its threats from out of the airthe wild places with their deer buffalo panthers trappers like slingerland scouts and desperadoes it began to get such a hold on me that i was wild that might have been bad for me but for my work i did well allie i ran lines for the u p that no other engineer could run  neale paused as much from the squeeze allie suddenly gave him as for an instants rest to catch his breath  i mean i had the nerve to tackle cliffs and dangerous slopes he went on then he told how larry red king had saved his life and that recollection brought back his service to the cowboy then naturally followed the two dominating incidents of the summer  allie lifted a blanched face and darkening eyes neale you were in danger  oh not much i guess but red thought so  he saved you again iill never forget that  anyway were square for hed have got shot sure the day the indian sneaked up on him allie shuddered and shrank back to neale while he hastily resumed his story were great pards now red and i he doesnt say much but his acts tell he will not let me alone he follows me everywhere its a joke among the men well allie it seems unbelievable that we have crossed the mountains and the desertgrade ninety feet to the mile the railroad can and will be built i wish i could tell you how tremendously all this has worked upon meupon all the engineers but somehow i cant it chokes me the idea is big but the workwhat shall i call that allie if you can imagine some spirit seizing hold of you and making you see difficulties as joysimpossible tasks as only things to strike fire from genius perils of death as merely incidents of daring adventure to treasure in memorywell thats something like it the idea of the u p has got me i believe in it i shall see it accomplished ill live it all  allie moved her head on his shoulder and looking up at him with eyes that made him ashamed of his egotism she said then when its done youll be chief of engineers or superintendent of maintenance of way  she had remembered his very words  allie i hope so he replied thrilling at her faith ill workill get some big position    next day ushered in for neale a wellearned rest and he proceeded to enjoy it to the full  the fall had always been neales favorite season here as elsewhere the aspect of it was flaming and golden but different from what he had known hitherto dreaming silence of autumn held the wildness and loneliness of the wyoming hills the sage shone gray and purple the ridges yellow and gold the valleys were green and amber and red no dust no heat no winda clear blue cloudless sky sweet odors in the still airit was a beautiful time  days passed and nights passed as if on wings every waking hour drew him closer to this incomparable girl who had arisen upon his horizon like a star he knew the hour was imminent when he must read his heart he fought it off he played with his bliss allie was now his shadow instead of the faithful larry although the cowboy was often with them adapting himself to the changed conditions too big and splendid to be envious or jealous they fished down the brook and always at the nevertobeforgotten ford he would cross first and turn to see her follow she could never understand why neale would delight in carrying her across at other points yet made her ford this one by herself  its such a bother to take off moccasins and leggings she would say  they rode horseback up and down the trails that slingerland assured them were safe and it was the cowboy larry who lent his horse and taught her a flying mount he said she would make a rider  in the afternoons they would climb the high ridge and on the summit sit in the long whitening grass and gaze out over the dim and purple vastness of the plains in the twilight they walked under the pines when night set in and the air grew cold they would watch the ruddy fire on the hearth and see pictures of the future there and feel a warmth on hand and cheek that was not all from the cheerful blaze  neale found it strange to realize how his attachment for larry had changed to love all neales spiritual being was undergoing a great and vital change but this was not the reason he loved larry it was because of allie the cowboy was a texan and he had inherited the southerners fine and chivalric regard for women neale never knew whether larry had ever had a sister or a sweetheart or a girl friend but at sight larry had become allies own not a brother or a friend or a lover but something bigger and higher the man expanded under her smiles her teasing her playfulness her affection neale had no pang in divining the love larry bore allie drifter cowboy gunthrower mankiller whatever he had been the light of this girls beautiful eyes her voice her touch had worked the last marvel in manforgetfulness of self and so neale loved him  it made neale quake inwardly to think of the change being wrought in himself it made him thoughtful of many things there was much in life utterly new to him he had listened to a moan in his keen ear he had felt a call of something helpless he had found a gleam of chestnut hair he had stirred two other men to help him befriend a poor brokenhearted halfcrazed orphan girl and lo the world had changed his friends had grown happier in their unloved lives a strange strength had come to him and sweetest most wonderful of all in the place of the helpless and miserable waif appeared a woman lovely of face and form with only a ghost of sadness haunting her eyes a woman adorable and bright with the magic of love on her lips  october came in the early morning and late afternoon a keen cold breath hung in the air slingerland talked of a good prospect for fur he chopped great stores of wood larry climbed the hills with his rifle neale walked the trails hand in hand with allie  he had never sought to induce her to speak of her past though at times the evidence of refinement and education and mystery around her made strong appeal to him she could tell her story whenever she liked or neverit did not greatly matter  thenone day quite naturally but with a shame she did not try to conceal she confided to him part of the story her mother had told her that dark night when the sioux were creeping upon the caravan  neale was astounded agitated intensely concerned  allie your father lives he exclaimed  yes  then i must find himtake you to him  do what you think best she replied sadly but i never saw him ive no love for him and he never knew i was born  is it possible how strange if any man could see you now allie do you resemble your mother  yes we were alike  where is your father neale went on curiously  how should i know it was in new orleans that mother ran off from him ii never blamed hersince she said what she said do you will thismake any difference to you  my god no but im soso thunderstruck this manthis duradetell me more of him  he was a spaniard of high degree an adventurer a gambler he was mad to gamble he forced my mother to use her beauty to lure men to his gamblinghell oh its terrible to remember she said he meant to use me for that purpose thats why she left him but in a way he was good to me i can see so many things now to prove he was wicked and mother said he would follow hertrack her to the end of the world  allie if he should find you some day exclaimed neale hoarsely  she put her arms up round his neck and that following a terrible pang of dread in neales breast was too much for him the tide burst love had long claimed him but its utterance had been withheld he had been happy in her happiness he had trained himself to spare her  but some dayill beyour wife she whispered  soon soon he returned trembling  the scarlet fired her temples her brow darkening the skin under her bright hair  thats for you to say  she held up her lips tremulous and sweet  neale realized the moment had come there had never been but the one kiss between themthat of the meeting upon his return in september  allie i love you he spoke thickly  and i love you she replied with sweet courage  this news youve toldthis man durade he went on hoarsely im suddenly alivestingingwild if i lost you  dear you will never lose menever in this world or any other she replied tenderly  my work my hope my life they all get spirit now from you allie youre sweetoh so sweet youre glorious he rang out passionately  surprise momentarily checked the rising response of her feeling  neale youve never before saidsuchthings and the way you look  how do i look he queried seeing the joyousness of her surprise  then she laughed and that was new to hima sound low unutterably rich and full sweettoned like a bell and all resonant of youth  oh you look like durade when he was gambling away his soul you should see him  well hows that  so whiteso terribleso piercing  neale drew her closer slipped her arms farther up round his neck im gambling my soul away now he said if i kiss you i lose itand i must  must what she whispered with all a womans charm  i must kiss you  then hurry  so their lips met  in the sweetness of that embrace in the simplicity and answering passion of her kiss in the overwhelming sense of her gift of herself heart and soul he found a strength a restraint a nobler fire that gave him peace  allie was to amaze neale again before the sun set on that memorable day  i forgot to tell you about the gold she exclaimed her face paling  gold ejaculated neale  yes he buried itthereunder the biggest of the three trees together near a rock oh i can see him now  him who allie whats this wild talk  she pressed his hand to enjoin silence  listen horn had gold how much i dont know but it must have been a great deal he owned the caravan with which we left california horn grew to like me but he hated all the rest that night we ended the awful ride the wagons stalled the grayness of dawnthe stillnessoh i feel them now that terrible indian yell rang out all my life ill hear it then horn dug a hole he buried his gold and he said whoever escaped could have it he had no hope  allie youre a mine of surprises buried gold what next  neale i wonderdid the sioux find that gold she asked  its not likely there certainly wasnt any hole left open around that place i saw every inch of ground under those trees allie ill go there tomorrow and hunt for it  let me go she implored ah i forgot nono there must be my mothers grave  yes its there i saw i will mark it allie how glad i am that you can speak of herof her pasther grave there without weakening you are brave but forget allie if i find that gold itll be yours  no yours  but i wasnt one of the caravan he did not give it to any outsider you escaped therefore it will belong to you  dearest i am yours  next day without acquainting slingerland or larry with his purpose neale rode down the valley trail  he expected the road to cross the old st vrain and laramie trail but if it did cross he could not find the place it was easy to lose bearings in these hills neale had to abandon the hunt for that day and turning back with some annoyance at his failure he decided that it would be best to take larry and slingerland into his confidence  allie was waiting for him at the brook ford  oh it was gone she cried  allie i couldnt find the place come ride back and let me walk beside you well have fun telling larry and slingerland  neale let me tell them she begged  go ahead make a strong story larry always had leanings toward goldstrikes  and that night after supper when the log fire had begun to blaze and all were comfortable before it allie glanced demurely at larry and said  reddy if you had known that i was heiress to great wealth would you have proposed to me  slingerland roared larry seemed utterly stricken  wealth he echoed feebly  yes gold lots of gold  slingerlands merry face suddenly grew curious and earnest  larry struggled with his discomfiture  i reckon id done thet anyhowwithout knowin you was richif it hadnt been fer this heah u p surveyor fellar  and then the joke was on allie as her blushes proved neale came to her rescue and told the story of horns buried gold and of his own search that day for the place  shore ill find it declared larry well go tomorrow  slingerland stroked his beard thoughtfully  if thars gold been buried thar its sure an certain thar yet he said but im afraid we wont git thar tomorrow  why not surely you or larry can find the place  listen  neale listened while he was watching allies parted lips and speaking eyes a low whining wind swept through the trees and over the roof of the cabin  thet wind says snow declared the trapper  neale went outside the wind struck him cold and keen with a sharp edge to it the stars showed pale and dim through hazy atmosphere assuredly there was a storm brewing neale returned to the fire shivering and holding his palms to the heat  cold you bet with the wind rising he said but slingerland suppose it does snow cant we go anyhow  it aint likely you see it snows up hyar mebbe well be snowed in fer a spell an thet valley is open down thar in deep snow what could we find well wait an see  on the morrow a storm raged and all was dim through a ghostly whirling pall the season of drifting snow had come and neales winter work had begun  five miles by short cut over the ridges curved the long survey over which neale must keep watch and the going and coming were neales hardest toil it was laborsome to trudge up and down in soft snow  that first snow of winter however did not last long except in the sheltered places fortunately for neale almost all of his section of the survey ran over open ground but this fact augured seriously for his task when the dry and powdery snow of midwinter began to fall and sweep before the wind and drift over the lee side of the ridge  during the first week of tramping he thoroughly learned the lay of the land the topography of his particular stretch of sherman pass and one day taking an early start from camp he set forth to make his first call upon his nearest associate in this work the engineer service once high up on the pass he found the snow had not all melted and still higher it lay white and unbroken as far as he could see the air was keener up there neale gathered that service would have a colder job than his own if it was not so long and hard  he found service at home in his dugout warm and comfortable and in excellent spirits they compared notes and even in this early work they decided it would be a wise plan for the engineering staff to study the problem of drifting snow  neale enjoyed a meal with service and then early in the afternoon he started back on his long tramp homeward he gathered from his visit that service did not mind the lonesomeness but that he did suffer from the cold more than he had expected service was not an active fullblooded man and neale had some misgivings judging from the trappers remarks winter high up in the wyoming hills was something to dread  november brought the real stormsthe gray banks of rolling cloud the rain and sleet and snow and ice and the wind neale concluded he had never before faced a real wind and when one day on a ridgetop he was blown off his feet he was sure of it some days he could not go out at all other days it was not imperative for it was only during and after snowstorms that he could make observations he learned to travel on snowshoes and ten miles of such traveling up and down the steep slopes was the most killing hard toil he had ever attempted after such trips he would reach the cabin utterly fagged out too tired to eat too weary to talk almost too dead to hear the solicitations of his friends or to appreciate allies tender anxious care if he had not been strong and robust and in good training to begin with he would have failed under the burden gradually he grew used to the strenuous toil and became hardened tough and enduring  though neale hated the cold and the wind there were moments when an exceedingly keen exhilaration uplifted him these experiences visited him while on the heights looking far over the snowy ridges to the white monotonous plain or up toward the shining peaks all seemed barren and cold he never saw a living creature or a track upon those slopes when the sun shone all was so dazzlingly glaringly white that his eyes were struck by temporary blindness  upon one of the milder days which were getting rarer in middecember neale again visited his comrade on the summit he found service in bad shape in falling down a slippery ledge he had injured or broken his lame leg neale with great concern tried to ascertain the nature and extent of the harm done but he was unable to do so service was practically helpless although not suffering any great pain the two of them decided at length that he had not broken any bones but that it was necessary to move him to where he could be waited upon and treated or else some one must be brought in to take care of him neale deliberated a moment  ill tell you what he said finally you can be moved down to slingerlands cabin without pain to you ill get slingerland and his sled youll be more comfortable there itll be better all around  so that was decided upon and neale after doing all he could for service and assuring him that he would return in less than twentyfour hours turned his steps for the valley  the sunset that night struck him as singularly dull pale menacing he understood its meaning later when slingerland said they were in for another storm before dark the wind began to moan through the trees like lost spirits the trapper shook his shaggy head ominously  reckon thet sounds bad to me he said and from moan it rose to wail and from wail to roar  that alarmed neale he went outside and slingerland followed snow was sweeping downlight dry powdery the wind was piercingly cold slingerland yelled something but neale could not distinguish what when they got back inside the trapper said  blizzard  neale grew distressed  wal no use to worry about service argued the trapper if it is a blizzard we cant git up thar thets all mebbe thisll not be so bad but i aint bettin on thet  even allie couldnt cheer neale that night long after she and the others had retired he kept up the fire and listened to the roar of the wind when the fire died down a little the cabin grew uncomfortably cold and this fact attested to a continually dropping temperature but he hoped against hope and finally sought his blankets  morning came but the cabin was almost as dark as by night a blinding swirling snowstorm obscured the sun  a blizzard raged for fortyeight hours when the snow finally ceased falling the cold increased until neale guessed the temperature might be forty degrees below zero the trapper claimed sixty it was necessary to stay indoors till the weather moderated  on the fifth morning slingerland was persuaded to attempt the trip to aid service larry wanted to accompany them but slingerland said he had better stay with allie so muffled up the two men set out on snowshoes dragging a sled a crust had frozen on the snow otherwise traveling would have been impossible once up on the slope the north wind hit them square in the face heavily clad as he was neale thought the very marrow in his bones would freeze that wind blew straight through him there were places where it took both men to hold the sled to keep it from getting away they were blown back one step for every two steps they made on the exposed heights they could not walk upright at last after hours of desperate effort they got over the ridge to a sheltered side along which they labored up to services dugout  up there the snow had blown away in places leaving bare spots bleak icy barren stark no smoke appeared to rise above the dugout the rude habitation looked as though no man had been there that winter neale glanced in swift dismay at slingerland  son look fer the wust he said an we haint got time to waste  they pushed open the canvas framework of a door and stooping low passed inside neales glance saw first the fireplace where no fire had burned for days snow had sifted into the dugout and lay in little drifts everywhere the blankets on the bunk covered service hiding his face both men knew before they uncovered him what his fate had been  frozen to death gasped neale  service lay white rigid like stone with no sign of suffering upon his face  he jest went to sleepan never woke up declared slingerland  thank god for that exclaimed neale oh why did i not stay with him  too late son an many a good man will go to his death before thet damn railroad is done  neale searched for services notes and letters and valuables which could be turned over to the engineering staff  slingerland found a pick and shovel which neale remembered to have used in building the dugout and with these the two men toiled at the frozen sand and gravel to open up a grave it was like digging in stone at length they succeeded then rolling service in the blankets and tarpaulin they lowered him into the cold ground and hurriedly filled up his grave  it was a grim gruesome task another nameless grave neale had already seen nine graves this one was up the slope not a hundred feet from the line of survey  slingerland exclaimed neale the railroad will run along there trains will pass this spot in years to come travelers will look out of the train windows along here boys riding away to seek their fortunes bride and groom on their honeymoon thousands of peoplegoing coming busy happy at their own affairs full of their own liveswill pass by poor services grave and never know its there  wal son if people must hev railroads they must kill men to build them replied the trapper  neale conceived the idea that slingerland did not welcome the coming of the steel rails the thought shocked him but then he reflected a trapper would not profit by the advance of civilization  with the wind in their backs neale and slingerland were practically blown home they made it up between them to keep knowledge of the tragedy from allie so ended the coldest and hardest and grimmest day neale had ever known  the winter passed the snows melted the winds quieted and spring came  long since neale had decided to leave allie with slingerland that summer she would be happy there and she wished to stay until neale could take her with him that seemed out of the question for the present a construction camp full of troopers and laborers was no place for allie neale dreaded the idea of taking her to omaha always in his mind were haunting fears of this spaniard durade who had ruined allies mother and of the father whom allie had never seen neale instinctively felt that these men were to crop up somewhere in his life and before they did appear he wanted to marry allie she was now little more than sixteen years old  neales plans for the summer could not be wholly known until he had reported to the general staff which might be at fort fetterman or north platte or all the way back in omaha but it was probable that he would be set to work with the advancing troops and trains and laborers engineers had to accompany both the grading gangs and the rail gangs  neale in his talks with larry and slingerland had dwelt long and conjecturingly upon what life was going to be in the construction camps  to larry what might happen was of little moment he lived in the present but neale was different he had to be anticipating events he lived in the future his mind was centered on future work achievement and what he might go through in attaining his end slingerland was his appreciative listener  wal he would say shaking his grizzled head i reckon i dont believe all your general lodge says is goin to happen  but man cant you imagine what it will be protested neale take thousands of soldiersthe riffraff of the warand thousands of laborers of all classes niggers greasers pigtail chinks and irish take thousands of men who want to earn an honest dollar but not honestly all the gamblers outlaws robbers murderers criminals adventurers in the states and perhaps many from abroad will be on the trail think man of the moneythe gold millions spilled out in these wilds and last and worstthe bad women  slingerland showed his amazement at the pictures drawn by neale especially at the final one  wal i reckon thets all guff too he said a lot of bad women out in these wilds aint to be feared supposin thar was a lot of them which aint likelyhowd they ever git out to the camps  slingerland the trainsthe trains will follow the laying of the rails  oho an you mean tharll be towns grow up overnightall full of bad people who aint workin on the railroad but jest followin the gold  exactly now listen remember all these mixed gangsthe goldand the bad womenout here in the wild countryno lawno restraintno fear except of deathdrinkinghellsgamblinghellsdancinghells whats going to happen  the trapper meditated a while stroking his beard and then he said wal thar aint enough gold to build thet railroadan if thar was it couldnt never be done  ah cried neale raising his head sharply its a matter of gold first streams of gold and thencan it be done  one day as the time for neales departure grew closer slingerlands quiet and peaceful valley was violated by a visit from four roughlooking men  they rode in without packs it was significant to neale that larry swore at sight of them and then in his cool easy way sauntered between them and the cabin door where allie stood with astonishment fixed on her beautiful face the texan always packed his heavy gun and certainly no western men would mistake his quality these visitors were civil enough asked for a little tobacco and showed no sign of evil intent  way off the beaten track up hyar said one  yes im a trapper replied slingerland whar do you hail from  ogden were packin east  much travel on the trail  right smart fer wild country an all goin east we haint met an outfit headin west hev you heerd any talk of a railroad buildin out of omaha  here larry put a word in  shore weve had soldiers campin around aboot all heah  soldiers ejaculated one of the gang  shore the roads bein built by soldiers  the men made no further comment and turned away without any goodbys slingerland called out to them to have an eye open for indians on the warpath  wal i dont like the looks of them fellars he declared  neale likewise took an unfavorable view of the visit but larry scouted the idea of there being any danger in a gang like that  shore theyd be afraid of a man he declared  red can you look at men and tell whether or not theres danger in them inquired neale  i shore can one man could bluff thet outfit but i reckon id hate to have them find allie aboot heah alone  i can take care of myself spoke up allie spiritedly  neale and slingerland for all their respect for the cowboys judgment regarded the advent of these visitors as a forerunner of an evil time for lonely trappers  ill hev to move back deeper in the mountains away from the railroad said slingerland  this incident also put a different light upon the intention neale had of hunting for the buried gold just now he certainly did not want to risk being seen digging gold or packing it away and slingerland was just as loath to have it concealed in or near his cabin  wal seein were not sure its really there lets wait till you come back in summer or fall he suggested if its thar itll stay thar  all too soon the dawn came for neales departure with larry allie was braver than he at the last he was white and shaken she kissed larry  reddy youll take care of yourselfand him she said  allie i shore will goodby larry rode down the trail in the dim gray dawn  watch sharp for indians she breathed and her face whitened momentarily then the color returned her eyes welled full of sweet soft light  allie i cant go said neale hoarsely the clasp of her arms unnerved him  you must its your work remember the big job dearest dearest hurryandgo  neale could no longer see her face clearly he did not know what he was saying  youll alwayslove me he implored  do you need to ask all my life i promise  kiss me then he whispered hoarsely blindly leaning down its hellto leave you wonderful girltreasurepreciousallie kiss meenough i  she held him with strong and passionate clasp and kissed him again and again  goodby her last word was low choked poignant and had in it a mournful reminder of her old tragic woe  then he was alone mounting clumsily with blurred eyes he rode into the winding trail     10  neale and king traveled light without packanimals and at sunrise they reached the main trail  it bore evidence of considerable use and was no longer a trail but a highroad fresh tracks of horses and oxen wagonwheel ruts dead campfires and scattered brush that had been used for windbreaksall these things attested to the growing impetus of that movement soon it was to become extraordinary  all this was indian country neale and his companion had no idea whether or not the sioux had left their winter quarters for the warpath but it was a vast region and the indians could not be everywhere neale and king took chances as had all these travelers though perhaps the risk was not so great because they rode fleet horses they discovered no signs of indians and it appeared as if they were alone in a wilderness  they covered sixty miles from early dawn to dark with a short rest at noon and reached fort fetterman safely without incident or accident troops were there but none of the u p engineering staff neale did not meet any soldiers with whom he was acquainted orders were there for him however to report to north platte as soon as it was possible to reach there troops were to be moving soon so neale learned and the long journey could be made in comparative safety  here neale received the tidings that forty miles of railroad had been built during the last summer and trains had been run that distance west from omaha his heart swelled not for many a week had he heard anything favorable to the great u p project and here was news of rails laid trains run already this spring the graders were breaking ground far ahead of the raillayers report and rumor at the fort had it that lively times had attended the construction but the one absorbing topic was the sioux indians who were expected to swarm out of the hills that summer and give the troops hot work  in due time neale and larry arrived at north platte which was little more than a camp the construction gangs were not expected to reach there until late in the fall baxter was at north platte with a lame surveyor and no other helpers consequently he hailed neale and larry with open arms a summers work on the hot monotonous plains stared neale in the face but he must resign himself to the inevitable he worked as always with that ability and energy which had made him invaluable to his superiors here however the labor was a dull hot grind without any thrills neale filled the long days with duty and seldom let his mindwander in leisure hours however he dreamed of allie and the future he found no trouble in passing time that way also he watched eagerly for arrivals from the west whom he questioned about indians in the wyoming hills and from troops or travelers coming from the east he heard all the news of the advancing railroad construction it was absorbingly interesting yet neale could credit so few of the tales  the summer and early fall passed  neale was ordered to omaha the news stunned him he had built all his hopes on another winter out in the wyoming hills and this disappointment was crushing it made him ill for a day he almost threw up his work it did not seem possible to live that interminable stretch without seeing allie lee the nature of his commission however brought once again to mind the opportunity that knocked at his door neale had run all the different surveys for bridges in the wyoming hills and now he was needed in the office of the staff where plans and drawings were being made again he bowed to the inevitable but he determined to demand in the spring that he be sent ahead to the forefront of the construction work  another disappointment seemed in order larry king refused to go any farther back east neale was exceedingly surprised  do you throw up your job he asked  shore not i can work heah replied larry  there wont be any outside work on these bleak plains in winter  wal i reckon ill loaf then he drawled  neale could not change him larry vowed he would take his old place with neale next spring if it should be open to him  but why red i cant figure you protested neale  pard i reckon im fur enough back east right heah said larry significantly  a light dawned upon neale red youve done something bad exclaimed neale in genuine dismay  wal i dont know jest how bad it was but it shore was hell replied larry with a grin  red you arent afraid asserted neale positively  the cowboy flushed and looked insulted if any one but you said thet to me hed hev to eat it  i beg your pardon old man but im surprised it doesnt seem like you and thenlord ill miss you  no more n ill miss you pard replied larry  suddenly neale had a happy thought red you go back to slingerlands and help take care of allie id feel she was safer  wal she might be safer but i wouldnt be declared the cowboy bluntly  you redhead what do you mean demanded neale  i mean this heah if i stayed around another winter near allie leewith her alone fer thet trapper never set up before thet fireidwhy neale id ambush you like an injun when you come back  you wouldnt rejoined neale he wanted to laugh but had no mirth  larry did not mean that but neither did he mean to be funny ill be hangin round heah waitin fer you its only a few months go on to your work pard youll be a big man on the road some day  neale left north platte with a wagontrain  after a long slow journey the point was reached where the graders had left off work for that year here had been a huge construction camp and the bare and squalid place looked as if it once had been a town of crudest make suddenly wrecked by a cyclone and burned by prairie fire fifty miles farther on representing two more long tedious and unendurable days and neale heard the whistle of a locomotive it came from far off but it was a whistle he yelled and the men journeying with him joined in  smoke showed on the horizon together with a wide low uneven line of shacks and tents  neale was all eyes when he rode into that construction camp the place was a bedlam a motley horde of men appeared to be doing everything under the sun but work and most of them seemed particularly eager to board a long train of boxcars and little old passengercoaches neale made a dive for the train and his sojourn in that camp was a short and exciting one of ten minutes  he felt unutterably proud he had helped survey the line along which the train was now rattling and creaking and swaying all that swiftly passed under his keen eyes was recorded in his memorythe uncouth crowd of laborers the hardest lot he had ever seen the talk noise smoke the rickety old clattering coaches the wayside dumps and heaps and wreckage but they all seemed parts of a beautiful romance to him neale saw through the eyes of golden ambition and illimitable dreams  and not for a moment of that endless ride with interminable stops did he weary of the two hundred and sixty miles of rails laid that year and of the forty miles of the preceding year then came omaha a beehivethe making of a western metropolis  neale plunged into the bewildering turmoil of plans tasks schemes landgrants politics charters inducements liens and loans government and army and state and national interests grafts and deals and bossesall that mass of selfish and unselfish motives all that wealth of cunning and noble aims all that congested assemblage of humanity which went to make up the building of the union pacific  neale was a dreamer like the few men whose minds had first given birth to the wonderful idea of a railroad from east to west neale found himself confronted by a singularly disturbing fact however grand this project its political and mercenary features could not be beautiful to him why could not all men be rightminded about a noble cause and work unselfishly for the development of the west and the future generations it was a melancholy thing to learn that men of sincere and generous purpose had spent their all trying to raise the money to build the union pacific on the other hand it was a satisfaction to hear that many capitalists with greedy claws had ruined themselves in like efforts  the president of the united states and congress had their own troubles at the close of the war and the government could do but little moneyraising with landgrants and loans but they offered a great bonus to the men who would build the railroad  the first construction company subscribed over a million and a half dollars and paid in onequarter of that the money went so swiftly that it opened the companys eyes to the insatiable gulf beneath that enterprise and they quit  thereupon what was called the credit mobilier was inaugurated and it became both famous and infamous  it was a type of the construction company by which it was the custom to build railroads at that time the directors believing that whatever money was to be made out of the union pacific must be collected during the construction period organized a clever system for just this purpose  an extravagant sum was to be paid to the credit mobilier for the construction work thus securing for stockholders of the union pacific who now controlled the credit mobilier the bonds loaned by the united states government  the operations of the credit mobilier finally gave rise to one of the most serious political scandals in the history of the united states congress  the cost of all material was high and it rose with leaps and bounds until it was prodigious omaha had no railroad entering it from the east and so all the supplies materials engines cars machinery and laborers had to be transported from st louis up the swift missouri on boats this in itself was a work calling for the limit of practical management and energy out on the prairieland for hundreds of miles were to be found no trees no wood scarcely any brush the prairieland was beautiful ground for buffalo but it was a most barren desert for the exigencies of railroad men moreover not only did wood and fuel and railroadties have to be brought from afar but also stone for bridges and abutments then thousands of men had to be employed and those who hired out for reasonable money soon learned that others were getting more having the company at their mercy they demanded exorbitant wages in their turn  one of the peculiar features of the construction a feature over which neale grew impotently furious was the law that when a certain section of so many miles had been laid and equipped the government of the united states would send out expert commissioners who would go over the line and pass judgment upon the finished work no two groups of commissioners seemed to agree these experts who had their part to play in the bewildering and labyrinthine maze of mens contrary plans and plots reported that certain sections would have to be done over again  the particular fault found with one of these sections was the alleged steepness of the grade and as neale had been the surveyor in charge he soon heard of his poor work he went over his figures and notes with the result that he called on henney and absolutely swore that the grade was right henney swore too in a different and more forcible way but he agreed with neale and advised him to call upon the expert commissioners  neale did so and found them with one exception open to conviction the exception was a man named allison lee the name lee gave neale a little shock he was a graylooking man with lined face and that concentrated air which neale had learned to associate with those who were high in the affairs of the u p  neale stated that his business was to show that his work had been done right and he had the figures to prove it mr lee replied that the survey was poor and would have to be done over  are you a surveyor queried neale sharply with the blood beating in his temples  i have some knowledge of civil engineering replied the commissioner  well it cant be very much declared neale whose temper was up  young man be careful what you say replied the other  but mrmr leelisten to me will you burst out neale its all here in my notes youve hurried over the line and you just slipped up a foot or so in your observations of that section  mr lee refused to look at the notes and waved neale aside  itll hurt my chances for a big job neale said stubbornly  you probably will lose your job judging from the way you address your superiors  that finished neale he grew perfectly white  all this expertcommissioner business is rot he flung at lee rot lodge knows it henney knows it we all do and so do you its a lot of damn red tape every last man who can pull a stroke with the government runs in here to annoy good efficient engineers who are building the road its an outrage its more its not honest that section has forty miles in it five miles you claim must be resurveyedregradedrelaid fortysix thousand dollars a mile thats the secrettwo hundred and thirty thousand dollars more for a construction company  neale left the office and returning to henney repeated the interview to him word for word henney complimented neales spirit but deplored the incident it could do no good and might do harm many of these commissioners were politicians working in close touch with the directors and not averse to bleeding the credit mobilier  all the engineers including the chief though he was noncommittal were bitter about this expertcommissioner law if a good roadbed had been surveyed the engineers knew more about it than any one else they were the pioneers of the work it was exceedingly annoying and exasperating to have a number of men travel leisurely in trains over the line and criticize the labors of engineers who had toiled in heat and cold and wet with brain and heart in the task but it was so  in may 1866 a wagontrain escorted by troops rolled into the growing camp of north platte and the first man to alight was warren neale strong active eagereyed as ever but older and with face pale from his indoor work and hope long deferred  the first man to greet him was larry king in whom time did not make changes  they met as longseparated brothers  red howre your horses was neales query following the greeting  wintered well but cost me all i had im shore busted replied larry  ive plenty of money said neale and whats mine is yours come on red well get light packs and hit the trail for the wyoming hills  wal i reckoned so neale its shore goin to be risky the injuns are on the rampage already you see how this heah camp has growed men ridin in all since winter broke an them from west tell some hard stories  ive got to go replied neale with emotion its nearly a year since i saw allie not a word between us in all that time red i cant stand it longer  shore i know replied king hastily you aint reckonin i wanted to crawfish ill go well pack light hit the trail at night an hide up in the daytime  neale had arrived in north platte before noon and before sunset he and king were far out on the swelling slopes of plainland riding toward the west  traveling by night camping by day they soon left behind them the monotonous plains of nebraska the sioux had been active for two summers along the southern trails of wyoming the texans long training on the ranges stood them in good stead here his keen eye for tracks and smoke and distant objects his care in hiding trails and selecting camps and his skill and judgment in all pertaining to the horsesthese things made the journey possible for they saw indian signs more than once before the wyoming hills loomed up in the distance more than one flickering campfire they avoided by a wide detour  slingerlands valley showed all the signs of early summer the familiar trail however bore no tracks of horses or man or beast a heavy rain had fallen recently and it would have obliterated tracks  neales suspense sustained the added burden of dread in the oppressive silence of the valley he read some nameless reason for fear the trail seemed the same the brook flowed and murmured as of old the trees shone soft and green but neale sensed a difference he dared not look at larry for confirmation of his fears the valley had not of late been lived in  neale rode hard up the trail under the pines a blackened heap lay where once the cabin had stood neales heart gave a terrible leap and then seemed to cease beating he could not breathe nor speak nor move his eyes were fixed on the black remains of slingerlands cabin  gawd almighty gasped larry and he put out a shaking hand to clutch neale the injuns i always feared thisspite of slingerlands talk  the feel of larrys fierce fingers like hot stinging arrows in his flesh pierced neales mind and made him realize what his stunned faculties had failed to grasp it seemed to loosen the viselike hold upon his muscles to liberate his tongue  he fell off his horse  red looklook around  allie was gone the disappointment at not seeing her was crushing and the fear of utter loss was terrible neale lay on the ground blind sick full of agony with his fingers tearing at the grass the evil presentiments that had haunted him for months had not been groundless fancies perhaps allie had called to him again in another hour of calamity and this time he had not responded she was gone that idea struck him cold it meant the most dreadful of all happenings for a while he lay there prostrate under the shock he was dimly aware of larrys coming and sitting down beside him  no sign of any one he said huskily not even a track thet fire must hev been about two weeks ago mebbe more but not much theres been a big rain an the grounds all washed clean an smooth  not a track  it was the cowboys habit to calculate the past movements of people and horses by the nature of the tracks they left  then neale awoke to violence he sprang up and rushed to the ruins of the cabin frantically tore and dug around the burnt embers and did not leave off until he had overhauled the whole pile there was nothing but ashes and embers whereupon he ran to the empty corrals to the sheds to the woodpile to the spring and all around the space once so habitable there was nothing to reward his fierce energynothing to scrutinize already grass was springing in the trails and upon spots that had once been bare  neale halted sweating hot wild before his friend larry avoided his gaze  shes gone shes gone neale panted  wal mebbe slingerland moved camp an burned this place suggested larry he was sore after them four roadagents rustled in heah  nono hed have left the cabin in case he movedallie was to write me a notetelling me how to find them i rememberwe picked out the place to hide the note oh shes gone shes gone  wal then mebbe slingerland got away an the cabin was burned after  i cant hope that i tell youit means hells opened up before me  wal its tough i know neale but mebbe  neale wheeled fiercely upon him youre only saying those things you dont believe them tell me what you do really think  lord pard it couldnt be no wuss replied larry his lean face working i figger only one way this heah slingerland had left allie alone thenshe was made away with an the cabin burned  indians  mebbe but i lean more to the idee of an outfit like thet one what was heah  neale groaned in his torture not that reddynot that the indians would kill herscalp heror take her captive into their tribe but a gang of cutthroat ruffians like these my god if i knew that had happened itd kill me  larry swore at his friend it cant do no good to go to pieces he expostulated lets do somethin  whatin heavens name cried neale in despair  wal we can rustle up every trail in these heah black hills mebbe we can find slingerland   then began a searchfrantic desperate and forlorn on the part of neale faithful and dogged and keen on the part of king neale was like a wild man he heeded no advice or caution only the cowboys iron arm saved neale and his horse it was imperative to find water and grass and to eat necessary things which neale seemed to have forgotten he seldom slept or rested or ate they risked meeting the sioux in every valley and on every ridge neale would have welcomed the sight of indians he would have rushed into peril in the madness of his grief still there was hope he lived all the hours in utter agony of mind but his heart did not give up  they coursed far and near always keeping to the stream beds for if slingerland had made another camp it would be near water more than one trail led nowhere more than one horse track roused hopes that were futile the wyoming hills country was surely a lonely and a wild one singularly baffling to the searchers for in two weeks of wide travel it did not yield a sign or track of man neale and king used up all their scant supply of food threw away all their outfit except a bag of salt and went on living on the meat they shot  then one day unexpectedly they came upon two trappers by a beaverdam neale was overcome by his emotion he sensed that from these men he would learn something the first look from them told him that his errand was known  howdy greeted larry it shore is good to see you menthe fust weve come on in an awful hunt through these heah hills  thar aint any doubt thet you look it friend replied one of the trappers  were huntin fer slingerland do you happen to know him  knowed al fer years he went through hyar a week agojest after the big rain wasnt it bill  wal to be exact it was eight days ago replied the comrade bill  washealone asked larry thickly  sure an lookin sick he lost his girl not long since he said an it broke him bad  lost her how  wal he was sure it wasnt redskins rejoined the trapper reflectively slingerland stood in with the siouxtraded with em he  tell me quick hoarsely interrupted neale what happened to allie lee  fellars my pard heah is hurt deep said larry the girl you spoke of was his sweetheart  young man we only know what al told us replied the trapper he said the only time he ever left the lass alone was the very day she was taken al come home to find the cabin redhot ashes everythin gone no sign of the lass no sign of murder she was jest carried off there was trackshoss tracks an boot tracks to the number of three or four men an hosses al trailed em but thet very night he had to hold up to keep from bein drowned as we had to hyar wal next day he couldnt find any tracks but he kept on huntin fer a few days an then give up he said shed be dead by thensaid she wasnt the kind thet could have lived more n a day with men like them some hard customers are driftin by from the goldfields an bill an i hyar aint in love with this railroad idee it ll ruin the country fer trappin an livin   some weeks later a gaunt and ragged cowboy limped into north platte walking beside a broken horse upon the back of which swayed and reeled a rider tied in the saddle  it was not a sight to interest any except the lazy or the curious for in that day such things were common in north platte the horse had bullet creases on his neck the rider wore a bloody shirt the gaunt pedestrian had a bandaged arm  neale lay ill of a deeper wound while the bullethole healed in his side day and night larry tended him or sat by him or slept near him in a shack on the outskirts of the camp shock grief starvation exhaustion loss of blood and sleepall these brought warren neale close to death he did not care to live it was the patient loyal friend who fought fever and heartbreak and the ebbing tide of life  baxter and henney visited north platte and called to see him and later the chief came and ordered larry to take neale to the tents of the corps every one was kind solicitous earnest he had been missed the members of his corps knew the strange story of allie lee they guessed the romance and grieved over the tragedy they did all they could do and the troop doctor added his attention but it was the nursing the presence and the spirit of larry king that saved neale  he got well and went back to work with the cowboy for his helper  in that camp of toil and disorder none but the few with whom neale was brought in close touch noted anything singular about him the engineers however observed that he did not work so well nor so energetically nor so accurately his enthusiasm was lacking the cowboy always with him was the one who saw the sudden spells of somber abstraction and the poignant hopeless sleepless pain the eternal regret and as neale slackened in his duty larry king grew more faithful  neale began to drink and gamble for long the cowboy fought argued appealed against this order of things and then failing to change or persuade neale he went to gambling and drinking with him but then it was noted that neale never got under the influence of liquor or lost materially at cards the cowboy spilled the contents of neales glass and played the game into his hands  both of them shrank instinctively from the women of the camp the sight of anything feminine hurt   north platte stirred with the quickening stimulus of the approach of the rails and the trains and the army of soldiers whose duty was to protect the horde of toilers and the army of tradesmen and parasites who lived off them  the construction camp of the graders moved on westward keeping ahead of the camps of the layers  the first train that reached north platte brought directors of the u p ramong them warburton and rudd and rogers also commissioners lee and dunn and a host of followers on a tour of inspection  the five miles of neales section of road that the commissioners had judged at fault had been torn up resurveyed and relaid  neale rode back over the line with baxter and surveyed the renewed part then returning to north platte he precipitated consternation among directors and commissioners and engineers as they sat in council by throwing on the table figures of the new survey identical with his old data  gentlemen the five miles of track torn up and rebuilt had precisely the same grade to an inch he declared with ringing scorn  baxter corroborated his statement the commissioners roared and the directors demanded explanations  ill explain it shouted neale fortysix thousand dollars a mile five milestwo hundred and thirty thousand dollars spent twice taken twice by the same construction company  warburton a tall whitehaired man in a frockcoat got up and pounded the table with his fist who is this young engineer he thundered he has the nerve to back his work instead of sneaking to get a bribe and he tells the truth were building twicespending twice when once is enough  an uproar ensued neale had cast a bomb into the council every man there and all the thousands in camp knew that railroad ties cost several dollars each that wages were abnormally high often demanded in advance and often paid twice that parallel with the great spirit of the work ran a greedy and cunning graft it seemed to be inevitable considering the nature and proportions of the enterprise an absurd law sent out the commissioners the politicians appointed them and both had fat pickings the directors likewise played both ends against the middle they received the money from the stock sales and loans they paid it out to the construction companies and as they employed and owned these companies the money returned to their own pockets but more than one director was fired by the spirit of the projectthe good to be donethe splendid achievementthe trade to come from across the pacific the building of the road meant more to some of them than a mere fortune  warburton was the lion of this group and he roared down the dissension then with a whirl he grasped neale round the shoulders and shoved him face to face with the others  heres the kind of man we want on this job he shouted with red face and bulging jaw his names neale ive heard of some of his surveys youve all seen him face this council that only gentlemen is the spirit which can build the u p r lets push him up lets send him to washington with those figures lets break this damned idiotic law for appointing commissioners to undo the work of efficient men  opportunity was again knocking at neales door  allison lee arose in the flurry and his calm cold presence the steel of his hard gray eyes and the motion of his hand entitled him to a voice  mr warburtonand gentlemen he said i remember this young engineer neale when i got here today i inquired about him remembering that he had taken severe exception to the judgment of the commissioners about that five miles of roadbed i learned he is a strange excitable young fellow who leaves his work for long wild trips and who is a drunkard and a gambler it seems to me somewhat absurd seriously to consider the false report with which he has excited this council  its not false retorted neale with flashing eyes then he appealed to warburton and he was white and eloquent you directors know better this man lee is no engineer he doesnt know a footgrade from a fortyfivedegree slope not a man in that outfit had the right or the knowledge to pass judgment on our work its political its a damned outrage its graft  another commissioner bounced up with furious gestures  well have you fired he shouted  neale looked at him and back at allison lee and then at warburton  i quit he declared with scorn to hell with your rotten railroad  another hubbub threatened in the big tent some one yelled for quiet  and suddenly there was quiet but it did not come from that individuals call a cowboy had detached himself from the group of curious onlookers and had confronted the council with two big guns held low  red hold on cried neale  it was larry one look at him blanched neales face  everybody sit still an let me talk drawled larry with the cool reckless manner that now seemed so deadly  no one moved and the silence grew unnatural the cowboy advanced a few strides his eyes with a singular piercing intentness were bent upon allison lee yet seemed to hold all the others in sight he held one gun in direct alignment with lee low down and with the other he rapped on the table the gasp that went up from round that table proved that some one saw the guns were both cocked  did i understand you to say neale lied aboot them surveyin figgers he queried gently  allison lee turned as white as a corpse the cowboy radiated some dominating force but the chill in his voice was terrible it meant that life was nothing to himnor death what was the u p r to him or its directors or its commissioners or the law there was no law in that wild camp but the law in his hands and he knew it  did you say my pard lied he repeated  allison lee struggled and choked over a halting no  the cowboy backed away slowly carefully with soft steps and he faced the others as he moved  i reckon thets aboot all he said and slipping into the crowd he was gone     11  after neale and larry left slingerland saw four seasons swing round in which no visitors disturbed the loneliness of his valley  all this while he did not leave allie lee alone or at least out of hearing when he went to tend his traps or to hunt to chop wood or to watch the trail allie always accompanied him she grew strong and supple she could walk far and carry a rifle or a pack she was keen of eye and ear and she loved the wilds she not only was of help to him but she made the time pass swiftly  when a year passed after the departure of neale and larry king it seemed to slingerland that they would never return there was peril on the trails these days he grew more and more convinced of some fatality but he did not confide his fears to allie she was happy and full of trust every day almost every hour she looked for neale the long wait did not drag her down she was as fresh and hopeful as ever and the rich bloom mantled her cheek slingerland had not the heart to cast a doubt into her happiness he let her live her dreams  there came a day that spring when it was imperative for him to visit a distant valley where he had left traps he now needed and as the distance was long and time short he decided to go alone allie laughed at the idea of being unsafe at the cabin  i can take care of myself she said im not afraid slingerland scarcely doubted her she had nerve courage she knew how to use a gun and underneath her softness and tenderness was a spirit that would not flinch at anything still he did not feel satisfied with the idea of leaving her alone and it was with a wrench that he did it now  moreover he was longer at the journey than he had anticipated the moment he turned his face homeward a desire to hurry an anxiety a dread fastened upon him a presentiment of evil gathered but encumbered as he was with heavy traps he could not travel swiftly it was late afternoon when he topped the last ridge between him and home  what slingerland saw caused him to drop his traps and gaze aghast a heavy column of smoke rose above the valley his first thought was of sioux but he doubted if the indians would betray his friendship the cabin had caught on fire by accident or else a band of wandering desperadoes had happened along to ruin him he ran down the slope stole down round to the group of pines and under cover cautiously approached the spot where his cabin had stood  it was a heap of smoking logs and probably had burned for hours there was no sign of allie or of any one then he ran into the glade almost at once he saw boottracks and hooftracks while pelts and hides and furs lay scattered around as if they had been discarded for choicer ones  robbers muttered slingerland an theyve got the lass  he shook under the roughest blow he had ever been dealt his conscience flayed him his distress over allies fate was so keen and unfamiliar that used as he was to prompt decision and action he remained stockstill staring at the ruins of his home  presently he roused himself he had no hopes he knew the nature of men who had done this deed but it was possible that he might overtake them in the dust he found four sizes of boottracks and he took the trail down the valley  then he became aware that a storm was imminent and that the air had become cold and raw rain began to fall and darkness came quickly slingerland sought the shelter of a nearby ledge and there hungry cold wet and unhappy he waited for sleep that would not come  it rained hard all night and by morning the brook had become a yellow flood and the trail was under water toward noon the rain turned to a drizzly snow and finally ceased slingerland passed on down the valley searching for tracks the ground everywhere had been washed clean and smooth when he reached the old st vrain and laramie trail it looked as though a horse had not passed there in months he spent another wretched night and next day awoke to the necessities of life except for his rifle and his horses and a few traps back up in the hills he had nothing to show for years of hard and successful work but that did not matter he had begun with as little and he could begin again he killed meat satisfied his hunger and cooked more that he might carry with him then he spent two more days in that locality until he had crossed every outlet from his valley not striking a track he saw nothing but defeat  that moment was bitter if nealed happen along hyar now hed kill mean sarve me right muttered the trapper  but he believed that neale too had gone the way of so many who had braved these wilds slingerland saw in the fate of neale and allie the result of civilization marching westward if before he had disliked the idea of the railroad entering his wild domain he hated it now before that survey the indians had been peaceful no dangerous men rode the trails what right had the government to steal land from the indians to break treaties to run a steam track across the plains and mountains slingerland foresaw the bloodiest period ever known in the west before that work should be completed it had struck him deepthis whiteman movement across the wyoming hills and it was not the loss of all he had worked for that he minded for years his life had been lonely and then suddenly it had been full never again would it be either  slingerland turned his back to the trail made by the advancing march of the empirebuilders and sought the seclusion of the more inaccessible hills  some day ill work out with a load of pelts he said an then mebbe ill hyar what become of nealean her  he found as one of his kind knew how to find the valleys where no white man had trodwhere the game abounded and was tamewhere if the red man came he was friendlywhere the silent days and lonely nights slowly made more bearable his memory of allie lee     12  allie lee possessed a mind at once active and contemplative while she dreamed of neale and their future she busied herself with many tasks and a whole year flew by without a lagging or melancholy hour  neale she believed had been detained or sent back to omaha or given more important work than formerly she divined slingerlands doubt but she would not give it room in her consciousness her heart told her that all was well with neale and that sooner or later he would return to her  in allie love had worked magic it had freed her from a horrible black memory she had been alone she had wanted to die so as to forget those awful yells and screamsthe murderthe bloodthe terror and the anguish she had nothing to want to live for she had almost hated those two kind men who tried so hard to make her forget then suddenly she never quite remembered when she had seen neale with different eyes a few words a touch a gift and a pledgeand life had been transformed for allie lee like a flower blooming overnight her heart had opened to love and all the distemper in her blood and all the blackness in her mind were dispelled the relief from pain and dread was so great that love became a beautiful and allabsorbing passion freed then and strangely happy she took to the life around her as naturally as if she had been born there and she grew like a wild flower neale returned to her that autumn to make perfect the realization of her dreams when he went away she could still be happy she owed it to him to be perfect in joy faith love and duty and her adversity had discovered to her an inward courage and an indomitable will she lived for neale  summer autumn winter passed short days full of solitude beauty thought and anticipation and always achievement for she could not stay idle when the first green brightened the cottonwoods and willows along the brook she knew that before their leaves had attained their full growth neale would be on his way to her a strange and inexplicable sense of the heart told her that he was coming  more than once that spring had she bent over the mossy rock to peer down at her face mirrored in the crystal spring neale had made her aware of her beauty and she was proud of it since it seemed to be such a strange treasure to him  on the may morning that slingerland left her alone she was startled by the clipclop of horses trotting up the trail a few hours after his departure  her first thought was that neale and larry had returned all her being suddenly radiated with rapture she flew to the door  four horsemen rode into the clearing but neale was not among them  allies joy was shortlived and the reaction to disappointment was a violent agonizing wrench she lost all control of her muscles for a moment and had to lean against the cabin to keep from falling  by this time the foremost rider had pulled in his horse near the door he was a young giant with hulking shoulders ruddyfaced boldeyed uglymouthed he reminded allie of some one she had seen in california he stared hard at her  hullo aint you durades girl he asked in gruff astonishment  then allie knew she had seen him out in the goldfields  no im not she replied  ahuh you look uncommon like her anybody home round here  slingerland went over the hill said allie hell be back presently  the fellow brushed her aside and went into the cabin then the other three riders arrived  mornin miss said one a grizzled veteran who might have been miner trapper or bandit the other two reined in behind him one wore a widebrimmed black sombrero from under which a dark sinister face gleamed the last man had sandy hair and light roving eyes  whars fresno he asked  im inside replied the man called fresno and he appeared at the door he stretched out a long arm and grasped allie before she could avoid him when she began to struggle the huge hand closed on her wrist until she could have screamed with pain  hold on girl it wont do you no good to jerk an if you holler ill choke you he said fellers get inside the cabin an rustle around lively  with one pull he hauled allie toward his horse and taking a lasso off his saddle he roped her arms to her sides and tied her to the nearest tree  keep mum now or it ll be the wuss fer you he ordered then he went into the cabin  they were a bad lot and slingerlands reason for worry had at last been justified allie did not fully realize her predicament until she found herself bound to the tree then she was furious and strained with all her might to slip free of the rope but the efforts were useless she only succeeded in bruising her arms for nothing when she desisted she was ready to succumb to despair until a flashing thought of neale of the agony that must be his if he lost her or if harm befell her drew her up sharply thrillingly a girls natural and instinctive fear was vanquished by her love  she heard the robbers knocking things about in the cabin they threw bales of beaver pelts out of the door presently fresno reappeared carrying a buckskin sack in which slingerland kept his money and few valuables and the others followed quarreling over a canecovered demijohn in which there had once been liquor  nary a drop growled the one who got possession of it and with rage he threw the thing back into the cabin where it crashed into the fire  sandy youve scattered the fire protested the grizzled robber as he glanced into the cabin them furs is catchin  let em burn called fresno we got all we want come on  but whats the sense burnin the fellers cabin down  nuthin ll burn said the darkfaced man an if it does it ll look like indians work savvy old miles  they shuffled out together evidently fresno was the leader or at least the strongest force he looked at the sack in his hand and then at allie  you fellers fight over thet he said and throwing the sack on the ground he strode toward allie  the three men all made a rush for the sack and sandy got it the other two pressed round him not threateningly but aggressively sure of their rights  ill divide said sandy as he mounted his horse wait till we make camp you fellers pack the beavers  fresno untied allie from the tree but he left the lasso round her holding to it and her arm he rudely dragged her to his horse  git up an hurry he ordered  allie mounted the stirrups were too long  you fellers clear out called fresno an ketch me one of them hosses we seen along the brook  while he readjusted the stirrups allie looked down upon him he was an uncouth ruffian and his touch gave her an insupportable disgust he wore no weapons but his saddle holster contained a revolver and the sheath a winchester allie could have shot him and made a run for it and she had the nerve to attempt it the others however did not get out of sight before fresno had the stirrups adjusted he strode after them leading the horse allie glanced back to see a thin stream of smoke coming out of the cabin door then she faced about desperately resolved to take any chance to get away she decided that she would not be safe among these men for very long whatever she was to do she must do that day and she only awaited her opportunity  at the ford sandy caught one of slingerlands horsesa mustang and a favorite of allies and one she could ride he was as swift as the wind once upon him she could run away from any horse which these robbers rode fresno put the end of the lasso round the mustangs neck  can you ride bareback he asked allie  allie lied her first thought was to lead them astray as to her skill with a horse and then it occurred to her that if she rode fresnos saddle there might be an opportunity to use the gun  fresno leaped astride the mustang and was promptly bucked off the other men guffawed fresno swore and picking himself up tried again this time the mustang behaved better but it was plain he did not like the weight then fresno started off leading his own horse and at a trot that showed he wanted to cover ground  allie heard the others quarreling over something probably the gold slingerland had been so many years in accumulating  they rode on to where the valley opened into another along which wound the old st vrain and laramie trail they kept to this traveling east for a few miles and then entered an intersecting valley where some distance up they had a camp they had not taken the precaution to hide either packs or mules and so far as allie could tell they had no fear of indians probably they had crossed from california and being dishonest and avoiding caravans and camps they had not become fully acquainted with the perils of that region  it was about noon when they arrived at this place the sun was becoming blurred and a storm appeared brewing fresno dismounted dropping the halter of the mustang then he let go his own bridle the eyes he bent on allie made her turn hers away as from something that could scorch and stain he pulled her off the saddle rudely with coarse and meaning violence  allie pushed him back and faced him in a way she had been sheltered all her life yet she had lived among such men as this man and she knew that resistance or pleadings were useless they would only inflame him she was not ready yet to court death  wait she said  ahuh he grunted breathing heavily he was an animal slowwitted and brutal  fresno i am durades girl she went on  i thought i knowed you but youre grown to be a woman an a dam pretty one  allie drew him aside farther from the others who had renewed a loud altercation fresno its gold you want she affirmed rather than asked  sure but no small stake like thetd be my choice agin you he leered jerking a thumb back at his companions  you remember horn went on allie  horn the miner who made thet big strike out near sacramento  yes thats who i mean replied allie hurriedly wewe left california in his caravan he brought all his gold with him  fresno showed a growing interest  we were attacked by sioux horn buried all that goldon the spot allall the others were killedexcept me and i know where allie shuddered with what the words brought up but no memory could weaken her  fresno opened his large mouth to bawl this unexpected news to his comrades  dont call themdont tell them allie whispered theres only one condition ill take you where that golds hidden  girl i can make you tell he replied menacingly  no you cant  you aint so smart you think ill let you gojest for some gold he queried goldll be cheap along this trail soon an girls like you are scarce  no thats not what i meant get rid of the othersand ill take you where horn buried his gold  fresno stared at her he grinned the idea evidently surprised and flattered him yet it was perplexing  but frankhes my pardthet one with the black hat he protested i couldnt do no dirt to frank whats your game girl ill beat you into tellin me where thet gold is  beating wont make me tell replied allie with intensity nothing willif i dont want to my game is for my life you know ive no chance among four men like you  aw i dont know about thet he blustered i can take care of you but say if youd stand fer frank mebbe ill take you up girl are you lyin about thet gold  no  why didnt the trapper dig it up you must hev told him  because he was afraid to keep it in or near his cabin we meant to leave it until we were ready to get out of the country  that appeared plausible to fresno and he grew more thoughtful  meanwhile the altercation among the other three ruffians assumed proportions that augured a fight  ill divide this sack when i git good an ready declared sandy  but pard thets no square deal protested old miles im agittin mad i seen you meant to keep it all  the darkfaced ruffian shoved a menacing fist under sandys nose when do i git mine he demanded  fresno wheeled and called frank you come here  the other approached sullenly fresno thet sandy is whole hog or none he exclaimed  let em fight it out replied fresno weve got a bigger game besides theyll shoot each other up then well hev it all come give em elbow room  he led allie and his horse away a little distance  fetch them packs frank he called the mustang followed and presently frank came with one of the packs fresno slipped the saddle from his horse and laying it under a tree he pulled gun and rifle from their sheaths the gun he stuck in his belt the rifle he leaned against a branch  sandyll plug old miles in jest another minnit remarked fresno  whats this other game queried frank curiously  its gold frankgold replied fresno and in few words he told his comrade about horns buried treasure but he did not mention the condition under which the girl would reveal its hidingplace evidently he had no doubt that he could force her to tell  lets rustle cried frank his dark face gleaming we want to git out of this country quick  you bet an i wonder when well be fetchin up with them railroad camps we heerd about camps full of gold an whisky an wimmen  weve enough on our hands now replied frank lets rustle fer thet  a gunshot interrupted him then a hoarse curse rang outand then two more reports from a different gun  them last was sandys observed fresno coolly an of course they landed go see if old miles hit sandy  frank strode off under the trees  allie had steeled herself to anything and those shots warned her that now she had two less enemies to contend with and that she must be quick to seize the first opportunity to act she could leap upon the mustang and if she was lucky she could get away she could jump for the winchester and surely shoot one of these villains perhaps both of them but the spirit that gave her the nerve to attempt either plan bade her wait not too long but longer in the hope of a more favorable moment  frank returned to fresno and he carried the sack of gold that had caused dissension fresno laughed  sandys plugged hardlow down said frank he cant live an old miles is croaked  ahuh frank ill go git the other packs an you see whats in this sack said fresno  when he got out of sight allie slipped the lasso from her waist  i dont need that hanging to me she said  sure you dont sweetheart replied the ruffian frank thet man fresno is rough with ladies now im gentle come an let me spill this sack in your lap  i guess not replied allie  wal youre sure a cat look at her eyes all right dont git mad at me  he spilled the contents of the sack out on the sand and bent over it  what had made allies eyes flash was the recognition of her opportunity she did not hesitate an instant first she looked to see just where the mustang stood he was near with the rope dragging half coiled allie suddenly noticed the head and ears of the mustang he heard something she looked up the valley slope and saw a file of indians riding down silhouetted against the sky they were coming fast for an instant allies senses reeled then she rallied her situation was desperatealmost hopeless but here was the issue of life or death and she met it  in one bound she had the rifle long before she had ascertained that it was loaded the man frank heard the click of the raising hammer  whatre you doin he demanded fiercely  dont get up warned allie she stepped backward nearer the mustang look up the slope indians  but he paid no heed he jumped up and strode toward her  look man cried allie piercingly he came on then fresno appeared running white of face  allie without leveling the rifle fired at frank even as his clutching hands struck the weapon  he halted with sudden gasp sank to his knees fell against the tree and then staggered up again  allie had to drop the rifle to hold the frightened mustang she mounted him urged him away and hauled in the dragging lasso once clear of brush and stones he began to run allie saw a clear field ahead but there were steep rocky slopes boxing the valley she would be hemmed in she got the mustang turned and ran among the trees keeping far over to the left she heard beating hoofs off to the right crashings in brush and then yells an opening showed the slope alive with indians riding hard some were heading down and others up the valley to cut off her escape the majority were coming straight for the clumps of trees  fresno burst out of cover mounted on sandys bay horse he began to shoot and the indians fired in reply all along the slopes rose white puffs of smoke and bullets clipped dust from the ground in front of allie fresno drew ahead the bay horse was swift allie pulled her mustang more to the left hoping to get over the ridge which on that side was not high to her dismay indians appeared there too she wheeled back to the first course and saw that she must attempt what fresno was trying  then the robber frank appeared riding out of the cedars the indian riders closed rapidly in on him shooting all the time his horse was hit and stumbling it almost threw the rider then the horse ran wildlycould not be controlled one indian was speeding from among the others he had a bow bent double and suddenly it straightened allie saw dust fly from franks back he threw up his arms and slid off under the horse the saddle slipping with him the horse wounded and terrorized began to plunge dragging man and saddle  ahead far to the right fresno was gaining on his pursuers he was out of range now but the indians kept shooting then allies situation became so perilous that she saw only the indians to the left with their mustangs stretched out so as to intercept her before she got out into the wider valley  her mustang did not need to be goaded the yells behind and on all sides and the whistling bullets drove him to his utmost allie had all she could do to ride him she was nearly blinded by the stinging wind yet she saw those lithe halfnaked savages dropping gradually back and she knew that she was gaining her hair became loose and streamed in the wind she heard the yells then no more rifles cracked her pursuers had discovered that she was a girl and were bent on her capture  fleet and strong the mustang ran surefooted leaping the washes and outdistancing the pursuers on the left allie thought she could turn into the big valley and go down the main trail before the indians chasing fresno discovered her but vain hope across the width of the valley where it opened out a string of indians appeared riding back to meet her  a long dust line dotted with bobbing objects to the right behind a closepacked bunch of hard riders in front an opening trap of yelling savages she was lost and suddenly she remembered the fate of her mother her spirit sank her strength fled everything blurred around her she lost control of the mustang she felt him turning slowing the yells burst hideously in her ears like her mothersher fate a roar of speedy hoofbeats seemed to envelop her and her nostrils were filled with dust they were upon her she prayed for a swift strokethen for her soul all darkenedher senses were failing neales face glimmered therein spaceand again was lost she was slippingslippinga rude and powerful hold fastened upon her then all faded     13  when allie lee came back from that black gap in her consciousness she was lying in a circular tent of poles and hides  for a second she was dazed but the indian designs and trappings in the tent brought swift realizationshe had been brought captive to the sioux encampment she raised her head she was lying on a buffalo robe her hands and feet were bound the floor was littered with blankets and beaded buckskin garments through a narrow opening she saw that the day was far spent indians and horses passed to and fro there was a bustle outside and jabber of indian jargon the wind blew hard and drops of rain pattered on the tent  allie could scarcely credit the evidence of her own senses here she was alive she tried to see and feel if she had been hurt her arms and body appeared bruised and they ached but she was not in any great pain her hopes arose if the sioux meant to kill her they would have done it at once they might intend to reserve her for torture but more likely their object was to make her a captive in the tribe in that case slingerland would surely find her and get her freedom  rain began to fall more steadily allie smelled smoke and saw the reflection of fires on the wall of the tent presently a squaw entered she was a huge woman evidently old very dark of face and wrinkled she carried a bowl and platter which she set down and grunting she began to untie allies hands then she gave the girl a not ungentle shake allie sat up  do youdo they meanto harm and kill me asked allie  the squaw shook her head to indicate she did not understand but her gestures toward the things she had brought were easy to interpret allie partook of the indian food which was coarse and unpalatable but it satisfied her hunger when she had finished the squaw laboriously tied the thongs round allies wrists and pushing her back on the robe covered her up and left her  after that it grew dark rapidly and the rain increased to a torrent allie hardly realizing how cold she had been began to warm up under the woolly robe the roar of the rain drowned all other sounds outside she wondered if slingerland had returned to his cabin and if so what he had done she felt sorry for him he would take the loss hard but he would trail her he would hear of a white girl captive in the sioux camp and she would soon be free how fortunate she was a star of providence had watched over her the prayer she had breathed had been answered she thought of neale she would live for him she would pray and fight off harm she would find him if he could not find her and lying there bound and helpless in an indian camp captive of the relentless sioux for all she knew in peril of death with the roar of wind and rain around her and the darkness like pitch she yet felt her pulses throb and thrill and her spirit soar at remembrance of the man she loved in the end she would find neale and it was with his name trembling on her lips that she fell asleep  more than once during the night she awoke in the pitchy darkness to hear the wind blow and the rain roar the dawn broke cold and gray and the storm gradually diminished allie lay alone for hours beginning to suffer by reason of her bonds and cramped limbs the longer she was left alone the more hopeful her case seemed  in the afternoon she was visited by the squaw released and fed as before allie made signs that she wanted to have her feet free so that she could get up and move about the squaw complied with her wishes allie could scarcely stand she felt dizzy a burning aching sensation filled her limbs  presently the old woman led her out allie saw a great number of tents many horses and squaws and children but few braves the encampment lay in a wide valley similar to all the valleys of that country except that it was larger a stream in flood swept yellow and noisy along the edge of the encampment the children ran at sight of allie and the women stared it was easy to see that they disapproved of her the few braves looked at her with dark steady unfathomable eyes the camp appeared rich in colorin horses and trappings evidently this tribe was not poor allie saw utensils blankets clothingmany things never made by indians  she was led to a big lodge with a tent adjoining inside an old indian brave grizzled and shrunken smoked before a fire and as allie was pushed into the tent a young indian squaw appeared she was small with handsome scornful face and dark proud eyes gorgeously clad in elaborate beaded and fringed buckskinevidently an indian princess or a chiefs wife she threw allie a venomous glance as she went out allie heard the old squaws grunting voice and the young ones quick and passionate answers  there was nothing for allie to do but await developments she rested rubbing her sore wrists and ankles thankful she had been left unbound she saw that she was watched particularly by the young woman who often walked to the opening to glance in the interior of this tent presented a contrast to the other in which she had been confined it was dry and clean with floor of rugs and blankets and all around hung beaded and painted and feathered articles some for wear and others for what purpose she could not guess  the afternoon passed without further incident until the old squaw entered manifestly to feed allie and tie her up as heretofore the younger squaw came in to watch the latter process  allie spoke to her and held out her bound hands appealingly this elicited no further response than an intent look  night came allie lay awake a good while and then she fell asleep next morning she was awakened by an uproar whistling and trampling mustangs whoops of braves the babel of many voices barking of dogs movement bustle soundall attested to the return of the warriors allies heart sank for a moment this would be the time of trial for her but the clamor subsided without any disturbance near her tent by and by the old squaw returned to attend to her needs this time on the way out she dropped a blanket curtain between the tent and the lodge  soon indians entered the lodge quite a number with squaws among them judging by their voices a harangue ensued lasting an hour or more it interested allie especially because at times she heard and recognized the quick passionate utterance of the young squaw  soon allies old attendant shuffled in and unbound her then lifting the curtain she motioned to allie to come out allie went into the lodge an early sun lighted the place brightly it was full of indians in the center stood a striking figure probably a chief tall and lean with scars on his naked breast his face was bronze with deep lines somber and bitter and cruel thin lips and eyes that glittered like black fire his head had the poise of an eagle  his piercing glance scarcely rested an instant upon allie he motioned for her to be taken away allie as she was led back got a glimpse of the young squaw sullen with bowed head and dark rich blood thick in her face with heaving breast and clenched hands she presented a picture of outraged pride and jealousy  probably the chief had decided to claim allie as his captive a decision which would be fiercely resented by the young indian bride  the camp quieted down after that allie peeped through a slit between the hides of which her tent was constructed and she saw no one but squaws and children the mustangs appeared worn out evidently the braves and warriors were resting after a hard ride or fight or foray  nothing happened the hours dragged allie heard the breathing of heavy sleepers about dark she was fed again and bound  that night she was awakened by a gentle shake a hand moved from her shoulder to her lips the pale moonlight filtered into the tent allie saw a figure kneeling beside her and she heard a whispered shsssh then her hands and feet were freed she divined then that the young squaw had come to let her go in the dead of night her heart throbbed high as her liberator held up a side of the tent allie crawled out a bright moon soared in the sky the camp was silent the young woman slipped after her and with a warning gesture to be silent she led allie away toward the slope of the valley it was a goodly distance not a sound disturbed the peace of the beautiful night the air was cold and still allie shivered and trembled this was the most exciting adventure of all she felt a sudden tenderness and warmth for this indian girl once the squaw halted with ear intent listening allies heart stopped beating but no bark of dog no sound of pursuit justified alarm at last they reached the base of the slope  the indian pointed high toward the ridgetop she made undulating motions of her hand as if to picture the topography of the ridges and the valleys between then kneeling she made a motion with her finger on the ground that indicated a winding trail whereupon she stealthily glided awayall without a spoken word  allie was left alonefreewith direction how to find the trail but what use was it for her to find it in that wilderness still her star kept drawing her spirit she began to climb the slope was grassy and her light feet left little trace she climbed and climbed until she thought her heart would burst once upon the summit she fell in the grass and rested  far below in the moonblanched valley lay the white tents and the twinkling campfires the bay of a dog floated up to her it was a tranquil beautiful scene rising she turned her back upon it with a muttered prayer for the indian girl whose jealousy and generosity had freed her and again she faced the ridgetop and the unknown wilderness  a wolf mourned and the sound clear and sharp startled her but remembering slingerlands word that no beast would be likely to harm her in the warm season she was reassured soon she had crossed the narrow back of the ridge to see below another valley like the one she had left but without the tents and fires descent was easy and she covered ground swiftly she feared lest she should come upon a stream in flood again she mounted a slope zigzagging up going slowly reserving her strength pausing often to rest and to listen and keeping a straight line with the star she had marked climbing was hard work however slowly she went just as going down was a relief to her wearied legs  in this manner she climbed four ridges and crossed three valleys before a rest became imperative now dawn was near as was evidenced by the paling stars and the gray in the east it would be well for her to remain on high ground while day broke  so she rested but soon cooling off she suffered with the cold huddling down in the grass against a stone and facing the east she waited for dawn to break  the stars shut their eyes the dark blue of sky turned gray a pale light seemed to suffuse itself throughout the east the valley lay asleep in shadow the ridges awoke in soft gray mist far down over the vastness and openness of the plains appeared a ruddy glow it warmed it changed it brightened a sea of cloudy vapors serene and motionless changed to rose and pink and a red curve slid up over the distant horizon all that world of plain and cloud and valley and ridge quickened as with the soul of day while it colored with the fire of sun red radiant glorious the sun rose  it was the dispeller of gloom the bringer of hope allie lee lost on the heights held out her arms to the east and the sun and she cried oh god oh nealeneale  when she turned to look down into the valley below she saw the white winding ribbonlike trail and with her eyes she followed it to where the valley opened wide upon the plains  she must go down the slope to the cover of the trees and brush and there work along eastward ever with eye alert she must meet with travelers within a few days or perish of starvation or again fall into the hands of the sioux thirst she did not fear for the recent heavy rain had left waterholes everywhere  with action her spirit lightened and the numbness of hands and feet left her time passed swiftly the sun stood straight overhead before she realized she had walked miles and it declined westward as she skulked like an indian from tree to tree from bush to bush along the first bench of the valley floor  night overtook her at the gateway of the valley the vast monotony of the plains opened before her like a gulf she feared it she found a mound of earth with a windworn shelf in its side and overgrown with sage and into this she crawled curled in the sand and prayed and slept  next day she took up a position a few hundred yards from the trail and followed its course straining her eyes to see before and behind her husbanding her strength with frequent rests and drinking from every pool  that day like its predecessor passed swiftly by and left her well out upon the huge billowy bosom of the plains again she sought a hidingplace but none offered there was no warmth in the sand and the night wind arose cold and moaning she could not sleep the whole empty world seemed haunted rustlings of the sage seepings of the sand gusts of the wind the night the loneliness the faithless stars and a treacherous moon that sank the wailing of wolvesall these things worked upon her mind and spirit until she lost her courage she feared to shut her eyes or cover her face for then she could not see the stealthy forms stalking her out of the gloom she prayed no more to her star  oh god have you forsaken me she moaned  how relentless the grip of the endless hours the black night held fast and yet when she had grown nearly mad waiting for the dawn it finally broke ruddy and bright with the sun as always a promise of better things to come  allie found no water that day she suffered from the lack of it but hunger appeared to have left her her strength diminished yet she walked and plodded miles on miles always gazing both hopelessly and hopefully along the winding trail  at the close of the short and merciful day despair seized upon allies mind with night came gloom and the memory of her mothers fate she still clung to a strange faith that all would soon be well but reason fact reality these present things pointed to certain doomstarvationdeath by thirstor indians a thousand times she imagined she heard the fleet hoofbeating of many mustangs only the tiny pats of the broken sage leaves in the wind  it was a dark and cloudy night warmer and threatening rain she kept continually turning round and round to see what it was that came creeping up behind her so stealthily how horrible was the darkthe blackness that showed invisible things a wolf sent up his hungry lonely cry she did not fear this reality so much as she feared the intangible if she lived through this night there would be another like it to renew the horror she would rather not live like a creature beset by foes all around she watched she faced every little sound she peered into the darkness instinctively unable to give up to end the struggle to lie down and die  neale seemed to be with her he was alive he was thinking of her at that very moment he would expect her to overcome self and accident and calamity he spoke to her out of the distance and his voice had the old power stronger than fear exhaustion hopelessness insanity he could call her back from the grave  and so the night passed  in the morning when the sun lit the level land far down the trail westward gleamed a long white line of moving wagons  allie uttered a wild and broken cry in which all the torture shuddered out of her heart again she was saved that black doubt was shame to her spirit she prayed her thanksgiving and vowed in her prayers that no adversity however cruel could ever again shake her faith or conquer her spirit  she was going on to meet neale life was suddenly sweet again unutterably full blazing like the sunrise he was theresomewhere to the eastward  she waited the caravan was miles away but it was no mirage no trick of the wide plain she watched if the hours of night had been long what were these hours of day with life and the chance of happiness ever advancing  at last she saw the scouts riding in front and alongside and the plodding oxen it was a large caravan well equipped for defense  she left the little rise of ground and made for the trail how uneven the walking she staggered her legs were weak but she gained the trail and stood there she waved they were not so far away surely she would be seen she staggered onwaved again  there the leading scout had halted he pointed other riders crowded around him the caravan came to a stop  allie heard voices she waved her arms and tried to run a scout dismounted advanced to meet her rifle ready the caravan feared a sioux trick allie described a lean gray old man now he was rapidly striding toward her  its a white gal she heard him shout  others ran forward as she staggered to meet them  im aloneimlost she faltered  a white gal in injun dress said another  and then kind hands were outstretched to her  imrunningaway indians panted allie  whar asked the lean old scout  over the ridgesmilestwenty milesmore they had me i gotaway fourthree days ago  the group around allie opened to admit another man  whos thiswhos this called a quick voice soft and liquid yet with a quality of steel in it  allie had heard that voice she saw a tall man in long black coat and wide black hat and flowered vest and flowing tie her heart contracted  allie rang the voice  she looked up to see a dark handsome facea spanish face with almond eyes sloeblack and magnetica face that suddenly blazed  she recognized the man with whom her mother had run awaythe man she had long believed her fatherthe adventurer durade then she fainted     14  allie recovered to find herself lying in a canvascovered wagon and being worked over by several sympathetic women she did not see durade but she knew she had not been mistaken the wagon was rolling along as fast as oxen could travel evidently the caravan had been alarmed by the proximity of the sioux and was making as much progress as possible  allie did not answer many questions she drank thirstily but she was too exhausted to eat  whose caravan was the only query she made  durades replied one woman and it was evident from the way she spoke that this was a man of consequence  as allie lay there slowly succumbing to weariness and drowsiness she thought of the irony of fate that had let her escape the sioux only to fall into the hands of durade still there was hope durade was traveling toward the east out there somewhere he would meet neale and then blood would be spilled she had always regarded durade strangely wondering that in spite of his kindness to her she could not really care for him she understood now and hated him passionately and if there was any one she feared it was durade allie lost herself in the past seeing the stream of mixed humanity that passed through durades gamblinghalls no doubt he was on his way first to search for her mother and secondly to profit by the building of the railroad but he would never find her mother allie was glad  at length she fell asleep and slept long then dozed at intervals the caravan halted allie heard the familiar singsong calls to the oxen soon all was bustle about her and this fully awakened her in a moment or more she must expect to be face to face with durade what should she tell him how much should she let him know not one word about her mother he would be less afraid of her if he found out that the mother was dead durade had always feared allies mother  the women with whom allie had ridden helped her out of the wagon and finding her too weak to stand they made a bed for her on the ground the camp site appeared to be just the same as any other part of that monotonous plainland but evidently there was a stream or waterhole near by allie saw her companions were the only women in the caravan they were plain persons blunt yet kind used to hard honest work and probably wives of defenders of the wagontrain  they could not conceal their curiosity in regard to allie nor their wonder she had heard them whispering together whenever they came near  presently allie saw durade he was approaching how well she remembered him yet the lapse of time and the change between her childhood and the present seemed incalculable he spoke to the women motioning in her direction his bearing and action were that of a man of education and a gentleman yet he looked what her mother had called hima broken man of class an adventurer a victim of base passions  he came and knelt by allie how are you now he asked his voice was gentle and courteous different from that of the other men  i cant stand up replied allie  are you hurt  noonly worn out  you escaped from indians  yesa tribe of sioux they intended to keep me captive but a young squaw freed meled me off  he paused as if it was an effort to speak and a long thin shapely hand went to his throat your mother he asked hoarsely suddenly his face had turned white  allie gazed straight into his eyes with wonder pain suspicion my mother ive not seen her for nearly two years  my god what happened you lost her you became separated indiansbandits tell me  i havenomore to tell said allie his pain revived her own she pitied durade he had changedagedthere were lines in his face that were new to her  i spent a year in and around ogden searching went on durade tell memore  no cried allie  do you know then he asked very low  im not your daughterand mother ran off from you yes i know that replied allie bitterly  but i brought you uptook care of youhelped educate you protested durade with agitation you were my own child i thought i was always kind to you ii loved the mother in the daughter  yes i know but you were wicked  if you wont tell me it must mean shes still alive he replied swiftly shes not dead ill find her ill make her come back to meor kill her after all these yearsto leave me  he seemed wrestling with mingled emotions the man was proud and strong but defeat in life in the crowning passion of life showed in his white face the evil in him was not manifest then  where have you lived all this time he asked presently  back in the hills with a trapper  you have grown when i saw you i thought it was the ghost of your mother you are just as she was when we met  he seemed lost in sad retrospection allie saw streaks of gray in his once jetblack hair  what will you do asked allie  he was startled the softness left him a blaze seemed to leap under skin and eyes and suddenly he was differenthe was durade the gambler instinct with the lust of gold and life  your mother left me for you he said with terrible bitterness and the game has played you into my hands ill keep you ill hold you to get even with her  allie felt stir in her the fear she had had of him in her childhood when she disobeyed but you cant keep me against my willnot among people well meet eastward  i can and i will he declared softly but implacably were not going east well be in rougher places than the goldcamps of california theres no law but gold and guns out here butif you speak of me to any one may your god have mercy on you  the blaze of him betrayed the spaniard he meant more than dishonor torture and death the evil in him was rampant the love that had been the only good in an abnormal and disordered mind had turned to hate  allie knew him he was the first person who had ever dominated her through sheer force of will unless she abided by his command her fate would be worse than if she had stayed captive among the sioux this man was not an american his years among men of later mold had not changed the old world cruelty of his nature she recognized the fact in utter despair she had not strength left to keep her eyes open  after a while allie grew conscious that durade had left her she felt like a creature that had been fascinated by a deadly snake and then left to itself in the mean time she could do nothing but wait shudderingly mournfully she resigned herself to the feeling that she must stay under durades control until a dominance stronger than his should release her neale seemed suddenly to have retreated far into the past to have gone out of the realm of her consciousness and yet the sound of his voice the sight of his face would make instantly that spirit of hershis spiritto leap like a tigress in her defense but where was neale the habits of life were all powerful and all her habits had been formed under durades magnetic eye neale retreated and so did spirit courage hope love remained despairing yet unquenchable  allies resignation established a return to normal feelings she ate and grew stronger she slept and was refreshed  the caravan moved on about twentyfive miles a day at the next camp allie tried walking again to find her feet were bruised her legs cramped and action awkward and painful but she persevered and the tingling of revived circulation was like needles pricking her flesh she limped from one campfire to another and all the rough men had a kind word or question or glance for her allie did not believe they were all honest men durade had employed a large force and apparently he had taken on every one who applied miners hunters scouts and men of no hallmark except that of wildness composed the mixed caravan it spoke much for durade that they were under control allie well remembered hearing her mother say that he had a genius for drawing men to him and managing them  once during her walk when every one appeared busy a big fellow with hulking shoulders and bandaged head stepped beside her  girl he whispered if you want a knife slipped into durade tell him about me  allie recognized the whisper before she did the heated red face with its crooked nose and bold eyes and ugly mouth fresno he must have escaped from the sioux and fallen in with durade  allie shrunk from him durade compared with this kind of ruffian was a haven of refuge she passed on without a sign but fresno was safe from her this meeting made her aware of an impulse to run back to durade instinctively just as she had when a child he had ruined her mother he had meant to make a lure of her the daughter he had showed what his vengeance would be upon that mother just as he had showed allie her doom should she betray him but notwithstanding all this durade was not fresno nor like any of those men whose eyes seemed to burn her  she returned to the wagon and to the several women and men attached to it with the assurance that there were at least some good persons in that motley caravan crew  the women naturally curious and sympathetic questioned her in one way and another who was she what had happened to her where were her people or friends how had she ever escaped robbers and indians in that awful country was she really durades daughter  allie did not tell much about herself and finally she was left in peace  the lean old scout who had first seen allie as she staggered into the trail told her it was over a hundred miles to the first camp of the railroadbuilders  downhill all the way he concluded an well make it in a jiffy  nevertheless it took nearly all of four days to sight the camp of the tradersthe advanceguard of the great construction work  in those four days allie had recovered her bloom her health her strengtheverything except the wonderful assurance which had been hers durade had spoken daily with her and had been kind watchful like a guardian  it was with a curious thrill that allie gazed around as she rode into the construction camphorses and men and implements all following the line of neales work could neale be there if so how dead was her heart to his nearness  the tents of the workers some new and white others soiled and ragged stretched everywhere large tents belched smoke and resounded with the ring of hammers on anvil soldiers stood on guard men redshirted and blueshirted swarmed as thick as ants in a wide hollow a long line of horses in double row heads together pulled hay from a rack as long as the line and they pulled and snorted and bit at one another a strong smell of hay and burning wood mingled with the odor of hot coffee and steaming beans fires blazed on all sides under another huge tent or many tents without walls stretched wooden tables and benches on the scant sage and rocks and brush and everywhere upon the tents lay in a myriad of colors and varieties the lately washed clothes of the toilers and through the wide street of the camp clattered teams and swearing teamsters dragging plows with clanking chains and huge scoops turned upside down bordering the camp running east as far as eye could see stretched a high flat yellow lane with the earth hollowed away from it so that it stood higher than the level plainand this was the work of the graders the roadbed of the union pacific railroad the u p trail  this camp appeared to be durades destination his caravan rode through and halted on the outskirts of the far side preparations began for what allie concluded was to be a permanent halt at once began a significant disintegration of durades party one by one the scouts received payment from their employer and with horse and pack disappeared toward the camp the lean old fellow who had taken kindly interest in allie looked in at the opening of the canvas over her wagon and wishing her luck bade her goodby the women likewise said goodby informing her that they were going on home not one man among those left would allie have trusted  during the hurried settling of camp durade came to allie  allie he said you dont have to keep cooped up in there unless i tell you but dont talk to any oneand dont go that way  he pointed toward the humming camp that place beats any golddiggings i ever saw he concluded  the tall scant sage afforded allie some little seclusion and she walked there until durade called her to supper she ate alone on a wagonseat and when twilight fell she climbed into her wagon grateful that it was high off the ground and so inclosed her from all except sound  darkness came the fire died down the low voices of durade and his men and of callers who visited them flowed continuously  then presently there arose a strange murmur unlike any sound allie had ever heard it swelled into a low distant roar she was curious about it peeping out of her wagoncover she saw where the darkness flared to yellow with a line of lightstorches or lanterns or fires crossing and recrossing these lights were black objects in twos and threes and dozens and from this direction floated the strange low roar suddenly she realized it was the life of the camp hundreds and thousands of men were there together and as the night advanced the low roar rose and fell and lulled away to come againstrange sad hideous mirthful for a long time allie could not sleep  next morning durade called her when she unlaced the canvas flaps it was to see the sun high and to hear the bustle of work all about her  durade brought her breakfast and gave her instructions while he was about in the daytime she might come out and do what she could to amuse herself but when he was absent or at night she must be in her wagontent laced in and she was not to answer any call she would be guarded by stitt one of his men a deaf mute faithful to his interests and who had orders to handle her roughly should she disobey allie would not have been inclined to mutiny even without the fear and abhorrence she felt of this ugly and deformed mute  that day durade caused to be erected tents canopies tables benches and last a larger tent into which the tables and benches were carried fresno worked hard as did all the men except stitt who had nothing to do but watch allies wagon wearily the time passed for her how many days must she spend thus watching idly because there was nothing else to do still back in her consciousness there was a vague and growing thought sooner or later neale would appear in the flesh as he now came to her in her dreams  that night allie peeping out saw by the fire and torchlight a multitude of men drawn to durades large tent mexicans negroes irishmenall kinds of men passed loud and profane careless and reckless quarrelsome and loquacious soon there arose in her ears the longforgotten but now familiar sounds of a gamblinghell in full blast the rolling rattle of the wheel sharp strident and keen intermingled with the strange rich false clink of gold  it needed only a few days and nights for allie lee to divine durades retrogression before this he had been a gambler for the sake of gambling even a sportsman in his evil way now he seemed possessed of an unscrupulous intent a strange cold devouring passion to get gold and more goldalways more gold allie divined evidence of this saw it heard it the man had struck the descent and he was all the more dangerous for his lapse from his former standards poor as they had been  not a week had elapsed before the gamblinghell roared all night allie got most of her sleep during the day she tried to shut out what sound she could and tried to be deaf to the rest but she had to hear the angry brawls pistolshots and shrill cries yes and the trample of heavy boots as men dragged a dead gamester out to the ditch  day was a relief a blessing allie was frequently cooped up in her narrow canvascovered wagon but she saw from there the life of the grading camp  there were various bossesthe boarding boss who fed the laborers the stable boss who had charge of the teams the grading boss who ruled the diggers and scrapers and the timekeeper boss who kept track of the work of all  in the early morning a horde of hungry men stampeded the boardingtents where the cooks and waiters made mad haste to satisfy loud and merry demands at sunset the same horde dropped in dirty and hot and lame and fought for seats while others waited for their turn  out on the level plain stretched the hundreds of teams moving on and returning the drivers shouting the horses bending the hot sun glared the wind whipped up the dust the laborers speeded up to the shout of the boss and ever westward crept the low level yellow bank of sand and gravelthe roadbed of the first transcontinental railway  thus the daytime had its turmoil too but this last was splendid like the toil of heroes united to gain some common end and the army of soldiers waited ever keeneyed for the skulking sioux  mull the boss of the camp became a friend of durades the wily spaniard could draw to him any class of men this mull had been a driver of truckhorses in new york and now he was a driver of men  he was huge like a bull heavylipped and redcheeked hairy and coarse with big sunken eyes a brutea caveman he drank he gambled he was at once a bully and a pirate responsible to no one but his contractor he hated the contractor and he hated his job he was great in his place brutal with fist and foot a gleaner of results from hard men at a hard time  he won gold from durade or as fresno guffawed to a comrade he had been allowed to win it durade picked his man he had big schemes and he needed mull  benton was durades objective pointbenton the great and growing campcity where gold and blood were spilled in the dusty streets and life roared like a blast from hell  all that allie heard of benton increased her dread and at last she determined that she would run any risk rather than be taken there and so one night as soon as it grew dark she slipped out of the wagon and under cover of darkness made her escape     15  the building of the u p r as it advanced westward caused many camps and towns to spring up and flourish like mushrooms in a single night and trains were run as far as the rails were laid  therefore strange towns and communities were born like to nothing that the world had ever seen before  warren neale could not get away from the fascination of the work and life even though he had lost all his ambition and was now nothing more than an ordinary engineer insignificant and idle he began to drink and gamble in north platte more in a bitter defiance to fate than from any real desire then with larry king he drifted out to kearney  at kearney larry got into troublecharacteristic trouble in a quarrel with a construction boss named smith larry accused smith of being the crooked tool of the crooked commissioners who had forced neale to quit his job smith grew hot and profane the cowboy promptly slapped his face then smith like the fool he was went after his gun he never got it out  it distressed neale greatly that larry had shot up a manand a railroad man at that no matter what larry said neale knew the shooting was on his account this deed made the cowboy a marked man it changed him also toward neale inasmuch as that he saw his wildness was making small neales chances of returning to work larry never ceased importuning neale to go back to his job after shooting smith the cowboy made one more eloquent appeal to neale and then left for cheyenne neale followed him  cheyenne was just sobering up after its brief and tempestuous reign as headquarters town and though depleted and thin it was now making a bid for permanency but the sting and wildness of life had departed with the construction operations and now benton had become the hub of the railway universe  neale boarded a train for benton and watched with bitterness the familiar landmarks he had learned to know so well while surveying the line he was no longer connected with the great projectno more a necessary part of the great movement  beyond medicine bow the grass and the green failed and the immense train of freightcars and passengercoaches loaded to capacity clattered on into arid country gray and red the drab and fiery colors of the desert lent the ridges characterforbidding and barren  from a car window neale got his first glimpse of the wonderful terminus city and for once his old thrills returned he recalled the distanceseven hundredno six hundred and ninetyeight miles from omaha so far westward was benton  it lay in the heart of barrenness alkali and desolation on the face of the windy desert alive with dustdevils sweeping along yellow and funnelshapeda huge blockedout town and set where no town could ever live benton was prey for sun wind dust drought and the wind was terribly and insupportably cold no sage no cedars no grass not even a cactusbush nothing green or living to relieve the eye which swept across the gray and the white through the dust to the distant bare and desolate hills of drab  the hell that was reported to abide at benton was in harmony with its setting  the immense train clattered and jolted to a stop a roar of wind a cloud of powdery dust a discordant and unceasing din of voices came through the open windows of the car the heterogeneous mass of humanity with which neale had traveled jostled out struggling with packs and bags  neale carrying his bag stepped off into half a foot of dust he saw a disintegrated crowd of travelers that had just arrived and of travelers ready to departsoldiers indians mexicans negroes loafers merchants tradesmen laborers an everchanging and everremarkable spectacle of humanity he saw stagecoaches with hawkers bawling for passengers bound to salt lake ogden montana idaho he saw a wide white streetwhite with dust where it was not thronged with moving men and women and lined by tents and canvas houses and clapboard structures together with the strangest conglomeration of painted and printed signs that ever advertised anything in the world  a woman well clad young not uncomely but with hungry eyes like those of a hawk accosted neale he drew away in the din he had not heard what she said a boy likewise spoke to him a greaser tried to take his luggage a man jostling him felt of his pocket and as neale walked on he was leered at importuned jolted accosted and all but mobbed  so this was benton  a pistolshot pierced the din some one shouted a wave of the crowd indicated commotion somewhere and then the action and noise went on precisely as before neale crossed five intersecting streets evidently the wide street he was on must be the main one  in that walk of five blocks he saw thousands of persons but they were not the soldiers who protected the line nor the laborers who made the road these were the travelers the business people the stragglers the nondescripts the parasites the criminals the desperadoes and the idlersall who must by hook or crook live off the builders  neale was conscious of a sudden exhilaration the spirit was still in him after all his defeated ambition counted for nothing in the great sum of this work how many had failed he thought of the nameless graves already dotting the slopes along the line and already forgotten it would be something to live through the heyday of benton  under a sign hotel he entered a door in a clapboard house the place was as crude as an unfinished barn paying in advance for lodgings he went to the room shown hima stall with a door and a bar a cot and a bench a bowl and a pitcher through cracks he could see out over an uneven stretch of tents and houses toward the edge of town stood a long string of small tents and several huge ones which might have been the soldiers quarters  neale went out in search of a meal and entered the first restaurant it was merely a canvas house stretched over poles with compartments at the back high wooden benches served as tables low benches as seats the floor was sand at one table sat a mexican an irishman and a negro the irishman was drunk the negro came to wait on neale and receiving an order went to the kitchen the irishman sidled over to neale  say did yez hear about casey he inquired in very friendly fashion  no i didnt replied neale he remembered casey the flagman but probably there were many caseys in that camp  there wus a foight out on the line yisteddy went on the fellow an the dom redskins chased the gang to the trooptrain phwat do you think a bullet knocked caseys pipe out of his mouth as he wus runnin an bgorra casey sthopped fer it an wus all shot up  is he dead inquired neale  not yit no bullets cant kill casey  was his pipe a short black one  it wus thot  and did casey have it everlastingly in his mouth  he shlept in it  neale knew that particular casey and he examined this loquacious irishman more closely he recognized him as pat shane one of the trio he had known during the survey in the hills two years ago the recognition was like a stab to neale memory of the wyoming hillsof the lost allie leecut him to the quick shane had aged greatly there were scars on his face that neale had not seen before  mister dont i know yez leered shane studying neale with bleary eyes  neale did not care to be remembered the waiter brought his dinner which turned out to be a poor one at a high price after eating neale went out and began to saunter along the walk the sun had set and the wind had gone down there was no flying dust the street was again crowded with men but nothing like it had been after the arrival of the train no one paid much attention to neale on that walk he counted nineteen saloons and probably some of the larger places were of like nature but not so wide open to the casual glance  neale strolled through the town from end to end and across the railroad outside the limits to a high bank where he sat down the desert was beautiful away to the west with its dull mottled hues backed by gold and purple with its sweep and heave and notched horizon near at hand it seemed drab and bare he watched a long train of flat and box cars come in and saw that every car swarmed with soldiers and laborers the train discharged its load of thousands and steamed back for more  twilight fell all hours were difficult for neale but twilight was the most unendurable for it had been the hour allie lee loved best and during which she and neale had walked hand in hand along the brook back there in the lovely and beautiful valley in the hills neale could not sit still long he could not rest nor sleep well nor work nor indeed be of any use to himself or to any one and all because he was haunted and driven by the memory of allie lee and at such quiet hours as this in the midst of the turmoil he had sought for weeks a sadness filled his soul and an eternal remorse the love that had changed him and the life that had failed him seemed utterly misrelated  to and fro he paced on the bare ridge while twilight shadowed a star twinkled in the west a night wind began to seep the sand the desert vast hidden mysterious yet so free and untrammeled darkened  lights began to flash up along the streets of benton and presently neale became aware of a low and mounting hum like a first stir of angry bees  the loud and challenging strains of a band drew neale toward the center of the main street where men were pouring into a big tent  he halted outside and watched this strident businesslike quickstep music and the sight of the men and women attracted thereby made neale realize that benton had arisen in a day and would die out in a night its life would be swift vile and deadly  when the band ceased a sudden roar came from inside the big tent a commingling of the rough voices of men and the humming of wheels the clinking of glasses and gold the rattling of dice the hoarse call of a dealer the shuffling of feeta roar pierced now and then by the shrill vacant soundless laugh of a woman  it was that last sound which almost turned neale away from the door he shunned women but this place fascinated him he went in under the flaming lamps  the place was crowdeda huge tent stretched over a framework of wood and it was full of people din smoke movement the floor was good planking covered with sand walking was possible only round the narrow aisles between groups at tables  neales sauntering brought him to the bar it had to him a familiar look and afterward he learned that it had been brought complete from st louis where he had seen it in a saloon it seemed a huge glittering magnificent monstrosity in that coarse bare setting wide mirrors glistening bottles paintings of nude women row after row of polished glasses a brawny villainous barkeeper with three attendants all working fast a line of rough hoarse men five deep before the counterall these things constituted a scene that had the aspects of a city and yet was redolent with an atmosphere no city ever knew the drinkers were not all rough men there were elegant blackhatted frockcoated men of leisure in that linenot directors and commissioners and traveling guests of the u p r but gentlemen of chance gamblers  the band now began a different strain of dance music neale slowly worked his way around at the end of the big tent a wide door opened into another big rooma dancehall full of dancers  neale had seen nothing like this in the other construction camps  a ball was in progress just now it was merry excited lively neale got inside and behind the row of crowded benches he stood up against a post to watch probably twohundred people were in the hall most of them sitting how singular it struck neale to see goodlooking barearmed and barenecked young women dancing there and dancing well there were other womenpainted holloweyedsad wrecks of womanhood the male dancers were young men as years counted mostly unfamiliar with the rhythmic motion of feet to a tune and they bore the rough stamp of soldiers and laborers but there were others as there had been before the bar who wore their clothes differently who had a different poise and swingyoung men like neale whose earlier years had known some of the graces of society they did not belong there the young women did not belong there the place seemed unreal this was a merry scene apparently with little sign at that moment of what it actually meant neale sensed its undercurrent  he left the dancehall of the gambling games he liked best both to watch and to play poker it had interest for him the winning or losing of money was not of great moment poker was not all chance or luck such as the roll of a ball the turn of a card or the facing up of dice presently he became one of an interested group round a table watching four men play poker  one a gambler in black immaculate in contrast to his companions had a white hard expressionless face with eyes of steel and thin lips his hands were wonderful probably they never saw the sunlight certainly no labor they were as swift as light too swift for the glance of an eye but when he dealt the cards he was slow careful deliberate the stakes were gold and the largest heap lay in front of him one of his opponents was a giant of a fellow young with hulking shoulders heated face and broken nosea desperado if neale ever saw one the other two players called this strapping brute fresno the little man with a sallow face like a wolf was evidently too intent on the game to look up he appeared to be losing beside his small pile of gold stood an empty tumbler the other and last player was a huge bullnecked man whom neale had seen before it was difficult to place him but after studying the red cheeks and heavy drooping mustache and hearing the loud voice he recognized him as a boss of gradersa head boss presently the sallowfaced player called him mull and then neale remembered him well  several of the watchers round this table lounged away leaving a better vantageplace for neale  may i sit in the game he inquired during a deal  certainly replied the gambler  naw we gotta nough said the sallow man and he glanced from neale to the gambler as if he suspected them gamblers often worked in pairs  i just came to benton added neale reading the mans thought i never saw the gentleman in black before  what th hell rumbled mull grabbing up his cards  fresno leered  the gambler leaned back and his swift white hands flashed neale believed he had a derringer up each sleeve a wrong word now would precipitate a fight  excuse me said neale hastily i dont want to make trouble i just said i never saw this gentleman before  nor i him returned the gambler courteously my name is place hough and my word is not doubted  neale had heard of this famous mississippi river gambler so evidently had the other three players the game proceeded and when it came to houghs deal mull bet hard and lost all his big hairy hands shook he looked at fresno and the other fellow but not at hough  im broke he said gruffly and got up from the bench  he strode past hough and behind him then as if suddenly instinctively answering to fury he whipped out a gun  neale just as instinctively grasped the rising hand  hold on there he called would you shoot a man in the back  and neale whose grip was powerful caused the other to drop the gun neale kicked it aside fresno got up  whars your head mull he growled git out of this  attention had been attracted to mull some one picked up the gun the sallowfaced man rose holding out his hand for it hough did not even turn around  i was goin to hold him up said mull he glared fiercely at neale wrenched his hand free and with his comrades disappeared in the crowd  the gambler rose and shook down his sleeves the action convinced neale that he had held a little gun in each hand i saw him draw he said you saved his life nevertheless i appreciate your action my name is place hough will you drink with me  sure my name is neale  they approached the bar and drank together  a railroad man i take it asked hough  i was im footloose now  a fleeting smile crossed the gamblers face benton is bad enough without you being footloose  all these camps are tough replied neale  i was in north platte kearney cheyenne and medicine bow during their rise said hough they were tough but they were not benton and the next camp west which will be the lastit will be roaring hell what will be its name  why is benton worse inquired neale  the big work is well under way now with a tremendous push from behind there are three men for every mans work that lays off two men each day drunk or dead the place is wildfar off theres goldhundreds of thousands of dollars in gold dumped off the trains benton has had one payday that day was the sight of my life then there are women  i saw a few in the dancehall replied neale  then you havent looked in at stantons  whos he  stanton is not a man replied hough  neale glanced inquiringly over his glass  beauty stanton they call her went on hough i saw her in new orleans years ago when she was a very young womannotorious then she had the beauty and she led the life did beauty stanton  neale made no comment and hough turning to pay for the drinks was accosted by several men they wanted to play poker  gentlemen i hate to take your money he said but i never refuse to sit in a game neale will you join us  they found a table just vacated neale took two of the three strangers to be prosperous merchants or ranchers from the missouri country the third was a gambler by profession neale found himself in unusually sharp company he did not have a great deal of money so in order to keep clearheaded he did not drink and he began to win not by reason of excellent judgment but because he was lucky he had good cards all the time and part of the time very strong ones it struck him presently that these remarkable hands came during houghs deal and he wondered if the gambler was deliberately manipulating the cards to his advantage at any rate he won hundreds of dollars  mr neale do you always hold such cards asked one of the men  why sure replied neale he could not help being excited and elated  well he cant be beat said the other  lucky at cards unlucky in love remarked the third of the trio i pass  hough was looking straight at neale when this last remark was made and neale suddenly lost his smile his flush the gambler dropped his glance  play the game and dont get personal in your remarks he said this is poker  neale continued to win but his excitement did not return nor his elation a random word from a strange man had power to sting him unlucky in love alas what was luck goldanything to him any more  by the time the game was ended neale felt a friendly interest in hough that was difficult to define or explain and the conviction gained upon him that the gambler had deliberately dealt him those remarkable cards  lets see said hough consulting his watch twelve oclock stantons will be humming well go in  neale did not want to show his reluctance yet he did hot know just what to say after all he was drifting so he went  it seemed that all the visitors who had been in the gamblinghall had gravitated to this other dancehall the entrance appeared to be through a hotel at least neale saw the hotel sign the building was not made of canvas but painted wood in sections like the scenes of a stage men were coming and going the hum of music and gaiety came from the rear there were rugs pictures chairs this place whatever its nature made pretensions neale did not see any bar  they entered a big room full of people apparently doing nothing from the opposite side where the dancehall opened came a hum that seemed at once music and discordance gaiety and wildness with a strange carrying undertone raw and violent  hough led neale across the room to where he could look into the dancehall  neale saw a mad colorful flash and whirl of dancers  hough whispered in neales ear stanton throws the drunks out of here  no it appeared the dancers were not drunk with liquor but there was evidence of other drunkenness than that of the bottle the floor was crowded looking at the mass neale could only see whirling heated faces white clinging arms forms swaying round and round a wild rhythm without grace a dance in which music played no real part where men and women were lost neale had never seen a sight like that he was stunned there were no souls here only beasts of men and women for whom there was no name if death stalked in that camp as hough had intimated and hell was there then the two could not meet too soon  if the mass and the spirit and the sense of the scene dismayed neale the living beings the creatures the womenfor the men were beyond himconfounded him with pity consternation and stinging regret he had loved two womenhis mother and allieso well that he ought to love all women because they were of the same sex yet how impossible had these creatures any sex yet they wereat least many wereyoung gay pretty wild full of life they had swift suppleness smiles flashing eyes a look at once intent and yet vacant but few onlookers would have noticed that the eyes for which the dance was meant saw the mad whirl the bare flesh the brazen glances the close embrace  the music ended the dancers stopped the shuffling ceased there were no seats unoccupied so the dancers walked around or formed in groups  well i see ruby has spotted you observed hough  neale did not gather exactly what the gambler meant yet he associated the remark with a girl dressed in red who had paused at the door with others and looked directly at neale at that moment some one engaged houghs attention  the girl would have been striking in any company neale thought her neither beautiful nor pretty but he kept on looking her arms were bare her dress cut very low her face offered vivid contrast to the carmine on her lips it was a round soft face with narrow eyes dark seductive bold she tilted her head to one side and suddenly smiled at neale it startled him it was a smile with the shock of a bullet it held neale so that when she crossed to him he could not move he felt rather than saw hough return to his side the girl took hold of the lapels of neales coat she looked up her eyes were dark with what seemed red shadows deep in them she had white teeth the carmined lips curled in a smilea smile impossible to believe of youth and sweetness that disclosed a dimple in her cheek she was pretty she was holding him pulling him a little toward her  i like you she exclaimed  the suddenness of the incident the impossibility of what was happening made neale dumb he felt her saw her as he were in a dream her face possessed a peculiar fascination the sleepy seductive eyes the provoking halfsmile teasing alluring the red lips full and young through the carmine paint all of her seemed to breathe a different kind of a power than he had ever before experiencedunspiritual elemental strong as some heady wine she represented youth health beauty terribly linked with evil wisdom and a corrupt and irresistible power possessing a base and mysterious affinity for man  the breath and the charm and the pestilence of her passed over neale like fire  sweetheart will you dance with me she asked with her head tilted to one side and her halfopen veiled eyes on his  no replied neale he put her from him gently but coldly  she showed slow surprise why not cant you dance you dont look like a gawk  yes i can dance replied neale  then will you dance with me she retorted and red spots showed through the white on her cheeks  i told you no replied neale  his reply transported her into a sudden fury she swung her hand viciously hough caught it saving neale from a sounding slap in the face  ruby dont lose your temper remonstrated the gambler  he insulted me she cried passionately  he did not ruby youre spoiled  spoiledhell didnt he look at me flirt with me thats why i asked him to dance then he insulted me ill make cordy shoot him up for it  no you wont replied hough and he pulled her toward his companion a tall woman with golden hair stanton shut her up  the woman addressed spoke a few words in rubys ear then the girl flounced away but she spoke with withering scorn to neale  what in hell did you come in here for you big handsome stiff  with that she was lost amid her mirthful companions  hough turned to neale the girls a favorite you ruffled her vanity you see thats benton if you had happened to be alone you would have had gunplay be careful after this  but i didnt flirt with her protested neale i only looked at hercuriously of course and i said i wouldnt dance  hough laughed youre young in benton neale let me introduce to you the lady who saved you from some inconvenience miss stantonmr neale  and that was how neale met beauty stanton it seemed she had done him a service he thanked her neales manner with women was courteous and deferential it showed strangely here by contrast the stanton woman was superb not more than thirty years old with a face that must have been lovely once and held the haunting ghost of beauty still her hair was dead gold her eyes were large and blue with dark circles under them and her features had a clearcut classic regularity  wheres ancliffe asked hough addressing stanton she pointed and hough left them  neale youre new here affirmed the woman rather curiously  didnt i look like it i cant forget what that girl said replied neale  tell me  she asked me what in the hell i came here for and she called me  oh i heard what ruby called you its a wonder it wasnt worse she can swear like a trooper the men are mad over ruby itd be just like her to fall in love with you for snubbing her  i hope she doesnt replied neale constrainedly  may i askwhat did you come here for  you mean here to your dancehall why hough brought me i met him we played cards and  no i mean what brought you to benton  i just drifted here im looking for aa lost friend said neale  no work but youre no spiker or capper or boss i know that sort and i can spot a gambler a mile the whole world meets out here in benton but not many young men like you wander into my place  like me how so  the men here are wolves on the scent for flesh like bandits on the trail of gold but youyoure like my friend ancliffe  who is he asked neale politely  who is he god only knows but hes an englishman and a gentleman its a pity men like ancliffe and you drift out here  she spoke seriously she had the accent and manner of breeding  why miss stanton inquired neale he was finding another woman here and it was interesting to him  because it means wasted life you dont work youre not crooked you cant do any good and only a knife in the back or a bullet from some drunken bullys gun awaits you  that isnt a very hopeful outlook ill admit replied neale thoughtfully  at this point hough returned with a pale slender man whose clothes and gait were not american he introduced him as ancliffe neale felt another accession of interest benton might be hell but he was meeting new types of men and women ancliffe was fair he had a handsome face that held a story and tired blue eyes that looked out upon the world wearily and mildly without curiosity and without hope an englishman of broken fortunes  just arrived eh he said to neale rather jolly here dont you think  a fellows not going to stagnate in benton replied neale  not while hes alive interposed stanton  miss stanton that idea seems to persist with youthe brevity of life said neale smiling what are the average days for a mortal in this bloody benton  days you mean hours i call the night blessed that some one is not dragged out of my place and i dont sell drinks ive saved ancliffes life nine times i know of either he hasnt any sense or he wants to get killed  i assure you its the former said the englishman  but my friends im serious she returned earnestly this awful place is getting on my nerves mr neale here he would have had to face a gun already but for me  miss stanton i appreciate your kindness replied neale but it doesnt follow that if i had to face a gun id be sure to go down  you can throw a gun questioned hough  i had a cowboy gunthrower for a partner for years out on the surveying of the road hes the friend i mentioned  boy youre courting death exclaimed stanton  then the music started up again conversation was scarcely worth while during the dancing neale watched as before twice as he gazed at the whirling couples he caught the eyes of the girl ruby bent upon him they were expressive of pique resentment curiosity neale did not look that way any more besides his attention was drawn elsewhere hough yelled in his ear to watch the fun a fight had started a strapping fellow wearing a belt containing gun and bowieknife had jumped upon a table just as the music stopped he was drunk he looked like a young workman ambitious to be a desperado  ladies an gennelmen he bawled i beenrequested t sing  yells and hoots answered him he glared ferociously around trying to pick out one of his insulters trouble was brewing something was thrown at him from behind and it struck him he wheeled unsteady upon his feet then several men bareheaded and evidently attendants of the hall made a rush for him the table was upset the wouldbe singer went down in a heap and he was pounced upon handled like a sack and thrown out the crowd roared its glee  the worst of that is those fellows always come back drunk and ugly said stanton then we all begin to run or dodge  your men didnt lose time with that rowdy remarked neale  ive hired all kinds of men to keep order she replied laborers exsheriffs gunmen bad men the irish are the best on the job but they wont stick ive got eight men here now and they are a tough lot im scared to death of them i believe they rob my guests but what can i do without some aid i couldnt run the place itll be the death of me  neale did not doubt that a shadow surely hovered over this strange woman but he was surprised at the seriousness with which she spoke evidently she tried to preserve order to avert fights and bloodshed so that licentiousness could go on unrestrained neale believed they must go hand in hand he did not see how it would be possible for a place like this to last long it could not the life of the place brought out the worst in men it created opportunities neale watched them pass seeing the truth in the red eyes the heavy lids the open mouths the look and gait and gesture a wild frenzy had fastened upon their minds he found an added curiosity in studying the faces of ancliffe and hough the englishman had run his race any place would suit him for the end neale saw this and marveled at the mans ease and grace and amiability he reminded neale of larry red kingthe same cool easy careless air ancliffe would die game hough was not affected by this sort of debauched life any more than he would have been by any other kind he preyed on men he looked on with cold gray expressionless face possibly he too would find an end in benton sooner or later  these reflections passing swiftly made neale think of himself what was true for others must be true for him the presence of any of these personsof hough and ancliffe of himself in beauty stantons gaudy resort was sad proof of a disordered life  some one touched him interrupted his thought  youve had trouble asked stanton who had turned from the others  yes he said  well weve all had that you seem young to me  hough turned to speak to stanton rubys going to make trouble  no exclaimed the woman with eyes lighting  neale then saw that the girl ruby with a short boldlooking fellow who packed a gun and several companions of both sexes had come in from the dancehall and had taken up a position near him stanton went over to them she drew ruby aside and talked to her the girl showed none of the passion that had marked her manner a little while before presently stanton returned  rubys got over her temper she said with evident relief to neale she asked me to say that she apologized its just what i told you shell fall madly in love with you for what you did shes of good family neale she has a sister she talks much of and a home she could go back to if she wasnt ashamed  that so replied neale thoughtfully let me talk to her  at a slight sign from stanton ruby joined the group  ruby youve already introduced yourself to this gentleman but not so nicely as you might have done said beauty  im sorry replied ruby a certain wistfulness showed in her low tones  maybe i was rude said neale i didnt intend to be i couldnt dance with any one hereor anywhere then he spoke to her in a lower tone but ill tell you what i will do i won a thousand dollars tonight ill give you half of it if youll go home  the girl shrank as if she had received a stab then she stiffened  why dont you go home she retorted were all going to hell out here and the gamest will get there soonest  she glared at neale an instant whitefaced and hard and then rejoining her companions she led them away  beauty stanton seemed to have received something of the check that had changed the girl ruby  gentlemen you are my only friends in benton but these are business hours  presently she leaned toward neale and whispered to him boy youre courting death some onesomething has hurt you but youre young go home  then she bade him good night and left the group  he looked on in silence after that and presently when ancliffe departed he was glad to follow hough into the street there the same confusion held a loud throng hurried by as if bent on cramming into a few hours the life that would not last long  neale was interested to inquire more about ancliffe and the gambler replied that the englishman had come from no one knew where that he did not go to extremes in drinking or betting that evidently he had become attached to beauty stanton that surely he must be a ruined man of class who had left all behind him and had become like so many out therea leaf in the storm  stanton took to you went on hough i saw that and poor ruby ill tell you neale im sorry for some of these women  who wouldnt be  women of this class are strange to you neale but ive mixed with them for years of course benton sets a pace no man ever saw before still even the hardest and vilest of these scullions sometimes shows an amazing streak of good and women like ruby and beauty stanton whose early surroundings must have been refinedthey are beyond understanding they will cut your heart out for a slight and sacrifice their lives for sake of a courteous word it was your manner that cut ruby and won beauty stanton they meet with neither coldness nor courtesy out here it must be bitter as gall for a woman like stanton to be treated as you treated herwith respect yet see how it got her  i didnt see anything in particular replied neale  you were too excited and disgusted with the whole scene said hough as they reached the roaring lights of the gamblinghell will you go in and play again there are always open games  no i guess notunless you think  boy i think nothing except that i liked your company and that i owed you a service good night  neale walked to his lodgings tired and thoughtful and moody behind him the roar lulled and swelled it was three oclock in the morning he wondered when these nighthawks slept he wondered where larry was as for himself he found slumber not easily gained dawn was lighting the east when he at last fell asleep     16  neale slept until late the next day and awoke with the pang that a new day always gave him now he arose slowly gloomily with the hateful consciousness that he had nothing to do he had wanted to be alone and now loneliness was bad for him  if i were half a man id get out of here quick he muttered in scorn and he thought of the broken englishman serene and at ease settled with himself and he thought of the girl ruby who had flung the taunt at him not for a long time would he forget that certainly this abandoned girl was not a coward she was lost but she was magnificent  i guess ill leave benton he soliloquized but the place the wildness fascinated him no i guess ill stay  it angered him that he was ashamed of himself he was a victim of many moods and underneath every one of them was the steady ache the dull pain the pang in his breast deep in the bone  as he left his lodgings he heard the whistle of a train the scene down the street was similar to the one which had greeted him the day before only the dust was not blowing so thickly he went into a hotel for his meal and fared better watching the hurry and scurry of men after he had finished he strolled toward the station  benton had two trains each day now this one just in was long and loaded to its utmost capacity neale noticed an indian arrow sticking fast over a window of one of the coaches there were flat cars loaded with sections of houses and boxcars full of furniture benton was growing every day at least a thousand persons got off that train adding to the dusty jostling melee  suddenly neale came face to face with larry king  red he yelled and made at the cowboy  im shore glad to see you drawled larry what n hell busted loose round heah  neale drew larry out of the crowd he carried a small pack done up in a canvas covering  red your face looks like home to a man in a strange land declared neale where are your horses  larry looked less at his ease  wal i sold them  sold them those great horses oh red you didnt  hell it costs money to ride on this heah upr thet we built an i had no money  but what did you sell them for ii cared for those horses  will you keep quiet aboot my hosses  neale had never before seen the tinge of gray in that redbronze face  but i told you to straighten up  wal who hasnt retorted larry  you havent dont lie  if you put it thet way all right now whatre youall goin to do aboot it  ill lick you good declared neale hotly he was angry with larry but angrier with himself that he had been the cause of the cowboys loss of work and of his splendid horses  lick me ejaculated larry you mean beat me up  yes you deserve it  larry took him in earnest and seemed very much concerned neale could almost have laughed at the cowboys serious predicament  wal i reckon i aint much of a fighter with my fists said larry soberly so come an get it over  oh damn you red i wouldnt lay a hand on you and i am sick im so glad to see you i thought you got here ahead of me  neales voice grew full and trembling  larry became confused his red face grew redder and the keen blue flash of his eyes softened  wal i heerd what a tough place this heah benton wasso i jest come  larry ended this speech lamely but the way he hitched at his belt was conclusive  wal by gawd look whos heah he suddenly exclaimed  neale wheeled with a start he saw a scout in buckskin a tall form with the stride of a mountaineer strangely familiar  slingerland he cried  the trapper bounded at them his tanned face glowing his gray eyes glad  boys its come at last i knowed id run into you some day he said and he gripped them with horny hands  neale tried to speak but a terrible cramp in his throat choked him he appealed with his hands to slingerland the trapper lost his smile and the iron set returned to his features  larry choked over his utterance allie what aboother  boys its broke me down replied slingerland hoarsely i swear to you i never left allie alone fer a yearan thenthe fust timewhen she made me goi come back an finds the cabin burnt shes gone gone no redskin job that damned riffraff out of californy i tracked em then a hell of a storm comes up no tracks left alls lost an i goes back to my traps in the mountains  whatbecameofher whispered neale  slingerland looked away from him  son you remember allie shed die quick wouldnt she larry  shore thet girlcouldnthev lived a day replied larry thickly  neale plunged blindly away from his friends then the torture in his breast seemed to burst the sobs came heavy racking he sank upon a box and bowed his head there larry and slingerland found him  the cowboy looked down with helpless pain aw parddont take itso hard he implored  but he knew and slingerland knew that sympathy could do no good here there was no hope no help neale was stricken they stood there the elder man looking all the sadness and inevitableness of that wild life and the younger the cowboy slowly changing to iron  slingerland youall said some californy outfit got allie he queried  im sure an sartin replied the trapper them days there wasnt any travelin west so early after winter you recollect them four bandits as rode in on us one day they was from californy  wal ill be lookin fer men with thet californy brand drawled king and in his slow easy cool speech there was a note deadly and terrible  neale slowly ceased his sobbing my nerves gone he said shakily  no it jest broke you all up to see slingerland an it shore did me too replied larry  its hard but slingerland could not finish his thought  slingerland im glad to see you even if it did cut me said neale more rationally im surprised too are you here with a load of pelts  no boys i hed to give up trappin i couldnt stand the lonelinessafterafter an now im killin buffalo meat for the soldiers an the construction gangs jest got in on thet train with a carload of fresh meat  buffalo meat echoed neale his mind wandered  son hows your work goin  neale shook his head  the cowboy answering for him said we kind of chucked the work slingerland  what are you hyar in benton doin nothin  shore thets the size of it  the trapper made a vehement gesture of disapproval and he bent a scrutinizing gaze upon neale  son youve not gone anan  yes replied neale throwing out his hands i quit i couldnt work i cant work i cant rest or stand still  a spasm of immense regret contracted the trappers face and larry king looking away over the sordid dusty passing throng cursed under his breath neale was the first to recover his composure  lets say no more whats done is done he said suppose you take us on one of your buffalohunts  slingerland grasped at straws wal now thet aint a bad idee i can use you he replied eagerly but its hard an dangerous work we git chased by redskins often an youd hev to ride i reckon neale youre good enough on a hoss but our cowboy friend hyar he cant ride as i recollect your old argyments  my job was hosses drawled larry  an besides youve got to shoot straight which reddy hasnt hed experience of went on slingerland with a broader smile  i seen you was packin a winchester all shiny an new replied larry shore im in fer anythin with ridin an shootin  neale and larry accepted the proposition then and there  youll need to buy rifles an shells thets all said slingerland ive hosses an outfit over at the workcamp an ive been huntin east of thar come on well go to a store thet trains goin back soon  wal i come in on thet train an now im leavin on it drawled larry shore is funny without even lookin over this heah benton  on the ride eastward slingerland inquired if neale and larry had ever gone back to the scene of the massacre of the caravan where horn had buried his gold  neale had absolutely forgotten the buried gold probably when he and larry had scoured the wild hills for trace of allie they had passed down the valley where the treasure had been hidden slingerland gave the same reason for his oversight they talked about the gold and planned when the railroad reached the foothills to go after it  both indians and buffalo were sighted from the train before the trio got to the next camp  i reckon i dont like thet declared slingerland i was friendly with the sioux but now thet ive come down hyar to kill off their buffalo fer the whites theyre agin me i know thet an i allus regarded them buffalo as injun property if it wasnt thet i seen this railroad means the end of the buffalo an the indians too id never hev done it thet ill swar  it was night when they reached their destination how quiet and dark after benton neale was glad to get there he wondered if he could conquer his unrest would he go on wandering again he doubted himself and dismissed the thought perhaps the companionship of his old friends and the anticipation of action would effect a change in him  neale and larry spent the night in slingerlands tent next morning the trapper was ready with horses at an early hour but owing to the presence of sioux in the vicinity it was thought best to wait for the worktrain and ride out on the plains under its escort  by and by the train with its few cars and half a hundred workmen was ready and the trapper and his comrades rode out alongside some few miles from camp the train halted at a place where stonework and filling awaited the laborers neale was again interested in spite of himself yet his love for that railroad was quite as hopeless as other things in his life  these laborers were picked men all soldiers and many irish they stacked their guns before taking up shovels and bars  dom me if it aint me ould frind neale exclaimed a familiar voice  and there stood casey with the same old grin the same old black pipe  neales first feeling of pleasure at seeing the old flagman was counteracted by one of dismay at the possibility of coming in contact with old acquaintances it would hurt him to meet general lodge or any of the engineers who had predicted a future for him  shane and mcdermott were also in this gang and they slouched forward  its thot gunthrowin cowboy as wuz onct goin to kill casey exclaimed mcdermott at sight of larry  neale during the few moments of reunion with his old comrades of the survey received a melancholy insight into himself and a clearer view of them the great railroad had gone on growing making men change he had been passed by he was no longer a factor along with many many other men he had retrograded the splendid spirit of the work had not gone from him but it had ceased to govern his actions he had ceased to grow but these uncouth irishmen they had changed in many ways they were the same slow loquacious quarreling trio as before but they showed the effect of toil of fight of growth under the great movement and its spiritthe thing which great minds had embodied and these laborers were no longer ordinary men something shone out of them neale saw it he felt an inexplicable littleness in their presence they had gone on he had been left they would toil and fight until they filled nameless graves he too would find a nameless grave he thought but he would not lie in it as one of these the moment was poignant for neale exceedingly bitter and revealing  slingerland was not long in sighting buffalo after making a careful survey of the rolling country for lurking indians he rode out with neale larry and two other menbrush and an irishman named patwho were to skin the buffalo the hunters killed and help load the meat into wagons which would follow  it aint no trick to kill buffalo slingerland was saying to his friends but i dont want old bulls an old cows killed an when youre ridin fast an the herd is bunched its hard to tell the difference you boys stick close to me an watch me first an keep one eye peeled fer injuns  slingerland approached the herd without alarming it until some little red calves on the outskirts of the herd became frightened then the herd lumbered off raising a cloud of dust the roar of hoofs was thunderous  ride yelled slingerland  not the least interesting sight to neale was larry riding away from them he was whacking the buffalo on the rumps with his bare hand before slingerland and neale got near enough to shoot  at the trappers first shot the herd stampeded thereafter it took fine riding to keep up to choose the level ground and to follow slingerlands orders neale got up in the thick of the rolling din and dust the pursuit liberated something fierce within him which gave him a measure of freedom from his constant pain all before spread the great bobbing herd the wind whistled the dust choked him the gravel stung his face the strong even action of his horse was exhilarating he lost track of larry but he stayed close to slingerland the trapper kept shooting at intervals neale saw the puffs of smoke but in the thundering din he could not hear a report it seemed impossible for him to select the kind of buffalo slingerland wanted shot neale could not tell one from the other he rode right upon their flying heels unable finally to restrain himself from shooting he let drive and saw a beast drop and roll over neale rode on  presently out of a lane in the dust he thought he saw slingerland pass he reined toward the side larry was riding furiously at him and slingerlands horse was stretched out heading straight away the trapper madly waved his arms neale spurred toward them something was amiss larrys face flashed in the sun he whirled his horse to take neales course and then he pointed  neale thrilled as he looked a few hundred rods in the rear rode a band of sioux coming swiftly a cloud of dust rose behind them they had no doubt been hiding in the vicinity of the grazing buffalo lying in wait  as neale closed in on larry he saw the cowboys keen glance measuring distance and speed  we shore got to ride was what larry apparently yelled though the sound of words drifted as a faint whisper to neale but the roar of buffalo hoofs was rapidly diminishing  then neale realized what it meant to keep close to the cowboy every moment larry turned round both to watch the indians and to have a glance at his comrade they began to gain on slingerland brush was riding for dear life off to the right and the irishman pat still farther in that direction was in the most perilous situation of all already the white skipping streaks of dust from bullets whipped up in front of him the next time neale looked back the sioux had split up some were riding hard after brush and pat the majority were pursuing the other three hunters cutting the while a little to the right for slingerland was working round toward the worktrain neale saw the smoke of the engine and then the train it seemed far away and he was sure the indians were gaining what incomparable riders they looked half naked dark gleaming low over their mustangs feathers and trappings flying in the winda wild and panicprovoking sight  dont ride so close yelled larry theyre spreadin  neale gathered that the indians were riding farther apart because they soon expected to be in range of bullets and larry wanted neale to ride farther from him for the identical reason  neale saw the first white puff of smoke from a rifle of the leader the bullet hit far behind more shots kept raising the dust the last time still a few yards short  gawd look yelled larry the devils hit pats hoss  neale saw the irishman go down with his horse plunge in the dust and then roll over and lie still  they got him he yelled at larry  ride thet hoss came back grimly and appealingly from the cowboy  neale rode as he had never before ridden fortunately his horse was fresh and fast and that balanced the driving the cowboy was giving his mount for a long distance they held their own with the sioux they had now gained a straightaway course for the worktrain so that with the sioux behind they had only to hold out for a few miles brush appeared as well off as they were slingerland led by perhaps a hundred feet far over to the left and he was wholly out of range  it took a very short time at that pace to cover a couple of miles and then the indians began to creep up closer and closer again they were shooting neale heard the reports and each one made him flinch in expectation of feeling the burn of a bullet brush was now turning to fire his rifle  neale bethought himself of his own winchester which he was carrying in his hand dropping the rein over the horn of his saddle he turned half round how close how red how fierce these sioux were he felt his hair rise stiff under his hat and at the same instant a hot wrath rushed over him madness to fight to give back blow for blow just then several of the indians fired he heard the sharp cracks then the spats of bullets striking the ground he saw the little streaks of dust in front of him then the whistle of lead that made him shoot in return his horse lunged forward almost throwing him and ran the faster for his fright neale heard larry begin to shoot it became a running duel now with the indians scattering wide riding low yelling like demons and keeping up a continuous volley they were well armed with white mens guns neale worked the lever of his rifle while he looked ahead for an instant to see where his horse was running then he wheeled quickly and took a snap shot at the nearest indian no more than three hundred yards distant now he saw where his bullet going wide struck up the dust it was desperately hard to shoot from the back of a scared horse neale did not notice that larrys shots were any more effective than his own he grew certain that the sioux were gaining faster now but the worktrain was not far away he saw the workmen on top of the cars waving their arms rougher ground though on this last stretch  larry was drawing ahead he had used all the shells in his rifle and now with hand and spur was goading his horse  suddenly neale heard the soft thud of lead striking flesh his horse leaped with a piercing snort of terror and neale thought he was going down but he recovered and went plunging on still swift and game though with uneven gait larry yelled his red face flashed back over his shoulder he saw something was wrong with neales horse and he pulled his own  save your own life yelled neale fiercely it enraged him to see the cowboy holding back to let him come up but he could not prevent it  hes hit shouted larry  yes but not badly shouted neale in reply spread out  the cowboy never swerved a foot he watched neales horse with keen sure eyes  hes breakin mebbe he cant last  bullets whistled all around neale now he heard them strike the stones on the ground and sing away he saw them streak through the scant grass he felt the tug at his shoulder where one cut through his coat stinging the skin that touch light as it was drove the panic out of him the strange darkness before his eyes hard to see through passed away he wheeled to shoot again and with deliberation he aimed as best he could yet he might as well have tried to hit flying birds he emptied the winchester  then hunching low in the saddle neale hung on slingerland was close to the train brush on his side appeared to be about out of danger the pursuit had narrowed down to neale and larry the anger and the grimness faded from neale he did not want to go plunging down in front of those lean wild mustangs to be ridden over and trampled and mutilated the thought sickened him the roar of pursuing hoofs grew distinct but neale did not look back  another roar broke on his earthe clamor of the irish soldierlaborers as they yelled and fired  pull him pull him came the piercing cry from larry  neale was about to ride his frantic horse straight into the worktrain desperately he hauled the horse up and leaped off larry was down waiting and his mount went plunging away bullets were pattering against the sides of the cars from which puffed streaks of flame and smoke  up wid yez lads sang out a cheery voice caseys grin and black pipe appeared over the rim of the car and his big hands reached down  one quick and straining effort and neale was up over the side to fall on the floor in a pile of sand and gravel all whirled dim round him for a second his heart labored he was wet and hot and shaking  shure yez aint hit now exclaimed casey  larrys nervous hands began to slide and press over neales quivering body  noimallsafe panted neale  the engine whistled shrilly as if in defiance of the indians and with a jerk and rattle the train started  neale recovered to find himself in a novel and thrilling situation the car was of a gondola type being merely a flatcar with sides about four feet high made of such thick oak planking that bullets did not penetrate it besides himself and larry there were half a dozen soldiers all kneeling at little portholes neale peeped over the rim in a long thinnedout line the sioux were circling round the train hiding on the off sides of their mustangs and shooting from these difficult positions they were going at full speed working in closer a bullet striking the rim of the car and showering splinters in neales face attested to the fact that the sioux were still to be feared even from a moving fort neale dropped back and reloading his rifle found a hole from which to shoot he emptied his magazine before he realized it but what with his trembling hands the jerking of the train and the swift motion of the indians he did not do any harm to the foe  suddenly with a jolt the train halted  blocked agin bgorra said casey calmly me pipes out sandy gimme a motch  the engine whistled two shrill blasts  whats that for asked neale quickly  thems for the men in the foist car to pile over the engine an remove obstruchtions from the track replied casey  neale dared to risk a peep over the top of the car the sioux were circling closer to the front of the train all along a halfdozen cars ahead of neale puffs of smoke and jets of flame shot out heavy volleys were being fired the attack of the savages seemed to be concentrating forward evidently to derail the engine or kill the engineer  casey pulled neale down risky fer yez he said use a porthole an foight  my shells are gone replied neale  he lay well down in the car then and listened to the uproar and watched the irish trio when the volleys and the fiendish yells mingled he could not hear anything else there were intervals however when the uproar lulled for a moment  casey got his black pipe well lit puffed a cloud of smoke and picked up his rifle  drill ye terriers drill he sang and shoved his weapon through a porthole he squinted over the breech  mac its the same bunch as attacked us day before yisteddy he observed  it shure aint replied mcdermott theres a million of thim today  he aimed his rifle as if following a moving object and fired  mac you git excited in a foight now i niver do an ive seen thot pinto hoss an thot dom redskin a lot of times ill kill him yit  casey kept squinting and aiming and then just as he pressed the trigger the train started with a sudden lurch  spiled me aim thot engineers savin of the sooz tribe drill ye terriers drill drill ye terriers drill shane i dont hear yez shootin  hown hell can i shoot whin me eye is full of blood demanded shane  neale then saw blood on shanes face he crawled quietly to the irishman  man are you shot let me see  jist a bullet hit me loike replied shane  neale found that a bullet perhaps glancing from the wood had cut a gash over shanes eye from which the blood poured shanes hands and face and shirt were crimson neale bound a scarf tightly over the wound  let me take the rifle now he said  thanks lad i aint hurted an hev casey make me loife miserable foriver not much hes a harrd mon thot casey  shane crouched back to his porthole with his bloody bandaged face and his bloody hands and just then the train stopped with a rattling crash  whin we git beyond thim ties as was scattered along here mebbe well go on in remarked mcdermott  mac yez looks on the gloomy side replied casey then quickly he aimed the shot i loike it better whin we aint movin he soliloquized with satisfaction thot redskin wont niver scalp a soldier of the u p r drill ye terriers drill ye terriers drill  the engine whistle shrieked out and once more the din of conflict headed to the front neale lay there seeing the reality of what he had so often dreamed these old soldiers these toilers with rail and sledge and shovel these irishmen with the rifles they were the builders of the great u p r glory might never be theirs but they were the battlescarred heroes they were as used to fighting as to working they dropped their sledges or shovels to run for their guns  again the train started up and had scarcely gotten under way when with jerk and bump it stopped once more the conflict grew fiercer as the indians became more desperate but evidently they were kept from closing in for during the thick of the heaviest volleying the engine again began to puff and the wheels to grind slowly the train moved on like hail the bullets pattered against the car smoke drifted away on the wind  neale lay there watching these cool men who fought off the savages no doubt casey and shane and mcdermott were merely three of many thousands engaged in building and defending the u p r this trio liked the fighting perhaps better than the toiling casey puffed his old black pipe grinned and aimed shot and reloaded sang his quaint song and joked with his comrades all in the same cool quiet way if he knew that the shadow of death hung over the train he did not show it he was not a thinker casey was a man of action only once he yelled and that was when he killed the indian on the pinto mustang  shane grew less loquacious and he dropped and fumbled over his rifle but he kept on shooting neale saw him feel the hot muzzle of his gun and shake his bandaged head the blood trickled down his cheek  mcdermott plied his weapon and ever and anon he would utter some pessimistic word or presage dire disaster or remind casey that his scalp was destined to dry in a siouxs lodge or call on shane to hit something to save his life or declare the engine was off the track he rambled on but it was all talk the man had gray hairs and he was a born fighter  this time the train gained more headway and evidently had passed the point where the indians could find obstructions to place on the track neale saw through a porthole that the sioux were dropping back from the front of the train and were no longer circling their firing had become desultory medicine bow was in sight the engine gathered headway  well git the rest of the day off remarked casey complacently shane yez are dom quiet betoimes an mac i shure showed yez up today  ye did not retorted mcdermott i kilt jist twintynine sooz  jist thorty wus moine an mac as they wus only about fifthy of thim yez must be a liar  the train drew on toward medicine bow firing ceased neale stood up to see the sioux riding away their ranks did not seem noticeably depleted  drill ye terriers drill sang casey as he wiped his sweaty and begrimed rifle mac how many sooz did shane kill  bgorra he aint said yit replied mcdermott say shane casey  neale whirled at the sharp change of tone  shane lay face down on the floor of the car his bloody hands gripping his rifle his position was inert singularly expressive  neale strode toward him but casey reached him first he laid a hesitating hand on shanes shoulder  shane old mon he said but the cheer was not in his voice  casey dropped his pipe then he turned his comrade over shane had done his best and his last for the u p r     17  neale and larry and slingerland planned to go into the hills late in the fall visit slingerlands old camp and then try to locate the gold buried by horn for the present larry meant to return to benton and neale though vacillating as to his own movements decided to keep an eye on the cowboy  the trappers last words to neale were interesting son he said theres a feller hyar in medicine bow who says as how he thought your pard larry was a bad cowpuncher from the pan handle of texas  bad queried neale  wal he meant a gunthrowin bad man i take it  dont let reddy overhear you say it replied neale and advise your informant to be careful ive always had a hunch that reddy was really somebody  benton ll work on the cowboy continued slingerland earnestly an son i aint so allfired sure of you  ill take what comes returned neale shortly goodbye old friend and if you can use us for buffalohunting without the dom sooz as casey says why well come  after slingerland departed neale carried with him a memory of the trappers reluctant and wistful goodbye it made neale thinkwhere were he and larry going friendships in this wild west were stronger ties than he had known elsewhere  the train arrived at benton after dark and the darkness seemed a windy gulf out of which roared yellow lights and excited men the tents with the dim lights through the canvas gleamed pale and obscure like so much of the life they hid the throngs hurried the dust blew the band played the barkers clamored for their trade  neale found the more pretentious hotels overcrowded and he was compelled to go to his former lodgings where he and larry were accommodated  now were here what ll we do queried neale more to himself he felt as if driven and the mood he hated and feared was impinging upon his mind  shore well eat replied larry  then what  wal i reckon well see whats goin on in this heah benton  as a matter of fact neale reflected there was nothing to do that he wanted to do  youall air gettin the blues said larry with solicitude  red im never free of them  larry put his hands on neales shoulder demonstration of this kind was rare in the cowboy  pard are we goin to see this heah benton an then brace an go back to work  no i cant hold a job replied neale bitterly  youre showin a yellow streak youre done as you told slingerland nothin aint no good lifes over fer all thets sweet an right is thet your stand  yes it must be reddy said neale with scorn of himself but youit neednt apply to you  i reckon im sorry rejoined larry ignoring neales last words i always hoped youd get over allies loss you had so much to live fer  reddy i wish the bullet that hit shane today had hit me instead you neednt look like that i mean it today when the sioux chased us my hair went stiff and my heart was in my mouth i ran for my life as if i loved it but that was my miserable cowardice im sick of the game  are you in daid earnest asked larry huskily  neale nodded gloomily he did not even regret the effect of his speech upon the cowboy he divined that somehow the moment was as critical and fateful for larry but he did not care the black spell was enfolding him all seemed hard cold monstrous within his breast he could not love anything he was lost he realized the magnificent loyalty of this simple texan who was his true friend  reddy for gods sake dont make me ashamed to look you in the eyes appealed neale i want to go on you know  wal i reckon there aint anythin to hold me now drawled larry he had changed as he spoke he had aged the dry humor of the cowboy the amiable ease were wanting  oh forgive my utter selfishness burst out neale im not the man i was but dont think i dont love you  they went out together and the hum of riotous benton called them the lights beckoned and the melancholy night engulfed them  next morning late on the way to breakfast neale encountered a young man whose rough bronzed face somehow seemed familiar  at sight of neale this young fellow brightened and he lunged forward  neale lookin for you was like huntin for a needle in a haystack  neale could not place him and he did not try hard for recognition for that surely would recall his former relations to the railroad  i dont remember you replied neale  ill bet larry does said the stranger with a grin at the cowboy  shore your names campbell an you was a lineman for baxter returned larry  right you are said campbell offering his hand to neale and then to larry he appeared both glad and excited  i guess i recall you now said neale thoughtfully you saidyou were hunting me  well i should smile returned campbell and handed neale a letter  neale tore it open and hastily perused its contents it was a brief urgent request from baxter that neale should return to work the words almost like an order made neales heart swell for a moment he stood there staring at the paper larry read the letter over his shoulder  pard shore i was expectin jest thet there an i say go exclaimed larry  neale slowly shook his head  campbell made a quick nervous movement neale i was to saytelltheres more n your old job waitin for you  what do you mean queried neale  thats all except the corps have struck a snag out here west of benton its a bad place you an henney were west in the hills when this survey was made its a deep washbad grade an curves the gangs stuck an baxter swore weve got to have neale back on the job  wheres henney asked neale rather thickly campbells words affected him powerfully  henney had to go to omaha boone is sick at fort fetterman baxter has only a new green hand out there an theyve sure struck a snag  thats too bad replied neale still thoughtfully isthe chiefis general lodge there  yes theres a trooper camp colonel dillon an some of the officers have their wives out on a little visit to see the work they couldnt stand benton  wellyou thank baxter and tell him im sorry i must refuse said neale  you wont come ejaculated campbell  neale shook his head larry reached out with big eager hands  see heah pard i reckon you will go  campbell acted strangely as if he wanted to say more but did not have authority to do so he looked dismayed then he said all right neale ill take your message but you can expect me back  and he went on his way  neale shore theres somethin in the wind said larry wal it jest tickles me they cant build the railroad without you  would you go back to work queried neale  shore i would if theyd have me but i reckon thet little runin of mine with smith has made bad feelin an come to think of thet if i did go back id only have to fight some of smiths friends an i reckon id better not go itd only make trouble for you  me you heard me refuse  shore i heerd you drawled larry softly but youre goin back if i have to hawgtie you an pack you out there on a hoss  neale said no more if he had said another word he would have betrayed himself to his friend he yearned for his old work to think that the engineer corps needed him filled him with joy but at the same time he knew what an effort it would take to apply himself to any task he hated to attempt it he doubted himself he was morbid all that day he wandered around at larrys heels half oblivious of what was going on after dark he slipped away from his friend to be alone and being alone in the dark quietness brought home to him the truth of a strange strong growth out of the depths of him that was going to overcome his morbid craving to be idle to drift to waste his life on a haunting memory  he could not sleep that night and so was awake when larry lounged in slow and heavy the cowboy was halfdrunk neale took him to task and they quarreled finally larry grew silent and fell asleep after that neale likewise dropped into slumber  in the morning larry was again his old cool easy reckless self and had apparently forgotten neales sharp words neale however felt a change in himself this was the first morning for a long time that he had not hated the coming of daylight  when he and larry went out the sun was high for neale there seemed something more than sunshine in the air at sight of campbell waiting in the same place in which they had encountered him yesterday neales pulses quickened  campbell greeted them with a bright smile im back he said  so i see replied neale constrainedly  ive a message for you from the chief announced campbell  the chief exclaimed neale  larry edged closer to them with the characteristic hitch at his belt and his eyes flashed  he asks as a personal favor that you come out to see him replied campbell  neale flushed general lodge asks that he echoed there was a slow heat stirring all through him  yes will you go  ii guess ill have to replied neale he did not feel that he was deciding he had to go but this did not prove that he must take up his old work  larry swung his hand on neales shoulder almost staggering him the cowboy beamed  go in to breakfast he said order for me too ill be back  you want to hurry rejoined campbell weve only a halfhour to eat an catch the worktrain  larry strode back toward the lodginghouse and it was campbell who led neale into the restaurant and ordered the meal neales mind was not in a whirl nor dazed but he did not get much further in thought than the remarkable circumstance of general lodge sending for him personally meanwhile campbell rapidly talked about masonry roadbeds washouts and other things that neale heard but did not clearly understand then larry returned he carried neales bag which he deposited carefully on the bench  i reckon you might as well take it along he drawled  neale felt himself being forced along an unknown path  they indulged in little further conversation while hurriedly eating breakfast that finished they sallied forth toward the station campbell clambered aboard the worktrain  come on larry he said  and neale joined in the request yes come he said  wal seein as how i want youall to get on an the railroad built i reckon id better not go drawled larry his blue eyes shone warm upon his friend  larry ill be back in a day or so said neale  aw now pard you stay go back on the job an stick appealed the cowboy  no i quit and ill stay quit i might help outfor a dayjust as a favor but neale shook his head  i reckon if you care anythin aboot me youll shore stick  larry youll go to the bad if i leave you here alone protested neale  wel if you stay well both go replied larry sharply he had changed subtly its in me to go to helli reckon ive gonebut that aint so for you  twos company said neale with an attempt at lightness but it was a pretense larry worried him  listen if you go back on the jobthen it ll be all right for you to run in heah to see me once in a while but if you throw up this chance ill  larry paused his ruddy tan had faded slightly  neale eyed him aware of a hard and tense contraction of the cowboys throat  well what ll you do queried neale shortly  larry threw back his head and the subtle fierce tensity seemed to leave him  wal the day you come back ill clean out stantons placejest to start entertainin you he replied with his slow drawl as marked as ever it was  a stir of anger in neales breast subsided with the big warm realization of this wild cowboys love for him and the melancholy certainty that larry would do exactly as he threatened  suppose i come back and beat you all up suggested neale  wal thet wont make a dam bit of difference replied larry seriously  whereupon neale soberly bade his friend goodbye and boarded the train  the ride appeared slow and long dragged out by innumerable stops all along the line laborers awaited the train to unload supplies at the end of the line there was a congestion neale had not observed before in all the work freightcars loaded with stone and iron beams and girders for bridgework piles of ties and piles of rails and gangs of idle men attested to the delay caused by an obstacle to progress the sight aggressively stimulated neale he felt very curious to learn the cause of the setback and his old scorn of difficulties flashed up  the camp neales guide led him to was back some distance from the construction work it stood in a little valley through which ran a stream there was one large building low and flat made of boards and canvas adjoining a substantial old log cabin and clustered around though not close together were a considerable number of tents troopers were in evidence some on duty and many idle in the background the slopes of the valley were dark green with pine and cedar  at the open door of the building neale met baxter face to face and that worthys greeting left neale breathless and aghast yet thrilling with sheer gladness  whatre you up against asked neale  the boss ll talk to you get in there baxter replied and pushed neale inside it was a big room full of smoke noise men tables papers there were guns stacked under portholes some one spoke to neale but he did not see who it was all the faces he saw so swiftly appeared vague yet curious and interested then baxter halted him at a table once again neale faced his chief baxter announced something neale did not hear the words plainly  general lodge looked older sterner more worn he stood up  hello neale he said offering his hand and the flash of a smile went over his grim face  come in here continued the chief and he led neale into another room of different aspect it was small the walls were of logs new boards had been recently put in the floor new windows had been cut and it contained indian blankets chairs a couch  here general lodge bent a stern and piercing gaze upon his former lieutenant  neale you failed me when you quit your job he said you were my righthand man you quit me in my hour of need  general ii was furious at that rotten commissioner deal replied neale choking what he had done now seemed an offense to his chief my work was ordered done over  neale that was nothing to what ive endured you should have grit your teethand gone on that five miles of reconstruction was nothingnothing  in his chiefs inflexible voice in the worn shadowed face neale saw the great burden and somehow he was reminded of lincoln and a passion of remorse seized him why had he not been faithful to this steadfast man who had needed him  it seemedso much to me faltered neale  why did you not look at that as you have looked at so many physical difficultiesthe running of a survey for instance  ii guess i have a yellow streak  why didnt you come to me went on the chief evidently he had been disappointed in neale  i might have comeonly larry my friendhe got into it and i was afraid hed kill somebody replied neale  that cowboyhe was a great fellow but gone wrong he shot one of the bossessmith  yes i know diddid smith die  no but hell never be any more good for the u p r thats certain where is your friend now  i left him in benton  benton exclaimed the chief bitterly i am responsible for benton this great work of my life is a hell on wheels moving on and on your cowboy friend has no doubt found his placeand his matchin benton  larry has broken loose from mefrom any last restraint  neale what have you been doing  and at that neale dropped his head  idling in the campsdrifting from one place to the nextdrinking gambling eh  im ashamed to say sir that of late i have been doing just those things replied neale and he raised his gaze to his chiefs  but you havent been associating with those camp women exclaimed general lodge with his piercing eyes dark on neale  no cried neale the speech had hurt him  im glad to hear thatgladder than you can guess i was afraidbut no matter what you did do is bad enough you ought to be ashamed a young man with your intelligence your nerve your gifts i have not had a single man whose chances compared with yours if you had stuck youd be at the head of my engineer corps right now baxter is played out boone is ill henney had to take charge of the shops in omaha and you with fortune and fame awaiting you throw up your job to become a bum to drink and gamble away your life in these rotten camps  general lodges scorn flayed neale  sir you may not know ii lost some onevery dear to me after that i didnt seem to care neale turned to the window he was ashamed of what blurred his eyes if it hadnt been for thatid never have failed you  the chief strode to neale and put a hand on his shoulder son i believe you maybe ive been a little hard lets forget it his tone softened and there was a close pressure of his hand the thing is nowwill you come back on the job  baxters notecampbell said theyd struck a snag here you mean help them get by that  snag i guess it is a snag it bids fair to make all our labor and millions of dollarswasted but im not asking you to come back just to help us over this snag i mean will you come back for goodand stick  neale was lifted out of the gloom into which memory had plunged him he turned to his chief and found him another person there was a light on his face and eagerness on his lips and the keen stern eyes were soft  son will you come backstand by me till the finish repeated general lodge his voice deep and full there was more here than just the relation of employer to his lieutenant  yes sir ill come back replied neale in low voice  their hands met  good exclaimed the chief  then he deliberately took out his watch and studied it his hand trembled slightly he did not raise his eyes again to neales face  ill call youlater he said you stay here ill send some one in  with that he went out  neale remained standing his eyes fixed on the graygreen slope seen through the window he seemed a trifle unsteady on his feet and he braced himself with a knee against the couch his restraint under extreme agitation began to relax a flooding splendid thought filled his mindhis chief had called him back to the great work  presently the door behind him opened and closed very softly then he heard a low quick gasp some one had entered suddenly the room seemed strange full charged with terrible portent and he turned as if a giant hand had heavily swung him around  it was not light at the other end of the room yet he saw a slight figure of a girl backed against the door her outline was familiar haunting ghost of his dreams bewildered and speechless he stared trembling all over the figure moved swayed a faint sweet voice called piercing his heart like a keen blade all of a sudden he had gone mad he thought this return to his old work had disordered his mind the tremor of his body succeeded to a dizziness his breast seemed about to burst  neale called the sweet voice she was coming toward him swiftly its alliealive and well  neale felt lifted as if by invisible wings his limbs were uselesshad lost strength and feeling the room whirled around him and in that whirl appeared allie lees face aliveflushedradiant recognition brought a maddening checka shockand neales sight darkened tender fluttering hands caught him soft strong arms enfolded him convulsively     18  neale seemed to come into another worlda paradise his eyes doubted the exquisite azure bluethe fleecy cloudthe golden sunshine  there was a warm wet cheek pressed close to his bright chestnut strands of hair over his face tight little hands clutching his breast he scarcely breathed while he realized that allie lee lived then he felt so weak that he could hardly move  allieyoure not dead he whispered  with a start she raised her head it was absolutely the face of allie lee  im the livest girl you ever saw she replied with a little low laugh of joy  alliethen youre actually alivesafehere he exclaimed in wild assurance  yesyes with you again isnt it glorious but oh i gave you a shock you frightened me so neale are you well  i wasntbut i am now  he trembled as he gazed at her yes it was allies faceincomparable unforgettable she might have been a little thin and strained but time and whatever she had endured had only enhanced her loveliness no harm had befallen herthat was written in the white glow of her face in the violet eyes dark and beautiful with the brave soul shining through their haunting shadows in the perfect lips tremulous and tender with love  neale they told me you gave up your workwere going to the bad she said with an eloquence of distress changing her voice and expression  yes allie lee i loved you so wellthat after i lost youi cared for nothing  you gave up  allie he interrupted passionately dont talk of me you havent kissed me  allie blushed i havent thats all you know  have you  yes i havei have i was afraid id strangled you  i never felt it i lost all sense of feeling kiss me now prove youre alive and love me still  and then presently when neale caught his breath again it was to whisper precious allie  am i alive do i love you she whispered her eyes like purple stars her face flooded with a dark rose color  im forced to believe it but you must prove it often he replied then he drew her to a seat beside him ive had many dreams of you yet not one like this how is it you are alive by what providence i shall pray to providence all my life how do you come to be here tell me quick  she leaned close against him thats easy she replied only sometime i want to tell you alleverything do you remember the four ruffians who visited slingerlands cabin one day when we were all there well they came back one day the first time slingerland ever left me alone they fired the cabin and carried me off then they fought among themselves two were killed i made up my mind to get on a horse and run just as i was ready i spied indians riding down i had to shoot the ruffian frank but i didnt kill him then i got on a horse and tried to ride away the indians captured metook me to their camp there an indian girl freed meled me away at night i found a trail and walkedoh nights and days it seemed then i fell in with a caravan i thought i was saved but the leader of that caravan turned out to be durade  durade echoed neale intensely  yes he was traveling east he treated me well but threatened me when we reached the construction camp somewhere back there he started his gamblingplace one night i escaped i walked all that nightall the next day and i was about ready to drop when i found this camp it was night again i saw the lights they took me in mrs dillon and the other women were so kind so good to me i told them very little about myself i only wanted to be hidden here and have them send for you then they brought general lodge your chief to see me he was kind too he promised to get you here it has been a whole terrible week of waiting but now  allie burst out neale they never told me a word about younever gave me a hint they sent for me to come back to my job i could have come a day soonerthe day campbell found me oh  i know they did not find you at once and i learned yesterday they had located you that eased my mind a day more or lesswhat was that but they were somehow strange about you then mrs dillon told me how the chief had been disappointed in youhow he had needed youhow he must have you back  good lord getting me back would have been easy enough if they had only told me exclaimed neale impatiently  dear maybe that was just it i suspect general lodge cared enough for you to want you to come back to your job for your sakefor his sakefor sake of the railroad and not for me  aha breathed neale softly i wonder allie how cheap how little i felt awhile ago when he talked to me i never was so ashamed in my life he called me but thats over you said durade had you allie that scares me to death  it scares me too she replied for im in more danger hidden here than when he had me  oh no how can that be  he would kill me for running away she shuddered paling but while i was with him obedienti dont think he would have done me harm im more afraid now than when i was his prisoner  ill take a bunch of soldiers and go after durade said neale grimly  no dont do that let him alone just get me away safely far out of his reach  but allie thats not possible now declared neale im certainly not going to lose sight of you now ive got you again and i must go back to work i promised  i can stay hereor go along with you to other camps and be careful to veil myself and hide  but thats not safenot the best plan protested neale then he gave a start his face darkened ill put larry king on durades trail  oh no neale dont do that please dont do that larry would kill him  i rather guess larry would and why not  i dont want durade killed it would be dreadful he never hurt me let him alone after all he seems to be the only father i ever knew oh i dont care for him i despise him but let him live he will soon forget me he is mad to gamble this railroad of gold is a rich stake for him he will not last long nor will any of his kind  neale shook his head doubtfully it doesnt seem wise to meletting him go allie does he use his right namedurade  no  what does he look like you described him once to me but ive forgotten  allie resolutely refused to tell him and once more entreated neale to let well enough alone to keep her hidden from the mob and not to seek durade  he has a bad gang she added they might kill you and do youyou think idever beable to live longer without you  whereupon neale forgot all about durade and vengeance and everything but the nearness and sweetness of this girl  when shall we get married he asked presently  this simple question caused allie to avert her face and just at that moment there came a knock on the door allie made a startled movement  come in called neale  it was his chief who entered general lodges face wore the smile that softened it then it showed surprise  neale youre transfigured  neales laugh rang out behold causeeven for that he replied indicating the blushing allie  son i didnt have to play my trump card to fetch you back to work said the general  if you only had exclaimed neale  allie got up shyly and with difficulty disengaged her hand from neales  youyou must want to talk she said and then she fled  a wonderful girl neale were all in love with her declared the chief she dropped down on us one nightasked for protection and you she does not talk much all we know is that she is the girl you saved back in the hills and has been kept a prisoner here she hides by day and night she will not talk but we know she fears some one  yes indeed she does replied neale seriously and then briefly he told general lodge allies story as related by her  well ejaculated the chief if that doesnt beat me what are you going to do  ill keep her close surely she will be safe herehiddenwith the soldiers about  of course but you can never tell whats going to happen if she could be gotten to omahanow  nono replied neale almost violently he could not bear the thought of parting with allie now just when he had found her then the chiefs suggestion had reminded neale of the possibility of allies father materializing and the idea was attended by a vague dread  i appreciate how you feel dont worry about it neale  whats this snag the engineers are up against queried neale abruptly changing the subject  were stuck its an engineering problem that i hopeand expect you to solve  who ran this survey in the first place  its baxters workwith the men he had under him then replied the chief somebody blundered his later surveys make over one hundred feet grade to the mile that wont do weve got to get down to ninety feet baxters stuck the new surveyor is floundering oh its bad business neale i dont sleep of nights  no wonder returned neale and he felt suddenly the fiery grip of his old state of mind toward all the engineering obstacles im going out to look over the ground  ill send baxter and some of the men with you  no thanks replied neale id rathertake up my job all alone out there  the chiefs acquiescence was silent and eloquent  neale strode outdoors the color of things the feel of wind the sounds of men and horses all about him had remarkably changed just as he himself had incalculably changed general lodge had saidtransfigured  he walked down to the construction line and went among the idle men and the strings of cars the piles of rails and the piles of ties he seemed to absorb in them again then he walked down the loose unspiked ties to where they ended and so on along the graded roadbed to the point where his quick eyes recognized the trouble they swiftly took in what had been done and what had been attempted how much needless work begun and completed in the building of the railroad he clambered around in the sand up and down the ravine over the rocks along the stream for half a mile and it was laborious work but how good to pant and sweat once more he retraced his steps then he climbed the long slope of the hill the wind up there blew him a welcome and the sting and taste of dust were sweet his steps was swift and then again he loitered with keen roving glance studying the lay of the ground neales was the deductive method of arriving at conclusions today he was inspired and at length there blazed suddenly his solution to the problem  then he gazed over the rolling hills with contemplative and dreamy vision they were beautiful strong changelessand he divined now how they might have helped him if he had only looked with seeing eyes  late that afternoon tired and dusty he tramped into the big office room general lodge was pacing the floor chewing at his cigar baxter sat over blueprint papers and his face was weary colonel dillon campbell and several other young men were there  neale saw that his manner of entrance or the look of him or both together struck these men singularly he laughed  it was greatgoing back to my job he exclaimed  baxter sat up general lodge threw away his cigar with an action that suggested a sudden vitalizing of a weary but indomitable spirit  did you find the snag weve struck asked baxter slowly  no replied neale  aha well ill have to take you out tomorrow and show you  the chiefs keen eyes began to shine as they studied neale  no couldnt find any snag baxter old boy and the reason is because theres no snag to find  baxter stared and his worn face reddened boy somethins gone to your head he retorted  wal i should smile as larry would say  baxter pounded the table neale its no smiling matter he said harshly you come back here your eye and mindfresh but even so it cant be you make light of this difficulty you cantyou cant  but i do cried neale his manner subtly changing  baxter got up his shaking hand rustled a paper he held i know youof old youve tormented me often youre a boy but herethisthis thing has stumped me ive had no one to help and im getting oldthis damned railroad has made me old ifif you saw a way outtell me  baxter faltered indeed he had aged neale saw the growth of the great railroad with its problems in the face and voice of the old engineer  listen said neale swiftly a halfmile down from where you struck your snag well change the course of that stream well change the lineset a compound curve by intersectionsand well get much less than a ninetyfoot grade to the mile  then he turned to general lodge chief baxter had so many problemsso much on his mindthat he couldnt think the work will go on tomorrow  but neale you went out without any instrument protested the chief  i didnt need one  son are you sure this has been a stumper what you sayseems too goodtoo  am i sure cried neale gaily look at baxters face  indeed one look at the old engineer was confirmation enough  neale was made much of that night the chief and his engineers the officers and their wives all vied with one another in their efforts to celebrate neales return to work the dinner party was merry yet earnest too baxter made a speech his fine old face alight with gladness as he extolled youth and genius and the inspiring power of bright eyes neale had to answer his voice was deep and full as he said that providence had returned him to his work and to a happiness he had believed lost he denied the genius attributed to him but not the inspiring power of bright eyes and he paid a fine tribute to baxter  through all this gaiety and earnestness allies lips were mute and her cheeks flushed and paled by turns it was an ordeal for her both confusing and poignant at last she and neale got away alone to the cabin room where they had met earlier in the day  they stood at the open window close together hands locked gazing out over the quiet valley the moon was full and broad belts of silver light lay in strong contrast to black shadows the hour was late the sentries paced their beats  allie stirred and lifted her face to neales what they said about you makes me almost as happy as to see you again she said  they said who what asked neale dreamily  oh i heard i remember for instance mr baxter said you had genius  he was just eulogizing me replied neale what he said about your bright eyes was more to the point i think  its sweet to believe i could inspire you but i knowand you knowthat if i had not been here you would have seen through the engineering problem just the same now be honest  yes i would replied neale frankly though perhaps not so swiftly i could see through stone today  and that proves your worth your duty it always has beento stand by your chief oh i love him he seems so much younger today you have encouraged them all oh dear neale there is something noble in what you can do for him cant you see it  yes allie indeed i do  promise menever to fail him again  i promise  no matter what happens to me i am alive safe well and im yours but something might happenyou can never tell and i dont refer particularly to durade and his gang i mean life and everything is uncertain out here so promise me no matter what happens that youll stand by your work  i promise that too replied neale huskily but you frighten me you fearfor yourself  no i dont she protested  fate could not be so brutalto take you from me anyway ill not think of it  do not nor will i i wouldnt have asked youonly this night has shown me your opportunity im so proudso proud youll be great some day  well if youre so proudif you think im so wonderfulwhy havent you rewarded me for that little job today  reward you how  how do you suppose  she was pale eloquent grave but he was lowvoiced gay intense  dear nealewhatwhat can i do i have nothing so big a thing as you did today  child you can kiss me  allies sweet gravity changed she smiled i shore can as larry used to say thats my privilege but you spoke of a reward my kissesthey are yoursand as many as thethe grains of sand out there but they are not reward  no listen for just one kissif i had to earn it soi would dig that roadbed out there carry every tie and rail with my bare hands drive every spike  neale you talk like a boy something indeed has gone to your head  yes indeed it has its your facein the moonlight  she hid her blushes for a moment on his breast  ii want to be serious she whispered i want to thank god for my good fortune to think of you and your work the future and youyou only want kisses  well since your future must be largely made up of kisses suppose you begin your workright now  oh youre teasing yet when you ask of mewhatever you aski have no mindno will something drags at me i feel it nowas i used towhen you made me wade the brook  oh thats my sweetest memory of you how it haunted me  they stood silent for a while out in the moonblanched space the sentries trod monotonously a coyote yelped sharp and wild the wind moaned low suddenly neale shook himself as if awakening  allie it grows late we must say good night today has been blessed i am grateful to the depths of my heart but i wont let you gountil my reward  she raised her face white and noble in the moonlight     19  neale slept in a tent and when he was suddenly awakened it was bright daylight his ears vibrated to a piercing blast for an instant he could not distinguish the sound but when it ceased he knew it had been a ringing buglecall following that came the voices and movements of excited troopers  he rolled from his blankets to get into boots and coat and rush out the troopers appeared all around him in hurried orderly action neale asked a soldier what was up  redskins bgorrabefore brikfast was the disgusted reply  neale thought of allie and his heart contracted a swift glance on all sides however failed to see any evidence of attack on the camp he espied general lodge and colonel dillon among a group before the engineers quarters neale hurried up  good morning neale said the chief grimly youre back on the job all right  and colonel dillon added a little action to celebrate your return neale  whats happened queried neale shortly  we just got a telegraph message big forcesioux thats all the operator says the wire was cut in the middle of the message  big forcesioux repeated neale between here and benton  of course we sent a scout on horseback down along the line  neale youll find guns inside help yourself said general lodge youll take breakfast with us in the cabin we dont know whats up yet but it looks bad for ushaving the women here this cabin is no fort  general we can have all those railroad ties hustled here and throw up defenses suggested the officer  thats a good idea but the troopers will have to carry them that worktrain wont get out here today  its not likely but we can use the graders from the camp up the line neale go in and get guns and a bite to eat ill have a horse here ready for you i want you to ride out after those graders  all right replied neale rapidly have you tolddo the women know yet whats up  yes and that girl of yours has nerve hurry neale  neale rode away on his urgent errand without having seen allie his orders had been to run the horse it was some distance to the next grading camphow far he did not know and the possibility of his return being cut off by indians had quickened neale into a realization of the grave nature of the situation  he had difficulty climbing down and up the gorge but once across it there was the graded roadbed leading straight to the next camp this roadbed was soft and not easy going for a horse neale found better ground along the line on hard ground and here he urged the fresh horse to a swift and steady gait  the distance was farther than he had imagined and probably exceeded ten miles he rode at a gallop through a wagontrain camp which from its quiet looks was not connected with the work on the railroad straight on into the midst of two hundred or more graders just about to begin the days work his advent called a halt to everything sharply and briefly neale communicated the orders given him then he wheeled his horse for the return trip  when he galloped through the wagontrain camp several roughappearing men hailed him curiously  indians yelled neale as he swept on  he glanced back once to see a tall darkfaced man wearing a frockcoat speak to the others and then wildly fling out his arms  it was downhill on the way back and the horse now thoroughly heated and excited ran his swiftest far down the line neale saw columns of smoke rolling upward they appeared farther on than his camp yet they caused him apprehension his cheek blanched at the thought that the camp containing allie lee might be surrounded by indians his fears however were groundless for soon he saw the white tents and the cabins with the smoke columns rising far below  neale rode into camp from the west in time to see dillons scout galloping hard up from the east neale dismounted before the waiting officers to give his report  good replied dillon you certainly made time we can figure on those graders in an hour or so  yes there were horses enough for half the gang answered neale  now for andersons report muttered the officer  anderson was the scout he rode up on a foamlashed mustang and got off dark and grimy with dust his report was that he had been unable to get in touch with any soldiers or laborers along the line but he had seen enough with his own eyes halfway between the camp and benton a large force of sioux had torn up the track halted and fired the worktrain a desperate battle was being fought with the odds against the workmen for the reason that the train of boxcars was burning troops must be rushed to the rescue  colonel dillon sent a trooper with orders to saddle the horses  this sent a cold chill through neale general if the sioux rounded us up here in this camp wed be hard put to it he said forcibly  right you are neale the high slopes rocks and trees would afford cover whoever picked out this location for a camp wasnt thinking of indians but we need scarcely expect an attack here  suppose we get the women awayto the hills suggested neale  anderson shook his head they might be worse off here youve shelter water food and men coming thats a big force of sioux theyll have lookouts on all the hills  it was decided to leave a detachment of soldiers under lieutenant brady who was to remain in camp until the arrival of the graders and then follow hard on colonel dillons trail  besides allie lee there were five other women in camp and they all came out to see the troops ride away neale heard colonel dillon assure his wife that he did not think there was any danger but the color failed to return to her face the other women excepting allie were plainly frightened neale found new pride in allie she showed little fear of the sioux  general lodge rode beside colonel dillon at the head of the troops they left camp on a trot raising a cloud of dust and quickly disappeared round the curve of the hill the troopers who were left behind stacked their guns and sallied out after railroad ties with which to build defenses anderson the scout rode up the slope to a secluded point from which he was to keep watch the women were instructed to stay inside the log cabin that adjoined the flimsy quarters of the engineers baxter with his assistants overhauled the guns and ammunition left and neale gathered up all the maps and plans and drawings and put them in a bag close at hand  time passed swiftly and in another halfhour the graders began to arrive they came riding in bareback sometimes two on one horse flourishing their gunsa hundred or more redfaced irishmen spoiling for a fight their advent eased neales dread still a strange feeling weighed upon him and he could not understand it or shake it he had no optimism for the moment he judged it to be overemotion a selfish and rather exaggerated fear for allies safety  lieutenant brady then departed with his soldiers leaving the noisy laborers to carry ties and erect bulwarks the irish as ever growled and voiced their complaints at finding work instead of fighting  hurry an fetch on yez dirn sooz was the cry sent after brady and that request voiced the spirit of the gang  in an hour they had piled a fence of railroad ties six feet high around the engineers quarters this task had scarcely been done when anderson was discovered riding recklessly down the slope baxter threw up his hands  were going to have it he said neale im not so young as i was  anderson rode in behind the barricade and dismounted sioux  the graders greeted this information with loud hurrahs but when anderson pointed out a large band of sioux filing down from the hilltop the enthusiasm was somewhat checked it was the largest hostile force of sioux that neale had ever seen the sight of the lean wild figures stirred neales blood and then again sent that cold chill over him the indians rode down the higher slope and turned off at the edge of the timber out of riflerange here they got off their mustangs and apparently held a council neale plainly saw a befeathered chieftain point with long arm then the band moved disintegrated and presently seemed to have melted into the ground  men were in for a siege yelled old baxter  at this juncture the women came running out badly frightened  the indians the indians cried mrs dillon we saw thembehind the cabincreeping down through the rocks  get insidestay in the cabin ordered baxter  allie was the last one crowded in neale as he half forced her inside was struck with a sudden wild change in her expression  there there she whispered trying to point  just then rifleshots and the spattering of bullets made quick work urgent  goget inside the log walls said neale as he shoved allie in  excitement prevailed among the graders they began to run under cover of the inclosure and some began to shoot aimlessly  anderson take some men go to the back of the cabin shouted baxter  the scout called for men to follow him and ran out so many of the graders essayed to follow that they blocked the narrow opening between the inclosure and house suddenly one of them in the rear sheered round so that he looked at neale it was but a momentary glance but neale sensed recognition there then the man was gone and neale sustained a strange surprise that face had been familiar but he could not recall where he had ever seen it the red leering evil visage with its prominent hard features grew more vivid in memory as neales mind revolved closer to discovery  inside with you neale yelled baxter  baxter and neale with the four young engineers took to the several rooms of the log cabin where each selected an aperture between the logs or a window through which to fire upon the indians but neale soon ascertained that there was nothing to shoot at outside of some white puffs of smoke rising from behind rocks on the slope there was absolutely not a sign of an indian the graders were firing but neale believed they would have done better to save their powder bullets pattered against the logs now and then a leaden pellet sang through a window to thud into the wall neale shut the heavy door leading from the cabin into the engineers quarters for bullets were ripped through from one side to the other of this canvasandclapboard structure then neale passed from room to room searching for allie two of the engineers were kneeling at a chink between the logs aiming and firing in great excitement campbell had sustained a slight wound and looked white with rage and fear baxter was peeping from behind the rude jamb of a window  nothin to shoot at boy he said in exasperation  wait listen to that bunch of irish shoot theyre wasting powder  weve plenty of ammunition let em shoot they may not hit any redskins but theyll scare em  we can hold out hereif the troopers hurry back said neale  sure but maybe theyre hard at it too ive no hope this is the same bunch of sioux that held up the worktrain  neither have i and if the troops dont get here before dark  neale halted and baxter shook his gray head  that would be bad he said but weve squeezed out of narrow places before buildin this u p r  neale found the women in the large room between the corner of the walls and a huge stone fireplace they were quiet allie leaped at sight of neale her hands trembled as she grasped him  neale she whispered i saw fresno  whos he queried neale blankly  hes one of durades gang  no exclaimed neale he drew allie aside youre scared  id never forget fresno she replied positively he was one of the four ruffians who burned slingerlands cabin and made off with me  then neale shook with a violent start he grasped allie tight  i saw him too just before i came in i saw one of the men that visited us at slingerlands big hulking fellowred ugly facebad look  thats fresno he and the gang must have been camped with those graders you brought here oh im more afraid of fresnos gang than of the indians  but alliethey dont know youre here youre safe the troops will be back soon and drive these indians away  allie clung to neale and again he felt something of the terror these ruffians had inspired in her he reassured her assuming a confidence he was far from feeling and cautioned her to stay in that protected corner then he went in the other room to his station it angered neale and alarmed him that another peril perhaps menaced allie and he prayed for the return of the troops  the day passed swiftly in intense watchfulness on the part of the defenders and in a waiting game on the part of the besiegers they kept up a desultory firing all afternoon now and then a reckless grader running from post to post drew a volley from the sioux and likewise something that looked like an indian would call forth shots from the defenses but there was no real fighting  it developed that the sioux were waiting for night a fiery arrow speeding from a bow in the twilight left a curve of sparks in the air like a falling rocket it appeared to be a signal for demoniacal yells on all sides rifleshots ceased to come from the slopes as darkness fell gleams of little fires shot up from all around the sioux were preparing to shoot volleys of burning arrows down into the camp  anderson hurried in to consult with baxter were surrounded he said tersely the redskins are goin to try burnin us out were in a mighty tight place  whats to be done asked baxter  anderson shook his head  on the instant there was a dull spat of an object striking the roof over their heads this sound was followed by a long shrill yell  that was a burnin arrow declared anderson  the men as of one accord ran out through the engineers quarters to the open it was now dark little fires dotted the hillsides a dull red speck like an ember showed over the roof darkened and disappeared then a streak of fire shot out from the black slope and sped on clear over the camp  sooner or later theyll make a go of that muttered anderson  neale heard the scouts horse that had been left there in the inclosure  anderson suppose i jump your horse its dark as pitch i could run throughreach the troops ill take a chance  i had that idee myself replied anderson but it seems to me if them troopers wasnt havin hell theyd been here long ago im lookin for them every minnit theyll come an weve got to fight fire now till they get here  but theres no fire yet said baxter  there will be replied anderson but mebbe we can put it out as fast as they start it plenty of water here an its dark what im afraid of is theyll fire the tents out there an then it ll be light as day we cant risk climbin over the roofs  neale go insidecall the boys out said baxter  neale had to feel his way through the rooms he called to his comrades and then to the women to keep up their couragethat surely the troops would soon return  when he went out again the air appeared full of fiery streaks shouts of the graders defiantly answered the yells of the savages showers of sparks were dropping upon the camp the sioux had ceased shooting their rifles for the present and judging from their yells they had crawled down closer under the cover of night  presently a bright light flared up outside of the inclosure one of the tents had caught fire the indians yelled triumphantly neale and his companions crouched back in the shadow the burning tent set fire to the tent adjoining they blazed up like paper lighting the camp and slopes but not an indian was visible they stopped yelling then neale heard the thudding of arrows almost at once the roof of the engineers quarters which was merely strips of canvas over a wooden frame burst into flames in a single moment the roof of the cabin was blazing more tents ignited flared up and the scene became almost as light as day rifles again began to crack the crafty indians poured a hail of bullets into the inclosure and the walls of the buildings still not an indian was visible for the defenders to shoot at  anderson neale and baxter were in grim consultation they agreed on the scouts dictum reckon the games up hustle the women out  neale crawled along the inclosure to the opening on that side of the buildings there was dark shadow but it was lifting he ran along the wall and he heard the whistle of bullets back of the cabin the indians appeared to have gathered in force neale got to the corner and peered round the blazing tents lighted up this end he saw the graders break and run some on his side of the cabin he clambered in a door of this room was open and through it neale saw the roof of the engineers quarters blazing he heard the women screaming evidently they too were running out to the inclosure neale hurried into the room where he had left allie he called there was no answer but a growing roar outside apparently drowned his voice it was dark in this room he felt along the wall the fireplace the corner allie was not there the room was empty his hands groping low along the floor came in contact with the bag he had left in allies charge it contained the papers he had taken the precaution to save probably in her flight to escape from the burning cabin she had dropped it but that was not like allie she would have clung to the bag while strength and sense were hers perhaps she had not gotten out of the cabin neale searched again growing more and more aware of the strife outside he heard the crackling of wood over his head evidently the cabin was burning like tinder there were men in the back room fighting yelling crowding neale could see only dim burly forms and the flashes of guns smoke floated thickly there some one on the inside or outside was beating out the door with an axe  he decided quickly that whatever allie might have done she would not have gone into that room he retraced his steps groping feeling everywhere in the dark  suddenly the crackling the shots the yells ceased or were drowned in a volume of greater sound neale ran to the window the flare from the burning tents was dying down but into the edge of the circle of light he saw loom a line of horsemen  troopers he cried joyfully a great black pressing weight seemed lifted off his mind the troops would soon rout that band of sneaking sioux  neale ran to the back room where above the din outside he made himself heard but for all he could see or hear his tidings of rescue did not at once affect the men there then he forgot them and the fight outside in his search for allie the cabin was on fire and he did not mean to leave it until he was absolutely sure she was not hidden or lying in a faint in some corner and he had not made sure of that until the burning roof began to fall in then he leaped out the window and ran back to the inclosure  the blaze here was no longer bright but neale could see distinctly some of the piles of ties were burning the heat had begun to drive the men out troopers were everywhere and it appeared the rattle of rifles was receding up the valley the sioux had retreated  here neale continued his search for allie he found mrs dillon and her companions but allie was not with them all he could learn from the frightened women was that allie had been in their company when they started to run from the cabin they had not seen her since  still neale did not despair though his heart sank allie was hiding somewhere frantically he searched the inclosure questioned every man he met rushed back to the burning cabin where the fire drove him out but there was no trace of allie  then the conviction of calamity settled upon him while the cabin burned and the troopers and graders watched neale now searched for the face of the man he had recognizedthe ruffian allie called fresno this search was likewise fruitless  the following hours were a hideous slow nightmare for neale he had left one hopethat daylight would disclose allie somewhere  day eventually dawned it disclosed many facts the sioux had departed and if they had suffered any loss there was no evidence of it the engineers quarters cabin and tents had burned to the ground utensils bedding food grain tools and instrumentseverything of value except the papers neale had savedhad gone up in smoke the troopers who had rescued the worktrain must now depend upon that train for new supplies many of the graders had been wounded some seriously but none fatally nine of them were missing as was allie lee  the blow was terrible for neale yet he did not sink under it he did not consider the opinion of his sympathetic friends that allie had wildly run out of the burning cabin to fall into the hands of the sioux he returned with the graders to their camp and it was no surprise to him to find the wagontrain that had tarried near gone in the night he trailed that wagontrain to the next camp where on the busy road he lost the wheeltracks next day he rode horseback all the way in to benton but all his hunting and questioning availed nothing gloom heartsickness and despair surged in upon him but he did not think of giving up he remembered all allie had told him those fiends had gotten her again he believed now all that she had said and there was something of hope in the thought that if durade had found her again she would at least not be at the mercy of ruffians like fresno but this was a forlorn hope still it upheld neale and determined him to seek her during the time in which his work did not occupy him  and thus it came about that neale plodded through his work along the line during the day and late in the afternoon rode back with the laborers to benton if allie lee lived she must be in benton     20  neale took up lodgings with his friend larry he did not at first tell the cowboy about his recovery of allie lee and then her loss for the second time and when finally he could not delay the revelation any longer he regretted that he had been compelled to tell  larry took the news hard he inclined to the idea that she had fallen again into the hands of the indians nevertheless he showed himself terribly bitter against men of the fresno stamp and in fact against all the outlaw ruffianly desperado class so numerous in benton  neale begged larry to be cautious to go slow to ferret out things and so help him instead of making it harder to locate allie through his impetuosity  pard i reckon allies done for said larry gloomily  nono larry i feel shes alivewell if she were dead ororwell wouldnt i know protested neale  but larry was not convinced he had seen the hard side of border life he knew the odds against allie  reckon ill look fer that fresno he said  and deeper than before he plunged into bentons wild life  one evening neale on returning from work to his lodgings found the cowboy there in the dim light larry looked strange he had his gunbelt in his hands neale turned up the lamp  hello red whats the matter you look pale and sick said neale  they wanted to throw me out of thet dance ball said larry  which one  stantons  well did they inquired neale  wal i reckon not i walked an some night ill shore clean out thet hall  neale did not know what to make of larrys appearance the cowboy seemed to be relaxing his lips that had been tight began to quiver and his hands shook then he swung the heavy gunbelt with somber and serious air as if he were undecided about leaving it off even when about to go to bed  red youve thrown a gun exclaimed neale  larry glanced at him and neale sustained a shock  shore drawled larry  by heaven i knew you would declared neale excitedly and he clenched his fist did youyou kill some one  pard i reckon hes daid mused the cowboy i didnt look to see fust gun ive throwed fer long it ll come back now shorer n hell  what ll come back queried neale  larry did not answer this  whod you shoot neale went on  pard i reckon it aint my way to gab a lot replied larry  but youll tell me insisted neale passionately he jerked the gun and belt from larry and threw them on the bed all right drawled larry taking a deep breath i went into stantons hall the other night an a pretty girl made eyes at me wal i shore asked her to dance i reckon wed been good pards if wed been let alone but theres a heap of fellers runnin her an some of them didnt cotton to me one they called cordyhe shore did get offensive hes the fourflush loud kind i didnt want to make any trouble for the girl rubythets her nameso i was mighty goodnatured i dropped in stantons today ruby spotted me fust

shore is the dangerest wal she says reddy are you goin to let them run you out of heah they havent any strings on me so i slapped cordys face an told him to shut up he let out a roar an got wild with his hands like them fourflush fellers do who wants to look real bad i says pretty sharplike dont make any moves now an the darned fool went fer his gun wal i caught his hand twisted the gun away from him poked him in the ribs with it an then shoved it back in his belt he was crazy but pretty pale an surprised shore i acted suddenlike then i says my festive gent if you think of thet move again youll be stiff before you start it guess he believed me  larry paused in his narrative wiped his face and moistened his lips evidently he was considerably shaken  well go on said neale impatiently  thet was all right so far as it went resumed larry but the pard of cordyshe was halfdrunk an a big brag anyhow he took up cordys quarrel he hollered so he stopped the music an drove most everybody out of the hall they was peepin in at the door but ruby stayed theres a game kid an im goin to see her tomorrow  you are not declared neale hurry up finish your story  wal the big bloke swaggered all over me an i seen right off thet he didnt have sense enough to be turned then i got cold i always used to he says are you goin to keep away from ruby  an i says very polite i reckon not  then he throws hisself in shape like he meant to leap over a hoss an hollers pull yer gun  i asks very innocent what for mister  an he bawls fer the crowd cause im agoin to bore you an i never kill a man till he

staggered but he didnt fall then he straightens an goes fer his gun  larry halted again he looked as if he had been insulted and a bitter irony sat upon his lips  i seen when he dropped thet he never got his hand to his gun at all jest as id reckoned wal what made me sick was that my bullet went through him an then some of them thin wallsan hit a girl in another house shes bad hurt they ought to have walls thetd stop a bullet  neale heard the same narrative from the lips of ancliffe and it differed only in the essential details of the cowboys consummate coolness ancliffe who was an eyewitness of the encounter declared that drink or passion or bravado had no part in determining larrys conduct ancliffe talked at length about the cowboy evidently he had been struck with larrys singular manner and look and action ancliffe had all an englishmans intelligent observing powers and the conclusion he drew was that larry had reacted to a situation familiar to him  neale took more credence in what slingerland had told him at medicine bow that night hough and then many other acquaintances halted neale to gossip about larry reel king  the cowboy had been recognized by texans visiting benton they were cattle barons and they did not speak freely of king until ready to depart from the town larrys right name was fisher he had a brothera famous texas outlaw called king fisher larry had always been red fisher and when he left texas he was on the way to become as famous as his brother texas had never been too hot for red until he killed a sheriff he was a born gunfighter and was well known on all the ranches from the pan handle to the rio grande he had many friends he was a great horseman a fine cowman he had never been notorious for bad habits or ugly temper only he had an itch to throw a gun and he was unlucky in always running into trouble trouble gravitated to him his red head was a target for abuse and he was sensitive and dangerous because of that very thing texas the land of gunfighters had seen few who were equal to him in cool nerve and keen eye and swift hand  neale did not tell larry what he had heard the cowboy changed subtly but not in his attitude toward neale benton and its wildness might have been his proper setting so many rough and bad men inspired by the time and place essayed to be equal to benton but they lasted a day and were forgotten the great compliment paid to larry king was the change in the attitude of this wild camp he had been one among manya stranger in time when the dancehalls grew quiet as he entered and the gamblinghells suspended their games his fame increased as from lip to lip his story passed always gaining something jealousy hatred and fear grew with his fame it was hinted that he was always seeking some man or men from california he had been known to question new arrivals might youall happen to be from california have you ever heard of an outfit that made off with a girl out heah in the hills  neale not altogether in the interest of his search for allie became a friend and companion of place hough ancliffe sought him also and he was often in the haunts of these men they did not take so readily to larry king the cowboy had become a sort of nervous factor in any community his presence was not conducive to a comfortable hour for larry though he still drawled his talk and sauntered around looked the name the texan visitors had left him his flashing blue eyes cold and intent and hard in his naming red face his blazing red hair his stalking form and his gun swinging lowthese characteristics were so striking as to make his presence always felt beauty stanton insisted the cowboy had ruined her business and that she had a terror of him but neale doubted the former statement all business good and bad grew in benton it was strange that as this attractive and notorious woman conceived a terror of larry she formed an infatuation for neale he would have been blind to it but for the dry humor of place hough and the amiable indifference of ancliffe who had anticipated a rival in neale their talk like most talk drifted through neales ears what did he care both hough and ancliffe began to loom large to neale they wasted every day every hour and yet underneath the ones cold passionless pursuit of gold and the others serene and gentle quest for effacement there was something finer left of other years benton was full of gamblers and broken men who had once been gentlemen neale met them oftengambled with them watched them he measured them all they had given life up but within him there was a continual struggle he swore to himself as he had to larry that life was hopeless without allie leeyet there was never a sleeping or a waking hour that he gave up hope the excitement and allurement of the dancehalls though he admitted their power were impossible for him and he frequented them as he went everywhere else only in search of a possible clue  gambling then seemed the only excuse open to him for his presence in bentons sordid halls and he had to bear as best he could the baseness of his associates of course women had free run of all the places in benton  at first neale was flirted with and importuned then he was scorned then he was let alone finally as time went on always courteous even considerate of the women who happened in his way but blind and cold to the meaning of their looks and words he was at last respected and admired  there was always a game in the big gamblingplace and in fact the greatest stakes were played for by gamblers like hough pitted against each other but most of the time was reserved for the fleecing of the builders of the u p r the wageearners whose gold was the universal lure and the magnet neale won money in those games in which he played with place hough his winnings he scattered or lost in games where he was outpointed or cheated  one day a number of eastern capitalists visited benton the fame of the town drew crowds of the curious and greedy and many of these transient visitors wanted to have their fling at the gamblinghells and dancinghalls there was a contagion in the wildness that affected even the selfish it would be something to remember and boast of when benton with its wild life should be a thing of the past  place hough met old acquaintances among some st louis visitors who were out to see the road and benton and perhaps to find investments and he assured them blandly that their visit would not be memorable unless he relieved them of their surplus cash so a game with big stakes was begun neale with hough and five of the visitors made up the table  eastern visitors worked upon neales mood but he did not betray it he was always afraid he would come face to face with some of the directors whom he did not care to meet in such surroundings and so while gambling he seldom looked up from his cards the crowd came and went but he never saw it  this big game attracted watchers the visitors were noisy they drank a good deal they lost with an equanimity that excited interest even in benton the luck for neale seesawed back and forth then he lost steadily until he had to borrow from hough  about this time beauty stanton with ruby and another woman entered the room and were at once attracted by the game to the evident pleasure of the visitors and then unexpectedly larry red king stalked in and lounged forward cool easy careless his cigarette half smoked his blue eyes keen  hey is that him whispered one of the visitors indicating larry  thats red replied hough i hope hes not looking for one of you gentlemen  they laughed but not spontaneously  ive seen his like in dodge city said one  ask him to sit in the game said another  no reds a cardsharp replied hough and id hate to see him catch one of you pulling a crooked deal  they lapsed back into the intricacies and fascination of poker  neale however found the game unable to hold his undivided attention larry was there looking and watching and he made neales blood run cold the girl ruby stood close at hand with her halfclosed eyes mysterious and sweet upon him and beauty stanton came up behind him  neale ill bring you luck she said and put her hand on his shoulder  neales luck did change fortune faced about abruptly with its fickle inconsistency and neale had a run of cards that piled the gold and bills before him and brought a crowd ten deep around the table when the game broke up neale had won three thousand dollars  see i brought you luck whispered beauty stanton in his ear and across the table ruby smiled hauntingly and mockingly  neale waved the crowd toward the bar only the women and larry refused the invitation ruby gravitated irresistibly toward the cowboy  arent you connected with the road inquired one of the visitors drinking next to neale  yes replied neale  saw you in omaha at the office of the company my names blair i sell supplies to commissioner lee he has growing interests along the road  neales lips closed and he set down his empty glass excusing himself he went back to the group he had left larry sat on the edge of the table ruby stood close to him and she was talking stanton and the other woman had taken chairs  wal i reckon you made a rakeoff drawled larry as neale came up lend me some money pard  neale glanced at larry and from him to the girl she dropped her eyes  ruby do you like larry he queried  sure do replied the girl  reddy do you like ruby went on neale  beauty stanton smiled her interest the other woman came back from nowhere to watch neale larry regarded his friend in mild surprise  i reckon it was a turrible case of love at fust sight he drawled  ill call your bluff flashed neale ive just won three thousand dollars ill give it to you will you take it and leave bentongo backno go westbegin life over again  together you mean exclaimed beauty stanton as she rose with a glow on her faded face no need to wonder why she had been named beauty  yes together replied neale in swift steadiness youve started bad but youre young its never too late with this money you can buy a ranchbegin all over again  pard havent you seen too much red liquor drawled larry  the girl shook her head too late she said softly  why  larry is bad but hes honest im both bad and dishonest  ruby i wouldnt call you dishonest returned neale bluntly badyes and wild but if you had a chance  no she said  youre both slated for hell whats the sense of it  i dont see that youre slated for heaven retorted ruby  wal i shore say echo drawled larry as he rolled a cigarette pard youre drunk this heah minnit  im not drunk i appeal to you miss stanton protested neale  you certainly are not drunk she replied youre just  crazy interrupted ruby  they laughed  maybe i do have queer impulses replied neale as he felt his face grow white every once in a while i see a flashofof i dont know what i could do something bigevennowif my heart wasnt dead  mines in its grave said ruby bitterly come stanton lets get out of this find me men who talk of drink and women  neale deliberately reached out and stopped her as she turned away he faced her  youre no fourflush he said youre game you mean to play this out to a finish but youre nono maggot like the most you can think youre afraid to talk to me  im afraid of no man but youyoure a foola skypilot youre  the thing isits not too late  it is too late she cried with trembling lips  neale saw and felt his dominance over her  it is never too late he responded with all his force i can prove that  she looked at him mutely the ghost of another girl stood there instead of the wild ruby of benton  pard youre drunk shore ejaculated larry as he towered over them and gave his belt a hitch the cowboy sensed events  ive annoyed you more than once said neale thiss the last so tell me the truth could i take you away from this life  take me howman  ii dont know but somehow id hold itas worthyto save a girl like youany girlfrom hell  buthow she faltered the bitterness the irony the wrong done by her life was not manifest now  you refused my plan with larry come let me find a home for youwith good people  my godhes not in earnest gasped the girl to her women friends  i am in earnest said neale  then the tension of the girl relaxed her face showed a rebirth of soul  i cant accept she replied if she thanked him it was with a look assuredly her eyes had never before held that gaze for neale then she left the room and presently stantons companion followed her but beauty stanton remained she appeared amazed even dismayed  larry lighted his cigarette shore id call thet a square kid he said neale if you get any drunker youll lose all thet money  ill lose it anyhow replied neale absentmindedly  wal stake me right heah an now  at that neale generously and still absentmindedly delivered to larry a handful of gold and notes that he did not count  hell i aint no bank protested the cowboy  hough and ancliffe joined them and with amusement watched larry try to find pockets enough for his small fortune  easy come easy go in benton said the gambler with a smile then his glance alighting upon the quiet stanton grew a little puzzled beauty what ails you he asked  she was pale and her expressive eyes were fixed upon neale houghs words startled her  what ails me place ive had a forgetful momenta happy oneand im deathly sick  ancliffe stared in surprise he took her literally  beauty stanton looked at neale again will you come to see me she asked with sweet directness  thank youno replied neale he was annoyed she had asked him that before and he had coldly but courteously repelled what he thought were her advances this time he was scarcely courteous  the woman flushed she appeared about to make a quick and passionate reply in anger and wounded pride but she controlled the impulse she left the room with ancliffe  neale do you know stanton is infatuated with you asked hough thoughtfully  nonsense replied neale  she is though these women cant fool me i told you days ago i suspected that now ill gamble on it and you know how i play my cards  she saw me win a pile of money said neale with scorn  ill bet you cant make her take a dollar of it any amount you want and any odds  neale would not accept the wager what was he talking about anyway what was this drift of things his mind did not seem clear perhaps he had drunk too much the eyes of both ruby and beauty stanton troubled him what had he done to these women  neale youre more than usually excited today observed hough probably was the run of luck and then you spouted to the women neale confessed his offer to ruby and larry and then his own impulse  ruby called me a foolcrazya skypilot maybe i am  skypilot well the little devil laughed hough ill gamble she called you that before you declared yourself  before yes i tell you hough i have crazy impulses theyve grown on me out here they burst like lightning out of a clear sky i would have done just that thing for ruby mad you say why man shes not hopeless there was something deep behind that impulse strangenot understandable im at the mercy of every hour i spend here benton has got into my blood and i see how benton is a product of this great advance of progressof civilizationthe u p r were only atoms in a force no one can understand look at reddy king that cowboy was setfixed like stone in his character but benton has called to the worst and wildest in him hell do something terrible mark what i say well all do something terrible you too place hough with all your cold implacable control the moment will come born out of this abnormal time i cant explain but i feel theres a workshop in this hell of benton invisible monstrous and nameless nameless like the new graves dug every day out here on the desert how few of the honest toilers dream of the spirit that is working on them that irishman shane think of him he fought while his brains oozed from a hole in his head i saw but i didnt know then i wanted to take his place he said no he wasnt hurt and casey would laugh at him aye casey would have laughed they are men there are thousands of them the u p r goes on it cant be stopped it has the momentum of a great nation pushing it on from behind and i who have lost all i cared for and you who are a drone among the bees and ruby and stanton with their kind poor creatures sucked into the vortex yes and that mob of leeches why we all are so stung by that nameless spirit that we are stirred beyond ourselves and dare both height and depth of impossible things  you must be drunk said place gravely and yet what you say hits me hard im a gambler but sometimesthere are moments when i might be less or more theres mystery in the air this benton is a chaos those hairy toilers of the rails ive watched them hammer and lift and dig and fight by day they sweat and they bleed they sing and joke and quarreland go on with the work by night they are seized by the furies they fight among themselves while being plundered and murdered by bentons wolves heroic by dayhellish by night and so spirit or whatthey set the pace  next afternoon when parasitic benton awoke it found the girl ruby dead in her bed  her door had to be forced she had not been murdered she had destroyed much of the contents of a trunk she had dressed herself in simple garments that no one in benton had ever seen it did not appear what means she had employed to take her life she was only one of many more than one girl of bentons throng had sought the same short road and cheated life of further pain  when neale heard about it upon his return to benton late that afternoon ruby was in her grave it suited him to walk out in the twilight and stand awhile in the silence beside the bare sandy mound no stoneno mark another nameless grave she had been a child once with dancing eyes and smiles loved by some one surely and perhaps mourned by some one living the low hum of bentons awakening night life was borne faintly on the wind the sand seeped the coyotes wailed and yet there was silence twilight lingered out on the desert the shadows deepened  by some chance the grave of the scarlet woman adjoined that of a laborer who had been killed by a blast neale remembered the spot he had walked out there before a morbid fascination often drew him to view that everincreasing row of nameless graves as the workman had given his life to the road so had the woman neale saw a significance in the parallel  neale returned to the town troubled in mind he remembered the last look ruby had given him had he awakened conscience in her upon questioning hough he learned that ruby had absented herself from the dancinghall and had denied herself to all on that last night of her life  there was to be one more incident relating to this poor girl before benton in its mad rush should forget her  neale divined the tragedy before it came to pass but he was as powerless to prevent it as any other spectator in beauty stantons hall  larry king reacted in his own peculiar way to the news of rubys suicide and the rumored cause he stalked into that dancinghall where his voice stopped the music and the dancers  come out heah he shouted to the pale cordy  and king spun the man into the center of the hall where he called him every vile name known to the camp scorned and slapped and insulted him shamed him before that breathless crowd goaded him at last into a desperate reaching for his gun and killed him as he drew it     21  benton slowed and quieted down a few days before payday to get ready for the great rush only the saloons and dancehalls and gamblinghells were active and even here the difference was manifest  the railroadyard was the busiest place in the town for every train brought huge loads of food merchandise and liquor the transporting of which taxed the teamsters to their utmost  the day just before payday saw the beginning of a singular cycle of change gangs of laborers rode in on the worktrains from the gradingcamps and the camps at the head of the rails now miles west of benton a rest of several days inevitably followed the visit of the paycar it was difficult to keep enough men at work to feed and water the teams and there would have been sorry protection from the indians had not the troops been on duty paydays were not offdays for the soldiers  steady streams of men flowed toward benton from east and west and that night the hum of benton was merry subdued waiting  bright and early the town with its added thousands awoke the morning was clear rosy fresh on the desert the colors changed from soft gray to red and the whirls of dust riding the wind resembled little clouds radiant with sunset hues silence and solitude and unbroken level reigned outside in infinite contrast to the seething town benton resembled an antheap at break of day a thousand songs arose crude and coarse and loud but full of joy payday and vacation were at hand      then drill my paddies drill      drill my heroes drill      drill all day      no sugar in your tay      workin on the u p railway  casey was one irish trooper of thousands who varied the song and tune to suit his taste the content alone they all held drill they were laborers who could turn into regiments at a word  they shaved their stubby beards and donned their besta bronzed sturdy cheery army of wild boys the curse rested but lightly upon their broad shoulders  strangely enough the morning began without the gusty wind so common to that latitude and the six inches of powdery white dust did not rise the wind too waited the powers of heaven smiled in the clear quiet morning but the powers of hell waitedfor the hours to come the night and the darkness  at nine oclock a mob of five thousand men had congregated around the station most of them out in the open on the desert side of the track they were waiting for the paytrain to arrive this hour was the only orderly one that benton ever saw there were laughter profanity playa continuous hum but compared to bentons usual turmoil it was pleasant the workmen talked in groups and like all crowds of men sober and unexcited they were given largely to badinage and idle talk  wot was ut i owed ye moike asked a strapping grader  mike scratched his head wor it thorty dollars this toime  it wor replied the other moike yez hev a mimory  a big negro pushed out his huge jaw and blustered at his fellows  is agwine to bust thet yaller niggers haid he declared  bill hes your fren cool down man cool down replied a comrade  a teamster was writing a letter in leadpencil using a board over his knees  jim you goin to send money home queried a fellowlaborer  i am that an first thing when i get my pay was the reply  reminds me i owe for this suit im wearin ill drop in an settle  a group of spikers held forth on a little bank above the railroad track at a point where a few weeks before they had fastened those very rails with lusty blows  well boys i think i see the smoke of our paydirt way down the line said one  bandy your eyes are pore replied another  yep shes comin said another bout time for i havent twobits to my name  boys no buckin the tiger for me today declared bandy  he was laughed at by all except one quiet comrade who gazed thoughtfully eastward back over the vast and rolling country this man was thinking of home of wife and little girl of what payday meant for them  bandy gave him a friendly slap on the shoulder  frank you got drunk an laid out all night last payday  frank remembered but he did not say what he had forgotten that last payday  a long and gradual slope led from benton down across the barren desert toward medicine bow the railroad track split it and narrowed to a mere thread upon the horizon the crowd of watching waiting men saw smoke rise over that horizon line and a dark flat creeping object through the big throng ran a restless murmur the train was in sight it might have been a harbinger of evil for a subtle change nervous impatient brooding visited that multitude a slow movement closed up the disintegrated crowd and a current of men worked forward to encounter resistance and opposing currents they had begun to crowd for advantageous positions closer to the paycar so as to be the first in line  a fight started somewhere full of loud curses and dull blows and then a jostling mass tried the temper of the slowmarching men some boss yelled an order from a boxcar and he was hooted there was no order when the train whistled for benton a hoarse and sustained shout ran through the mob not from all lips nor from any massed group but taken up from man to mana strange sound the first note of calling benton  the train arrived troops alighting preserved order near the paycar and out of the dense mob a slow stream of men flowed into the car at one end and out again at the other  bates a giant digger and a bully was the first man in the line the first to get his little share of the fortunes in gold passing out of the car that day  long before half of that mob had received its pay bates lay dead upon a sanded floor killed in a drunken brawl  and the irishman mike had received his thirty dollars  and the big negro had broken the head of his friend  and the teamster had forgotten to send money home  and his comrade had neglected to settle for the suit of clothes he was wearing  and bandy for all his vows had gone straight for bucking the tiger  and frank who had gotten drunk last payday had been mindful of wife and little girl far away and had done his duty  as the spirit of the gangs changed with the coming of the gold so did that of the day  the wind began to blow the dust began to fly the sun began to burn and the freshness and serenity of the morning passed  main street in benton became blackstreaked with men whitesheeted with dust there was a whining whistle in the wind as it swooped down it complained it threatened it strengthened and from the heating desert it blew in stiflingly hot a steady tramp tramp tramp rattled the loose boards as the army marched down upon benton it moved slowly the first heave of a great mass getting under way stores and shops restaurants and hotels and saloons took toll from these first comers benton swallowed up the builders as fast as they marched from the paytrain it had an insatiable maw the bands played martial airs and soldiers who had lived through the rebellion felt the thrill and the quickstep and the call of other days  toward afternoon benton began to hurry the hour was approaching when crowded halls and tents must make room for fresh and unspent gangs the swarms of men still marched up the street benton was gay and noisy and busy then white shirts and blue and red plaid held their brightness despite the dust gaudily dressed women passed in and out of the halls all was excitement movement color merriment and dust and wind and heat the crowds moved on because they were pushed on music laughter shuffling feet and clinking glass a steady tramp voices low and voices loud the hoarse brawl of the barkerall these varying elements merged into a roara roar that started with a merry note and swelled to a nameless din  the sun set the twilight fell the wind went down the dust settled and night mantled benton the roar of the day became subdued it resembled the purr of a gorging hyena the yellow and glaring torches the bright lamps the dim pale lights behind tent walls all accentuated the blackness of the night and filled space with shadows like specters bentons streets were full of drunken men staggering back along the road upon which they had marched in no woman now showed herself the darkness seemed a cloak cruel yet pitiful it hid the flight of a man running from fear it softened the sounds of brawling and deadened the pistolshot under its cover soldiers slunk away sobered and ashamed and murderous bandits waited in ambush and brawny porters dragged men by the heels and young gamblers in the flush of success hurried to new games and broken wanderers sought some place to rest and a long line of the vicious of mixed dialect and of different colors filed down in the dark to the tents of lust  life indoors that night in benton was monstrous wonderful and hideous  every saloon was packed and every dive and room filled with a hoarse violent mob of furious men furious with mirth furious with drink furious with wildnessinsane and lecherous spilling gold and blood  the gold that did not flow over the bars went into the greedy hands of the cold swift gamblers or into the clutching fingers of wildeyed women the big gamblinghell had extra lights extra attendants extra tables and there round the great glittering mirrorblazing bar struggled and laughed and shouted a drinksodden mass of humanity and all through the rest of the big room groups and knots of men stood and sat around the tables intent absorbed obsessed listening with strained ears watching with wild eyes reaching with shaking handsonly to gasp and throw down their cards and push rolls of gold toward coldfaced gamblers with a muttered curse this was the night of golden harvest for the blackgarbed steelnerved coldeyed cardsharps they knew the brevity of time and of hour and of life  in the dancinghalls there was a maddening whirl an immense and incredible hilarity a wild fling of unleashed burly men an honest drunken spree but there was also the hideous redeyed drunkenness that did not spring from drink the unveiled passion the brazen lure the raw corrupt and terrible presence of bad women in absolute license at a wild and baneful hour  that was the last payday beauty stantons dancinghall ever saw likewise it was to be the last she would ever see in the madness of that night there was written finalitythe end benton had reached its greatest wildest blackest vilest but not its deadliest that must comelateras an aftermath but the height or the depth was reached  the scene at midnight was unreal livid medieval dance of cannibals dance of sunworshipers dance of apaches on the warpath dance of cliffdwellers wild over the massacre of a dreaded foeonly these orgies might have been comparable to that whirl of gold and lust in beauty stantons parlors  benton seemed breathing hard laboring under its load of evil dancing toward its close  night wore on and the hour of dawn approached the lamps were dead the tents were dark the music was stilled and the low soft roar was but a hollow mockery of its earlier strength  like specters men staggered slowly and wanderingly through the gray streets gray ghosts all was gray a vacant laugh pealed out and a strident curse and then again the low murmur prevailed benton was going to rest weary drunken spent nature sought oblivionon disordered beds on hard floors and in dusty corners an immense and hovering shadow held the tents and halls and streets through this opaque gloom the silent and the mumbling revelers reeled along louder voices broke the spell only for an instant death lay in the middle of the main street in the dustand no passing man halted it lay as well down the side streets in sandy ditches and on tent floors and behind the bar of the gamblinghell and in a corner of beauty stantons parlor likewise death had his counterpart in hundreds of prostrate men who lay in drunken stupor asleep insensible to the dust in their faces no one answered the low moans of the man who stabbed and robbed had crawled so far and could crawl no farther  but the dawn would not stay back in order to hide bentons hideousness the gray lifted out of the streets the shadows lightened the east kindled and the sweet soft freshness of a desert dawn came in on the gentle breeze  and when the sun arose splendid and golden with its promise and beauty it shone upon a ghastly silent motionless sleeping benton     22  to allie lee again a prisoner in the clutches of durade the days in benton had been mysterious the nights dreadful in fear and trembling she listened with throbbing ears to footsteps and low voices ceaseless as of a passing army and a strange muffled roar rising and swelling and dying  durades caravan had entered benton in the dark allie had gotten an impression of wind and dust lights and many noisy hurried men and a crowded jumble of tents she had lived in the back room of a canvas house a door opened out into a little yard fenced high with many planks over or through which she could not see here she had been allowed to walk she had seen durade once the morning after fresno and his gang had brought her to benton when he had said that meals would be sent her and that she must stay there until he had secured better quarters he threatened to kill her if he caught her in another attempt to escape allie might have scaled the high fence but she was more afraid of the unknown peril outside than she was of him  she listened to the mysterious life of benton wondering and fearful and through the hours there came to her the nameless certainty of something tremendous and terrible that was to happen to her but spirit and hope were unquenchable not prayer nor reason nor ignorance was the source of her sustained and inexplicable courage a star shone over her destiny or a good angel hovered near she sensed in a vague and perplexing way that she must be the center of a mysterious cycle of events the hours were fraught with strain and suspense yet they passed fleetingly a glorious and saving moment was cominga meeting that would be as terrible as sweet benton held her lover neale and her friend larry they were searching for her she felt their nearness it was that which kept her alive she knew the truth with her heart and while she thrilled at the sound of every step she also shuddered for there was durade with his desperadoes blood would be spilled somewhere somehow that meeting would come neale would rush to her and the cowboy  allie remembered the red blaze of his face the singular piercing blue of his eye his cool easy careless air his drawling speechand underneath all his lazy gentleness a deadliness of blood and iron  so allie lee listened to all sounds particularly to all footsteps waiting for that one which was to make her heart stand still  some one had entered the room adjoining hers and was now fumbling at the rude door which had always been barred from the other side it opened stitt the mute who attended and guarded her appeared carrying bundles entering he deposited these upon allies bed then he made signs for her to change from the garb she wore to the clothes contained in the bundles further he gave her to understand that she was to hurry that she was to be taken away with that he went out shutting and barring the door after him  allies hands shook as she opened the packages that very hour might bring her freedom she was surprised to find a complete outfit of womans apparel well made and of fine material benton then had stores and women hurriedly she made the change which was very welcome the dress did not fit her as well as it might have done but the bonnet and cloak were satisfactory as were also the little boots she found a long dark veil and wondered if she was expected to put that on  a knocking at the door preceded a call allie are you ready  yes she replied  the door opened durade entered he appeared thinner than she had ever seen him with more white in or beneath his olive complexion and there were marks of strain and of passion on his face allie knew he labored under some strong suppressed excitement more and more he seemed to lose something of his old characterof the stately spanish manner  put that veil on he said im not ready for benton to see you  are youtaking me away she asked  only down the street ive a new place he replied come stitt will bring your things  allie could not see very well through the heavy veil and she stumbled over the rude threshold durade took hold of her arm and presently led her out into the light the air was hot windy dusty the street was full of hurrying and lounging men allie heard different snatches of speech as she and durade went on some stared and leered at her at which times durades hold tightened on her arm and his step quickened she was certain no one looked at durade some man jostled her another pinched her arm her ears tingled with unfamiliar coarse speech  they walked through heavy sand and dust then along a board walk to turn aside before what was apparently a new brick structure but a closer view proved it to be only painted wood the place rang hollow with a sound of hammers it looked well but did not feel stable underfoot durade led her through two large halllike rooms into a small one light and newly furnished  the best benton afforded said durade waving his hand youll be comfortable there are booksnewspapers heres a door opening into a little room its dark but theres water towel soap and youve a mirror allie this is luxury to what youve had to put up with  it is indeed she replied removing her veil and then the cloak and bonnet butam i to be shut up here  yes sometimes at night early ill take you out to walk but benton is  what she asked as he paused  benton will not last long he finished with a shrug of his shoulders therell be another one of these towns out along the line well go there and then to omaha  more than once he had hinted at going on eastward  ill find your mothersome day he added darkly if i didnt believe that id do differently by you  why  i want her to see you as good as she left you then are you ever going to tell me how she gave me the slip  shes dead i told you  allie thats a lie shes hiding in some trappers cabin or among the indians i should have hunted all over that country where you met my caravan but the scouts feared the sioux the sioux we had to run and so i never got the truth of your strange appearance on that trail  allie had learned that reiteration of the fact of her mothers death only convinced durade the more that she must be living while he had this hope she was safe so long as she obeyed him a dark and sinister meaning lay covert in his words she doubted not that he had the nature and the power to use her in order to be revenged upon her mother that passion and gambling appeared to be all for which he lived  suddenly he seized her fiercely in his arms youre the picture of her  then slowly he released her and the corded red of his neck subsided his action had been that of a man robbed of all he loved who remembered in a fury of violent longing hate and despair what he had lost in life allie was left alone  she gazed around the room that she expected to be her prison for an indefinite length of time walls and ceiling were sections locking together and in some places she could see through the cracks one side opened upon a tent wall the other into another room the small glass windows upon a house of canvas when allie put her hand against any part of her room she found that it swayed and creaked she understood then that this house had been made in sections transported to benton by train and hurriedly thrown together  she looked next at the newspapers how strange to read news of the building of the u p r the name of general lodge chief engineer made allie tremble he had predicted a fine future for warren neale she read that general lodge now had a special train and that he contemplated an inspection trip out as far as the rails were laid she read that the pacific construction company was reputed to be crossing the sierra nevada that there were ten thousand chinamen at work on the road that the day when east and west were to meet was sure to come eagerly she searched her heart thumping for the name of neale but she did not find it she read in one paper that the sioux were active along the line between medicine bow and kearney every day the workmen would sight a band of indians and growing accustomed to the sight they would become careless and so many lost their lives a massacre had occurred out on the western end of the road where the construction gangs were working day after day the sioux had prowled around without attacking until the hardy and reckless laborers lost fear and caution then one day a grading gang working a mile from the troops was set upon by a band of swiftly riding warriors and before they could raise a gun in defense were killed and scalped in their tracks  allie read on she devoured the news manifestly the world was awakening to the reality of the great railroad how glad neale must be always he had believed in the greatness and the reality of the u p r somewhere along that line he was workingperhaps every night he rode into benton her emotions overwhelmed her as she thought of him so near and for a moment she could not see the print neale would never again believe she was dead and indeed she did live she breathedshe was well strong palpitating she was sitting here in benton reading about the building of the railroad she wondered with a pang what her disappearance would mean to neale he had said his life would be over if he lost her again she shivered  suddenly her eye rested on printed letters familiar and startling allison lee  allison lee she breathed very low my father and she read that allison lee commissioner of the u p r and contractor for big jobs along the line would shortly leave his home in council bluffs to meet some of the directors in new york city in the interests of the railroad if durade and he ever meet she whispered and in that portent she saw loom on the gamblers horizon another cloud in his egotism and passion and despair he was risking more than he knew he could not hope to keep her a prisoner for very long allie felt again the gathering surety of an approaching climax  my danger is he may harm me use me for his gambling lure or kill me she murmured and her prevision of salvation contended with the dark menace of the hour but as always she rose above hopelessness  her thoughts were interrupted by the entrance of the mute stitt who brought her a few effects left at the former place and then a tray holding her dinner that day passed swiftly  darkness came bringing a strange augmentation of the sounds with which allie had become familiar she did not use her lamp for she had become accustomed to being without one and she seemed to be afraid of a light only a dim pale glow came in at her window but the roar of bentonthat grew as night fell she had heard something similar in the goldcamps of california and in the gradingcamps where durade had lingered this was at once the same and yet vastly different she lay listening and thinking the low roar was that of human beings and any one of its many constituents seemed difficult to distinguish voicesfootstepsmovementmusicmirthdancingclink of gold and glassesthe high shrill laugh of a womanthe loud vacant laugh of a mansudden gust of dustladen wind sweeping overhead all these blended in the mysterious sound that voiced the strife and agony of benton for hours it kept her awake and when she did fall asleep it was so late in the night that upon awakening next day she thought it must be noon or later  that day passed and another night came it brought a change in that the house she was in became alive and roaring durade had gotten his establishment under way allie lay in sleepless suspense rough noisy thickvoiced men appeared to be close to her in one of the rooms adjoining hers and outside in the tents the room however into which hers opened was not entered dawn had come before allie fell asleep  thus days passed during which she saw only the attendant stitt and allie began to feel a strain that she believed would be even harder on her than direct contact with benton life while she was shut up there what chance had she of ever seeing neale or larry even if they were in benton durade had said he would take her outdoors occasionally but she had not seen him restlessness and gloom began to weigh upon her and she was in continual conflict with herself she began to think of disobeying durade something would happen to him sooner or later and in that event what was she to do why not try and escape whatever the evil of benton it was possible that she might not fall into bad hands anything would be better than her confinement here with no sight of the sun with no one to speak to with nothing to do but brood and fight her fancies and doubts and listen to that ceaseless soft mysterious din allie believed she could not long bear that now and then occurred a change in her mind which frightened her it was a regurgitation of the old tide of somber horror which had submerged her after the murder of her mother  she was working herself into a frenzied state when unexpectedly durade came to her room at first glance she hardly knew him he looked thin and worn his eyes glittered his hands shook and the strange radiance that emanated from him when his passion for gambling had been crowned with success shone stronger than allie had ever seen it  allie the times come he said he seemed to be looking back into the past  what time she asked  for you to do for meas your mother did before you  iidont understand  make yourself beautiful  beautiful how allie had an inkling of what it meant but all her mind repudiated the horrible suggestion  durade laughed he had indeed changed he seemed a weaker man benton was acting powerfully upon him  how little vanity you have allie you are beautiful now or at any time youll be so when youre old or dead i mean for you to show more of your beauty let down your hair braid it a little put on a white waist open it at the neck you remember how your mother did  allie stared at him slowly paling she could not speak it had comethe crisis that she had dreaded  you look like a ghost durade exclaimed like she did years ago when i told herthis same thingthe first time  you mean to use meas you used her faltered allie  yes but you neednt be afraid or sick ill always be with you  what am i to do  be ready in the afternoon when i call you  i know now why my mother hated you burst out allie for the first time she too hated him and felt the stronger for it  shell pay for that hate and so will you he replied passionately his physical action seemed involuntarya shrinking as if from a stab then followed swift violence he struck allie across the mouth with his open hand a hard blow almost knocking her down  dont let me hear that from you again he continued furiously  with that he left the room closing but not barring the door  allie put her hand to her lips they were bleeding she tasted her own warm and salty blood then there was born in her something that burned and throbbed and swelled and drove out all her vacillations that blow was what she had needed there was a certainty now as to her peril just as there was imperious call for her to help herself and save herself  neale or larry will visit durades she soliloquized with her pulses beating fast and if they do not comesome one else will some man i can trust  therefore she welcomed durades ultimatum she paid more heed to the brushing and arranging of her hair and to her appearance than ever before in her life the white of her throat and neck mantled red as she exposed them intentionally for the gaze of men her beauty was to be used as had been her mothers but there would be some one who would understand some one to pity and help her  she had not long to meditate and wait she heard the heavy steps and voices of men entering the room next hers  presently durade called her with a beating heart allie rose and pushed open the door from that moment there never would be any more monotony for hernor peacenor safety yet she was glad and faced the room bravely for neale or larry might be there  durade had furnished this larger place luxuriously and evidently intended to use it for a private gamblingden where he would bring picked gamesters allie saw about eight or ten men who resembled miners or laborers  durade led her to a table that had been placed under some shelves which were littered with bottles and glasses he gave her instructions what to do when called upon saying that stitt would help her then motioning her to a chair he went back to the men it was difficult for her to raise her eyes and she could not at once do so  durade whos the girl asked a man  the gambler vouchsafed for reply only a mysterious smile  bet shes from california said another they bloom like that out there  now aint she your daughter queried a third  but durade chose to be mysterious in that he left his guests license for covert glances without the certainty which would permit of brutal boldness  they gathered around a table to play faro then durade called for drinks this startled allie and she hastened to comply with his demand when she lifted her eyes and met the glances of these menshe had a strange feeling that somehow recalled the california days her legs were weak under her a hot anger labored under her breast she had to drag her reluctant feet across the room her spirit sank and then leaped it whispered that looks and words and touches could only hurt and shame her for this hour of her evil plight they must rouse her resistance and cunning wit it was a fact that she was helpless for the present but she still lived and her love was infinite  fresno was there throwing dice with two soldiers to his ugliness had been added something that had robbed his face of the bronze tinge of outdoor life and had given it red and swollen lines and shades of beastly greed benton had made a bad man worse  mull was there heavier than when he had ruled the gradingcamp sodden with drink thicklipped and redcheeked burly brutal and still showing in every action and loud word the bully he was whirling a wheel and rolling a ball and calling out in his heavy voice with him was a little sallowfaced man like a wolf with sneaky downcast eyes and restless hands he answered to the name of andy these two were engaged in fleecing several blueshirted halfdrunken spikers  durade was playing faro with four other men or at least there were that number seated with him one whose back was turned toward allie wore black and looked and seemed different from the others he did not talk nor drink evidently his winning aggravated durade presently durade addressed the man as jones  then there were several others standing around dividing their attention between allie and the gamblers the door opened occasionally and each time a different man entered held a moments whispered conversation with durade and then went out these men were of the same villainous aspect that characterized fresno durade had surrounded himself with lieutenants and comrades who might be counted upon to do anything  allie was not long in gathering this fact nor that there were subtle signs of suspicion among the gamesters most of them had gotten under the influence of drink that durade kept ordering evidently he furnished this liquor free and with a purpose  the afternoons play ended shortly so far as allie could see jones the man in black a pale thinlipped coldeyed gambler was the only guest to win durades manner was not pleasant while he paid over his debts durade always had been a poor loser  jones youll sit in tomorrow said durade  maybe replied the other  why not youre winner retorted durade hotheaded in an instant  winners are choosers returned jones with an enigmatic smile his hard cold eyes shifted to allie and seemed to pierce her then went back to durade and mull and fresno plain it was to allie with her womans intuition that if jones returned it would not be because he trusted that trio durade apparently made an effort to swallow his resentment but the gambling pallor of his face had never been more marked he went out with jones and the others slowly followed  fresno approached allie  hullo gurly you sure look purtier than in thet buckskin outfit he leered  allie got up ready for fight or defense durade had forgotten her  fresno saw her glance at the door  hes goin to the bad he went on with his big hand indicating the door bentons too hot fer his kind hell not git up some fine mornin an youd better cotton to me you aint his kinan he hates you an you hate him i seen thet im no fool im sorta gone on you i wish i hadnt fetched you back to him  fresno ill tell durade replied allie forcing her lips to be firm if she expected to intimidate him she was disappointed  fresno leered wisely youd better not fer ill kill him an then youll be a sweet little chunk of meat among a lot of wolves  he laughed and his large frame lurched closer he wore a heavy gun and a knife in his belt also there protruded the butt of a pistol from the inside of his open vest allie felt the heat from his huge body and she smelled the whisky upon him and sensed the base faithless malignant animalism of the desperado assuredly if he had any fear it was not of durade  im sorta gone on you myself repeated fresno an durades a greaser hes runnin a crooked game all these games are crooked but benton wont stand for a polite greaser who talks sweet an gambles crooked mebbe no ones told you what this place benton is  i havent heard tell me replied allie she might learn from any one  fresno appeared at fault for speech bentons a beehive he replied presently an when the bees come home with their honey why the red ants an scorpions an centipedes an rattlesnakes git busy ive seen some places in my time butbenton beats em all say ill sneak you out at nights to see whats goin on an ill treat you handsome im sorta  the entrance of durade cut short fresnos further speech what are you saying to her demanded durade in anger  i was jest tellin her about what a place benton is replied fresno  allie is that true queried durade sharply  yes she replied  fresno i did not like your looks  boss if you dont like em you know what you can do rejoined fresno impudently and he lounged out of the room  allie these men are all bad said durade you must avoid them when my backs turned i cannot run my place without them so i am compelled to endure much  allies attendant came in with her supper and she went to her room  thus began allie lees life as an unwilling and innocent accomplice of durade in his retrogression from the status of a gambler to that of a criminal in california he had played the game diamond cut diamond but he had broken his hope spirit luck nerve were gone the bottle and benton had almost destroyed his skill at professional gambling  the days passed swiftly every afternoon durade introduced a new company to his private den few ever came twice in this there was a grain of hope for if all the men in benton or out on the road could only pass through durades hall the time would come when she would meet neale or larry she lived for that she was constantly on the lookout for a man she could trust with her story honestfaced laborers were not wanting in the stream of visitors durade ushered into her presence but either they were drunk or obsessed by gambling or she found no opportunity to make her appeal  these afternoons grew to be hideous for allie she had been subjected to every possible attention annoyance indignity and insult outside of direct violence she could only shut her eyes and ears and lips fresno found many opportunities to approach her sometimes in durades presence the gambler being blind to all but the cards and gold at such times allie wished she was sightless and deaf and feelingless but after she was safely in her room again she told herself nothing had happened she was still the same as she had always been and sleep obliterated quickly what she had suffered every day was one nearer to that fateful and approaching moment and when that moment did come what would all this horror amount to it would fadebe as nothing she would not let words and eyes harm her they were not tangiblethey had no substance for her they made her sick with rage and revolt at the moment but they had no power no taint no endurance they were evil passing winds  as she saw durades retrogression so she saw the changes in all about him his winnings were large and his strange passion for play increased with them the free gold that enriched fresno and mull and andy only augmented their native ferocity there were also durades other helpersblack his swarthy doorkeeper a pallid fellow called dayss who always glanced behind him and grist a short lame bulletheaded silent manall of them under the spell of the green cloth  with durades success had come the craze for bigger stakes and these could only be played for with other gamblers so the blackfrocked coldfaced sharps became frequent visitors at durades jones the professional won on that second visita fatal winning for him allie saw the giant fresno suddenly fling himself upon jones and bear him to the floor then allie fled to her room but she heard cursesa shota groandurades loud voice proclaiming that the gambler had cheatedand then the scraping of a heavy body being dragged out  this murder horrified allie yet sharpened her senses providence had protected her durade had grown richwildvainmad to pit himself against the coolest and most skilful gamblers in bentonand therefore his end was imminent allie lay in the dark listening to bentons strange wailing roar sad yet hideous and out of what she had seen and heard and from the mournful message on the night wind she realized how closely associated were gold and evil and men and how inevitably they must lead to lawlessness and to bloodshed and to death     23  neale conceived an idea that he was in line for the longlookedfor promotion neither the chief nor baxter gave any suggestion of a hint of such possibility but more and more as the work rapidly progressed neale had been intrusted with important inspections  long since he had discovered his talent for difficult engineering problems and with experience had come confidence in his powers he had been sent from place to place in each case with favorable results general lodge consulted him baxter relied upon him the young engineers learned from him and when baxter and his assistants were sent on ahead into the hills neale had an enormous amount of work on his hands still he usually managed to get back to benton at night  whereupon he became a seeker a searcher he believed there was not a tent or a hut or a store or a hall in the town that he had not visited but he found no clue of allie he never encountered the wellremembered face of the bandit fresno he saw more than one spaniard and many mexicans not one of whom could have been the gambler durade  but benton was too full too changeful too secret to be thoroughly searched in little time neale bore his burden although it grew heavier each day and his growing work on the railroad was his salvation  one morning he went to the telegraph station expecting orders from general lodge he found the chiefs special train at the station headed east  neale im off for omaha said lodge big powwow the directors roaring again  what about queried neale always alive to interest of that nature  cost of the construction what else neale there are two kinds of men building the u p rmen who see the meaning of the great work and the men who see only the gold in it  and they conflict thats what you mean  exactly weve been years on the job now and the nearer the meeting of rails from west to east the harder become our problems henney is played out boone is ill baxter wont last much longer if i were not an old soldier i would be done up now  chief i can see only success replied neale with spirit  assuredly we see with the same eyes said general lodge smiling neale ive a job for you that will make you grayheaded  hardly that returned neale laughing  do you remember the survey we made out here in the hills for number ten bridge made over two years ago  im not likely to forget it  well the rails are within twenty miles of number ten theyll be there presentlyand no piers to cross on  hows that  i dont know the report came in only last night its a queer document here it is study it at your leisure it seems a big force of men have been working there for months piers have been put inonly to sink  sink ejaculated neale whew thats a stumper chief the survey is mine ill never forget how i worked on it  could you have made a mistake  of course replied neale readily but id never believe that unless i saw it a tough job it wasbut just the kind of work i eat up  well you can go out and eat it up some more  that means ill have to camp out there i cant get back to benton  no you cant and isnt that just as well queried the chief with his keen dark glance on neale son ive heard your name coupled with gamblersand that stanton woman  no doubt i know them ive beenseeking some trace ofallie  you still hope to find her you still imagine some of this riffraff benton gang made off with her  yes  son its scarcely possible said lodge earnestly anderson claims the sioux got her we all incline to that oh its hard neale love and life are only atoms under the iron heel of the u p r its too late now you cant forgetnobut you must not risk your lifeyour opportunitiesyour reputation  neale turned away his face for a moment and was silent an engine whistled a bell began to ring some train official called to general lodge the chief held up his hand for a little more delay  im off he said rapidly neale youll go out to number ten and take charge  that surprised and thrilled neale into eagerness  who are the engineers  blake and coffee i dont know them henney sent them out from omaha theyre well recommended but thats no matter something is wrong youre to have full charge of engineers bosses masons in fact ive sent word out to that effect  whos the contractor asked neale  i dont know but whoever he is he has made a pile of money out of this job and the jobs not done thats what galls me  well chief it will be done said neale sharp with determination  good neale ill start east with another load off my shoulders and son if you throw up a bridge so therell be no delay something temporary for the rails and the worktrain and then plan piers right for number tenwellyoull hear from it thats all they shook hands  i may be gone a week or a monthi cant tell went on the chief but when i do come ill probably have a trainload of directors commissioners stockholders  bring them on said neale maybe if they saw more of what were up against they wouldnt holler so  right remember youve full charge and that i trust you implicitly goodby and good luck  the chief boarded his train as it began to move neale watched it leave the station and with a swelling heart he realized that he had been placed high that his premonition of advancement had not been without warrant  the worktrain was backing into the station and would depart westward in short order neale hurried to his lodgings to pack his few belongings larry was lying on his cot fully dressed and asleep neale shook him  wake up you lazy sonofagun shouted neale  larry opened his eyes wal whats wrong is it last night or tomorrow  larry im off got charge of a big job  is thet all drawled larry sleepily why shore i always knowed youd be chief engineer some day  pardsit up said neale unsteadily will you stay soberand watchand listen for some news of allie till i come back to benton  neale air you still dreamin asked larry incredulously  will you do that much for me  shore  thank you old friend goodby now ive got to rustle he left larry sitting on his cot staring at nothing on the way to the station neale encountered the gambler place hough who despite his nocturnal habits was an early riser in the excitement of the hour neale gave way to an impulse briefly he told hough about allieher disappearance and probable hidden presence in benton and he asked the gambler to keep his eyes and ears open hough seemed both surprised and pleased with the confidence and he said he would go out of his way to help neale  neale had to run to catch the train a brawny irishman extended a redsleeved arm to help him up  up wid yez thor  neale found himself with bag and rifle and blanket sprawling on the gravelcovered floor of a flat car casey the old lineman grinned at him over the familiar short black pipe  bgorra its me ould frind neale  it sure is howre you casey  pritty good fur an ould soldier an its news i hear of yez me boy  what news  shure yez hed a boost gineral lodge hisself wor tellin grady the boss that yez had been given charge of number ten  yes thats correct  im dom glad to hear ut declared the irishman but yez hev a hell of a job in thot number ten  so ive been told what do you know about it casey  shure ut aint much a frind of mine was muxin mortor over there an he sez whin the crick was dry ut hed a bottom but whin wet ut shure hed none  then i have got a job on my hands replied neale grimly  those days it took the worktrain several hours to reach the end of the rails neale rode by some places with a profound satisfaction in the certainty that but for him the track would not yet have been spiked there construction was climbing fast into the hills he wondered when and where would be the longlookedfor meeting of the rails connecting east with west word had drifted over the mountains that the pacific division of the construction was already in utah  at the camp colonel dillon offered neale an escort of troopers out to number ten but neale decided he could make better time alone there had been no late sign of the indians in that locality and he knew both the road and the trail  early next morning mounted on a fast horse he set out it was a melancholy ride several times he had been over that ground once traveling west with larry full of ardor and joy at the prospect of soon seeing allie lee and again on the return in despair at the loss of her  he rode the twenty miles in three hours the camp of dirty tents was clustered in a hot valley surrounded by hills sparsely fringed with trees neale noted the timber as a lucky augury to his enterprise it was an idle camp full of lolling laborers  as neale dismounted a mexican came forward  look after the horse said neale and taking his luggage he made for a big tent with a fly extended in front several men sat on campchairs round a table one of them got up and stepped out  wheres blake and coffee inquired neale  im blake was the reply and theres coffee are you mr neale  yes  coffee heres our new boss called blake as he took part of neales baggage  coffee appeared to be a sunburnt middleaged man rather bluff and hearty in his greeting the younger engineer blake was a tanned thinfaced individual with a shifty gaze and constrained manner the third fellow they introduced as a lineman named somers neale had not anticipated a cordial reception and felt disposed to be generous  have you got quarters for me here he inquired  sure theres lots of room and a cot replied coffee  they carried neales effects inside the tent it was large and spare containing table and lamp boxes for seats several cots and bags  its hot got any drinkingwater asked neale taking off his coat next he opened his bag to take things out then drank thirstily of the water offered him he did not care much for this part of his new task these engineers might be sincere and competent but he had been sent on to judge their work and the situation was not pleasant neale had observed many engineers come and go during his experience on the road and that fact together with the authority given him and his loyalty to the chief gave him cause for worry he hoped and he was ready to believe that these engineers had done their best on an extremely knotty problem  we got lodges telegram last night said coffee kinda sudden it jarred us  no doubt im sorry what was the message  lodge never wastes words replied the engineer shortly but he did not vouchsafe the information for which neale had asked  neale threw his notebook upon the dusty table and sitting down on the box he looked up at the men both engineers were studying him intently almost eagerly neale imagined  number tens a tough nut to crack eh he inquired  weve been here three months replied blake  wait till you see that quicksand hole added coffee  quicksand it was a dry solid streambed when i ran the line through here and drew the plans for number ten declared neale  coffee and blake stared blandly at him so did the lineman somers  you did you draw the plans weweve been working on asked coffee  yes i did answered neale slowly it struck him that blake had paled slightly neale sustained a slight shock of surprise and antagonism he bent over his notebook opening it to a clean page fighting his first impressions he decided they had arisen from the manifest dismay of the engineers and their consciousness of a blunder  lets get down to notes neale went on taking up his pencil youve been here three months  yes  with what force  two hundred men on and off  whos the gang boss  colohan hes had some of the biggest contracts along the line  neale was about to inquire the name of the contractor but he refrained governed by one of his peculiar impulses  anybody working when you got here he went on  yes masons had been cutting stone for six weeks  whats been done  coffee laughed harshly we got the three piers ingood and solid on dry bottom then along comes the rainand our work melts into the quicksand since then weve been trying to do it over  but why did this happen in the first place  coffee spread wide his arms ask me something easy why was the bottom dry and solid why did it rain why did solid earth turn into quicksand  neale slapped the notebook shut and rose to his feet gentlemen that is not the talk of engineers he said deliberately  the hell you say what is it then burst out coffee his face flushing redder  ill inform you later replied neale turning to the lineman somers tell this gang boss colohan i want him  neale left the tent he had started to walk away when he heard blake speak up in a fierce undertone  didnt i tell you were up against it  and coffee growled a reply neale could not understand but the tone of it was conclusive these men had made a serious blunder and were blaming each other hating each other for it neale was conscious of anger this section of line came under his survey and he had been proud to be given such important and difficult work incompetent or careless engineers had bungled number ten neale strode on among the idle and sleeping laborers between the tents and then past the blacksmiths shop and the feed corrals down to the river  a shallow stream of muddy water came murmuring down from the hills it covered the wide bed that neale remembered had been a dry sandandgravel waste on each side the abutment piers had been undermined and washed out not a stone remained in sight the banks were hollowed inward and shafts of heavy boards were sliding down in the middle of the stream stood a cofferdam in course of building and near it another that had collapsed these frameworks almost hid the tip of the middle pier which had evidently slid over and was sinking on its side there was no telling what had been sunk in that hole all the surroundingsthe tons of stone cut and uncut the piles of muddy lumber the platforms and rafts the crevices in the worn shores up and down both sidesall attested to the long weeks of fruitless labor and to the engulfing mystery of that shallow murmuring stream  neale returned thoughtfully to camp blake and coffee were sitting under the fly in company with a stalwart irishman  fine sinkhole you picked out for number ten dont you think queried blake  neale eyed his interrogator with somewhat of a penetrating glance blake did not meet that gaze frankly  yes its a sinkhole all right andno mistake replied neale its just what i calculated when i ran the plans did you follow those plans  blake appeared about to reply when coffee cut him short certainly we did he snapped  then where are the breakwaters asked neale sharply  breakwaters ejaculated coffee his surprise was sincere  yes breakwaters retorted neale i drew plans for breakwaters to be built upstream so that in high water the rapid current would be directed equally between the piers and not against them  oh yes whywe must have gotit mixed replied coffee thought they were to be built last wasnt that it blake  sure replied his colleague but his tone lacked something  ahi see said neale slowly  then the big irishman got up to extend a huge hand im colohan he boomed  neale liked the bronzed rough face goodnatured and intelligent and he was aware of a shrewd pair of gray eyes taking his measure why these men seemed to want to look through neale might have been natural enough but somehow it struck him strangely he had come there to help them not to discharge them colohan however did not rouse neales antagonism as the others had done  colohan are you sick of this job queried neale after greeting the boss  yesan no replied colohan  you want to quit then went on neale bluntly the irishman evidently took this curt query as a foreword of the coming dismissal he looked shamed crestfallen at a loss to reply  dont misunderstand me continued neale im not going to fire you but if you are sick of the job you can quit ill boss the gang myself the rails will be here in ten days and im going to have a trestle over that hole so the rails can cross no holding up the work at this stage of the game theres near five thousand men in the gangs back along the linecoming fast theyve all got just one ideasuccess the u p r is going through soon out here the rails will meet colohan make it a matter of your preference will you stick  you bet he replied heartily a ruddy glow emanated from his face neale was quick to sense that this irishman like casey had an honest love for the railroad whatever he might feel for the labor  get on the job then ordered neale cheerily well hustle while theres daylight well have that trestle ready when the rails get here  coffee laughed scornfully neale that sounds fine but its impossible until the trains get here with piles and timbers iron and other stuff we meant to run up a trestle then  i dare say replied neale but the u p r did not start that way and never would finish that way  well youll have your troubles declared coffee troubles do you imagine im going to think of myself retorted neale these fellows were beginning to get on his nerves coffee grew sullen blake shifted uneasily from foot to foot colohan beamed upon neale come on with them orders he said  right send men up on the hills to cut and trim trees for piles and beams find a way or make one for horses to snake down these timbers haul that piledriver down to the river and set it up have the engineer start up steam and try out look the blacksmith shop over to see if theres iron enough if not telegraph benton for morefor whatever you wantand send wagons back to the end of the rails thats all for this time colohan  all right chief replied the boss and he saluted then he turned sneeringly to blake and coffee did you hear them orders im not takin none from you again theyre from the chief  colohans manner or tone or the word chief amazed coffee he looked nasty  go on and work then you big irish paddy he said violently your chiefblarney doesnt fool us youre only working to get on the right side of your new boss let me tell youyoure in this number ten deal as deepas deep as we are  it had developed that there was hatred between these men colohans face turned fiery red and looming over coffee he looked the quicktempered and dangerous nature of his class coffee im sayin this to your face right now i aint deep in this number ten deal i obeyed ordersan damn strange ones some of them  neale intervened and perhaps prevented a clash dont quarrel men sure theres bound to be a little friction for a day or so but well soon get to working  colohan strode away without another word his brawny shoulders were expressive of a doubt  get me my plans for number ten construction said neale pleasantly for he meant to do his share at making the best of it  blake brought the plans and spread them out on the table  will you both go over them with me inquired neale  whats the use returned coffee disgustedly neale youre thickheaded  yes i guess so rejoined neale constrainedly thats why general lodge sent me up hereover your clear heads  no retort was forthcoming from the two disgruntled engineers neale went into the tent and drew a seat up to the table he wanted to be aloneto study his plansto think about the whole matter he found his old figures and drawings as absorbing as a good story still there came breaks in his attention blake walked into the tent several times as if to speak and each time he retired silently again some messenger brought a telegram to one of the engineers outside and it must have caused the whispered colloquy that followed finally they went away and neale getting to work in earnest was not disturbed until called for supper  neale ate at a messtable with the laborers and enjoyed his meal the paddies always took to him one thing he gathered early was the fact that number ten bridge was a joke with the men this sobered neale and he left the cheery bantering company for a quiet walk alone  it was twilight down in the valley while still daylight up on the hilltops a faint glow remained from the sunset but it faded as neale looked he walked a goodly distance from camp so as to be out of earshot the cool night air was pleasant after the hot day it fanned his face and the silence the darkness the stars calmed him a lonely wolf mourned from the heights and the long wail brought to mind slingerlands cabin then it was only a quick step to memory of allie lee and neale drifted from the perplexities and problems of his new responsibility to haunting memories hopes doubts fears  when he returned to the tent he espied a folded paper on the table in the yellow lamplight it was a telegram addressed to him it said that back salaries and retention of engineers were at his discretion and was signed lodge this message nonplussed neale the chief must mean that blake and coffee would not be paid for past work nor kept for future work unless neale decided otherwise while he was puzzling over this message the engineers came in  say what do you make of this demanded neale and he shoved the telegram across the table toward them  both men read it coffee threw his coat over on his cot and then lit his pipe  what i make of this isi lose three months back pay nine hundred dollars he replied puffing a cloud of smoke  and i lose six hundred supplemented blake  neale leaned back and gazed up at his subordinates he felt a subtle change in them they had arrived at some momentous decision  but this message reads at my discretion said neale its a plain surprise to me ive no intention of making you lose your back pay or of firing you either  youll probably do bothunless we can get together asserted coffee  well cant we get together  that remains to be seen was the enigmatic reply  ill need you both went on neale thoughtfully weve a big job weve got to put a force of men on the piers while were building the trestle maybe ill fall down myself heavens ive made blunders myself i cant condemn you fellows im willing to call off all talk about past performances and begin over again  neale felt that this proposition should have put another light on the question that it should have been received appreciatively if not enthusiastically but he was somewhat taken aback by the fact that it was not  ahem well we can talk it over tomorrow yawned coffee  neale made no more overtures busied himself with his notes for an hour and then sought his cot  next morning bright and early neale went down to the river to make his close inspection of what had been done toward building number ten from colohan he ascertained the number of shafts and cofferdams sunk from the masons he learned the amount of stone cut to patterns and he was not only amazed and astounded but overwhelmed and incensed beyond expression the labor had been prodigious hundreds of tons of material had been sunk there and that meant that hundreds of thousands of dollars also had been sunk  upon investigation neale found that although many cribbings had been sunk for the piers they had never been put deep enough and there were cofferdams that did not dam at alluseless senseless wastes of time and material not to say wages his plans called for fifty thirtyfoot piles driven to bedrock which according to the excavations he had had made at the time of survey was forty feet below the surface not a pile had been driven there had been no solid base for any of the cribbings no foundations for the piers  at the discovery the blood burned hot in neales face and neck  no blunder no incompetence no misreading of my plans but a rotten deliberate deal work done over and over again oh i see it all now general lodge knew it without ever coming here the same old story that black stainthat dishonor on the great work  graft graft  he clambered out of the wet and muddy hole and up the bank then he saw blake sauntering across the flat toward him neale sat down abruptly to hide his face and fury giving himself the task of scraping mud from his boots when blake got there neale had himself fairly well in hand  hello neale said blake suavely collected some mud i see its sure a dirty job  yes its been dirty in more ways than mud i guess replied neale the instant his voice sounded in his ears it unleashed his temper  sure has been a pile of moneydirty government moneysunk in there rejoined blake he spoke with assurance that surprised neale into a desire to see how far he would go  blake its an ill wind that blows nobody good  a moment of silence passed before blake spoke again sure and itll blow you good too he said breathing hard  every man has his price replied neale lightly  then he felt a big soft roll of bills stuffed into his hand he took it trembling all over he wanted to spring erect to fling that bribe in its givers face but he could control himself a moment longer  blake whos the contractor on this job he queried rapidly  dont you know  i dont  well we supposed you knew its lee  neale started as if he had received a stab the name hurt him in one way and was a shock in another  allison leethe commissioner he asked thickly  sure oh were in right neale replied blake with a laugh of relief  swift as an indian and as savagely neale sprang up he threw the roll of bills into blakes face  you try to bribe me me burst out neale passionately you think ill take your dirty moneycover up your crooked job why you sneak you thief you dog  he knocked blake down holdonneale gasped blake he raised himself on his elbow half stunned  pick up that money ordered neale and he threatened blake again hurry now march for camp  neale walked the young engineer into the presence of his superior coffee sat his table under the fly with somers and another man colohan appeared on the moment and there were excited comments from others near by coffee stood up his face turned yellow his lips snarled  coffee heres your side partner called neale and his voice was biting ive got you both dead to rights you liars you never even tried to work on my plans for number ten  neale what in hell do you suppose were out here for demanded coffee harshly theyre all getting a slice of this money theres barrels of it the directors of the road are crooked they play both ends against the middle they borrow money from the government and then pay it out to themselves youre one of these dreamers youre lodges pet but you cant scare me  coffee if there was any law out here for stealing youd go to jail declared neale youre a thief same as this pup who tried to bribe me youre worse youve held up the line youve ordered your rotten work done over and over again this is treachery to general lodgeto henney who sent you out here and to me itsitstheres no name low enough i surveyed the line through here i drew the plans for number ten and im going to prove you both cheats you and your contractor  neale theres more than us in the deal said coffee sullenly  colohan strode close big and formidable if you mean me youre a liar he declared an dont say it coffee was plainly intimidated and colohan turned to neale boss i swear i wasnt in on this deal lately i guessed it was all wrong but all i could do was obey orders  neale you cant prove anything sneered coffee if you have any sense youll shut up i tell you this is only a little deal im on the inside i know financiers commissioners congressmen and senatorsand i told you before the directors are all in on this u p r pickings youre a fool  maybe but im no thief retorted neale  shut up will you shouted coffee who plainly did not take kindly to that epithet before the gathering crowd im no thief men get shot out here for saying less than that  neale laughed he read coffees mind that worthy responding to the wildness of the time and place meant to cover his tracks one way or another and neale had not lived long with larry red king for nothing  coffee you are a thief declared neale striding forward the worst kind because you stole without risk you cant be punished but ill carry this deal higher than you and quick as a flash neale snatched some telegrams from coffees vest pocket the act infuriated coffee his face went purple  hand em back he yelled his arm swinging back to his hip  ill bet theres a telegram here from lee and im entitled to keep it responded neale coolly and slowly  then as coffee furiously jammed his hand back for his gun neale struck him coffee fell with the overturned table out in the sand his gun dropped as he dropped neale was there light and quick he snatched up the gun  coffee you and blake are to understand youre fired said neale fired off the job and out of camp just as you are  fifteen days later the worktrain crossed number ten on a trestle and the construction progressed with new impetus  not many days later a train of different character crept slowly foot by foot over that temporary bridge it carried passengercoaches a private car containing the directors of the railroad and general lodges special car the engine was decorated with flags and the engineer whistled a piercing blast as he rolled out upon the structure number ten had been the last big obstacle  as fortune would have it neale happened on the moment to be standing in a significant and thrilling position for himself and for all who saw him and that happened to be in the middle of the stream opposite the trestle on the masonry of the middle pier now two feet above the cofferdam he was as wet and muddy as the laborers with him  engineer fireman brakemen and passengers cheered him for neale the moment was unexpected and simply heartswelling never in his life had he felt so proud and yet stinging among these sudden sweet emotions was a nameless pang  presently neale espied general lodge leaning out of a window of his car he was waving neale pointed down at his feet at the solid masonry and then circling his mouth with his hands he yelled with all his might  bedrock  his chief yelled back youre a soldier  that perhaps in the excitement and joy of the moment was the greatest praise the army officer could render nothing could have pleased neale more  the train passed over the trestle and on out of sight upon its return about the middle of the afternoon it stopped in camp a messenger came with word for neale to report at once to the directors he hurried to his tent to secure his papers and then wet and muddy he entered the private car of the directors  it contained only four mengeneral lodge and warburton rogers and rudd all except the tall whitehaired warburton were comfortable in shirtsleeves smoking with a table between them the instant neale entered their presence he divined that he faced a big moment in his life  the chiefs manner like larry kings when there was something in the wind seemed quiet easy potential his searching glance held warmth and a gleam that thrilled neale but he was ceremonious not permitting himself his old familiarity before these dignitaries of the great railroad  gentlemen you remember mr neale said lodge  they were cordialpleasant  warburton vigorously shook neales hand and leaned back after the manner of matured men to look neale over  young man im glad to meet you again he declared in his big voice remember him well i dothough hes thinner older  small wonder interposed the chief hes been doing a mans work  neale back there in omaha you got soreyou quit us went on warburton reprovingly that was bad business i cottoned to youand i might havebut no matter youre with us again  mr warburton im ashamed of that replied neale hastily but i was hotheaded am so still i fear  so am i so is lodge so is any man worth a damn replied the director  mr neale you look cool enough now observed rogers smiling wish i was as wet and cool as you are its hotin this desert  warburton took off his frockcoat you gentlemen arent going to have any the best of me and now neale tell us things  neale looked at his papers and then at his chief for instance said lodge tell us about blake and coffee  havent you seen themheard from them inquired neale  no henney has not either and they were his men  gentlemen im afraid i lost my head in regard to them  explain please said warburton we will judge your conduct  it was a rather difficult moment for neale because his actions regarding the two engineers now appeared to have been the result of violent temper rather than a dignified exercise of authority but then as he remembered blakes offer and coffees threat the heat thrilled along his nerves and that stirred him to forceful expression  i drove them both out of this camp  why queried warburton sharply  blake tried to bribe me and coffee  one at a time interrupted warburton and he thrust a strong hand through his hair ruffling it he began to scent battle what did blake try to bribe you to do  he didnt say but he meant me to cover their tracks  so and what did coffee do  he tried to pull a gun on me  why be explicit please  well he threatened me and i laughed at himcalled him names  what names  quite a lot if i remember the one he objected to was thief i repeated that and snatched some telegrams from his pocket he tried to draw his gun on meand then i drove them both out of camp they got through safely for they were seen in benton  sir it appears to me you lost your head to good purpose said warburton now just what were the tracks they wanted you to cover  i drew the original plans for number ten they had not followed them to be exact they did not drive piles to hold the cribbings for the piers they did not go deep enough they sank shafts they built cofferdams they put in piers over and over again there was forty feet of quicksand under all their work and of course it slipped and sank  warburton slowly got up he was growing purple in the face his hair seemed rising he doubled a huge fist over and over again he roared furiously over and over again lodge do you hear that  yes sounds kind of familiar to me replied the chief with one of his rare smiles he was beyond rage now he saw the end he alone perhaps had realized the nature of that great work and that smile had been sad as well as triumphant  warburton stamped up and down the car aisle manifestly he wanted to smash something or to take out his anger upon his comrades that was not the quick rage of a moment it seemed the bursting into flame of a smoldering fire he used language more suited to one of bentons dancehalls than the private car of the directors of the union pacific railroad once he stooped over lodge pounded the table  three hundred thousand dollars sunk in that quicksand hole he thundered over and over again thats what galls me work done over and overunnecessaryworse than uselessall for dirty gold not for the railroad but for gold god what a band of robbers weve dealt with lodge why in hell didnt you send neale out here at the start  a shadow lay dark in the chiefs lined face why had he not done a million other things why indeed he did not answer the irate director  three hundred thousand dollars sunk in that holefor nothing shouted warburton in a final explosion  the other two directors laughed pooh exclaimed rogers softly what is that a drop in the bucket consult your notebook warburton  and that speech cooled the fighting director it contained volumes it evidently struck home warburton growled he mopped his red face he fell into a seat  lodge excuse me he said apologetically what our fine young friend here told me was like some one stepping on my gouty foot ive been maybe a little too zealoustoo exacting then im old and testy what does it matter how could it have been prevented alas its black like that hideous benton but were coming out into the light lodge didnt you tell me this number ten bridge was the last obstacle  i did the rails will go down now fast and straight till they meet out there in utah soon  warburton became composed the red died out of his face he looked at neale  young man can you put permanent piers in that sinkhole  yes they are started on bedrock replied neale  bedrock he repeated and remained gazing at neale fixedly then he turned to lodge do you remember that wild redhead cowboyneales friendwhen he said i reckon thets aboot all ill never forget him lodge say we have lee and his friend senator dunn come in and get it over an thetll be aboot all  thank heaven replied the chief fervently he called to his porter but as no one replied general lodge rose and went into the next car  neale had experienced a disturbing sensation in his breast lee allison lee the mere name made him shake he could not understand but he felt there was more reason for its effect on him than his relation to allison lee as a contractor somewhere there was a man named lee who was allies father and neale knew he would meet him some day  then when the chief walked back into the car with several frockcoated individuals neale did recognize in the pale face of one a resemblance to the girl he loved  there were no greetings this situation had no formalities warburton faced them and he seemed neither cold nor hot  mr lee as a director of the road i have to inform you that following the reports of our engineer here your present contracts are void and you will not get any more  a white radiance of rage swiftly transformed allison lee his eyes seemed to blaze purple out of his white face  and neale knew him to be allies fathersaw the beauty and fire of her eyes in his  warburton youll reconsider i have great influence  to hell with your influence retorted warburton the lion in him rising the buildersthe directorsthe owners of the u p r are right here in this car do you understand that do you demand that i call a spade a spade  i have been appointed by congress i will  congress or no congress you will never rebuild a foot of this railroad thundered warburton he stood there glaring final assured for the sake of youryour government connections let us saylet well enough alone  this upstart boy of an engineer burst out lee in furious resentment who is he how dare he accuse or report against me  mr lee your name has never been mentioned by him replied the director  lee struggled for selfcontrol but warburton its preposterous he protested this wild boythe associate of desperadoeshis report whatever it isabsurd absurd as opposed to my position a cub surveyorslick with tongue and figuresto be thrown in my face its outrageous ill have him  warburton held up a hand and impelled lee to silence in that gesture neale read what stirred him to his soul it was coming he saw it again in general lodges fleeting rare smile he held his breath the old pang throbbed in his breast  lee pray let me enlighten you and senator dunn said warburton sonorously and terminate this awkward interview when the last spike is driven out herepresentlymr neale will be chief engineer of maintenance of way of the union pacific railroad     24  so for neale the wonderful dream had come to pass and but for the memory that made all hours of life bitter his cup of joy would have been full  he made his headquarters in benton and spent his days riding east or west over the line taking up the great responsibility he had long trained forthe maintaining of the perfect condition of the railroad  toward the end of that month neale was summoned to omaha  the message had been signed warburton upon arriving at the terminus of the road neale found a marvelous change even in the short time since he had been there omaha had become a city it developed that warburton had been called back to new york leaving word for neale to wait for orders  neale availed himself of this period to acquaint himself with the men whom he would deal with in the future among them and in the roar of the railroad shops and the bustle of the city he lost perhaps temporarily that haunting sense of pain and gloom despite himself the deference shown him was flattering and his old habit of making friends reasserted itself his place was assured now there were rumors in the air of branch lines for the union pacific he was consulted for advice importuned for positions invited here and there so that the days in omaha were both profitable and pleasurable  then came a telegram from warburton calling him to washington dc  it took more than two days to get there and the time dragged slowly for neale it seemed to him that his importance grew as he traveled a fact which was amusing to him all this resembled a dream  when he reached the hotel designated in the telegram it was to receive a warm greeting from warburton  its a long trip to make for nothing said the director and thats what it amounts to now i thought id need you to answer a few questions for me but youll not be questioned officially and so youd better keep a close mouth weve raised the money the completion of the upr is assured  neale could only conjecture what those questions might have been for the director offered no explanation and this circumstance recalled to mind his former impression of the complexity of the financial and political end of the construction warburton took him to dinner and later to a club and introduced him to many men  for this alone neale was glad that he had been summoned to the capital he met senators congressmen and other government officials and many politicians and prominent men all of whom he was surprised to note were well informed regarding the union pacific he talked with them but answered questions guardedly and he listened to discussions and talks covering every phase of the work from the credit mobilier to the chinese coolies that were advancing from the west to meet the paddies of his own division  how strange to realize that the great railroad had its nucleus its impetus and its completion in such a center as this here were the frockcoated softvoiced cigarsmoking gentlemen among whom warburton and his directors had swung the colossal enterprise what a vast difference between these men and the builders with the handsome whitehaired warburton and his associates as they smoked their rich cigars and drank their wine neale contrasted casey and mcdermott and many another burly spiker or teamster out on the line each class was necessary to this task these easterners talked of money of gold as a grade foreman might have talked of gravel they smoked and conversed at ease laughing at sallies gossiping over what was a tragedy west of north platte and about them was an air of luxury of power of importance and a singular grace that neale felt rather than saw  strangest of all to him was the glimpse he got into the labyrinthine plot built around the stock the finance the gold that was constructing the road he was an engineer with a deductive habit of mind but he would never be able to trace the intricacy of this monumental aggregation of deals yet he was hugely interested much of the scorn and disgust he had felt out on the line for the mercenaries connected with the work he forgot here among these frockcoated gentlemen  an hour later neale accompanied warburton to the station where the director was to board a train for his return to new york  youll start back tomorrow said warburton ill see you soon i hopeout there in utah where the last spike is to be driven that will be the daythe hour it will be celebrated all over the united states  neale returned to his hotel trying to make out the vital thing that had come to him on this hurried and apparently useless journey his mind seemed in a whirl yet as he pondered there gradually loomed up the reflection that in the eastern or constructive end of the great plan there were the same spirits of evil and mystery as existed in the western or building end here big men were interested involved out there bigger men sweat and burned and aged and died the difference was that these toilers gave all for an ideal while the directors and their partners thought only of money of profits  neale restrained what might have been contempt but he thought that if these financiers could have seen the life of the diggers and spikers as he knew it they might be actuated by a nobler motive before he dropped to sleep that night he concluded that his trip to washington and the recognition accorded him by warburtons circle had fixed a new desire in his heart to heave some more rails and drive some more spikes for the railroad he loved so well to him the work had been something for which he had striven with all his might and for which he had risked his life not only had his brain been given to the creation but his muscles had ached from the actual physical toil attendant upon this biggest of big jobs  when neale at last reached benton it was night benton and night and he had forgotten a mob of men surged down and up on the train neale had extreme difficulty in getting off at all but the excitement the hurry the discordant and hoarse medley of many voices were unusual at that hour around the station even for strenuous benton all these men were carrying baggage neale shouted questions into passing ears until at length some fellow heard and yelled a reply  the last night of benton  he understood then the great and vile construction camp had reached the end of its career it was being torn downmoved awaydepopulated there was an exodus in another fortyeight hours all that had been benton with its accumulated life and gold and toil would be incorporated in another and a greater and a last camproaring city  the contrast to the beautiful washington the check to his halfdreaming memory of what he had experienced there the sudden plunge into this dimlighted sordid and roaring hell all brought about in neale a revulsion of feeling  and with the sinking of his spirit there returned the old haunting pangsthe memory of allie lee the despairing doubts of life or death for her beyond the camp loomed the dim hills mystical secretive and unchangeable if she were out there among them dead or alive to know it would be a blessed relief it was this horror of benton that he feared  he walked the street up and down up and down until the hour was late and he was tired all the halls and saloons were blazing in full blast once he heard low hoarse cries and pistolshotsand then again quick dull booming guns how strange they should make him shiver but all seemed strange from these sounds he turned away not knowing what to do or where to go since sleep or rest was impossible finally he went into a gamblingden and found a welcome among players whose faces he knew  it was bentons last night and there was something in the air menacing terrible  neale gave himself up to the spirit of the hour and the game he had almost forgotten himself when a white jeweled hand flashed over his shoulder to touch it softly he heard his name whispered looking up he saw the flushed and singularly radiant face of beauty stanton     25  the afternoon and night of payday in benton during which allie lee was barred in her room were hideous sleepless dreadful hours her ears were filled with bentons roarwhispers and wails and laughs thick shouts of drunken men the cold voices of gamblers clink of gold and clink of glasses a ceaseless tramp and shuffle of boots pistolshots muffled and far away pistolshots ringing and near at hand the angry hum of brawling men and strangest of all this dreadful roar were the highpitched piercing voices of women in songs without soul in laughter without mirth in cries wild and terrible and mournful  allie lay in the dark praying for the dawn shuddering at this strife of sound fearful that any moment the violence of benton would burst through the flimsy walls of her room to destroy her but the roar swelled and subsided and died away the darkness gave place to gray light and then dawn the sun arose the wind began to blow now benton slept the sleep of sheer exhaustion  her mirror told allie the horror of that night her face was white her eyes were haunted by terrors with great dark shadows beneath she could not hold her hands steady  late that afternoon there were stirrings and sounds in durades hall the place had awakened presently durade himself brought her food and drink he looked haggard worn yet radiant he did not seem to note allies condition or appearance  that deaf and dumb fool who waited on you is gone said durade yesterday was payday in benton many are gone allie i won fifty thousand dollars in gold  isnt that enough she asked  he did not hear her but went on talking of his winnings of gold of games and of big stakes coming his lips trembled his eyes glittered his fingers clawed at the air  for allie it was a relief when durade left her he had almost reached the apex of his fortunes and the inevitable end allie realized that if she were ever to lift a hand to save herself she must do so at once  this was a fixed and desperate thought in her mind when durade called her to her work  allie always entered that private den of durades with eyes cast down she had been scorched too often by the glances of men as she went in this time she felt the presence of gamblers but they were quieter than those to whom she had become accustomed durade ordered her to fetch drinks then he went on talking rapidly in excitement elated boastful almost gay  allie did not look up as she carried the tray to the large table she heard a man whisper low by jove hough thats the girl  then she heard a slight quick intake of breath and the exclamation good god  both voices thrilled allie the former seemed the low wellmodulated refined and drawling speech of an englishman the latter was keen quick soft and full of genuine emotion allie returned to her chair by the sideboard before she ventured to look up durade was playing cards with four men three of whom were blackgarbed after the manner of professional gamblers the other player wore gray and a hat of unusual shape with wide loose cloth band he removed his hat as he caught allies glance and she associated the act with the fact of her presence she thought that this must be the man whose voice had proclaimed him english he had a fair face lined and shadowed and dissipated with tired blue eyes and a blond mustache that failed to altogether hide a wellshaped mouth it was the kindest and saddest face allie had ever seen there she read its story in her extremity she had acquired a melancholy wisdom in the judgment of the faces of the men drifting through durades hall what allie had heard in this englishmans voice she saw in his features he did not look at her again he played cards wearily carelessly indifferently with his mind plainly on something else  ancliffe how many cards called one of the blackgarbed men  the englishman threw down his cards none he said  the game was interrupted by a commotion in the adjoining room which was the public gamblinghall of durades establishment  another fight exclaimed durade impatiently and only mull and fresno showed up today  harsh voices and heavy stamps were followed by a pistolshot durade hurriedly arose  gentlemen excuse me he said and went out one of the gamblers also left the room and another crossed it to peep through the door  this left the englishman sitting at the table with the last gambler whose back was turned toward allie she saw the englishman lean forward to speak then the gambler arose and turning came directly toward her  my name is place hough he said speaking rapidly and low i am a gamblerbut gentleman ive heard strange rumors about you and now i see for myself are you allie lee  allies heart seemed to come to her throat she shook all over and she gazed with piercing intensity at the man when he had arisen from the table he had appeared the same blackgarbed hardfaced gambler as any of the others but looked at closely he was different underneath the cold expressionless face worked something mobile and soft his eyes were of crystal clearness and remarkable for a penetrating power they shone with wonder curiosity sympathy  allie instinctively trusted the voice and then consciously trusted the man oh sir i amdistressedill from fright she faltered if i only dared  you dare tell me he interrupted swiftly be quick are you here willingly with this man  oh no  what then  oh siryou do not thinki  i knew you were good innocentthe moment i laid eyes on you who are you  allie lee my father is allison lee  whew the gambler whistled softly and turning glanced at the door then beckoned ancliffe the englishman arose in the adjoining rooms sounds of strife were abating  ancliffe this girl is allie leedaughter of allison leea big man of the upr something terribly wrong here and he whispered to ancliffe  allie became aware of the englishmans scrutiny doubtful sad yet kind and curious indeed these men had heard of her  hough you must be mistaken he said  allie felt a sudden rush of emotion her opportunity had come i am allie lee my mother ran off with duradeto california he used her as a lure to draw men to his gamblinghellsas he uses me now two years ago we escapedstarted east with a caravan the indians attacked us i crawled under a rockescaped the massacre i  never mind all your story interrupted hough we havent time for that i believe you you are held a close prisoner  oh yeslocked and barred i never get out i have been threatened sothat until now i feared to tell anyone but duradehe is going mad ii can bear it no longer  miss lee you shall not bear it declared ancliffe well take you out of here  how queried hough shortly  ancliffe was for walking right out with her but hough shook his head  listen began allie hurriedly he would kill me the instant i tried to escape he loved my mother he does not believe she is dead he lives only to be revenged upon her he has a desperate gang here fresno mull stitt black grist dayss a greaser called mex and othersall the worst of bad men you cannot get me out of here alive except by some trick  how about bringing the troops  durade would kill me the first thing  could we steal you out at night  i dont see how they are awake all night i am barred in watched  better work on durades weakness gold hes mad for gold when the fevers on him he might gamble me awayor sell me for gold  houghs cold eyes shone like fire in ice he opened his lips to speakthen quickly motioned ancliffe back to the table they had just seated themselves when the two gamblers returned followed by durade he was rubbing his hands in satisfaction  what was the fuss about queried hough tipping the ashes off his cigar  some drunks after money they had lost  and got thrown out for their pains inquired ancliffe  yes mull and fresno are out there now  the game was taken up again allie sensed a different note in it the gambler hough now faced her in his position at the table and behind every card he played there seemed to be intense purpose and tremendous force ancliffe soon left the game but he appeared fascinated where formerly he had been indifferent soon it developed that hough by his spirit and skill was driving his opponents inciting their passion for play working upon their feelings durade seemed the weakest gambler though he had the best luck good luck balanced his excited play the two other gamblers pitted themselves against hough  the shadows of evening had begun to darken the room when durade called for lights a slim sloeeyed pantherishmoving mexican came in to execute the order he wore a belt with a knife in it and looked like a brigand when he had lighted the lamps he approached durade and spoke in spanish durade replied in the same tongue then the mexican went out one of the gamblers lost and arose from the table  gentlemen may i go out for more money and return to the game he asked  certainly replied hough  durade assented with bad grace  the game went on and grew in interest probably the mexican had reported the fact of its possibilities or perhaps durade had sent out word of some nature for one by one his villainous lieutenants came in stepping softly gleamingeyed  durade have you stopped play outside queried hough  suppertime not much going on replied mull  hough watched this speaker with keen coolness  i did not address you he said  durade catching the drift came out of his absorption of play long enough to say that with a big game at hand he did not want to risk any interruption he spoke frankly but he did not look sincere  presently the second gambler announced that he would consider it a favor to be allowed to go out and borrow money then he left hurriedly durade and hough played alone and the luck seesawed from one to the other until both the other players returned they did not come alone two more blackfrocked blacksombreroed coldfaced individuals accompanied them  may we sit in they asked  with pleasure replied hough  durade frowned and the glow left his face though the luck was still with him it was evident that he did not favor added numbers yet the mans sensitiveness to any change immediately manifested itself when he won the first large stake his radiance returned and also his vanity  hough interrupted the game by striking the table with his hand the sound seemed hard metallic yet his hand was empty any attentive observer would have become aware that hough had a gun up his sleeve but durade did not catch the significance  i object to that man leaning over the table said hough and he pointed to the lounging fresno  thet so leered the ugly giant he looked bold and vicious  do not address me ordered hough  fresno backed away silently from the coldfaced gambler  dont mind him hough protested durade theyre all excited big stakes always work them up  send them out so we can play without annoyance  no replied durade sharply they can watch the game  ancliffe called hough just as sharply fetch some of my friends to watch this game dont forget neale and larry king  allie who was watching and listening with strained faculties nearly fainted at the sudden mention of her lover neale and her friend larry she went blind for a second the room turned round and round she thought her heart would burst with joy  the englishman hurried out  durade looked up with a passionate and wolfish swiftness  what do you mean  i want some of my friends to watch the game replied hough  but i dont allow that redheaded cowboy gunfighter to come into my place  that is regrettable for you will make an exception this time durade you dont stand well in benton i do  the spaniards eyes glittered you insinuatesenor  yes interposed hough and his cold deliberate voice dominated the explosive durade do you remember a gambler named jones he was shot in this room if i should happen to be shot herein the same wayyou and your gang would not last long in benton  durades face grew livid with rage and fear and in that moment the mask was off the nature of the spaniard stood forth another manifest fact was that durade had not before matched himself against a gambler of houghs caliber  well are you only a bluff or do we go on with the game inquired hough  durade choked back his rage and signified with a motion of his hand that play should be resumed  allie fastened her eyes upon the door she was in a tumult of emotion despite that her mind revolved wild and intermittent ideas as to the risk of letting neale see and recognize her there yet her joy was so overpowering that she believed if he entered the door she would rush to him and trust in god to save her in god and reddy king she remembered the cowboy and a thrill linked all her emotions durade and his gang would face a terrible reckoning if reddy king ever entered to see her there  moments passed the gambling went on the players spoke low the spectators were silent discordant sounds from outside disturbed the quiet  allie stared fixedly at the door presently it opened ancliffe entered with several men all quick in movement alert of eye but neale and larry king were not among them allies heart sank like lead the revulsion of feeling the disappointment was sickening she saw ancliffe shake his head and divined in the action that he had not been able to find the friends hough wanted particularly then allie felt the incredible strangeness of being glad that neale was not to find her therethat larry was not to throw his guns on durades crowd there might be a chance of her being liberated without violence  this reaction left her weak and dazed for a while still she heard the low voices of the gamesters the slap of cards and clink of gold her wits had gone from her ever since the mention of neale she floundered in a whirl of thoughts and fears until gradually she recovered selfpossession whatever instinct or love or spirit had guided her had done so rightly she had felt neales presence in benton it was stingingly sweet to realize that her heart swelled with pangs of fullest measure surely he again believed her dead soon he would come upon herface to facesomewhere he would learn she was aliveunharmedtrue to him with all her soul indians renegade spaniards benton with its terrors a host of evil men not these nor anything else could keep her from neale forever she had believed that always but never as now in the clearness of this beautiful spiritual insight behind her belief was something unfathomable and great not the movement of progress as typified by those men who had dreamed of the railroad nor the spirit of the unconquerable engineers as typified by neale nor the wildness of wild youth like larry king nor the heroic labor and simplicity and sacrifice of common men nor the inconceivable passion of these gamblers for gold nor the mystery hidden in the mad laughter of these fallen women strange and sad on the night windnot any of these things nor all of them wonderful and incalculable as they were loomed so great as the spirit that upheld allie lee  when she raised her head again the gambling scene had changed only three men playedhough durade and another and even as allie looked this third player threw his cards into the deck and with silent gesture rose from the table to take a position with the other blackgarbed gamblers standing behind hough the blackness of their attire contrasted strongly with the whiteness of their faces they had lost gold which fact meant little to them but there was something big and significant in their presence behind hough gamblers leagued against a crooked gamblinghell durade had lost a fortune yet not all his fortune he seemed a haggard flamingeyed wreck of the once debonair durade his hair was wet and dishevelled his collar was open his hand wavered blood trickled down from his lower lip he saw nothing except the gold the cards and that steelnerved grayfaced implacable hough behind him lined up his gang nervous strained frenzied with eyes on the goldhatefilled murderous eyes  allie slipped into her room leaving the door ajar so she could peep out and there she paced the floor waiting listening for what she dared not watch the gambler hough would win all that durade had and then stake it against her that was what allie believed she had no doubts of houghs winning her too but she doubted if he could take her away there would be a fight and if there was a fight then that must be the end of durade for this gambler hough with his unshakable nerve his piercing eyes his wonderful white hands swift as lighthe would at the slightest provocation kill durade  suddenly allie was arrested by a loud long suspirationa heave of heavy breaths in the room of the gamblers a chair scraped noisily breaking the silence which instantly clamped down again  durade youre done it was the cold ringing voice of hough  allie ran to the door peeped through the crack durade sat there like a wild beast bound hough stood erect over a huge golden pile on the table the others seemed stiff in their tracks  theres a fortune here went on hough indicating the gold all i hadall our gentlemen opponents hadall you had i have won it all  durades eyes seemed glued to that dully glistening heap he could not even look up at the coldly passionate hough  all all echoed durade  then hough like a striking hawk bent toward the spaniard durade have you anything more to bet  durade was the only man who moved slowly he arose shaking in every limb and not till he became erect did he unrivet his eyes from that yellow heap on the table  senordo youmock me he gasped hoarsely  i offer you my winningsallfor the girl you have here  you are crazy ejaculated the spaniard  certainly but hurry do you accept  senor i would not sell that girl for all the gold of the indies replied durade instantly no vacillationno indecision in him here houghs offer held no lure for this spaniard who had committed many crimes for gold  but youll gamble her asserted hough and now indeed his words were mockery in one splendid gesture he swept his winnings into the middle of the table and the gold gave out a ringing clash as a gambler he read the soul of his opponent  durades jaw worked convulsively as if he had difficulty in holding it firm enough for utterance what he would not sell for any price he would risk on a gamblers strange faith in chance  all my winnings against this girl went on hough relentlessly scorn and a taunting dare and an insidious persuasion mingled with the passion of his offer he knew how to inflame durade as a gambler was a weakling in the grasp of a giant come do you accept  durades body leaped as if an irresistible current had been shot into it  si senor he cried with power and joy in his voice in that moment no doubt the greatest in his life of gambling he unconsciously went back to the use of his mother tongue  actuated by one impulse hough and durade sat down at the table the others crowded around fresno lurched close with a wicked gleam in his eyes  i was onto hough he said to his nearest ally its the girl hes after  the gamblers cut the cards for who should deal hough won for him victory seemed to exist in the suspense of the very silence in the charged atmosphere of the room he began to shuffle the cards his hands were white shapely perfect like a womans and yet not beautiful the spirit the power the ruthless nature in them had no relation to beauty how marvelously swift they movedtoo swift for the gaze to follow and the incomparable dexterity with which he manipulated the cards gave forth the suggestion as to what he could do with them in those gleaming hands in the flying cards in the whole intenseness of the gambler there showed the power and the intent to win the crooked durade had met his match a match who toyed with him if there were an element of chance in this short game it was that of the uncertainty of life not of durades chance to win he had no chance no eye no hand could have justly detected hough in the slightest deviation from honesty yet all about the man in that tense moment proved what a gambler really was  durade called in a whisper for two cards and he received them with trembling fingers terrible hope and exultation transformed his face  ill take three said hough calmly with deliberate care and slowness in strange contrast to his former motions he took one by one three cards from the deck then he looked at them and just as calmly dropped all his cards face up on the table disclosing what he knew to be an unbeatable hand  durade stared a thick cry escaped him  swiftly hough rose durade i have won then he turned to his friends gentlemen please pocket this gold  with that he stepped to allies door he saw her peering out come miss lee he said  allie stepped out trembling and unsteady on her feet  the spaniard now seemed compelled to look up from the gold houghs comrades were pocketing when he saw allie another slow and remarkable transformation came over him at first he started slightly at houghs hand on allies arm the radiance of his strange passion for gold that had put a leaping glory into his haggard face faded into a dark and mounting surprise a blaze burned away the shadows his eyes betrayed an unsupportable sense of loss and the spirit that repudiated it for a single instant he was magnificentand perhaps in that instant race and blood spoke then with bewildering suddenness surely with the suddenness of a memory he became a black drippingfaced victim of unutterable and unquenchable hate  allie recoiled in the divination that durade saw her mother in her no memory no love no gold no wager could ever thwart the spaniard  senor you tricked me he whispered  i beat you at your own game said hough my friends and your men heard the stakesaw the game  senor i would notbetthat girlfor any stake  you have lost her let me warn you durade be careful once in your life youre welcome to what gold is left there  durade shoved back the gold so fiercely that he upset the table and its contents jangled on the floor the spill and the crash of a scattered fortune released durades men from their motionless suspense they began to pick up the coins  the spaniard was halted by the gleam of a derringer in houghs hand hissing like a snake durade stood still momentarily held back by a fear that quickly gave place to insane rage  shoot him said ancliffe with a coolness which proved his foresight  one of houghs friends swung a cane smashing a lamp then with like swift action he broke the other lamp instantly plunging the room into darkness this appeared to be the signal for durades men to break loose into a mad scramble for the gold durade began to scream and rush forward  allie felt herself drawn backward along the wall through her door it was not so dark in there she distinguished hough and ancliffe the latter closed the door hough whispered to allie though the din in the other room made such caution needless  can we get out this way he asked  theres a window replied allie  ancliffe open it and get her out ill stop durade if he comes in hurry  while the englishman opened the window hough stood in front of the door with both arms extended allie could just see his tall form in the pale gloom pandemonium had begun in the other room with durade screaming for lights and his men yelling and fighting for the gold and houghs friends struggling to get out but they did not follow hough into this room and evidently must have thought he had escaped through the other door  come said ancliffe touching allie  he helped her get out and followed laboriously then he softly called to hough the gambler let himself down swiftly and noiselessly  now what he muttered  they appeared to be in a narrow alley between a house of boards and a house of canvas excited voices sounded inside this canvas structure and evidently alarmed hough for with a motion he enjoined silence and led allie through the dark passage out into a gloomy square surrounded by low dark structures ancliffe followed close behind  the night was dark with no stars showing a cool wind blew in allies face refreshing her after her long confinement hough began groping forward this square had a rough board floor and a skeleton framework it had been a house of canvas some of the partitions were still standing  look for a doorany place to get out whispered hough to ancliffe as they came to the opposite side of this square space hough with allie close at his heels went to the right while ancliffe went to the left hough went so far then muttering drew allie back again to the point whence they had started ancliffe was there  no place all boarded up tight he whispered  same on this side well have to  listen exclaimed ancliffe holding up his hand  there appeared to be noise all around but mostly on the other side of the looming canvas house behind which was the alleyway that led to durades hall gleams of light flashed through the gloom durades high quick voice mingled with hoarser and deeper tones some one in the canvas house was talking to durade who apparently must have been in allies room and at her window  see hyar greaser we aint harborin any of your outfit an well plug the fust gent we see called a surly voice  durades staccato tones succeeded it did you see them  we heerd them gettin out the winder  durades voice rose high in spanish curses then he called  fresnomulltake mengo around the street they cant get away  you mex get down in there with the gang  lower voices answered questioning eager but indistinct  kill himbring her backand you can have the gold shouted durade  following that came the heavy tramp of boots and the low roar of angry men  hough leaned toward ancliffe theyve got us penned in  yes but its pretty dark here and theyll be slow you watch while i tear a hole through somewhere replied ancliffe  he was perfectly cool and might have been speaking of some casual incident he extinguished his cigarette dropped it then put on his gloves  hough loomed tall and dark his face showed pale in the shadow he stood with his elbows stiff against his sides a derringer in each hand  i wish i had heavier guns he said  allies thrill of emotion spent itself in a shudder of realization calmly and chivalrously these two strangers had taken a stand against her enemies and with a few cool words and actions had accepted whatever might betide  i must tell youoh i must she whispered with her hand on houghs arm i heard you send for neale and larry king it made my heart stop nealewarren neale is my sweetheart see i wear his ring reddy king is my dearest friendmy brother  hough bent low to peer into allies faceto see her ring then he turned to ancliffe  how things work out i always suspected what was wrong with neale now i knowafter seeing his girl  by jove exclaimed ancliffe  well ill block durades gang will you save the girl  assuredly answered the imperturbable englishman where shall i take her  where can she be safe the troop camp no too far aha take her to stanton tell stanton the truth stanton will hide her then find neale and king  hough turned to allie im glad you spokeabout neale he said and there was a curious softness in his voice i owe him a great deal i like him ancliffe will get you out of hereand safely back to neale  allie knew somehowfrom something in his tone his presencethat he would never leave this gloomy inclosure she heard ancliffe ripping a board off the wall or fence and that sound seemed alarmingly loud the voices no longer were heard behind the canvas house the wind whipped through the bare framework somewhere at a distance were music and revelry bentons night roar had begun over all seemed to hang a menacing and ponderous darkness  suddenly a light appeared moving slowly from the most obscure corner of the space perhaps fifty paces distant  hough drew allie closer to ancliffe get behind me he whispered  a sharp ripping and splitting of wood told of ancliffes progress also it located the fugitives for durades gang the light vanished quick voices rasped out then stealthy feet padded over the boards  allie saw or imagined she saw gliding forms black against the pale gloom she was so close to ancliffe that he touched her as he worked turning she beheld a ray of light through an aperture he had made  suddenly the gloom split to a reddish flare it revealed dark forms a gun cracked allie heard the heavy thud of a bullet against the wall then hough shot his derringer made a small spiteful report it was followed by a crya groan other guns cracked bullets pattered on the wood allie heard the spat of lead striking hough it had a sickening sound he moved as if from a blow a volley followed and allie saw the bright flashes all about her bullets were whistling and thudding she knew with a keen horror every time hough was struck hoarse yells and strangling cries mixed with the diminishing shots  then ancliffe grasped her and pushed her through a vent he had made allie crawled backward and she could see hough still standing in front it seemed that he swayed then as she rose further her view was cut off although she had not looked around she was aware of a dimly lighted storeroom outside the shots had ceased she heard something heavy fall suddenly then a patter of quick light footsteps  ancliffe essayed to get through the opening feet first it was a tight squeeze or else some one held him back there came a crashing of wood ancliffes body whirled in the aperture and he struggled violently allie heard hissing sibilant spanish utterances she stood petrified certain that durade had attacked ancliffe suddenly the englishman crashed through drawing a supple twisting slender man with him he held this man by the throat with one hand and by the wrist with the other allie recognized durades mexican ally he gripped a knife and the blade was bloody  once inside where ancliffe could move he handled the mexican with deliberate and remorseless ease allie saw him twist and break the arm which held the knife not that sight but the eyes of the mexican made allie close her own when she opened them at a touch ancliffe stood beside her and the mexican lay quivering ancliffe held the bloody knife he hid it under his coat  come he said his voice seemed thin  but hough we must  ancliffes strange gesture froze allies lips she followed himclung close to him there were voices nearand persons all seemed to fall back before the englishman he strode on indeed his movements appeared unnatural they went down a low stairway out into the dark lights were there to the right and hurrying forms ancliffe ran with her in the other direction only dim pale lamps shone through tents down this side street it was quiet and dark allie stumbled too he turned a corner and proceeded rapidly toward bright lights the houses loomed big down that way many people passed to and fro allies senses recognized a new sounda confusion of music dancing hilarity all distinct near at hand she could scarcely keep up with ancliffe he did not speak nor look to right or left  at the corner of a large housea long structure which sent out gleams of lightancliffe opened a door and pulled allie into a hallway dark near at hand but brilliant at the other end he drew her along this passage striding slower now and unsteadily he turned into another hall lighted by lamps music and gaiety seemed to sweep stunningly into allies face but allie saw only one person therea negress as ancliffe halted the negress rose from her seat she was frightened  call stantonquick he panted he thrust gold at her tell no one else  then he opened a door pushed allie into a handsomely furnished parlor and closing the door staggered to a couch upon which he fell his face wore a singular look remarkable for its whiteness all its weary careless indifference had vanished  as he lay back his hands loosed their hold of his coat and fell away all bloody the knife slid to the floor a crimson froth flecked his lips  ohheaven you werestabbed gasped allie sinking to her knees  if stanton doesnt come in timetell her what happenedask her to fetch neale to you he said he spoke with extreme difficulty and a fluttering told of blood in his throat allie could not speak she could not pray but her sight and her perception were abnormally keen ancliffes strange dear gaze rested upon her and it seemed to allie that he smiled not with lips or face but in spirit how strange and beautiful  then allie heard a rush of silk at the door it openedclosed a woman of fair face bare of arm and neck glittering with diamonds swept into the parlor she had great darkblue eyes full of shadows and they flashed from ancliffe to allie and back again  whats happened youre pale as death ancliffe your handsyour breast my god  she bent over him stanton ive beencut upand hough isdead  oh this horrible benton cried the woman  dont faint hear me you remember we were curious about a girldurade had in his place this is sheallie lee she is innocent durade held her for revenge he had lovedthen hated her mother hough won all durades goldand then the girl but we had to fight stanton this allie lee is neales sweetheart he believes her dead you hide herbring neale to her  quickly she replied i promise you ancliffe i promise how strangewhat you tell but not strange for benton ancliffe speak to meoh he is going  with her first words a subtle change passed over ancliffe it was the release of his will his whole body sank under the intense whiteness of his face a cold gray shade began to creep his last conscious instant spent itself in the strange gaze allie had felt before and now she had a vague perception that in some way it expressed a blessing and a deliverance the instant the beautiful light turned inward as if to illumine the darkness of his soul she divined what he had once been his ruin his secret and eternal remorseand the chance to die that had made him great  so forgetful of the other beside her allie lee watched ancliffe sustained by a nameless spirit feeling with tragic pity her duty as a womanto pray for him to stay beside him that he might not be alone when he died  and while she watched with the fading of that singular radiance there returned to his face a slow careless weariness  hes gone murmured stanton rising a dignity had come to her dead and we knew nothing of himnot his real namenor his place  but even benton could not keep him from dying like an english gentleman  she took allie by the hand led her out of the parlor and across the hall into a bedroom then she faced allie wonderingly with all a womans sympathy and something else that allie sensed as a sweet and poignant wistfulness  are youneales sweetheart she asked very low  ohpleasefind himfor me sobbed allie  the tenderness in this womans voice and look and touch was what allie needed more than anything and it made her a trembling child how strangely hesitatingly with closing eyes this woman reached to fold her in gentle arms what a tumult allie felt throbbing in the full breast where she laid her head  allie lee and he thinks you dead she murmured brokenly i will bring himto you  when she released allie years and shadows no longer showed in her face her eyes were tearwet and darkening her lips were tremulous at that moment there was something beautiful and terrible about her  but allie could not understand  you stay here she said be very quiet i will bring neale  opening the door she paused on the threshold to glance down the hall first and then back to allie her smile was beautiful she closed the door and locked it allie heard the soft swish of silk dying away     26  beauty stanton threw a cloak over her bare shoulders and hurriedly leaving the house by the side entrance she stood a moment breathless and excited in the dark and windy street  she had no idea why she halted there for she wanted to run but the instant she got out into the cool night air a check came to action and thought strange sensations poured in upon herthe darkness lonesome and weird the wailing wind with its weight of dust the roar of bentons main thoroughfare and the low strange murmur neither musical nor mirthful behind her from that huge hall she called her home stranger even than these emotions were the swelling and aching of her heart the glow and quiver of her flesh thrill on thrill deep like bursting pages of joy never before experienced the physical sense of a touch inexplicable in its power  on her bare breast a place seemed to flush and throb and glow ah murmured beauty stanton that girl laid her face hereover my heart what was i to do she murmured oh yesto find her sweetheartneale then she set off rapidly but if she had possessed wings or the speed of the wind she could not have kept pace with her thoughts  she turned the corner of the main street and glided among the hurrying throng men stood in groups talking excitedly she gathered that there had been fights more than once she was addressed familiarly but she did not hear what was said the wide street seemed strange dark dismal the lights yellow and flaring the wind burdened the dark tide of humanity raw wild animal unstable above the lights and the throngs hovered a shadownot the mantle of night nor the dark desert sky  her steps took familiar ground yet she seemed not to know this benton  once i was like allie lee she whispered not so many years ago  and the dark tide of men the hurry and din the wind and dust the flickering lights all retreated spectrallike to the background of a mind returned to youth hope love home she saw herself at eighteenyes beauty stanton even then possessed of a beauty that was her ruin at school the favorite of a host of boys and girls at home where the stately oaks were hung with silver moss and the old colonial house rang with song of sister and sport of brother where a sweetfaced gentlevoiced mother  ah mother and at that word the dark tide of men seemed to rise and swell at her to trample her sacred memory as inevitably and brutally as it had used her body  only the piercing pang of that memory remained with beauty stanton she was a part of benton she was treading the loose boardwalk of the great and vile construction camp she might draw back from leer and touch but none the less was she there a piece of this dark bold obscure life she was a cog in the wheel a grain of dust in the whirlwind a morsel of flesh and blood for the hungry maw of a wild and passing monster of progress  her hurried steps carried her on with her errand neale she knew where to find him often she had watched him play always regretfully conscious that he did not fit there his indifference had baffled her as it had piqued her professional vanity men had never been indifferent to her she had seen them fight for her mocking smiles but neale he had been stone to her charm yet kind gracious deferential always she had felt strangely shamed when he stood bareheaded before her beauty stanton had foregone respect yet respect was what she yearned for the instincts of her girlhood surviving made a whited sepulcher of her present life she could not bear neales indifference and she had failed to change it her infatuation born of that hotbed of benton life had beaten and burned itself to destruction against a higher and better lovethe only love of her womanhood she would have slaved for him but he had passed her by absorbed with his own secret working toward some fateful destiny lost perhaps like all the others there  and now she learned that the mystery of himhis secretwas the same old agony of love that sent so many on endless restless roadsallie lee and he believed her dead  after all the bitterness life had moments of sweetest joy fate was being a little kind to herbeauty stanton it would be from her lips neale would hear that allie lee was alivebeauty stantons soul seemed to soar with the realization of how that news would uplift neale craze him with happiness change his life save him he was going to hear the blessed tidings from a woman whom he had scorned always afterward then he would think of beauty stanton with a grateful heart she was to be the instrument of his salvation hough and ancliffe had died to save allie lee from the vile clutch of benton but to beauty stanton the woman of illfame had been given the power she gloried in it allie lee was safely hidden in her house the iniquity of her establishment furnished a haven for the body and life and soul of innocent allie lee beauty stanton marveled at the strange ways of life if she could have prayed if she had ever dared to hope for some splendid duty some atonement to soften the dark grim ending of her dark career it would not have been for so much as fate had now dealt to her she was overwhelmed with her opportunity  all at once she reached the end of the street on each side the wall of lighted tents and houses ceased had she missed her waygone down a side street to the edge of the desert no the rows of lights behind assured her this was the main street yet she was far from the railroad station the crowds of men hurried by as always before her reached a leveled space dimly lighted full of moving objects and noise of hammers and wagons and harsh voices then suddenly she remembered  benton was being evacuated tents and houses were being taken down and loaded on trains to be hauled to the next construction camp bentons day was done this was the last night she had forgotten that the proprietor of her hall from whom she rented it had told her that early on the morrow he would take it down section by section load it on the train and put it together again for her in the next town in fortyeight hours benton would be a waste place of board floors naked frames debris and sand ready to be reclaimed by the desert it would be gone like a hideous nightmare and no man would believe what had happened there  the gamblinghell where she had expected to find neale had vanished in a few hours as if by magic beauty stanton retraced her steps she would find neale in one of the other placesthe big tent perhaps  this hall was unusually crowded and the scene had the number of men though not the women and the hilarity and the gold that was characteristic of payday in benton all the tables in the gamblingroom were occupied  beauty stanton stepped into this crowded room her golden head uncovered white and rapt and strangely darkeyed with all the beauty of her girlhood returned and added to it that of a woman transformed supreme in her crowning hour as a bad woman infatuated and piqued she had failed to allure neale to baseness now as a good woman with pure motive she would win his friendship his eternal gratitude  stanton had always been a target for eyes yet never as now when she drew every gaze like a dazzling light in a dark room  as soon as she saw neale she forgot every one else in that hall he was gambling he did not look up his brow was somber and dark she approachedstood behind him some of the players spoke to her familiarly as was her bitter due then neale turned apparently to bow with his old courtesy thrill on thrill coursed over her always he had showed her respect deference  her heart was full she had never before enjoyed a moment like this she was about to separate him from the baneful and pernicious life of the campsto tender him a gift of unutterable happinessto give all of him back to the work of the great railroad  she put a trembling hand on his shoulderbent over him nealecome with me she whispered  he shook his head  yes yes she returned her voice thrilling with emotion  wearily with patient annoyance he laid down his cards and looked up his dark eyes held faint surprise and something that she thought might be pity  miss stantonpardon mebut please understandno  then he turned and picking up his cards resumed the game  beauty stanton suffered a sudden vague check it was as if a cold thought was trying to enter a warm and glowing mind she found speech difficult she could not get off the track of her emotional flight her womans wit tact knowledge of men would not operate  neale come withme she cried brokenly theres  some men laughed coarsely that did not mean anything to stanton until she saw how it affected neale his face flushed red and his hands clenched the cards  say neale spoke up this brutal gamester with a sneer never mind us go along with your lady friend youre ahead of the gameas i reckon she sees  neale threw the cards in the mans face then rising he bent over to slap him so violently as to knock him off his chair  the crash stilled the room every man turned to watch  neale stood up his right arm down menacingly the gambler arose cursing but made no move to draw a weapon  beauty stanton could not to save her life speak the words she wanted to say something impeding totally unexpected seemed to have arisen  nealecome withme was all she could say  no he declared vehemently with a gesture of disgust and anger  that following the coarse implication of the gambler conveyed to stanton what all these men imagined the fools the fools a hot vibrating change occurred in her emotion but she controlled it neale turned his back upon her the crowd saw and many laughed stanton felt the sting of her pride the leap of her blood she was misunderstood but what was that to her as neale stepped away she caught his armheld him while she tried to get close to him so she could whisper he shook her off his face was black with anger he held up one hand in a gesture that any woman would have understood and hated it acted powerfully upon beauty stanton neale believed she was importuning him to him her look whisper touch had meant only the same as to these coarse human animals gaping and grinning as they listened the sweetest and best and most exalted moment she had ever known was being made bitter as gall sickening hateful she must speak openly she must make him understand  allie lee at my house burst out stanton and then as if struck by lightning she grew cold stifflipped  the change in neale was swift terrible not comprehension but passion transformed him into a grayfaced man amazed furious agonized acting in seeming righteous and passionate repudiation of a sacrilege   his voice hurled out a heinous name the one epithet that could inflame and burn and curl beauty stantons soul into hellish revolt gray as ashes fireeyed he appeared about to kill her he struck herhardacross the mouth  dont breathe that name  beauty stantons fear suddenly broke blindly she ran out into the street she fell oncejostled against a rail the lights blurred the street seemed wavering the noise about her filtered through deadened ears the stalking figures before her were indistinct and unreal  he struck me he called me she gasped and the exaltation of the last hour vanished as if it had never been all the passion of her stained and evil years leaped into ascendency hellhell ill have him knifedill see him dying ill wet my hands in his blood ill spit in his face as he dies  so she gasped out staggering along the street toward her house there is no flame of hate so sudden and terrible and intense as that of the lost woman beauty stantons blood had turned to vitriol men had wronged her ruined her dragged her down into the mire one by one during her dark career the long procession of men she had known had each taken something of the good and the virtuous in her only to leave behind something evil in exchange she was what they had made her her soul was a bottomless gulf black and bitter as the dead sea her heart was a volcano seething turgid full of contending fires her body was a receptacle into which benton had poured its dregs the weight of all the iron and stone used in the construction of the great railroad was the burden upon her shoulders these dark streams of humanity passing her in the street these beasts of men these hairybreasted toilers had found in her and her kind the strength or the incentive to endure to build to go on and one of them stupid selfish merciless a man whom she had really loved who could have made her better to whom she had gone with only hope for him and unselfish abnegation for herselfhe had put a vile interpretation upon her appeal he had struck her before a callous crowd he had called her the name for which there was no pardon from her class a name that evoked all the furies and the powers of hell  oh to cut himto torture himto burn him alive but it would not be enough she panted  and into the mind that had been lately fixed in happy consciousness of her power of good there flashed a thousand scintillating corruscating gleams of evil thought and then came a crowning one an inspiration straight from hell  by god ill make of allie lee the thing i am the thing he struckthe thing he named  the woman in beauty stanton ceased to be all that breathed in that hour was what men had made her revenge only a word murder nothing life an implacable inexplicable impossible flux and reflux of human passion reason intelligence nobility love womanhood motherhoodall the heritage of her sexhad been warped by false and abnormal and terrible strains upon her physical and emotional life no tigress no cannibal no savage no man no living creature except a woman of grace who knew how far she had fallen could have been capable of beauty stantons deadly and immutable passion to destroy thus life and nature avenged her her hate was immeasurable she who could have walked naked and smiling down the streets of benton or out upon the barren desert to die for the man she loved had in her the inconceivable and mysterious passion of the fallen woman she could become a flame a scourge a fatal wind a devastation she was fire to man to her own sex ice stanton reached her house and entered festivities in honor of the last night of benton were already riotously in order she placed herself well back in the shadow and watched the wide door  the first man who enters ill give him this key she hissed  she was unsteady on her feet all her frame quivered the lights in the hall seemed to have a reddish tinge she watched several men passed out then a tall stalking form appeared entering  a ball of fire in stantons breast leaped and burst she had recognized in that entering form the wildest the most violent and the most dangerous man in bentonlarry red king  stanton stepped forward and for the first time in the cowboys presence she did not experience that singular chill of gloom which he was wont to inspire in her  her eyes gloated over king tall lean graceful easy with his flushed ruddy face and his flashing blue eyes and the upstanding red hair he looked exactly what he wasa handsome red devil fearing no man or thing hellbent in his cool reckless wildness  he appeared to be halfdrunk stanton was trained to read the faces of men who entered there and what she saw in kings added the last and crowning throb of joy to her hate if she had been given her pick of the devils in benton she would have selected this stalking gunpacking cowboy  larry ive a new girl here she said come  evenin missstanton he drawled he puffed slightly after the manner of men under the influence of liquor and a wicked boyish heated smile crossed his face  she led him easily but his heavy gun bumped against her giving her little cold shudders the passage opened into a wide room which in turn opened into her dancinghall she saw strange eager dark faces among the men present but in her excitement she did not note them particularly she led larry across the wide room up a stairway to another hall and down this to the corner of an intersecting passageway  takethiskey she whispered her hand shook she felt herself to be a black and monstrous creature all of benton seemed driving her she was another woman this was her fling at a rotten world her slap in neales face but she could not speak again her lips failed she pointed to a door  she waited long enough to see the stalking graceful cowboy halt in front of the right door then she fled     27  for many moments after the beautiful barearmed woman closed and locked the door allie lee sat in ecstasy in trembling anticipation of neale  gradually however in intervals of happy mindwanderings other thoughts intruded this little bedroom affected her singularly and she was at a loss to account for the fact it did not seem that she was actually afraid to be there for she was glad fear of durade and his gang recurred but she believed that the time of her deliverance was close at hand possibly durade with some of his men had been killed in the fight with hough then she remembered having heard the spaniard order fresno and mull to go round by the street they must be on her trail at this very moment ancliffe had been seen and not much time could elapse before her whereabouts would be discovered but allie bore up bravely she was in the thick of grim and bloody and horrible reality those brave men strangers to her had looked into her face questioned her then had died for her it was all so unbelievable in another room close to her lay ancliffe dead allie tried not to think of him of the remorseless way in which he had killed the mexican of the contrast between this action and his gentle voice and manner she tried not to think of the gambler houghthe cold iron cast of his face as he won durades gold the strange intent look which he gave her a moment before the attack there was something magnificent in ancliffes bringing her to a refuge while he was dying there was something magnificent in houghs standing off the gang allie divined that through her these two men had fought and died for something in themselves as well as for her honor and life  the little room seemed a refuge for allie yet it was oppressive as had been the atmosphere of the parlor where ancliffe lay but this oppressiveness was not death allie had become familiar with death near at hand this refuge made her flesh creep  the room was not the home of any oneit was not inhabited it was not livable yet it contained the same kind of furniture durade had bought for her and it was clean and comfortable still allie shrank from touching anything through the walls came the low strange discordant din to which she had become accustomedan intense compelling blend of music song voice and step actuated by one spirit then at times she imagined she heard distant hammering and the slap of a falling board  probably allie had not stayed in this room many moments when she began to feel that she had been there hours surely the woman would return soon with neale and the very thoughts drove all else out of her mind leaving her palpitating with hope sick with longing  footsteps outside distracted her from the nervous dreamy mood some one was coming along the hall her heart gave a wild boundthen sank the steps passed by her door she heard the thick maudlin voice of a man and the hollow trilling laugh of a girl  allies legs began to grow weak under her the strain the suspense the longing grew to be too much for her and occasioned a revulsion of feeling she had let her hopes carry her too high  suddenly the doorhandle rattled and turned allie was brought to a stifling expectancy motionless in the center of the room some one was outside at the door could it be neale it must be her sensitive ears caught short puffing breathsthen the click of a key in the lock allie stood there in an anguish of suspense with the lift of her heart almost suffocating her like a leaf in the wind she quivered  whoever was out there fumbled at the key then the lock rasped the handle turned the door opened a tall man swaggered in with head bent sideways his hand removing the key from the lock before he saw allie he closed the door with that he faced around  allie recognized the red face the flashing eyes the flaming hair  larry she cried with bursting heart she took a quick step ready to leap into his arms but his violent start checked her larry staggered backput a hand out his face was heated and flushed as allie had never seen it a stupid surprise showed there slowly his hand moved up to cross his lips to brush through his red hair then with swifter movement it swept back to feel the door as if he wanted the touch of tangible things  reckon im seein em again he muttered to himself oh larryim allie lee she cried holding out her hands  she saw the color fade out of his face a shock seemed to go over his body he took a couple of dragging strides toward her his eyes had the gaze of a man who did not believe what he saw the hand he reached out shook  im no ghost larry dontyouknow me she faltered indeed he must have thought her a phantom great clammy drops stood out upon his brow  dear oldredhead she whispered brokenly with a smile of agony and joy he would know her when she spoke that waycalled him the name she had tormented him withthe name no one else would have dared to use  then she saw he believed in her reality his face began to work she threw her arms about himshe gave up to a frenzy of longdeferred happiness where larry was there would neale be  allieit aintyou he asked hoarsely as he hugged her close  oh larryyesyesand ill die of joy she whispered  then you shore aintdaid he went on incredulously  how sweet to allie was the old familiar southern drawl  dead neverwhy ive kissed you and you havent kissed me back  she felt his breast heave as he lifted her off her feet to kiss her awkwardly boyishly  shorethe worlds comin to an end but mebbe im only drunk  he held her close towering over her while he gazed around him and down at her shaking his head muttering again in bewilderment  reddy dearwhere oh where is neale she breathed all her heart in her voice  as he released her allie felt a difference his whole body seemed to gather to harden then vibrate as if he had been stung  my gawd he whispered in hoarse accents of amaze and horror is it youalliehere  of course its i replied allie blankly  his face turned white to the lips  reddy what in the world is wrong she gasped beginning to wring her hands  suddenly he leaped at her with rude iron grasp he forced her back under the light and fixed piercing eyes upon hers he bent closer allie was frightened yet fascinated his gaze hurt with its intensity its strange penetrating power allie could not bear it  allie look at me he said low and hard for i reckon you maynt hev very long to live  allie struggled weakly he looked so gray grim and terrible but she could resist neither his strength nor his spirit she lay quiet and met the clear strange fire of his eyes in a few swift moments he had changed utterly  larryarentyoudrunk she faltered  i was but now im sober girl kiss me again  in wonder and fear allie complied now flushing scarlet  ii was never so happy she whispered but larryyouyou frighten me i  happy ejaculated larry then he let her go and stood up breathing hard theres a hell of a lie heah somewheresbut it aint in you  larry talk sense im weak from long waiting oh tell me of neale  what a strange curious incomprehensible glance he gave her  allieneales heah in benton i can take you to him in ten minutes do you want me to  want you to reddy ill die if you dont take meat once she cried in anguish  again larry loomed over her this time he took her hands how long had you been heahbefore i came he asked  half an hour perhaps maybe less but it seemed long  do youknowwhat kind of a house youre inthis heah roomwhat it means he went on very low and huskily  no i dont she replied instantly with sudden curiosity questions and explanations rushed to her lips but this strangely acting larry dominated her  no other mancame in heah iwas the first  yes  then larry king seemed to wrestle withhimselfwith the hold drink had upon himwith that dark and sinister oppression so thick in the room allie thrilled to see his face grow soft and light up with the smile she remembered how strange to feel in larry king a spirit of gladness of gratefulness for something beyond her understanding again he drew her close and allie keen to read and feel him wondered why he seemed to want to hide the sight of his face  wali reckoni was nigh onto bein drunk he said haltingly shore is a bad habit of mineallie makes me think of a lot ofguffjest the same as it makes me see snakesan things ill quit drinkin allie never will touch liquor againnow if youll jest forgive  he spoke gently huskily with tears in his voice and he broke off completely  forgive larry boy theres nothing to forgiveexcept your not hurrying me toto him  she felt the same violent start in him he held her a moment longer then when he let go of her and stepped back allie saw the cowboy as of old cool and easy yet somehow menacing as he had been that day the strangers rode into slingerlands camp  alliethet woman stanton locked you in heah queried larry  yes then she  larrys quick gesture enjoined silence stealthy steps sounded out in the hall they revived allies fear of durade and his men it struck her suddenly that larry must be ignorant of the circumstances that had placed her there  the cowboy unlocked the doorpeeped out as he turned how clear and cold his blue eyes flashed  ill get you out of heah he whispered come  they went out the passage was empty allie clung closely to him at the corner where the halls met he halted to listen only the low hum of voices came up  larry i must tell you whispered allie durade and his gang are after me fresnomullblackdayssyou know them  ireckon he replied swallowing hard my gawd you poor little girl with that gang after you an stanton i see all now she says to me larry ive a new girl heah wal beauty stanton thet was a bad deal for youdamn your soul  trembling allie opened her lips to speak but again the cowboy motioned her to be quiet he need not have done it for he suddenly seemed terrible wild deadly rendering her mute  allie if i call to you duck behind me an hold on to me ill take you out of heah  then he put her on his left side and led her down the righthand passage toward the wide room allie remembered she looked on into the dancehall larry did not hurry he sauntered carelessly yet allie felt how intense he was they reached the head of the stairway the room was full of men and girls the woman stanton was there and wheeling she uttered a cry that startled allie was this white glaringeyed drawnfaced woman the one who had gone for neale allie began to shake she saw and heard with startling distinctness the womans cry had turned every face toward the stairway and the buzz of voices ceased  stanton ran to the stairway started up and halted raising a white arm in passionate gesture  where are you taking that girl she called stridently  larry stepped down drawing allie with him im takin her to neale  stanton shrieked and waved her arms indeed she seemed another woman from the one upon whose breast allie had laid her head just a little while before  no you wont take her to neale cried stanton  the cowboy stepped down slowly guardedly but he kept on allie saw men run out of the crowded dancehall into the open space behind stanton dark hateful wellremembered faces of fresnomullblack allie pressed the cowboys arm to warn him and he letting go of her appeared to motion her behind him  stanton get out of my way yelled larry his voice rang with a wild ruthless note it carried far and stiffened every figure except that of the frantic woman with convulsed face purple in its fury and the hot eyes of a beast of prey she ran right up at the cowboy heedless of the gun he held leveled low down  he shot her she swayed backward uttering a low and horrible cry and even as she swayed her face blanched and her eyes changed she fell heavily with her golden hair loosening and her bare white arms spreading wide then in the horrorstricken silence she lay there still conscious but with an awful hunted realization in the eyes fixed upon the cowboy a great growing splotch of blood darkening the white of her dress  larry king did not look at stanton and he kept moving down the steps he was walking faster now and he drew allie behind him the first of that stunned group to awake to action was the giant fresno as with blind unreasoning passion he attempted to draw upon the cowboy the boom of larrys big gun and the crash of fresno as he fell woke the spellbound crowd into an uproar screaming women and shouting men rushed madly back into the dancehall  larry turned toward the hallway leading to the street mull and black began shooting as he turned and hit him for allie holding fast to him felt the vibrating shock of his body with two swift shots larry killed both men mull fell across the width of the hall and as allie stumbled over his body she looked down to see his huge head his ruddy face and the great oxeyes rolling and ghastly in that brief glance she saw him die  the cowboy strode fast now allie with hands clenched in his coat clung desperately to him hollow booms of guns filled the passageway and hoarse shouts of alarmed men sounded from the street burned powder smoke choked allie the very marrow of her bones seemed curdled she saw the red belches of fire near and far she passed a man floundering and bellowing on the floor she felt larry jerk back as if struck and then something hot grazed her shoulder a bullet had torn clear through him from breast to back he staggered but he went on another man lay on the threshold of the wide door his head down the step and his pallid face bloodstreaked a smoking gun lay near his twitching hand that pallid face belonged to dayss  larry king staggered out into an empty street looking up and down wal i reckonthetsabootall he drawled with low strangled utterance  then swaying from side to side he strode swiftly almost falling forward holding tight to allie they drew away from the brighter lights allie was dimly aware of moving forms ahead and across the street once fearfully she looked back to see if they were followed  the cowboy halted tottering against a house he seemed pale and smiling  runallie he whispered  nonono she replied clinging to him youre shot oh larrycome on  tellmy pardneale  his head fell back hard against the wood and his body sagging lodged there life had passed out of the gray face larry red king died standing with a gun in each hand and the name of his friend the last word upon his lips  oh larrylarry moaned allie  she could not run she could scarcely walk dark forms loomed up her strength failed and as she reeled sinking down rude hands grasped her above her bent the gleaming face and glittering eyes of durade     28  beauty stanton opened her eyes to see blue sky through the ragged vents of a wornout canvas tent an unusual quietness all around added to the strange unreality of her situation she heard only a low mournful seeping of windblown sand where was she what had happened was this only a vivid fearful dream  she felt stiff unable to move did a ponderous weight hold her down her body seemed immense full of dull horrible ache and she had no sensation of lower limbs except a creeping cold  slowly she moved her eyes around yes she was in a tentan abandoned tent old ragged dirty and she lay on the bare ground through a wide tear in the canvas she saw a stretch of flat ground covered with stakes and boards and denuded frameworks and piles of debris then grim reality entered her consciousness benton was evacuated benton was depopulated bentonhouses tents peoplehad moved away  during her unconsciousness perhaps while she had been thought dead she had been carried to this abandoned tent a dressinggown covered her the one she always put on in the first hours after arising the white dress she had worn last nightwas it last nightstill adorned her but all her jewelry had been taken then she remembered being lifted to a couch and cried over by her girls while awestruck men came to look at her and talk among themselves but she had heard how the cowboys shot had doomed herhow he had fought his way out only to fall dead in the street and leave the girl to be taken by durade  now beauty stanton realized that she had been left alone in an abandoned tent of an abandoned campto die she became more conscious then of dull physical agony but neither fear of death nor thought of pain occupied her mind that suddenly awoke to remorse with the slow ebbing of her life evil had passed out if she had been given a choice between the salvation of her soul and to have neale with her in her last moments to tell him the truth to beg his forgiveness to die in his arms she would have chosen the latter would not some trooper come before she died some one to whom she could intrust a message some gravedigger for the great u p r buried the dead it left in its bloody tracks  with strange numb hands stanton searched the pockets of her dressinggown to find at length a little accountbook with pencil attached then with stiffened fingers but acute mind she began to write to neale as she wrote into each word went something of the pang the remorse the sorrow the love she felt and when that letter was ended she laid the little book on her breast and knew for the first time in many yearspeace  she endured the physical agony she did not cry out or complain or repent or pray most of the spiritual emotion and life left in her had gone into the letter memory called up only the last moments of her lifewhen she saw ancliffe die when she folded innocent allie lee to the breast that had always yearned for a child when neale in his monstrous stupidity had misunderstood her when he had struck her before the grinning crowd and in burning words branded her with the one name unpardonable to her class when at the climax of a morbid and allconsuming hate a hate of the ruined woman whose body and mind had absorbed the vile dregs the dark fire and poison of lustful men she had inhumanly given allie lee to the man she had believed the wildest most depraved and most dangerous brute in all benton when this larry king by some strange fatality becoming as great as he was wild had stalked out to meet her like some red and terrible death  she remembered now that strange icy gloom and shudder she had always felt in the presence of the cowboy within her vitals now was the same cold deadly sickening sensation and it was death always she had anticipated it but vaguely unrealizingly  larry king had lifted the burden of her life she would have been gladif only neale had understood her that was her last wavering conscious thought  now she drifted from human consciousness to the instinctive physical struggle of the animal to live and that was not strong there came a moment the last between life and death when beauty stantons soul lingered on the threshold of its lonely and eternal pilgrimage and then drifted across into the gray shadows into the unknown out to the great beyond  casey leaned on his spade while he wiped the sweat from his brow and regarded his ally mcdermott between them yawned a grave they had been digging and near at hand lay a long quiet form wrapped in old canvas  mac ill be domned if i loike this job said casey drawing hard at his black pipe  yez want to be a directhor of the u p r huh replied mcdermott  shure an ive did ivery job but run an ingine its imposed on we are mac

place shure they niver blinked afther  an mac the best an dirtiest job weve had on this caseys huge hand indicated a row of freshly filled graves u p was the plantin of thim fellars over which the desert sand was seeping then dropping his spade he bent to the quiet figure  lay hold mac he said  they lowered the corpse into the hole casey stood up making a sign of the cross before him  he wor a man  then they filled the grave  mac wouldnt it be dacent to mark where larry kings buried a stone or wooden cross with his name  mcdermott wrinkled his red brow and scratched his sandy beard then he pointed casey wots the use see the blowin sands kivered all the graves  mac yez wor always hell at shirkin worrk come on now drill ye terrier drill  they quickly dug another long narrow hole then taking a rude stretcher they plodded away in the direction of a dilapidated tent that appeared to be the only structure left of benton casey entered ahead of his comrade  thots sthrange  wot queried mcdermott  didnt yez kiver her face whin we laid her down here  shure an i did casey  an that face has a different look now mac see here  casey stooped to pick up a little book from the womans breast his huge fingers opened it with difficulty  mac theres wroitin in ut he exclaimed  wal rade ye baboon  oh i kin rade ut though i aint much of a wroiter meself replied casey and then laboriously began to decipher the writing he halted suddenly and looked keenly at mcdermott  wot the divil bgorra uts to me frind nealean a love letteran  wal kape it thin fer neale an be dacent enough to rade no more  lifting beauty stanton they carried her out into the sunlight her white face was a shadowed and tragic record  mac she wor shure a handsome woman said casey an a loidy  casey yez are always sorry fer

ejaculated mcdermott aghast  casey nodded grimly and then he knelt to listen at stantons breast stone dead nowthots shure  for her shroud these deliberate men used strippings of canvas from the tent and then carrying her up the bare and sandy slope they lowered her into the grave next to the one of the cowboy  again casey made a sign of the cross he worked longer at the filling in than his comrade and patted the mound of sand hard and smooth when he finished his pipe was out he relighted it  wal beauty stanton shure yez hev a cleaner grave than yez hed a bed nice white desert sand an prisintly no man will ivir know where yez come to lay  the laborers shouldered their spades and plodded away  the wind blew steadily in from the desert seeping the sand in low thin sheets afternoon waned the sun sank twilight crept over the barren waste there were no sounds but the seep of sand the moan of wind the mourn of wolf loneliness came with the night that mantled beauty stantons grave shadows trooped in from the desert and the darkness grew black on that slope the wind always blew and always the sand seeped dusting over everything imperceptibly changing the surface of the earth the desert was still at work nature was no respecter of graves life was nothing radiant cold stars blinked pitilessly out of the vast blueblack vault of heaven but there hovered a spirit beside this womans last restingplacea spirit like the night sad lonely silent mystical immense  and as it hovered over hers so it hovered over other nameless graves  in the eternal workshop of nature the tenants of these unnamed and forgotten graves would mingle dust of good with dust of evil and by the divinity of death resolve equally into the elements again  the place that had known benton knew it no more coyotes barked dismally down what had been the famous street of the camp and prowled in and out of the piles of debris and frames of wood gone was the low strange roar that had been neither music nor mirth nor labor benton remained only a name  the sun rose upon a squalid scenea wide flat area where stakes and floors and frames mingled with all the flotsam and jetsam left by a hurried and profligate populace moving on to another camp daylight found no man there nor any living creature and all day the wind blew the dust and sheets of sand over the place where had reigned such strife of toil and gold and lust and blood and death a train passed that day out of which engineer and fireman gazed with wondering eyes at what had been benton like a mushroom it had arisen and like a duststorm on the desert wind it had roared away bearing its freight of labor of passion and of evil benton had become a namea fabulous name  but nature seemed more merciful than life for it began to hide what man had leftthe scars of habitations where hell had held high carnival sunset came then night and the starlight the lonely hours were winged as if in a hurry to resolve back into the elements the flimsy remains of that great camp  and that spot was haunted     29  casey left benton on the worktrain it was composed of a long string of boxand flatcars loaded with stone iron gravel tiesall necessaries for the upkeep of the road the engine was at the rear end pushing instead of pulling and at the extreme front end there was a flatcar loaded with gravel a number of laborers rode on this car among whom was casey in labor or fighting this irishman always gravitated to the fore  all along the track from outside of benton to the top of a long slow rise of desert were indications of the fact that indians had torn up the track or attempted to derail trains  the signs of sioux had become such an everyday matter in the lives of the laborers that they were indifferent and careless thus isolated unprotected groups of men out some distance from the worktrain often were swooped down upon by indians and massacred  the troopers had gone on with the other trains that carried bentons inhabitants and habitations  casey and his comrades had slow work of it going westward as it was necessary to repair the track and at the same time to keep vigilant watch for the sioux they expected the regular train from the east to overtake them but did not even see its smoke there must have been a wreck or telegraph messages to hold it back at medicine bow  toward sunset the worktrain reached the height of desert land that sloped in long sweeping lines down to the base of the hills  at this juncture a temporary station had been left in the shape of several boxcars where the telegraph operators and a squad of troopers lived  as the worktrain lumbered along to the crest of this heave of barren land casey observed that some one at the station was excitedly waving a flag thereupon casey who acted as brakeman signaled the engineer  dom coorious that remarked casey to his comrade mcdermott thim operators knowed wed stop anyway  that was the opinion of the several other laborers on the front car and when the worktrain halted that car had run beyond the station a few rods casey and his comrades jumped off  a little group of men awaited them the operator a young fellow named collins was known to casey he stood among the troopers palefaced and shaking  casey whos in charge of the train he asked nervously  the irishmans grin enlarged making it necessary for him to grasp his pipe  shure the engineers boss of the train an im boss of the gang  more of the worktrain men gathered round the group and the engineer with his fireman approached  youve got to hold up here said collins  casey removed his pipe to refill it ahhuh he grunted  wire from medicine boworder to stop general lodges trainthree hundred sioux in ambush near this stationlodges train between here and roaring city breathlessly went on the operator  an the message come from medicine bow ejaculated casey while his men gaped and muttered  yes it must have been sent here last night but oneil the night operator was dead murdered by indians while we slept  thots hell replied casey seriously as he lit his pipe  the message went through to medicine bow stacey down there sent it back to me i tried to get hills at roaring city no go the wires cut  an shure the ginerals train has leftwots that new camproarin wot  roaring city general lodge went through two days ago with a private train he had soldiers as usual but no force to stand off three hundred sioux or even a hundred  wal the gineral must hev lift roarin cityelse thot message niver would hev come  so i think now what on earth can we do the engineer of his train cant stop for orders short of this station for the reason that there are no stations  an thim sooz is in ambush near here queried casey reflectively shure thot could only be in wan place i rimimber thot higher narrer pass  right its steep upgrade coming east train can be blocked general lodge with his staff and partyand his soldierswould be massacred without a chance to fight that pass always bothered us for fear of ambush now the sioux have come west far enough to find it no chance on earth for a train therenot if it carried a thousand soldiers  wal if the gineral an company was sthopped somewhere beyond thot pass queried casey shrewdly as he took a deep pull at his pipe  then at least they could fight they have stood off attacks before they might hold out for the train following or even run back  thin collins weve only got to sthop the ginerals train before it reaches thot dom trap  but we cant cried collins the wire is cut it wouldnt help matters if it werent i thought when i saw your train we might risk sending the engine on alone but your engine is behind all these loaded cars no switch oh it is damnable  collins theres more domnable things than yez ever heerd of ill sthop gineral lodge  the brawny irishman wheeled and strode back toward the front car of the train all the crowdto a man muttering and gaping followed him casey climbed up on the gravelcar  casey wot in hell would yez be afther doin demanded mcdermott  casey grinned at his old comrade mac yez do me a favor uncouple the car  mcdermott stepped between the cars and the rattle and clank of iron told that he had complied with caseys request collins with all the men on the ground grasped caseys idea  by god casey can you do it theres downgrade for twenty miles once start this gravelcar and shell go clear to the hills butbut  collins itll be aisy ill slip through thot pass loike oil thim sooz wont be watchin this way theres a curve they wont hear till too late an shure they dont niver obsthruct a track till the last minute  but casey once through the pass you cant control that gravelcar the brakes wont hold youll run square into the generals trainwreck it  naw ive got a couple of ties an if thot wreck threatens ill heave a tie off on the track an derail me private car  casey its sure death exclaimed collins his voice and the pallor of his face and the beads of sweat all proclaimed him new to the u p r  me boy nothins shure whin yez are drillin with the paddies  casey was above surprise and beyond disdain he was a huge toilhardened sunreddened harddrinking soldier of the railroad a loquacious irishman whose fixed grin denied him any gravity a foreman of his gang his chief delight was to outdo his bosom comrade mcdermott he did not realize that he represented an unconquerable and unquenchable spirit neither did his comrade know but under caseys grin shone something simple radiant hard as steel  put yer shoulders agin an shove me off he ordered  like automatons the silent laborers started the car  drill ye terriers drill drill ye terriers drill sang casey as he stood at the wheelbrake  the car gathered momentum mcdermott was the last to let go  good luck to yez he shouted hoarsely  mac tell thim yez saw me called casey then he waved his hand in goodby to the crowd their response was a short ringing yell they watched the car glide slowly out of sight  for a few moments casey was more concerned with the fact that a breeze had blown out his pipe than with anything else skilful as years had made him he found unusual difficulty in relighting it and he would not have been beyond stopping the car to accomplish that imperative need when he had succeeded and glanced back the station was out of sight  casey fixed his eyes upon the curve of the track ahead where it disappeared between the sagecovered sandy banks here the grade was scarcely perceptible to any but experienced eyes and the gravelcar crept along as if it would stop any moment but casey knew that it was not likely to stop and if it did he could start it again a heavyladen car like this once started would run a long way on a very little grade what worried him was the creaking and rattle of wheels sounds that from where he stood were apparently very loud  he turned the curve into a stretch of straight track where there came a perceptible increase in the strength of the breeze against his face while creeping along at this point he scooped out a hole in the gravel mound on the car making a place that might afford some protection from indian bullets and arrows that accomplished he had nothing to do but hold on to the wheelbrake and gaze ahead  it seemed a long time before the speed increased sufficiently to insure him against any danger of a stop the wind began to blow his hair and whip away the smoke of his pipe and the car began to cover distance several miles from the station he entered the shallow mouth of a gully where the grade increased his speed accelerated correspondingly until he was rolling along faster than a man could run the track had been built on the right bank of the gully which curved between low bare hills and which grew deeper and of a rougher character casey had spiked many of the rails over which he passed  he found it necessary to apply the brake so that he would not take the sharp curves at dangerous speed the brake did not work well and gave indications that it would not stand a great deal with steady rattling creak and an occasional clank the car rolled on  if casey remembered the lay of the land there was a long straight stretch of track ending in several curves the last of which turned sharply into the narrow cut where the sioux would ambush and obstruct the train at this point it was caseys intention to put off the brake and let his car run wild  it seemed an endless time before he reached the head of that stretch then he let go of the wheel and the gravelcar began to roll on faster  casey appeared to be grimly and conscientiously concerned over his task and he was worried about the outcome he must get his car beyond that narrow cut if it jumped the track or ran into an obstruction or if the sioux spied him in time then his work would not be well done he welcomed the gathering momentum yet was fearful of the curve he saw a long distance ahead when he reached that he would be going at a high rate of speedtoo fast to take the curve safely  a little dimness came to caseys eyes years of hot sun and dust and desert wind had not made his eyes any stronger the low gray walls the white bleached rocks the shallow stream of water the fringe of brush and the long narrowing trackall were momentarily indistinct in his sight his breast seemed weighted over and over in his mind revolved the several possibilities that awaited him at the cut and every rod of the distance now added to his worry it grew to be dread chances were against him the thing intrusted to him was not in his control casey resented this he had never failed at a job the u p r had to be builtand who could tellif the chief engineer and all his staff and the directors of the road were massacred by the sioux perhaps that might be a last and crowning catastrophe  casey had his first cold thrill and his nerves tightened for the crisis while his horny hands gripped on the brake the car was running wild with a curve just ahead it made an unearthly clatter the indians would hear that but they would have to be swift if he stayed on the track almost before he realized it the car lurched at the bend casey felt the offside wheels leave the rail heard the scream of the inside wheels grinding hard but for his grip on the wheel he would have been thrown the wind whistled in his ears with a sudden lurch the car seemed to rise casey thought it had jumped the track but it banged back righted itself rounded the curve  here the gully widenedsent off branches casey saw hundreds of horsesbut not an indian he rolled swiftly on crossed a bridge and saw more horses his grim anticipation became a reality the sioux were in the ambush what depended on him and his luck caseys red cheek blanched but it was not with fear for himself not yet on this ride had he entertained one thought concerning his own personal relation to its fragile possibilities  to know the sioux were there made a tremendous difference a dark and terrible sternness actuated casey he projected his soul into that clattering car of iron and wood and it was certain he prayed his hair stood straight up there the narrow cut in the hill the curve of the track he was pounding at it the wheels shrieked looking up he saw only the rocks and gray patches of brush and the bare streak of earth no indian showed  his gaze strained to find an obstruction on the track the car rode the curve on two wheels it seemed alive it entered the cut with hollow screeching roar the shade of the narrow place was gloomy here it must happen caseys heart never lifted its ponderous weight then shooting round the curve he saw an open track and bright sunlight beyond  above the roar of wheels sounded spatting reports of rifles casey forgot to dodge into his gravel shelter he was living a strange dragging momentan age out shot the car into the light likewise caseys dark blankness of mind ended his heart lifted with a mighty throb there shone the gray endless slope stretching out and down to the black hills in the distance shrill wild yells made casey wheel the hillside above the cut was colorful and spotted with moving objects indians puffs of white smoke arose casey felt the light impact of lead glancing bright streaks darted down they were arrows two thudded into the gravel one into the wood then something tugged at his shoulder another arrow suddenly the shaft was there in his sight quivering in his flesh it bit deep with one wrench he tore it out and shook it aloft at the sioux oh bate yez dom sooz he yelled in fierce defiance the long screeching clamor of baffled rage and the scattering volley of rifleshots kept up until the car passed out of range  casey faced ahead the sioux were behind him he had a free track far down the gray valley where the rails disappeared were low streaks of black smoke from a locomotive the generals train was coming  the burden of worry and dread that had been caseys was now no morevanished as if by magic his job had not yet been completed but he had won he never glanced back at the sioux they had failed in their first effort at ambushing the cut and casey knew the troops would prevent a second attempt casey faced ahead the whistle of wind filled his ears the dry sweet odor of the desert filled his nostrils his car was on a straight track rolling along downgrade half a mile a minute and casey believing he might do well to slow up gradually lightly put on the brake but it did not hold he tried again the brake had broken  he stood at the wheel his eyes clear now watching ahead the train down in the valley was miles away not yet even a black dot in the gray the smoke however began to lift  casey was suddenly struck by a vague sense that something was wrong with him  phwat the hell he muttered then his mind strangely absorbed located the trouble his pipe had gone out casey stooped in the hole he had made in the gravel and there knocking his pipe in his palm he found the ashes cold when had that ever happened before casey wagged his head for his pipe to go cold and he not to know things were happening on the u p r these days casey refilled his pipe and with the wind whistling over him he relit it he drew deep and long stood up grasped the wheel and felt all his blood change  me poipe goin coldthat wor funny soliloquized casey  the phenomenon appeared remarkable to him indeed it stood alone he measured the nature of this job by that forgetfulness and memories thrilled him with his eye clear on the track that split the gray expanse with his whole being permeated by the soothing influence of smoke with his task almost done casey experienced an unprecedented thing for himhe lived over past performances and found them vivid thrilling somehow sweet battles of the civil war the day he saved a flag and better the night he saved pat shane who had lived only to stop a damned sioux bullet many and many an adventure with mcdermott who just a few minutes past had watched him with round shining eyes and the fights he had seen and sharedall these things passed swiftly through caseys mind and filled him with a lofty and serene pride  he was pleased with himself more pleased with what mcdermott would think caseys boyhood did not return to him but his mounting exhilaration and satisfaction were boyish it was great to ride this way there he saw a long black dot down in the gray the train general lodge had once shaken hands with casey  somebody had to do these things since the u p r must reach across to the pacific a day would come when a splendid passengertrain would glide smoothly down this easy grade where casey jolted along on his gravelcar the fact loomed large in the simplicity of the irishmans mind he began to hum his favorite song facing westward he saw the black dot grow into a long train likewise he saw the beauty of the redgold sunset behind the hills casey gloried in the wildness of the scenein the meaning of his rideparticularly in his loneliness he seemed strangely alone there on that vast gray slopea man and somehow accountable for all these things he felt more than he understood his longtried nerves and courage and strength had never yielded this wonderful buoyancy and sense of loftiness he was caseycasey who had let all the gang run for shelter from the sioux while he had remained for one last and final drive at a railroad spike but the cool devilmaycare indifference common to all his comrades as well as to himself was not the strongest factor in the casey of today up out of the rugged and dormant soul had burst the spirit of a race embodied in one man casey was his own audience and the light upon him was the glory of the setting sun a nightingale sang in his heart and he realized that this was his hour here the bloody hard years found their reward not that he had ever wanted one or thought of one but it had comeout of the toil the pain the weariness so his nerves tingled his pulses beat his veins glowed his heart throbbed and all the new sweet young sensations of a boy wildly reveling in the success of his first great venture all the vague strange deep complex emotions of a man who has become conscious of what he is giving to the worldthese shook casey by storm and life had no more to give he knew that whatever he was whatever this incomprehensible driving spirit in him whatever his unknown relation to man and to duty there had been given him in the peril just passed in this wonderful ride a gift splendid and divine  casey rolled on and the train grew plain in his sight when perhaps several miles of track lay between him and the approaching engine he concluded it was time to get ready lifting one of the heavy ties he laid it in front where he could quickly shove it off with his foot  then he stood up it was certain that he looked backward but at no particular thingjust an instinctive glance with his foot on the tie he steadied himself so that he could push it off and leap instantly after  and at that moment he remembered the little book he had found on beauty stantons breast and which contained the letter to his friend neale casey deliberated in spite of the necessity for haste then he took the book from his pocket  bgorra yez niver can tell an thim u p r throopers hev been known to bury a mon widout searchin his pockets he said  and he put the little book between the teeth that held his pipe then he shoved off the tie and leaped     30  neale aghast and full of bitter amaze and shame at himself fled from the gamblinghall where he had struck beauty stanton how beside himself with rage and torture he had been that woman to utter allie lees name inconceivable could she know his story  he tramped the dark streets and the exercise and the cool wind calmed him then the whistle of an engine made him decide to leave benton at once on the first train out hurriedly he got his baggage and joined the throng which even at that late hour was making for the station  a regret that was pain burned deep in himsomehow inexplicable he like other men had done things that must be forgotten what fatality in the utterance of a single namewhat power to flay  from a window of an old coach he looked out upon the dim lights and pale tent shapes  the lastof benton thank god he murmured brokenly well he realized how providence had watched over him there and slowly the train moved out upon the dark windy desert  it took neale nearly fortyeight hours to reach the new camproaring city a bigger town than benton had arisen and more was going uptents and clapboard houses sheds and cabinsthe same motley jumble set under beetling red utah bluffs  neale found lodgings being without food or bed or wash for two days and nights was not helpful to the task he must accomplishthe conquering of his depression he ate and slept long and the following day he took time to make himself comfortable and presentable before he sallied forth to find the offices of the engineer corps then he walked on as directed and heard men talking of indian ambushes and troops  when at length he reached the headquarters of the engineer corps he was greeted with restraint by his old officers and associates was surprised and at a loss to understand their attitude  even in general lodge there was a difference neale gathered at once that something had happened to put out of his chiefs mind the interest that officer surely must have in neales trip to washington and after greeting him the first thing general lodge said gave warrant to the rumors of trouble with indians  my train was to have been ambushed at deep cut he explained big force of sioux we were amazed to find them so far west it would have been a massacrebut for casey we have no particulars yet for the wire is cut but we know what casey did he ran the gantlet of the indians through that cut he was on a gravelcar running wild downhill you know the grade neale of course his intention was to hold up my trainblock us before we reached the ambushed cut there must have been a broken brake for he derailed the car not half a mile ahead of us my engineer saw the runaway flatcar and feared a collision casey threw a railroad tieon the trackin front of him we found him under the carcrusheddying  general lodges voice thickened and slowed a little he looked down his face appeared quite pale  neale began to quiver in the full presaging sense of a revelation  my engineer tom daley reached caseys side just the instant before he died said general lodge resuming his story in fact daley was the only one of us who did see casey alive caseys last words were ambushsooz deep cut and then me frind neale we were at a loss to understand what he meantthat is at first we found casey with this little notebook and his pipe tight between his teeth  the chief gave the notebook to neale who received it with a trembling hand  you can see the marks of caseys teeth in the leather it was difficult to extract the book he held on like grim death oh casey was grim death we could not pull his black pipe out at all we left it between his set jaws where it always had beenwhere it belonged i ordered him interred that way so they buried him out there along the track the chiefs low voice ceased and he stood motionless a moment his brow knotted his eyes haunted yet bright with a glory of tribute to a hero  neale heard the ticking of a watch and the murmur of the street outside he felt the soft little notebook in his hand and the strangest sensation shuddered over him he drew his breath sharply  when general lodge turned again to face him neale saw him differentlyaloof somehow removed indistinct  casey meant that notebook for you said the general it belonged to the woman beauty stanton it contained a letter evidently written while she was dying this developed when daley began to read aloud we all heard the instant i understood it was a letter intended for you i took the book no more was read we were all crowded round daleycurious you know there were visitors on my trainand your enemy lee im sorrybut no matter you see it couldnt be helped thats all  neale was conscious of calamity it lay in his hand poor old casey he murmured then he remembered stanton dying what had happened he could not trust himself to read that message before lodge and bowing he left the room but he had to grope his way through the lobby so dim had become his sight by the time he reached the street he had lost his selfcontrol something burnt his hand it was the little leather notebook he had not the nerve to open it what had been the implication in general lodges strange words  he gazed with awe at the toothmarks on the little book how had casey come by anything of beauty stantons could it be true that she was dead  then again he was accosted in the street a heavy hand a deep voice arrested his progress his eyes sweeping up from the path saw fringed and beaded buckskin a stalwart form a bronzed and bearded face and keen gray eyes warm with the light of gladness he was gripped in hands of iron  son hyar you airan its the savin of me exclaimed a deep familiar voice  slingerland cried neale and he grasped his old friend as a drowning man at an anchorrope my god what will happen next oh im glad to find you all these years slingerland im in trouble  son i reckon i know replied the other  neale shivered why did men look at him so this old trapper had too much simplicity too big a heart to hide his pity  come somewhereout of the crowd cried neale dragging at slingerland dont talk dont tell me anything wait ive a letter herethats going to be hell  neale stumbled along out of the crowded street he did not know where and with death in his soul he opened beauty stantons book and he read  you called me that horrible name you struck me youve killed me i lie here dying oh neale im dyingand i loved you i came to you to prove it if you had not been so blindso stupid my prayer is that some one will see this im writingand take it to you  ancliffe brought your sweetheart allie lee to meto hide her from durade he told me to find you and then he died he had been stabbed in saving her from durades gang and hough too was killed  neale i looked at allie lee and then i understood your ruin you fool she was not dead but alive innocent and sweet like an angel ah the wonder of it in

the shame of being forced to meet degraded men the pain from durades blows the dread that every hour he would do the worst by her or kill her the sudden and amazing recognition between her and her fatherthese became dwarfed and blurred in the presence of the glorious truth that neale was there  she had recognized him with reeling senses and through darkening eyes she had seen him leap before her father to confront that glitteringeyed durade she had neither fear for him nor pity for the spaniard  sensations of falling of being carried of the light and dust and noise of the street of men around her of rooms and the murmur of voices of being worked over and spoken to by a kindly woman of swallowing what was put to her mouth of answering questions of letting other clothes be put upon her she was as if in a trance aware of all going on about her but with consciousness riveted upon one stunning facthis presence when she was left alone this state gradually wore away and there remained a throbbing quivering suspense of love her despair had ended the spirit that had upheld her through all the long dark hours had reached its fulfilment  she lay on a couch in a small room curtained off from another the latter large and light and from which came a sound of low voices she heard the quick tread of men a door opened  lee i congratulate you a narrow escape exclaimed a deep voice with something sharp authoritative in it  general lodge it was indeed a narrow shave for me replied another voice low and husky  allie slowly sat up with the dreamy waiting abstraction less strong her father allison lee and general lodge neales old chief were there in the other room  neale almost killed durade broke him cut him all up said the general with agitation i had it from mcdermott one of my spikersa reliable man neale was shotperhaps cut too but he doesnt seem to know it  allie sprang up transfixed and thrilling  neale almost killedhim echoed allison lee hoarsely then followed a sound of a chair falling  indeed allison its true broke in a strange voice the streets full of menall talkingall stirred up  other men entered the room  is neale here queried general lodge sharply  theyre trying to hold him upin the office the boys want to pat him on the back durade was not liked replied some one  is neale badly hurt  i dont know he looked it he was all bloody  colonel dillon did you see neale went on the sharp eager voice  yes he seemed dazedwild probably badly hurt yet he moved steadily no one could stop him answered another strange voice  ah here comes mcdermott exclaimed general lodge allies ears throbbed to a slow shuffling heavy tread her consciousness received the fact of neales injury but her heart refused to accept it as perilous god could not mock her faith by a last catastrophe  sandyyouve seen neale  allie loved this sharp keen voice for its note of dread shure bgorra yez couldnt hilp seein him hes as big as a hill an his shirts as red as caseys red wan i wint to give him the little gun wot durade pulled on him dom me he looked roight at me an niver seen me replied the irishman  lee you will see neale queried general lodge there was a silence  no presently came a cold reply it is not necessary he saved meinjury perhaps i am grateful ill reward him  how rang general lodges voice  gold of course neale was a gambler probably he had a grudge against this durade i need not meet neale it seems i am somewhatoverwrought i wish to spare myself further excitement  leelisten returned general lodge violently neale is a splendid young manthe nerviest best engineer i ever knew i predicted great things for him they have come true  that doesnt interest me  youll hear it anyhow he saved the life of this girl who has turned out to be your daughter he took care of her he loved herwas engaged to marry her then he lost her and after that he was half mad it nearly ruined him  i do not credit that it was gambling drinkand bad women that ruined him  no  but pardon me general ifas you intimatethere was an attachment between him and my unfortunate child would he have become an associate of gamblers and vicious women  he would not the nature of his fury the retribution he visited upon this damned spaniard prove the manner of man he is  wild indeed but hardly from a sense of loyalty these camps breed bloodspillers i heard you say that  youll hear me say something more presently retorted the other with heat scarcely controlled but were wasting time i dont insist that you see neale thats your affair it seems to me the least you could do would be to thank him i certainly advise you not to offer him gold i do insist however that you let him see the girl  no  but man say mcdermott go fetch neale in here  allie lee heard all this strange talk with consternation an irresistible magnet drew her toward those curtains which she grasped with trembling hands ready but not able to part them and enter the room it seemed that in there was a friend of neales whom she was going to love and an enemy whom she was going to hate as for neale seeing herat onceonly death could rob her of that  general lodge i have no sympathy for neale came the cold voice of allison lee  there was no reply some one coughed footsteps sounded in the hallway and a hum of distant voices  you forget continued lee what happened not many hours ago when your train was saved by that daredevil caseythe little book held tight in his locked teeththe letter meant for this neale from one of bentons campwomen your engineer read enough you heard i heard a letter from a dying woman she accused neale of striking herof killing her she said she was dying but she loved him do you remember that general lodge  yes alas lee i dont deny that but  there are no buts  lee youre hard hard as steel appearances seem against neale i dont seek to extenuate them but i know men neale might have fallenit seems he must have these are terrible times in anger or drink neale might have struck this woman but kill herno  a gleam pierced allie lees dark bewilderment they meant beauty stanton that beautiful fair woman with such a white soft bosom and such sad eyesshe whom larry king had shot what a tangle of fates and lives she could tell them why beauty stanton was dying then other words like springing fire caught allies thought and a sickening ripple of anguish convulsed her they believed beauty stanton had loved nealehadallie would have died before admitting that last thought to her consciousness for a second the room turned black her hold on the curtains kept her from falling with frantic and terrible earnestnessthe old dominance neale had acquired over hershe clung to the one truth that mattered she loved nealebelonged to himand he was there that they were about to meet again was as strange and wonderful a thing as had ever happened what had she not endured what must he have gone through the fiery stinging nature of her new and sudden pain she could not realize  again the strong speech became distinct to her   youll stay hereand you dillon dont any one leave this room lee you can leave if you want but well see neale and so will allie lee  allie spread the curtains and stood there no one saw her all the men faced the door through which sounded slow heavy tread of boots an irishman entered then a tall man allies troubled soul suddenly calmed she saw neale  slowly he advanced a few steps another man entered and allie knew him by his buckskin garb neale turned his face in the light and a poignant cry leaped up from allies heart to be checked on her lips was this her young and hopeful and splendid lover she recognized him yet now did not know him he stood bareheaded and her swift allembracing glance saw the gray over his temples and the eyes that looked out from across the border of a dark hell and face white as death and twitching with spent passion  mrlee he panted very low and the bloody patch on his shirt heaved with his breath my onlyregretisi didntthink to makeduradetell the truth he lied he wanted torevenge himselfon allies motherthrough allie what he saidabout alliewas a lieas black as his heart he meant evilfor her butsomehow she was saved he was a tigerplayingand he waitedtoo long you must realizeher innocenceand understand god has watched over allie lee it was not lucknor accident but innocence hough died to save her then ancliffe then my old friendlarry king these menbrokengone to hellout herefelt an innocence that made themmadas i have just been that is proofif you need it men of ruined livescould not riseand dieas they didvictims of a false impressionof innocence they knew  neales voice sank to a whisper his eyes intent to read belief in the cold face of allison lee  i thank you neale for your service to me and your defense of her he said what can i do for you  sirii  can i reward you in any way  the gray burned out of neales face i asknothingexcept that you believe me  lee did not grant this nor was there any softening of his cold face  i would like to ask you a few questions he said general lodge here informed me that you saved mymy daughters life long ago can you tell me what became of her mother  she was in the caravanmassacred by sioux replied neale i saw her buried her grave is not so many miles from here  then a tremor changed allison lees expression he turned away an instant his hand closed tight he bit his lips this evidence of feeling in him relaxed the stony scrutiny of the watchers and they shifted uneasily on their feet  allie stood watchingwaiting with her heart at her lips  where did you take my daughter queried lee presently  to the home of a trapper my friendslingerland replied neale indicating the buckskinclad figure she lived thereslowly recovering you dont know that she lost her mindfor a while but she recovered and during an absence of slingerlandsshe was taken away  were you and shesweethearts  yes  and engaged to marry  of course replied neale dreamily  that cannot be now  i understand i didnt expecti didnt think  allie lee had believed many times that her heart was breaking but now she knew it had never broken till then why did he not turn to see her waiting therestricken motionless and voiceless wild to give the lie to those cold strange words  then nealeif you will not accept anything from me let us terminate this painful interview said allison lee  im sorry i only wanted to tell youand ask to seealliea moment replied neale  no it might cause a breakdown i dont want to risk anything that might prevent my taking the next train with her  going to take herback east asked neale as if talking to himself  certainly  theniwont see her neale murmured dazedly  at this juncture general lodge stepped out his face was dark his mouth stern  his action caused a breaking of the strange viselike clutchthe mute and motionless spellthat had fallen upon allie she felt the gathering of tremendous forces in her in an instant she would show these stupid men the tumult of a womans heart  lee be generous spoke up general lodge feelingly let neale see the girl  i said no snapped lee  but why not in heavens name  why i told you why declared lee passionately  but leethat implication may not be true we didnt read all that letter protested general lodge  ask him  then the general turned to neale boytell medid this stanton woman love youdid you strike her did you the generals voice failed  neale faced about with a tragic darkening of his face to my shameit is true he said clearly  then allie lee swept forward oh neale  he seemed to rise and leap at once and she ran straight into his arms no man no trouble no mystery no dishonor no barriernothing could have held her back the instant she saw how the sight of her how the sound of her voice had transformed neale for one tumultuous glorious terrible moment she clung to his neck blind her heart bursting then she fell back with hands seeking her breast  i heard she cried i know nothing of beauty stantons letter but you didnt shoot her it was larry i saw him do it  allie he whispered  at last he had realized her actual presence the safety of her body and soul and all that had made him strange and old and grim and sad vanished in a beautiful transfiguration  you know larry did it implored allie tell them so  yes i know he replied but i did worse i  she saw him shaken by an agony of remorse and that agony was communicated to her  neale she loved you  he bowed his head  oh her cry was almost mute full of an unutterable realization of tragic fatality for her and youyou  allison lee strode between them facing neale see she knows and if you would spare hergo he exclaimed  she knowswhat gasped neale in a frenzy between doubt and certainty  allie felt a horrible nameless insidious sense of falsitya nightmare unrealityan intangible neale fated drifting away from her  goodbyeallie bless you ill behappyknowingyoure he choked and the tears streamed down his face it was a face convulsed by renunciation not by guilt whatever he had done it was not base  dont let mego iforgive you she burst out she held out her arms theres no one in the world but you  but neale plunged away upheld by slingerland and allies world grew suddenly empty and black  the train swayed and creaked along through the night with that strain and effort which told of upgrade the oillamps burned dimly in corners of the coach there were soldiers at open windows looking out there were passengers asleep sitting up and lying down and huddled over their baggage  but allie lee was not asleep she lay propped up with pillows and blankets covered by a heavy coat her window was open and a cool desert wind softly blew her hair she stared out into the night and the wheels seemed to be grinding over her crushed heart  it was late an old moon misshapen and pale shone low down over a dark rugged horizon clouds hid the stars the desert void seemed weirdly magnified by the wan light and all that shadowy waste silent lonely bleak called out to allie lee the desolation of her soul for what had she been saved the train creaked on and every foot added to her woe her unquenchable spirit pure as a white flame that had burned so wonderfully through the months of her peril flickered now that her peril ceased to be she had no fount of emotion left to draw upon else she would have hated this creaking train  it moved on and there loomed bold outlines of rock and ridge familiar to her they had been stamped upon her memory by the strain of her lonely wanderings along that very road she knew every rod of the way dark lonely wild as it was in the midst of that stark space lay the spot where benton had been a spot lost in the immensity of the desert if she had been asleep she would have awakened while passing there there was not a light flat patches and pale gleams a long wan length of bare street shadows everywherethese marked bentons grave  allie stared with strained eyes they were therein the blacknessthose noble men who had died for her in vain nonot in vain she breathed a prayer for thema word of love for larry larry the waster of life yet the faithful the symbol of brotherhood as long as she lived she would see him stalk before her with his red blazing fire his magnificent effrontery his supreme will he who had been the soul of chivalry the meekest of men before a woman the inheritor of a reverence for womanhood had ruthlessly shot out of his way that wonderful whitearmed beauty stanton  she too must lie there in the shadow allie shivered with the cool desert wind that blew in her face from the shadowy spaces she shut her eyes to hide the dim passing traces of terrible benton and the darkness that hid the lonely graves  the train moved on and on leaving what had been benton far behind and once more allie opened her weary eyes to the dim obscure reaches of the desert her heart beat very slowly under its leaden weight its endless pang her blood flowed at low ebb she felt the longforgotten recurrence of an old morbid horror like a poison lichen fastening upon the very spring of life it passed and came again and left her once more her thoughts wandered back along the night track she had traversed until again her ears were haunted by that strange sound which had given roaring city its name she had been torn away from hope love almost life itself where was neale he had turned from her obedient to allison lee and the fatal complexity and perverseness of life the vindication of her spiritual faith and the answer to her prayers lay in the fact that she had been saved but rather than to be here in this car daughter of a rich father but separated from neale she would have preferred to fill one of the nameless graves in benton     33  the sun set palegold and austere as neale watched the train bear allie lee away no thought of himself entered into that solemn moment of happiness allie leealivesafeher troubles endedon her way home with her father the long train wound round the bold bluff and at last was gone for neale the moment held something big final a phasea part of his life ended there  son its over said slingerland who watched with him allies gone homeback to whar she belongsto come into her own thank god an youwhy this day turns you back to whar you was once allie owes her life to you an her fathers life think son of these hyar timeshow much wuss it might hev been  neales sense of thankfulness was unutterable passively he went with slingerland silent and gentle the trapper dressed his wounds tended him kept men away from him and watched by him as if he were a sick child  neale suffered only the weakness following the action and stress of great passion his mind seemed full of beautiful solemn bells of blessing resonant ringing the wonder of an everlasting unchangeable truth night fellthe darkness thickenedthe old trapper kept his vigiland neale sank to sleep and the sweet lowtoned bells claimed him in his dreams  how strange for neale to greet a dawn without hatred he and slingerland had breakfast together  son will you go into the hills with me asked the old trapper  yes some day when the railroads built replied neale thoughtfully  slingerlands keen eyes quickened but the railroads about donean you need a vacation he insisted  yes neale answered dreamily  son mebbe you ought to wait awhile youre packin a bullet somewhar in your carcass  its here said neale putting his hand to his breast high up toward the shoulder i feel ita dull steady weighty pain but thats nothing i hope i always have it  wal i dont an son you aint never goin back to drink an cardsan all thet hell not now  neales smile was a promise and the light of it was instantly reflected on the rugged face of the trapper  reckon i neednt asked thet wal ill be sayin goodbye you kin expect me back some day to see the meetin of the rails from east an westan to pack you off to my hills  neale rode out of roaring city on the worktrain sitting on a flatcar with a crowd of hairybreasted redshirted laborers  that train carried hundreds of men tons of steel rails thousands of ties and also it was equipped to feed the workers and to fight indians it ran to the end of the rails about forty miles out of roaring city  neale sought out reilly the boss this big irishman was in the thick of the start of the daywhich was like a battle neale waited in the crowd standing there in his shirtsleeves with the familiar bustle and color strong as wine to his senses at last reilly saw him and shoved out a huge paw  hullo neale im glad to see ye they tell me ye did a dom foine job  reilly i need work said neale  but monye was shot ejaculated the boss  im all right  ye look thot an no mistake shure now ye aint serious about work youthats chafe of all thim engineer jobs  i want to work with my hands let me heave ties or carry rails or swing a sledgefor just a few days ive explained to general lodge its a kind of vacation for me  reilly gazed with keen twinkling eyes at neale ye cant be drunk an look sober  reilly im soberand in dead earnest appealed neale i want to go backbe in the finishto lay some railsdrive some spikes  the boss lost his humorous quizzing expression shureshure replied reilly as if he saw but failed to comprehend yere on an more power to ye  he sent neale out with the gang detailed to heave railroad ties  a string of flatcars loaded with rails and ties stood on the track where the work of yesterday had ended beyond stretched the roadbed yellow level winding as far as eye could see the sun beat down hot the dry scorching desert breeze swept down from the bare hills across the waste dust flew up in puffs uprooted clumps of sage like balls went rolling along and everywhere the veils of heat rose from the sunbaked earth  drill ye terriers drill rang out a cheery voice and neale remembered casey  neales gang was put to carrying ties neale got hold of the first tie thrown off the car  phwat the hells yere hurry protested his partner this fellow was gnarled and knotted brickred in color with face a network of seams and narrow sunburnt slits for eyes he answered to the name of pat  they carried the tie out to the end of the rails and dropped it on the level roadbed men there set it straight and tamped the gravel around it neale and his partner went back for another passing a dozen couples carrying ties forward behind these staggered the rows of men burdened with the heavy iron rails  so the days toil began  pat had glanced askance at neale and then had made dumb signs to his fellowlaborers indicating his hard lot in being yoked to this new wild man on the job but his ridicule soon changed to respect presently he offered his gloves to neale they were refused  but frind ye aint tough loike me he protested  pat theyll put you to bed tonightif you stay with me replied neale  the hell ye say come on thin  at first neale had no sensations of heat weariness thirst or pain he dragged the little irishman forward to drop the tiesthen strode back ahead of him neale was obsessed by a profound emotion this was a new beginning for him for him the world and life had seemed to cease when yesternight the sun sank and allie lee passed out of sight his motive in working there he imagined was to lay a few rails drive a few spikes along the last miles of the road that he had surveyed he meant to work this way only a little while till the rails from east met those from west  this profound emotion seemed accompanied by a procession of thoughts each thought in turn like a sun with satellites reflecting its radiance upon them and rousing strange dreamy fullhearted fancies allie livedas good as innocent as ever incomparably beautifulsadeyed eloquent haunting from that mighty thought sprang both neales exaltation and his activity he had loved her so well that conviction of her death had broken his heart deadened his ambition ruined his life but since by the mercy of god and the innocence that had made men heroic she had survived all peril all evil then had begun a colossal overthrow in neales soul of the darkness the despair the hate the indifference he had been flung aloft into the heights and he had seen into heaven he asked for nothing in the world allsatisfied eternally humble grateful with every passionate drop of blood throbbing through his heart he dedicated all his spiritual life to memory and likewise there seemed a tremendous need in him of sustained physical action even violence he turned to the last stages of the construction of the great railroad  what fine comrades these hairybreasted toilers made neale had admired them once now he loved them every group seemed to contain a trio like that one he had known so wellcasey shane and mcdermott then he divined that these men were all alike they all toiled swore fought drank gambled hundreds of them went to nameless graves but the work went onthe great driving united heart beat on  neale was under its impulse in another sense  when he lifted a tie and felt the hard splintering wood he wondered where it had come from what kind of a tree it was who had played in its shade how surely birds had nested in it and animals had grazed beneath it between him and that square log of wood there was an affinity somehow his hold upon it linked him strangely to a long past intangible spirit of himself he must cling to it lest he might lose that illusive feeling then when he laid it down he felt regret fade into a realization that the yellowgravel roadbed also inspirited him he wanted to feel it work in it level it make it somehow his own  when he strode back for another load his magnifying eyes gloated over the toilers in actionthe rows of men carrying and laying rails and the splendid brawny figures of the spikers naked to the waist swinging the heavy sledges the blows rang out spangspangspang strong music full of meaning when his turn came to be a spiker he would love that hardest work of all  the engine puffed smoke and bumped the cars ahead little by little as the track advanced men on the train carried ties and rails forward filling the front cars as fast as they were emptied long lines of laborers on the ground passed to and fro burdened going forward returning emptyhanded the rails and the shovels and the hammers and the picks all caught the hot gleam from the sun the dust swept up in sheets the ring the crash the thump the scrape of iron and wood and earth in collision filled the air with a sound rising harshly above the song and laugh and curse of men  a shifting colorful strenuous scene of toil  gradually neale felt that he was fitting into this scene becoming a part of it an atom once more in the great whole he doubted while he thrilled clearly as he saw keenly as he felt he yet seemed bewildered was he not gazing out at this construction work through windows of his soul once more painted colored beautiful because the most precious gift he might have prayed for had been given himlife and hope for allie lee  he did not know he could not think  his comrade pat wiped floods of sweat from his scarlet face ill be domned if ye aint a sonofagun fer worrk he complained  pat weve been given the honor of pacemakers theyve got to keep up with us come on replied neale  be gad there aint a mon in the gang phwatll trade fer me honor thin declared pat frind id loike to live till next payday  come on then work up an appetite rejoined neale  shure ill die an id loike to ask beggin yere pardon

casey fer there was niver but wan loike yean he was casey mon yere sweatin blood roight now  pat pointed at neales red wet shirt neale slapped his breast and drops of blood and sweat spattered from under his hand  an shure yere hands are bladin too ejaculated pat  they were indeed but neale had not noted that  the boss reilly passing by paused to look and grin  pat yez got some one to kape up with today were half a mile ahead of yestidy this time  then he turned to neale  ive seen one in yer classcasey by name an thots talkin  he went his way and neale plodding on saw the red face of the great casey with its set grin and the black pipe swiftly then he saw it as he had heard of it last and a shadow glanced fleetingly across the singular radiance of his mind  the shrill whistle of the locomotive halted the work and called the men to dinner and rest instantly the scene changed the slow steady rhythmic motions of labor gave place to a scramble back to the long line of cars then the horde of sweaty toilers sought places in the shade and ate and drank and smoked and rested as the spirit of work had been merry so was that of rest with always a dry grim earnestness in the background  neale slowed down during the afternoon to the unconcealed thankfulness of his partner the burn of the sun the slippery sweat the growing ache of muscles the neverending thirst the lessening of strengththese sensations impinged upon neales emotion and gradually wore to the front of his consciousness his hands grew raw his back stiff and sore his feet crippled the wound in his breast burned and bled and throbbed at the end of the day he could scarcely walk  he rode in with the laborers slept twelve hours and awoke heavylimbed slow and aching but he rode out to work and his second day was one of agony  the third was a continual fight between will and body between spirit and pain but so long as he could step and lift he would work on from that time he slowly began to mend  then came his siege with the rails that was labor which made carrying ties seem light he toiled on sweating thin wearing hard growing clearer of mind as pain subsided and weariness of body no longer dominated him slowly thought and feeling returned until that morning dawned when like a flash of lightning illuminating his soul the profound and exalted emotion again possessed him soon he came to divine that the agony of toil and his victory over weak flesh had added to his strange happiness hour after hour he bent his back and plodded beside his comrades doing his share burdened as they were silent watchful listening dreaming keen to note the progress of the road yet deep in his own intense abstraction he seemed to have two minds he saw every rod of the ten miles of track laid every day knew as only an engineer could know the wonder of such progress and likewise always in his sight in his mind shone a face redlipped soulful lovely like a saints with mournful violet eyes starsweet in innocence life had given allie lee back to himto his love and his memory and all that could happen to him now must be good at first he had asked for nothing so grateful was he to fate but now he prayed for hours and days and nights to remember  the day came when neale graduated into the class of spikers this division of labor to him had always represented the finest spirit of the building the driversthe spikersthe men who nailed the railswho riveted the last linksthese brawny halfnaked wielders of the sledges bronzed as indians seemed to embody both the romance and the achievement neale experienced a subtle perception with the first touch and lift and swing of the great hammer and there seemed born in him a genius for the stroke he had a free easy swing with tremendous power he could drive so fast that his comrade on the opposite rail and the carriers and layers could not keep up with him moments of rest seemed earned during these he would gaze with glinting eyes back at the gangs and the trains at the smoke dust and movement and beyond toward the east  one day he drove spikes for hours with the gangs in uninterrupted labor around him while back a mile along the road the troopers fought the sioux and all this time when any moment he might be ordered to drop his sledge for a rifle he listened to the voice in his memory and saw the face  another day dawned in which he saw the grading gangs return from work ahead they were done streams of horses wagons and men on the return they had met the graders from the west and the two lines of roadbed had been connected as these gangs passed cheer on cheer greeted them from the raillayers it was a splendid moment  from lip to lip then went the word that the gradinggangs from east and west had passed each other in plain sight working on grading on for a hundred miles farther than necessary they had met and had passed on side by side doubling the expense of construction  this knowledge gave neale a melancholy reminder of the dishonest aspect of the roadbuilding and he thought of many things the spirit of the work was grand the labor heroic but alas side by side with these splendid and noble attributes stalked the specters of greed and gold and lust of blood and of death  but neither knowledge such as this nor peril from indians nor the toilpangs of a galley slave had power to change neales supreme state of joy  he gazed back toward the east and then with mighty swing he drove a spike he loved allie lee beyond all conception and next he loved the building of the railroad  when such thoughts came he went back to pure sensations the great bold peaks looming dark the winding level roadbed the smoky desertland reflecting heat the completed track and gangs of moving men like bright ants in the sunlight and the exhaust of the engines the old song drill ye terriers drill the ring and crash and thud and scrape of labor the whistle of the seeping sand on the wind the feel of the heavy sledge that he could wield as a toy the throb of pulse the smell of dust and sweat the sense of his being there his action his solidarity his physical brawnonce more manhood  but at last human instincts encroached upon neales superlative detachment from self it seemed all of a sudden that he stepped toward an eastbound train when he reached the coach something halted hima thoughtwhere was he going the westbound worktrain was the one he wanted he laughed a little grimly certainly he had grown absentminded and straightway he became thoughtful in a different way not many moments of reflection were needed to assure him that he had moved toward the eastbound train with the instinctive idea of going to allie lee the thing amazed him  but sheshes gone out of my life he soliloquized and i ami was glad  the lightningswift shift to past tense enlightened neale  he went out to work that work still loomed splendid to him but it seemed not the same he saw and felt the majesty of common free men sweating and bleeding and groaning over toil comparable to the building of the pyramids he felt the best that had ever been in him quicken and broaden as he rubbed elbows with these simple elemental toilers with them he had gotten down to the level of truth his old genius for achievement the practical and scientific side of him still thrilled with the battle of strong hands against the natural barriers of the desert he saw the thousands of plodding swearing fighting blaspheming joking laborers on the field of actionsaw the picture they made red and bronzed and black dustbegrimed and how here with the ties and the rails and the roadbed was the heart of that epical turmoil what approach could great and rich engineers and directors have made to that vast enterprise without these sons of brawn neale now saw what he had once dreamed and that was the secret of his longing to get down to the earth with these men  he loved to swing that sledge to hear the spang of the steel ring out he had a sheer physical delight in the power of his body long since thinnedout hardened tough as the wood into which he drove the spikes he loved his new comrade pat the gnarled and knotted little irishman who cursed and complained of his job and fought his fellowworkers yet who never lagged never shirked and never failed though his days of usefulness must soon be over soon pat would drop by the roadside a victim to toil and whisky and sun and he was great in his obscurity he wore a brass tag with a number he signed his wage receipt with a cross he cared only for drink and a painted hag in a squalid tent yet in all the essentials that neale now called great his friend pat reached up to themthe spirit to work to stand his share to go on to endure to fulfill his task  neale might have found salvation in this latedeveloped and splendid relation to labor and to men but there was a hitch in his brain he would see all that was beautiful and strenuous and progressive around him and then in a flash that hiatus in his mind would operate to make him hopeless then he would stand as in a trance with faraway gaze in his eyes until his fellowspiker would recall him to his neglected work these intervals of abstraction grew upon him until he would leave off in the act of driving a spike  and sometimes in these strange intervals he longed for his old friend brother shadowlarry red king he held to larrys memory though with it always would return that low strange roar of bentons gold and lust and blood and death neale did not understand the mystery of what he had been through it had been a phase of wildness never to be seen again by his race his ambition and effort his fall his dark siege with hell his friendship and loss his agony and toil his victory were all symbolical of the progress of a great movement in his experience lay hid all that development  the coming of night was always a relief now for with the end of the days work he need no longer fight his battle it was a losing battlethat he knew shunning everybody he paced to and fro out on the dark windy desert under the lonely pitiless stars  his longing to see allie lee grew upon him while he had believed her dead he had felt her spirit hovering near him in every shadow and her voice whispered on the wind she was alive now but gone away far distant over mountains and plains out of his sight and reach somewhere to take up a new life alien to his what would she do could she bear it never would she forget himbe faithless to his memory yet she was young and her life had been hard she might yield to that cold allison lees dictation in happy surroundings her beauty and sweetness would bring a crowd of lovers to her  but thats allonly natural muttered neale in perplexity i want her to forgetto be happyto find a home for her to grow oldalone no she must love some manmarry  and with the spoken words neales heart contracted he knew that he lied to himself if she ever cared for another man that would be the end of warren neale but then he was ended anyhow jealousy strange new horrible added to neales other burdens finished him he had the manhood to try to fight selfishness but he had failed to subdue it and he had nothing left to fight his consuming love and hatred of life and terrible loneliness and that fierce thingjealousy he had saved allie lee why had he given her up he had stained his hands with blood for her sake and that awful moment came back to him when maddened by the sting of a bullet he had gloried in the cracking of durades bones in the ghastly terror and fear of death upon the spaniards face in the feel of the knifeblade as he forced durade to stab himself always neale had been haunted by this final scene of his evil life in the construction camps a somber and spectral shape intangible gloomyfaced often attended him in the shadow he justified his deed for durade would have killed allison lee but that fact did not prevent the haunting shape the stir in the dark air the nameless step upon neales trail  and jealousy stronger than all except fear wore neale out of his exaltation out of his dream out of his old disposition to work he could persist in courage if not in joy but jealous longing would destroy himhe felt that it was so powerful so wonderful that it brought back to him words and movements which until then he had been unable to recall  and he lived over the past much still baffled him yet gradually more and more of what had happened became clear specifically in his memory he could not think from the present back over the past he had to ponder the other way one day leaning on his sledge neales torturing self morbid inquisitive growing by what it fed on whispered another question to his memory  what were some of the last words she spoke to me and there limned white on the dark background of his mind the answer appeared neale i forgive you  he recalled her face the tragic eyes the outstretched arms  forgive me for what neale muttered dazed and troubled he dropped his sledge and remained standing there though the noon whistle called the gang to dinner looking out across the hot smoky arid desert he saw again that scene where he had appealed to allison lee  the picture was etched out vividly and again he lived through those big moments of emotion  the room full of menlees cold acceptance of fact his thanks his offer his questions his refusalgeneral lodges earnest solicitationthe rapid exchange of passionate words between themthe query put to neale and his answerthe sudden appearance of allie shocking his heart with raptureher sweet wild wordsand so the end how vivid nowhow like flashes of lightning in his mind  lee thought id killed stanton muttered neale in intense perplexity but sheshe told them larry did it what a strange idea lee hadand general lodge too he defended me ah  suddenly neale drew from his pocket the little leather notebook that had been stantons and which contained her letter to him with trembling hands he opened it again this letter was to mean a revelation  general lodge had said his engineer had read aloud only the first of that message to neale and from this allison lee and all the listeners had formed their impressions  neale read these first lines  no wonder they imagined i killed her he exclaimed she accuses me but she never meant what they imagined she meant why that evidence could hang me allie told them she saw larry do it and its common knowledge nowive heard it here what then had allie to forgiveto forgive with eyes that will haunt me to my grave  then the truth burst upon him with merciless and stunning force  my god allie believed what they all believedwhat i must have blindly made seem true that i was beauty stantons lover     34  the home to which allie lee was brought stood in the outskirts of omaha upon a wooded bank above the river  allie watched the broad yellow missouri swirling by she liked best to be alone outdoors in the shade of the trees in the weeks since her arrival there she had not recovered from the shock of meeting neale only to be parted from him  but the comfort the luxury of her home the relief from constant dread such as she had known for years the quiet at nightthese had been so welcome so saving that her burden of sorrow seemed endurable yet in time she came to see that the finding of a father and a home had only added to her bitterness  allison lees sister an elderly woman of strong character resented the homebringing of this strange lost daughter allie had found no sympathy in her for a while neighbors and friends of the lees flocked to the house and were kind gracious attentive to allie then somehow her story or part of it became gossip her father sensitive cold embittered by the past suffered intolerable shame at the disgrace of a wifes desertion and a daughters notoriety allies presence hurt him he avoided her as much as possible the little kindnesses that he had shown and his feelings of pride in her beauty and charm soon vanished there was no love between them allie had tried hard to care for him but her heart seemed to be buried in that vast grave of the west she was obedient dutiful passive but she could not care for him and there came a day when she realized that he did not believe she had come unscathed through the wilds of the goldfields and the vileness of the construction camps she bore this patiently though it stung her but the loss of respect for her father did not come until she heard men in his study loudvoiced and furious wrangle over contracts and accuse him of doubledealing  later he told her that he had become involved in financial straits and that unless he could raise a large sum by a certain date he would be ruined  and it was this day that allie sat on a bench in the little arbor and watched the turbulent river she was sorry for her father but she could not help him moreover alien griefs did not greatly touch her her own grief was deep and allenfolding she was heartsick and always yearningyearning for that she dared not name  the day was hot sultry no birds sang but the locusts were noisy the air was full of humming bees  allie watched the river she was idle because her aunt would not let her work she could only remember and suffer the great river soothed her where did it come from and where did it go and what was to become of her almost it would have been better  a servant interrupted her missy heahs a gennelman to see yo announced the negro girl  allie looked she thought she saw a tall buckskinclad man carrying a heavy pack was she dreaming or had she lost her mind she got up shaking in every limb this tall man moved he seemed real his bronzed face beamed he approached he set the pack down on the bench then his keen clear eyes pierced allie  wal lass he said gently  the familiar voice was no dream no treachery of her mind slingerland she could not speak she could hardly see she swayed into his arms then when she felt the great strong clasp and the softness of buckskin on her face and the odor of pine and sageand desert dust she believed in his reality  her heart seemed to collapse all within her was riot  neale she whispered in anguish  all right an workin hard he sent me replied slingerland swift to get his message out  allie quivered and closed her eyes and leaned against him a beautiful something pervaded her soul slowly the tumult within her breast subsided she recovered  uncle al she called him tenderly  wal i should smile an glad to see youwhy lord id never tell you youre white an shaky lass set down hyaron the benchbeside me thar allie ive a powerful lot to tell you  wait to see youand to hearof himalmost killed me with joy she panted her little hands once so strong and brown but

whispered  wal if thet aint too bad shore its natural youd be downhearted losin neale thet way  its not allthat she murmured and then she told him  wal wal ejaculated the trapper stroking his beard in thoughtful sorrow but i reckon thets natural too youre strange hyar an thet story will hang over you lass with all due respect to your father i reckon youd better come back to me an neale  did he tell

an exquisite bittersweet fury of love she seemed rising uplifted filled with rich strong joy  i forgave him she murmured dreamily low to herself  war mebbe youll be right glad you didpresently said slingerland with animation specially when thar wasnt nothin much to forgive  allie became mute she could not lift her eyes  lass listen began slingerland after you left roarin city neale went at hard work began by heavin ties an rails an now hes slingin a sledge this was amazin to me i seen him only onct since an thet was the other day but i heerd about him i rode over to roarin city several times an i made it my bizness to find out about neale he never came into the town at all they said he worked like a slave the first day bleedin hard but he couldnt be stopped an the work didnt kill him though thar was some as swore it would they said he changed an when he toughened up thar was never but one man as could equal him an thet was an irish feller named casey i heerd it was somethin worth

me he was goin after the gold thet horn had buried along the old laramie trail wal i took my outfit an we rode back into the hills you remember them wal we found the gold easy enough an we packed it back to roarin city thar neale sent me off on a train to fetch the gold to you an hyar i i am an thars the gold  allie stared at the pack bewildered by slingerlands story suddenly she sat up and she felt the blood rush to her cheeks  gold horns gold but its not mine did neale send it to me  every ounce replied the trapper soberly i reckon its yours thar was no one else leftan you recollect what horn said lass its yoursan im goin to make you keep it  how much is there queried allie with thrills of curiosity how well she remembered horn he had told her he had no relatives indeed the gold was hers  wal neale an me couldnt calkilate how much hevin nothin to weigh the gold but its a fortune  allie turned from the pack to the earnest face of the trapper there had been many critical moments in her life but never one with the suspense the fullness the inevitableness of this  did neale send anything else she flashed  wal yes an i was comin to thet replied slingerland as he unlaced the front of his huntingfrock presently he drew forth a little leather notebook which he handed to allie she took it while looking up at him never had she seen his face radiate such strange emotion she divined it to be the supreme happiness inherent in the power to give happiness  allie trembled she opened the little book surely it would contain a message that would be as sweet as life to dying eyes she read a name written in ink in a clear script beauty stanton  her pulses ceased to beat her blood to flow her heart to throb all seemed to freeze within her except her mind and that leaped fearfully over the first lines of a letterthen feverishly on to the closeonly to fly back and read again then she dropped the book she hid her face on slingerlands breast she clutched him with frantic hands she clung there her body all held rigid as if some extraordinary strength or inspiration or joy had suddenly inhibited weakness  wal lass hyar youre takin it powerful hardan i made sure  hush whispered allie raising her face she kissed him then she sprang up like a bent sapling released she met slingerlands keen gazesaw him startthen rise as if the better to meet a shock  i am going back west with

sooner the better lass will you run off or tell him  ill tell him he cant stop me even if he would the gold will save him from ruinhe will let me go  she stooped to pick up the little leather notebook and placed it in her bosom her heart seemed to surge against it the great river rolled onrolled onmagnified in her sight a thick rich beautiful light shone under the trees what was this dance of her blood while she seemed so calm so cool so sure  does he have any ideathat i might return to him she asked  none lass none thet ill swear declared slingerland when i left him at roarin city the other day he waswal like he used to be the boy come out in him again not jest the same but brave sendin thet gold an thet little book made him happy i reckon neale found his soul then an he never expects to see you again in this hyar world     35  building a railroad grew to be an exact and wonderful science with the men of the union pacific from engineers down to the laborers who ballasted and smoothed the roadbed  wherever the worktrains stopped there began a hum like a beehive gangs loaded rails on a flatcar and the horses or mules were driven at a gallop to the front there two men grasped the end of a rail and began to slide it off in couples other laborers of that particular gang laid hold and when they had it off the car they ran away with it to drop it in place while they were doing this other gangs followed with more rails four rails laid to the minute when one of the cars was empty it was tipped off the track to make room for the next one and as that next one passed the first was levered back again on the rails to return for another load  four rails down to the minute it was herculean toil the men who fitted the rails were cursed the most frequently because they took time a few seconds when there was no time  then the spikers these brawny halfnaked sweaty giantswhat a grand spanging music of labor rang from under their hammers three strokes to a spike for most spikers only two strokes for such as casey or neale ten spikes to a railfour hundred rails to a mile  how many million times had brawny arms swung and sledges clanged  forward every day the worktrains crept westward closer and closer to that great hour when they would meet the worktrains coming east  the momentum now of the roadlaying was tremendous the spirit that nothing could stop had become embodied in a scientific army of toilers a mass a machine ponderous irresistible moving on to the meeting of the rails  every day the crisscross of ties lengthened out along the winding roadbed and the lines of glistening rails kept pace with them the sun beat down hotthe dust flew in sheets and puffsthe smoky veils floated up from the desert redshirted toilers blueshirted toilers halfnaked toilers sweat and bled and laughed grimly and sucked at their pipes and bent their broad backs the pace had quickened to the limit of human endurance fury of sound filled the air its rhythmical pace was the mighty gathering impetus of a last heave a last swing  promontory point was the place destined to be famous as the meeting of the rails  on that summer day in 1869 which was to complete the work special trains arrived from west and east the governor of california who was also president of the western end of the line met the vicepresident of the united states and the directors of the union pacific mormons from utah were there in force the government was represented by officers and soldiers in uniform and these with their military band lent the familiar martial air to the last scene of the great enterprise here mingled the irish and negro laborers from the east with the chinese and mexican from the west then the eastern paddies laid the last rails on one end while the western coolies laid those on the other the rails joined spikes were driven until the last one remained  the territory of arizona had presented a spike of gold silver and iron nevada had given one of silver and a railroad tie of laurel wood and the last spike of allof solid goldwas presented by california  the driving of the last spike was to be heard all over the united states omaha was the telegraphic center the operator here had informed all inquirers when the last spike is driven at promontory point we will say done  the magic of the wire was to carry that single message abroad over the face of the land  the president of the united states was to be congratulated as were the officers of the army and the engineers of the work san francisco had arranged a monster celebration marked by the booming of cannon and enthusiastic parades free railroad tickets into sacramento were to fill that city with jubilant crowds at omaha cannons were to be fired business abandoned and the whole city given over to festivity chicago was to see a great parade and decoration in new york a hundred guns were to boom out the tidings trinity church was to have special services and the famous chimes were to play old hundred in philadelphia a ringing of the liberty bell in independence hall would initiate a celebration and so it would be in all prominent cities of the union  neale was at promontory point that summer day he stood aloof from the crowd on a little bank watching with shining eyes  to him the scene was great beautiful final  only a few hundreds of that vast army of laborers were present at the meeting of the rails but enough were there to represent the whole neales glances were swift and gathering his comrades pat and mcdermott sat near exchanging lights for their pipes they seemed reposeful and for them the matter was ended broken hulks of toilers of the rails neither would labor any more a burly negro with crinkly bulletshaped head leaned against a post a brawny spiker naked to the waist his wonderful shoulders and arms brown shiny knotted scarred stood near sledge in hand a group of irishmen redand blueshirted puffed their black pipes and argued swarthy sloeeyed mexicans with huge sombreros on their knees lolled in the shade of a tree talking low in their mellow tones and fingering cigarettes chinamen with long pigtails and foreign dress added strangeness and colorful contrast  neale heard the low murmur of voices of the crowd and the slow puffing of the two engines head on only a few yards apart so strikingly different in shape then followed the pounding of hoofs and tread of many feet the clang of iron as the last rail went down how clear sweet spanging the hammer blows and there was the old sighing sweep of the wind then came a gunshot the snort of a horse a loud laugh  neale heard all with sensitive recording ears  mac yez are so dom smartnow tell me who built the u p demanded pat  thots asy me frind casey did bgorra retorted mcdermott  loike hell he did it was the irish  shure thots phwat i said mcdermott replied  wal thin phwat built the u p tell me thot yez knows so much  mcdermott scratched his sunblistered stubblefield of a face and grinned whisky built the eastern half an cold tay built the western half  pat regarded his comrade with considerable respect mac shure yez is intilligint he granted the irish lived on whisky an the chinamons on tay wal yez is so dom orful smart mebbe yez can tell me who got the money for thot worrk  bgorra i know where ivery dollar wint replied mcdermott  and so they argued on oblivious to the impressive last stage  neale sensed the rest the repose in the attitude of all the laborers present their hour was done and they accepted that with the equanimity with which they had met the toil the heat and thirst the sioux a splendid rugged loquacious crude elemental body of men unconscious of heroism those who had survived the five long years of toil and snow and sun and the bloody sioux and the roaring camps bore the scars the furrows the gray hairs of great and wild times  a lane opened up in the crowd to the spot where the rails had met  neale got a glimpse of his associates the engineers as they stood near the frockcoated group of dignitaries and directors then neale felt the stir and lift of emotion as if he were on a rising wave his blood began to flow fast and happily he was to share their triumphs the moment had come some one led him back to his post of honor as the head of the engineer corps  a silence fell then over that larger denser multitude it grew impressive charged waiting  then a man of god offered up a prayer his voice floated dreamily to neale when he had ceased there were slow dignified movements of frockcoated men as they placed in position the last spike  the silver sledge flashed in the sunlight and fell the sound of the drivingstroke did not come to neale with the familiar spang of iron it was soft mellow golden  a last stroke the silence vibrated to a deep hoarse acclaim from hundreds of mena triumphant united hurrah simultaneously sent out with that final message done  a great flood of sound of color seemed to wave over neale his eyes dimmed with salt tears blurring the splendid scene the last moment had passedthat for which he had stood with all faith all spiritand the victory was his the darkness passed out of his soul  then as he stood there bareheaded at the height of this allsatisfying moment when the last echoing melody of the sledge had blended in the roar of the crowd a strange feeling of a presence struck neale was it spiritualwas it divinewas it god or was it only baneful fatefulthe specter of his accomplished worka reminder of the long gray future  a hand slipped into hissmall soft trembling exquisitely thrilling neale became still as a stonetransfixed he knew that touch no dream no fancy no morbid visitation he felt warm fleshtender clinging fingers and then the pulse of blood that beat of hopelovelifeallie lee     36  slingerland saw allie lee married to neale by that minister of god whose prayer had followed the joining of the rails  and to the old trapper had fallen the joy and the honor of giving the bride away and of receiving her kiss as though he had been her father then the happy congratulations from general lodge and his staff the merry dinner given the couple and its toasts warm with praise of the brides beauty and the grooms luck and success neales strange rapt happiness and allies soul shining through her darkblue eyesthis hour was to become memorable for slingerlands future dreams  slingerlands sight was not clear when as the train pulled away he waved a last goodbye to his young friends now he had no hope no prayer left unanswered except to be again in his beloved hills  abruptly he hurried away to the corrals where his packtrain was all in readiness to start he did not speak to a man he had packed a dozen burrosthe largest and completest packtrain he had ever driven the abundance of carefully selected supplies tools and traps should last him many yearssurely all the years that he would live  slingerland did not intend to return to civilization and he never even looked back at that blotch on the face of the bluffthat hideous roaring city  he drove the burros at a good trot his mind at once busy and absent happy with the pictures of that last hour gloomy with the undefined unsatisfied cravings of his heart friendship with neale affection for allie acquainted him with the fact that he had missed something in lifenot friendship for he had had hunter friends but love perhaps of a sweetheart surely love of a daughter  for the rest the old trapper was glad to see the last of habitations and of men and of the railroad slingerland hated that great shining steel band of progress connecting east and west every ringing sledgehammer blow had sung out the deathknell of the trappers calling this railroad spelled the end of the wilderness what one group of greedy men had accomplished others would imitate and the grass of the plains would be burned the forests blackened the fountains dried up in the valleys and the wild creatures of the mountains driven and hunted and exterminated the end of the buffalo had comethe end of the indian was in sightand that of the furbearing animal and his hunter must follow soon with the hurrying years  slingerland hated the railroad and he could not see as neale did or any of the engineers or builders this old trapper had the vision of the indianthat farseeing eye cleared by distance and silence and the force of the great lonely hills progress was great but nature undespoiled was greater if a race could not breed all stronger men through its great movements it might better not breed any for the bad overmultiplied the good and so their needs magnified into greed slingerland saw many shining bands of steel across the plains and mountains many stations and hamlets and cities a growing and marvelous prosperity from timber mines farms and in the distant enda gutted west  he made his first camp on a stream watering a valley twenty miles from the railroad there were indian tracks on the trails but he had nothing to fear from indians that night though all was starry and silent around him as he lay he still held the insupportable feeling  next day he penetrated deeper into the foothills and soon he had gained the fastnesses of the mountains no longer did he meet trails except those of deer and wildcat and bear and so day after day he drove his burros climbing and descending the rocky ways until he had penetrated to the very heart of the great wild range  in all his roaming over untrodden lands he had never come into such a wild place no foot noteven an indians had ever desecrated this green valley with its clear singing stream its herds of tame deer its curious beaver its pinecovered slopes its looming gray protective peaks and at last he was satisfied to halt thereto build his cabin and his corral  discontent and longing and then hate passed into oblivion these useless passions could not long survive in such an environment by and by the old trappers only link with the past was memory of a stalwart youth and of a girl with violet eyes and of their sad and wonderful romance in which he had played a happy part  the rosy dawn the days of sun and cloud the still windy nights the solemn stars the moonblanched valley with its grazing herds the beautiful wild mourn of the hunting wolf and the whistle of the stag and always and ever the murmur of the streamin these and in the solitude and loneliness of their haunts he found his goal his serenity the truth and best of remaining life for him     37  a band of sioux warriors rode out upon a promontory of the hills high above the great expanse of plain long lean arms were raised and pointed  a chief dismounted and strode to the front of his band his warbonnet trailed behind him there were unhealed scars upon his bronze body his face was old full of fine wavy lines stern craggy and inscrutable his eyes were dark arrowy lightnings  they beheld far out and down upon the plain a long low moving object leaving a trail of smoke it was a train on the railroad it came from the east and crept toward the west the chief watched it and so did his warriors no word was spoken no sign made no face changed  but what was in the mind and the heart and the soul of that great chief  this beast that puffed smoke and spat fire and shrieked like a devil of an alien tribe that split the silence as hideously as the long track split the once smooth plain that was made of iron and wood this thing of the white mans coming from out of the distance where the great spirit lifted the dawn meant the end of the huntinggrounds and the doom of the indian blood had flowed many warriors lay in their last sleep under the trees but the iron monster that belched fire had gone only to return again those white men were many as the needles of the pines they fought and died but always others came  the chief was old and wise taught by sage and star and mountain and wind and the loneliness of the prairieland he recognized a superior race but not a nobler one white men would glut the treasures of water and earth the indian had been born to hunt his meat to repel his red foes to watch the clouds and serve his gods but these white men would come like a great flight of grasshoppers to cover the length and breadth of the prairieland the buffalo would roll away like a dustcloud in the distance and never return no meat for the indianno grass for his mustangno place for his home the sioux must fight till he died or be driven back into waste places where grief and hardship would end him  red and dusky the sun was setting beyond the desert the old chief swept aloft his arm and then in his acceptance of the inevitable bitterness he stood in magnificent austerity somber as death seeing in this railroad train creeping fading into the ruddy sunset a symbol of the destiny of the indianvanishingvanishingvanishing
