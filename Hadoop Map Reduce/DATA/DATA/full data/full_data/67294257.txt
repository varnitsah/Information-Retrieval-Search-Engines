67294257	the mayfair set  iii  conversations  with an  uncle     illustration title page      select  conversations  with  an uncle  now extinct    and two other  reminiscences by  h g wells     london  john lane   new york  the merriam company   1895     copyrighted in the united states  all rights reserved   second edition     to  my dearest  and best friend  r a c     prefatory  he was i remember short but by no means conspicuously short and of a bright almost juvenile complexion very active in his movements and garrulousor at least very talkative  his judgments were copious and frequent in the old days and some at least i found entertaining  at times his fluency was really remarkable  he had a low opinion of eminent peoplea thing i have been careful to suppress and his dissertations had ever an irresponsible gaiety of manner that may have blinded me to their true want of merit  that i say was in the old days before his abrupt extinction before the cares of this world suddenly sprang upon and choked him  i would listen to him cheerfully and afterwards i would go away and make articles out of him for the pall mall gazette so adding a certain material advantage to my mental and moral benefit  but all that has gone now to my infinite regret and sorrowing i have arranged this unworthy little tribute to his memory this poor dozen of casual monologues that were so preserved  the merits of the monument are his entirely its faults entirely my own     contents   select conversations    of conversation and the anatomy of fashion    the theory of the perpetual discomfort of humanity    the use of ideals    the art of being photographed    bagshots mural decorations    on social music    the joys of being engaged    la belle dame sans merci    on a tricycle    an unsuspected masterpiece    the great change    the pains of marriage   a misunderstood artist  the man with a nose     of conversation and the anatomy of fashion  this uncle of mine you must understand having attainedby the purest accidentsome trifles of distinction and a certain affluence in south africa came over at the earliest opportunity to london to be photographed and lionised  he took to fame easily as one who had long prepared in secret  he lurked in my chambers for a week while the new dress suit was amakinghis old one i really had to remonstrate againstand then we went out to be admired  during the weeks retirement he secreted quite a wealth of things to sayappropriate remarks on edibles on music on popular books on conversation offhand little things jotting them down in a notebook as they came into his mind for he had a high conception of social intercourse and the public expectation  he was ever a methodical little gentleman and all these accumulations that he could not get into his talk he proposed to put away for the big volume of reminiscences that was to round off his life  at last he was a mere conversational firework crammed with latent wit and jollity and ready to blaze and sparkle in fizzing style as soon as the light of social intercourse should touch him  but after we had circulated for a week or so my uncle began to manifest symptoms of distress  he had not had a chance  people did not seem to talk at all in his style  where do the literary people meet together george  i am afraid you have chosen your friends ill surely those longhaired serious people who sat round my joke like old cats round a beetlewhat is itwere not the modern representatives of a salon  those abominable wigmakers eccentricities who talked journalistic shop and posed all over that preposterous room with the draperies  those hectic young men who have done nothing except run down everybody  dont tell me that is the literary society of london george  where do they let off wit now george  where do they sparkle i want to sparkle  badly  i shall burst george if i dont  now really you know there are no salons nowi suppose we turn all our conversation into copyor the higher education has eliminated the witty womanand my uncle became more and more distressed  he said a lot of his good things to me which was sheer waste  i became afraid  i got him all the introductions i could pushed him into every lions den i had access to  but there was no relief  i see what it is george said my uncle these literary people write themselves out  they say nothing for private use  their brains are weary when they come into company  they get up in the morning fresh and bright and write write write  then when they are jaded they condescend to social intercourse  it is their way of resting  but why dont they go to bed  no more clever people for me george  let us try the smart  perhaps among them we shall find smart talking still surviving  allons george  that is how my uncle came into collision with fashion how i came to take him to the fitzbrilliants  of course you have heard of the fitzbrilliants  if you have not it is not their fault  they are the smartest people in london  always hard at work keeping up to date are the fitzbrilliants  but my uncle did not appreciate them  worse  they did not appreciate my uncle  he came to me again more pent up than ever and the thing i had feared happened  he began to discourse to me  it was about fashion with a decided reference to the fitzbrilliants and some reflections upon the alleys of literary ability and genius i had taken him through  george said my uncle this fashion is just brandnew vulgarity it is merely the regal side of the medal  the highly fashionable and the absolutely vulgar are but two faces of the common coin of humanity struck millions at a time  spin the thing in the light of wealth and i defy you as it whizzes from the illumination of riches to the shadow of poverty to distinguish the one stamp from the other  you cannot say here the mode ends and there the unspeakable thing its counterpart has its beginning  their distinction of mere position has vanished and they are in seeming as in substance one and indivisible  my uncle was now fairly under way  the fashionable is the foam on the ocean of vulgarity george cast up by the waves of that ocean and caught by the light of the sun  it is the vulgarblossoming  the flower it is of that earthly plant destined hereafter to run to seed and to beget new groves and thickets new jungles of vulgar things  note george how true this is of that common property of the vulgar and fashionableslang  the apt phrase falls and applause follows and then down it goes  the essential feature of slang is words misapplied the essential distinction of a coarse mind from one refined an inability to appreciate fine distinctions and minor discords the essential of the vulgar good example misused  first the fashionable get the apt phrase and bandy it about in inapt connections until even the novelty of its discordance has ceased to charm and thereafter it sinks down down  fin de siècle and cliché have for instance passed downward from the courts of the fashionable among journalists into the unspeakable depths below  soon if not already fin de siècle gin and onions and haddocks will be for sale in the whitechapelroad and harriet will be calling billy a cliché faced swine  even so do ostrich feathers begin a career of glory at the drawingroom and the fashionable photographers and after endless redyeing come to their last pose before a hampstead camera on a bright bank holiday  the fashionable and vulgar are after all but the expression of mans gregarious instinct  every poor mortal is torn by the conflicting dreads of being commonplace and of being eccentric  he and more particularly she is continually imitating and avoiding imitation trying to be singular and yet like other people  in the exquisitely fashionable and in the entirely vulgar the sheeplike longing is triumphant and the revolting individual has disappeared  the former is a mechanical vehicle upon which the new correct thing rides forth to extort the astonishment of men the latter a lifeless bier bearing its corrupt and unrecognisable remains away to final oblivion amidst universal execration  it is curious to notice george that there has of late been a fashion in originality the commonplace has turned as it were upon itself and vehemently denied its identity  so that people who were not eccentric have become rare and genius so far as it is a style of hairdressing and originality so far as it is a matter of etiquette or morals have become the habitual garments of the commonplace  the introduction of the word bourgeois as a comminatory epithet into the english language by bourgeois writers writing for the bourgeois will remain a memorial for ever for the philological humourist to chuckle over  if good resolutions could change the natures of men opinion has lately set so decidedly against the fashionable and the vulgar that their continued existence in this world would be very doubtful  but the leopard cannot change his spots so easily  while the stars go on in their courses until the cooling of the earth puts an end to the career of life and the last trace of his ancestral tendency to imitation disappears as the last man becomes an angel depend upon it george the fashionable will ever pursue this chimæra of distinguished correctness and trail the inseparable howling vulgar in its wakefor ever chased like a dog with a tin can attached by the horror of its own tail  thus my uncle  he had said a few of his things  it is possible his trick of talking like a disarticulated essay had something to do with his social discomfort  but anyhow he seemed all the better for the release  talking of tails george he said reminds me  i noticed the men at the fitzbrilliants had their coats cutwell i should say just a half inch shorter here than this of mine  your man is not up to date i must get the thing altered tomorrow     the theory of the perpetual discomfort of humanity  he had been sitting with his feet upon the left jamb of my mantel admiring the tips of his shoes in silence for some time  george he said dropping his cigarash thoughtfully into my inkstand in order i imagine to save my carpet have you ever done pioneer work for humanity  never i said  how do you get that sort of work  i dont know  i met a man and a woman though the other night who said they were engaged in that kind of thing  it seems to me to be exhausting work and it makes the hair very untidy  they do it chiefly with their heads  it consists so i understand of writing stuff in a hurry rushing about in cabs wearing your hair in some unpleasant manner and holding disorderly meetings  who are these people  never heard of them before though they told me they were quite well known  the lady asked me if i had been to chicago  i chuckled  i could imagine no more hideous insult to my uncle  i told her that i had been to most places southeastward and eastward but never across the atlantic  she informed me that i ought to have gone to chicago and that america was a great country and i remarked that i had always thought it was so great that one could best appreciate it at a distance  then she asked me what i thought of the condition of the lower classes and i told her i was persuaded from various things i had noticed that a lot of them were frightfully hard up  and with that she started off to show whose fault it was by the socratic method  entertaining  a little  i did not get all my answers right  for instance when she asked who sends the members of parliament to westminster i answered her the governors of the young ones and the wives of the others and when she said that was wrongi dont remember socrates ever saying bluntly that an answer was wrongi said i supposed she referred to the evil one  it was very dull of me of course and it obliged her to dictate the right solution  afterwards she threw over teaching me anything and explained to me all about her movements  at least i got really interested in her movements  one thing she said struck me very much though it could hardly be called novel  it was that the fads of one age were the fashions of the next that while the majority of people were engaged in their little presentday chores persons like herself are making the laws and preparing the customs for the generation to follow  poor generations to follow i said  yes but there is a lot of truth in it and do you know there flashed upon me all at once a great theory the theory of the perpetual discomfort of humanity  just let me explain it to you george he said bringing himself round so that his legs hung over the arm of his chair  i think you will see i have made a very great discovery gone to the root of the whole of this bother of reform movement advancement of humanity and the rest of it  he sucked his cigar for a moment each age he said has its own ideals of what constitutes human happiness  a very profound observation said i  looking down the vista of history one may generalise and say that we see human beings continually troubled by the conditions under which they live  i can think of no time in the world when there was not some question or other getting fussed about at one time episcopal celibacy at another time the pict and scot problem and so on  always a crumpled roseleaf  hence reform movements  now reforms move slowly and by the time these reforms come about the people whom they would have made happy and who fussed and encountered dislike and satire and snubbing and burning and boiling in oil and suchlike discouragements for the sake of them were dead and buried and mere sanitary problems the new people had new and quite different needs and the reforms for which their fathers fought and died more or less uncomfortably and got into debt with the printers so soon as there were printers to get into debt with were about as welcome as belated dinner guests  you take me  ireland when home rule comes home to it will simply howl with indignation  and we are living in the embodied discontent of the eighteenth century  adam smith tom paine and priestley would have looked upon this age and seen that it was gooddevilish good and as you know george to us it iswell a bit of a nuisance anyhow however most people are like myself and try to be as comfortable as they can and no doubt the next generation might do very well with it and then the pioneer people begin legislating agitating and ordering things differently  as you know george i am inclined to conservatism  constitutionally i tend to adapt myself to my circumstances  it seems to me so much easier to fit the man to the age than to fit the age to the man  let us i say settle down  we shall never be able to settle down while they keep altering things  it may not be a perfect world but then i am not a perfect man some of the imperfections are at least very convenient  so my theory is this the people whom the age suits fairly well dont botheri dont bother the others do  it is these confounded glaring and unshorn anachronisms that upset everything  they go about flapping their ideals at you and writing novels with a motive and starting movements and societies and generally poking ones epoch to rags until at last it is worn out and you have to start a new one  my conception of the progress of humanity is something after the wandering jew pattern your average humanity i figure as a comfortable person like myself always trying to sit down and put its legs somewhere out of the way and being continually stirred up by women in felt hats and short skirts and haggard men with those beastly long insufficient beards and soulful eyes and trumpetheaded creatures and bogles with spectacles and bald heads and nephews who look at watches  what are you looking at your watch for george  im very happy as i am  has it ever occurred to you george that one of the most uncomfortable things in the world must be to outlive your age  to have all the reforms of your boyish liberalism coming home to roost just as you are settling down to the old order  six oclock by jove  we shall keep them waiting if we dont mind     the use of ideals  ideals said my uncle certainly ideals  of course one must have ideals else life would be bare materialism  bare fact alone naked necessity is impossible barren rock for a soul to root upon  life indeed is an unfurnished house an empty glass in a thirsty landgood and necessary for foundation but insufficient for any satisfaction unless we have ideals  or again ideals are the flesh upon the skeleton of reality and it cannot live without them  it always appears to me said my uncle that the comparison of ideals to furniture is particularly appropriate  they are the draperies of the mind and they hide the nakedness of truth  your fireplace is ugly your mere necessary shelves and seats but planks and crudity all your surroundings so much office furniture until the skilful hand and the draperies come in  then a few cunning loopings and foldings and behold softness and delicacy crudity gone and life well worth the living  so that you cannot value ideals too highly  yet at the same time  my uncle became meditative  i would not have a man the slave of his ideals  hangings make the room comfortable but after all hangings are hangings  perhaps now and thenof course i would not suggest continual inconstancya slight change a little rearrangement even a partial replacement might brighten up the dear old dwellingplace  an ideal may be clung to too fondly  when the moth gets into it or the dustdid not carlyle warn us against this lest they accumulate and at last produce suffocation  i am exactly at one with him there  and that as any cabinet minister explains every time he opens a public library is why we have literature  good books are the warehouses of ideals  does it strike you your furniture is sombre a bit calvinistic and severetry a statuette by pope or a classical piece out of heine  too much white and gold for everyday purposesthen the reverend laurence sterne will oblige  urban tone may be corrected by hardy and lowell will give you urbanity  and however well you match and balance them remember there is a time for ideals and a time when they are better out of the way  the philistine of victorian literature is a person without ideals the practical man  but just now the fashion is all for the things ruskin and carlyle set it going and today the demand for ideals exceeds the supply  and as a result we meet with innumerable people anxious to have the correct thing but a little unsympathetic or inexpert and those unavoidable people who do not like the things but feel compelled to get them  ideals are not the easiest possessions to have and manage and they may even rise to the level of serious inconveniences  so that i sometimes wonder these extension people have not taken up the subject of their management and use  note for instance the folly of bringing ideals too much into the daily life it is childish like a baby insisting on its new toy at meal times and taking it to bed  never use an ideal as a standard and avoid any that reflect upon your conduct  the extremest decorative people refrain from enamelling their kettles and my cook though a born lady does not wear her silk dress in the kitchen  ideals are the full dress of the soul  a business man for instance who let visions of reverend venetian and genoese seigniors interfere with his agile city movementswho to carry out our comparison draped his mind with these thingswould be uncommonly like a bowler in a dressinggown  then an ideal we are also told is an elevating influence in life but unless one is very careful one may get hoist with ones own petard to a pitifully transitory soar above common humanity  the soar itself is not unpleasant but the sequel is sometimes disagreeable  to show how an ideal may trip up an inexpert mortal take that man javvers and his wife  she also had an ideal husband which was indeed a kind of bigamy and her constant references to this creation of hers used to drive poor old javvers frantic  it became as objectionable as if she had been its sorrowing widow and ultimately it wrecked the happiness of their little home very completely  the seat of ideals then in ones mind should be as it were a lounge over which these hangings may drape and flap harmlessly but it may easily become as the bed of procrustes  to turn ideals to idols and to command your whole world to bow down to them savours of the folly of nebuchadnezzar the king  let your ideal world be far away from reality fit it with rococo furniture angels and birdsofparadise minnesinger flowers and views of the delectable mountains and go there occasionally and restto return without illusions without encumbrance but with renewed zest to the sordid world of the actual the world of every day  herein is the real use of the ideal all other is fanaticism and folly     the art of being photographed  an album said my uncle as he sat and turned over my collection of physiognomy is i think the best reading in the world  you get such sidelights on the owners heredity george distant cousins caricature his features and point the moral of his nose and ancestral faces prophesy his fate  his friends moreover figure the secret of his soul  but what a lot we have to learn yet in the art of being photographed what grotesque and awkward blunders your common sitters make  why for instance do men brush their hair so excessively when they go before the lens  your cousin here looks like a cheap chess pawn about the head whereas as i know him his head is a thing like a wornout paintbrush  where but in a photograph would you see a parting so straight as this  it is unnatural  you flatten down all a mans character for nothing shows that more than the feathers and drakes tails the artful artlessness or revolutionary tumult of his hair  mind you i am not one of those who would prohibit a man wearing what he conceives to be his best clothes to the photographers  i like to see the little vanity peeping outthe last moments folly of a foolish tie nailed up for a lifetime  yet all the same people should understand that the camera takes no note of newness but much of the cut and fit  and a man should certainly not go and alter his outline into a feminine softness by pouring oil on his troubled mane and plastering it down with a brush and comb  it is not tidiness but hypocrisy  we have indeed very much to learn in this matter  it is a thing that needs teaching like deportment or dancing  plenty of men i have noticed who would never do it in real life commit the sin of being overgentlemanly in an album  their clothes are even indecently immaculate  they become not portraits but fashionplates  i hate a man who is not rumpled and creased a little as much as i do a brand new pipe  and as a sad example of sin on the other hand on the side of carelessness i have seen renderings of a very august personage indeed in a hata hat  it was tilted and to add to the atrocity he was holding a cigar  this i regard as horrible  think your photograph may go into boudoirs  imagine gladys opening the album to Ænone now i will show you him  and there you sit leering at their radiant sweetness hat on and a cigar reeking between your fingers  no george a man should go very softly to a photographers and he should sit before the camera with reverence in his heart and in his attitude as if he were in the presence of the woman he loved  he turned to mrs harboroughs portrait looked at it hesitated looked again and passed on  i often think we do not take this business of photography in a sufficiently serious spirit  issuing a photograph is like marriage you can only undo the mischief with infinite woe  i know of one man who has an error of youth of this kind on his minda fancydress costume affair crusader or templarof which he is more ashamed than many men would be of the meanest sins  for sometimes the camera has its mordant moods and amazes you by its saturnine estimate of your merits  this man was perhaps a little out of harmony with the garments of chivalry and a trifle complacent and vain at the time  but the photograph of him is so cynical and contemptuous so merciless in its exposure of his element of foolishness that we may almost fancy the spook of carlyle had got mixed up with the chemicals upon the film yet it never really dawned upon him until he had distributed this advertisement of his little weakness far and wide that the camera had called him a fool to his face  i believe he would be glad now to buy them all back at five pounds a copy  this of minnie hobson is a work of art  bless me the girl must be thirtyseven or thirtyeight now and just look at her  these photographers have got a trick now if your face is one of the long kind of raising the camera bending your head forward and firing down at you  so our minnie becomes quite chubby again  then this thing has been retouched  my uncle peered into the photograph  it seems to me it is pretty nearly all retouching  for instance if you look at the eye that high light is not perfectly even that was touched in on the negative with a pencil  then about the neck of our minnie i have observed certain bones just the slightest indication of her collarbone george but that has disappeared under the retouchers pencil  then the infantile smoothness of her cheek and the beautifullyrounded outline is produced by the retoucher carefully scraping off the surface of the film where the cheekbone projected with a sharp knife  there are also in real life little lines between the corner of our minnies mouth and her nostril  and again minnie is one of those people whose dresses never seem to fit but this fits like a glove  these retouchers are like midas and they turn all that comes to their hands to gold or like spring the flowers come back at their approach  they reverse the work of ithuriel and restore brightness to the fallen  they sit at their little desks and scratch scratch scratch with those delicate pencils of theirs scratching away age scratching away care making the crooked straight and the rough smooth  they are the fairies of photography and fill our albums with winsome changelings  their ministry anticipates in a little way the angels who will take us when we die releasing us from the worn and haggard body of this death and showing something of the eternal life and youth that glows within  or one might say that the spirit of the retoucher is the spirit of love  it makes plain women beautiful and common men heroic  her regal fingers touch for the evil of ungainliness and behold we are restored  her pencil is like the queens sword and it makes knights out of common men  when i have my photograph taken said my uncle i always like to think of the retoucher  i idealise her i fancy her with the sweetest eyes i have ever seen and an expression infinitely soft and tender and she looks closely into my face and her little pencil goes gently and lovingly over my features  tickle tickle  in that way george i get a really very nice expression indeed  my uncle turned to his own presentment and mused pleasantly for a space  then he looked again at mrs harborough as if inadvertently and asked her name  i like this newer way of taking your photograph against a mere grey background just the head of you  one should always beware of the property furniture of the photographer  in the seventies they were great at such aidsa pedestal a cork rustic stile wide landscape in the distance but i think that we are at least getting beyond that now people in those days must have been afraid to be left alone before a camera or they wanted it to seem that they were taken unawares quite against their modestydid not know what the camera was and were just looking at it  a very favourite pose for girls was a graceful droop over a sofa chin on elegant hand  when i was at dribblebridgei was a bright young fellow theni collected a number of local photographs ladies chiefly and the thing was very noticeable when i put them in a row over my mantleshelf  the local artist was intensely fond of that pose  but fancy the local leader finding her cook drooping over the same sofa as herself  nowadays i see you get merely the heads of your girls with their hair flossed up intense light from above and faces in shadow  i think it is infinitely better  what horrible things hands become in a photograph  i wonder how it is that the hand in a photograph is always four shades darker than the arm  every girl who goes to be photographed in evening dress should be solemnly warned to keep her hands out of the picture  they will look as though she has been enamelling the grate or toying with a bucket of pitch  there is something that sins against my conception of womanly purity in those dark hands  my uncle shut the album  yes it is a neglected field of education an important branch of deportment altogether forgotten  our wellbred ease fails us before the camera we are lucky if we merely look stiff and selfconscious  i should fancy there would be an opening for some clever woman to teach people how to dress for the occasion and how to sit what to avoid and how to avoid it  as it is we go in a state of nervous agitation obsequiously costumed our last vestige of selfassertion vanishes before the unwinking cyclops eye of the instrument and we cower at the mercy of the thing and its attendant they make what they will of us and the retoucher simply edits the review with an eye to the market  so history is falsified before our faces and we prepare a lie for our grandchildren  we fail to stamp our individualities upon our photographs and are mere dumbdriven cattle in the matter  we sin against ourselves in this neglect and act against the spirit of the age  sooner or later this haphazard treatment of posterity must come to an end  he meditated for a moment  then as if pursuing a train of thought that mrs harborough is a very pretty woman george  where did you happen to meet her     bagshots mural decorations  bagshot was rather proud of his new quarters until my uncle called upon him  up to then he felt assured he was doing right had indeed not the faintest doubt in the matter until my uncle unsettled him  nice carpet bagshot said my uncle nice and soft  this chair certainly very comfortable  but what the mischief do you meanyou with your pretence to cultureby hanging your dwelling with all those framed and glazed photograph and autograph dittoes  i should have thought you at least would have known better  love and life and love and death the daphnephoria rembrandts portraitwild havoc man  what were you thinking of  bagshot seemed staggered  he ventured to intimate feebly his persuasion that the things were rather good  good they certainly are and well reproduced but only the bible and shakspeare could stand this incessant reiteration and not all shakspeare  these things are in shop windows mandrawingrooms offices everywhere  they afflict me like popular songslike popular quotations  they are good enoughas a matter of fact they are too good  only dont you know willis has love and life and love and death  and so has smith and bays has rembrandts portrait in his office and my niece euphemia has the daphnephoria in her drawingroom i cant understand george why you let it stay there  it is possible to have too much of a good thing  there is no getting away from these all too popular triumphs  they cover up the walls everywhere  they consume all other art  i shall write a schedule some day of the fifty correct pictures of the british people  and to find you bagshot among the philistines  i thought they showed rather an improvement in the general taste said bagshot  there is no reason why a thing should not be common and yet very beautiful  primroses for instance  that is true enough but pictures are not primroses said my uncle besides i think we like primroses all the better because they must soon be over but these are perennial blossoms like the everlasting flowers and dried grass of a lodging house  they may still be beautiful but by this time bagshot they are awfully dry and dusty who looks at them  i notice our eyes avoid them even while we talk about them  we have all noticed everything there is to be noticed and said all the possible things that are to be said about them long ago surely a picture must be a little fresh to please  else we shall come at last to the perfect picture and art will have an end  dont you see the mere popularity of these things of the pavement is enough to condemn them in the estimation of every rightminded person  i dont see it said bagshot making head against the torrent  i cannot afford to go to these swells and get original work of theirs  what do you want with these swells and their original work interrupted my uncle fiercely  havent they used up all their originality ages ago  is it not open to such men as yourself to discover new men  there are men pining in garrets now for you bagshot  fancy the delight of having pictures that are unfamiliar pictures that catch the eye and are actually to be looked at pictures that suggest new remarks pictures by a name that the stray visitor has never heard of and which therefore puzzle him dreadfully because he hasnt the faintest idea whether to praise or blame them  isnt it worth hunting studios for and even maybe going to the academy besides suppose your struggling artist comes to the front  what price the fiveguinea specimen of his early style then  your artistic virtue is indeed its own reward and besides you can boast about finding him  the poor man of culture and the struggling artist live for one another or at least they ought tothough i am afraid it is not much of a living for the struggling artist  he paused abruptly  i suppose that autotype cost thirty shillings and this carpet about five pounds  bagshot assumed an elegant attitude against his bureau  he had discovered his reply  you know you are bitten by the fashion for originality  why should i make my room hideous with the work of thirdrate mediocrity or of men who are still learning to paint simply in order to be unlike my neighbour  why returned my uncle should you hang up things less interesting than your wall paper in mere imitation of your neighbours  for this on your walls bagshot deny it though you may is not art but fashion i tell you you do not care a rap for art  you think pictures are a part of virtue like a silk hator evening dress at dinner  and in your choice of pictures you follow after your kind  i never met a trueborn briton yet who dared to buy a picture on his own accordunless he was a dealer  and then usually he was not really a trueborn briton  he waits to see what is being hung  he has these things now because he thinks they are right not because they are beautiful just as he used to have the stag at bay and the boastful hound  it is leighton now it was landseer then  really i believe that very soon the ladies papers will devote a column to pictures something in this style  smart people are taking down their rossettis annunciations now and are hanging gambler boltons new hippopotamus in the place of it  this hippopotamus is to be the correct thing in pictures this year and no woman with any claim to be considered smart will fail to have it over her piano  marcus stones new engraving will also be rather chic  wattss hope is now considered a little dowdy  and so forth  this gregarious admiration is the very antithesis of artistic appreciation which i tell you simply must be individual  go on said bagshot go on  and that said my uncle with the glow of discovery in his face that is where the vulgar critic goes wrong  he conceives an orthodoxy  he tries to explain why velasquez is better than raphael and raphael better than gerard dow  as well say why a cirrus cloud is better than a sycamore and a sycamore better than a scarlet hat  every painter unless he is a mere operative must have his peculiar public it is incredible that any painter can really satisfy the æsthetic needs of such a public as these reproductions indicate  true art is always sectarian  why were landseer and sidney cooper popular a few years ago and why does every teatable sneer at them now  there must be something admirable in them or they would never have been admired then why has my niece annie dropped admiring poynter and why does she pretendand a very thin pretence it isto admire whistler  you are wandering from my pictures said bagshot  i want to said my uncle  but why do you try and hide your taste under these mere formalities in frames  why do you always say i pass in the game of decoration  better a mess of green amateurs and love therewith than the richest autotypes and dull complacency  have what you like  there is no such thing as absolute beauty  that is the magna charta of the world of art  what is beautiful to me is not beautiful to another man in art as in women  but take care to get the art that fits you  frankly that love and death suits you bagshot about as much as a purple toga would  orchardson is in your style  i tell you that the greengrocer who buys an original oil painting for sixteen shillings with frame complete is far nearer artistic salvation than the patron of the popular autotype  surely you will wake up presently bagshot and wonder what you have been about  halfpast four by jove  i must be getting on  well bagshot tata one must talk you know  i really hope you will be comfortable in your new rooms  and so goodbye to bagshot staring in a puzzled way at his reviled and desecrated walls     on social music  my poor uncle came to me the other evening in a most distressful state broken down to common blasphemy  his ample front was rumpled with sorrow and his tie disorderly aslant  his hair had gone rough with his troubles  the time i have had george he panted  give me something to drink in the name of holy charity  since the pall mall gazette took to reporting his little sayings about photographs and ornaments ideals and fashions he has been setting up as a conversationalist  he thinks he was designed by providence to that end and aids his destiny as much as he can by elaborately preparing remarks  yet this thing had happened  they put said my uncle a little chap at the piano and me at a very nice girl indeed as she looked and the little chap began and so did i  i said a prelude thing of mine brand new and rather pretty  he stopped  he turned to nerve himself with whisky  well i said when the pause seemed sufficient what did she say  my uncle looked unspeakable things  then in a whisper bending towards me  she saidsssh  he repeated it that i might grasp its full enormity ssshso  what is music said my uncle after a moody silence that reasonable people should listen to it  i had to listen to it myself and it struck me  it was just a tune this little chap was trying to remember and now he would come at it this way and now that  he never got it quite right though he fumbled about it for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour  and then two girls went and one punished the piano while the other with a wrist rather than an ear for music drowned its cries with a violin  so it went on all the evening and when i moved they all looked at me i had been put on a nervous wicker chair and i knew my shoes squeaked like a carnival of swine and so i could not get away  and all the things that kept coming into my head george the neat remarks and graceful sayings  you see i look at it in this light  music is merely background and ought to be kept in its place  i am no enemy of music george  the air in a room should be melodious for the same reason that it should be faintly pleasing to the olfactory sense and neither hot nor stuffy just as the walls should be delightfully coloured and softly lit and the refreshments pleasant and at the moment of need  but surely we meet for human intercourse  when i go to see people i go to see the peoplenot to hear a hired boy play the piano  but these people plant a chevaux de frise of singers and performers upon instruments of music between themselves and me  they gag me with a few pennyworths of secondhand opera  there i was bursting to talk and nice intelligentlooking girls to talk to and whenever i began to say something they said sssh  tantalus in a drawingroom it wasthe very hades of hospitality  surely some day we shall learn refinement in our entertaining  your modern hostess issues her invitations and seems overcome with consternation at her gathering  what shall i do with all these people she seems to ask  so she dabs cakes upon them piles coffee cups over them eat she says and shut up and stifles their protests with a clamorous woman and a painful piano  no of course i dont object to having music  but it is an accessory not an object in life  it is after all a physical comfort a pleasant vibration in ones ears  to make an object of it is sensuality  it is on allfours with worshipping the wallpaper  some wallpapers are very beautiful things nowadays harmonious in form and colour skilful in invention but people do not expect you to sit down and admire wallpaper or promise you wallpaper at eight  neither do they put an extinguisher over any girl who does not go with the wallpaper or expect you to dress in neutral tint on account of it and they are not hurt if you go away without seeming to see it gustatory harmony too is very delicious  yet there is no hush during dinner they do not insist upon a persistent gnawing in honour of the feast  but these musical people their god is their piano  they set up an idol in their salon and command all the world to bow down to it they found a priestcraft of pianists and an inquisition of fiddlers when i came away they were all crowded round a violin the women especially  they could not have fussed more if it had been a baby they stroked it and admired its figure  it had rather a fashionable figure but the neck was too long  i began to suspect the cause of this bitterness  yes  she was there  and while some of this piano was going on she looked at the ear of the man who was playing with a dreamy tender look  no  i couldnt get a word with her the whole evening     the joys of being engaged  as i was passing the london university the other day i saw my uncle emerge from the branch of the bank of england opposite and proceed in the direction of the burlington arcade  he was elaborately disguised as a young man even to the youthful flower and i was incontinently smitten with curiosity respecting the dark purpose he might veil in this way  there is to me a peculiar and possibly rather a childish fascination in watching my more intimate friends unobserved and curiously enough i had never before studied the avuncular back view i found something singularly entertaining in the study of the graceful contour of his new frock coat and in the cheerful carriage of his cane  he paraded a dignified procession of one some way down the arcade hesitated for a moment outside a jewellers shop and then entered it  i strolled on as far as piccadilly returned to the shop and so fell upon him suddenly in the midst of his buying  hullo george he said hastily facing me so as to hide as much of the counter as possible  hows euphemia  i looked him fairly in the eye  you are buying a ring i said in a firm decided voice  he turned to the counter with an air of surprise  by jove so i am  a ladys ring i said  he was i could see hastily collecting his sufficiently nimble powers of subterfuge  one must buy something you know george sometimes he said feebly  he had selected some dozen or so already the most palpable engagement rings i think i ever saw  one of them had visible on its inner curvature the four letters mizp  he looked at them saw the posy and then glancing at me laughed affably  i meant to tell you yesterday georgei will take these to the shopman  and we emerged with a superficial amiability the case of rings in my uncles pocket the thing was rather a shock to me coming so suddenly and unexpectedly  i had anticipated some innocent purchase of the jewellery he reviles so much but certainly not significant rings golden fetters for others to wear and enslave him and we were past the flowershop towards hyde park before either of us spoke  it seemed so dreadful to me that the cheerful talkative man beside me my own fathers little brother a traveller in distant countries and a most innocent man and with all the inveterate habits of thirty years honourable bachelorhood and all the mellowness of life upon him should without consulting me have taken the first irrevocable step towards becoming a ratepayer a pew tenant paterfamilias a fighter with schoolmasters and the serf of a butler that i scarcely knew what to say adequate to the occasion  well said i at last with an involuntary sigh i suppose i must congratulate you  dont look at it in that light george said my uncle and he added in a more cheerful tone i am only going to get engaged you know  you can scarcely imagine george he proceeded how i have longed to be engaged  all my life it has been my hope and goal  it is i think the ideal state of man  there was a chap with me when i was at kimberley who first put the idea into my head  his ways were animated and cheerful even for a diamond field where you know animation and cheerfulness are so to speak de rigueur  whisky he affected and jesting of the kind that paints cities scarlet  and he used every night before festivities began to write a long letter to some girl in england and say within limits how bad he had been and how he longed to reform and be with her and never never do anything wrong any more he poured all the higher and better parts of his nature into the letter and folded it up and sealed it very carefully  and then he came to us in a singularly relieved frame of mind and would be the life and soul of as merry a game of followyourleader as one can well imagine  pleasant reminiscences occupied him for a moment  every man should be engaged i think to at least one woman  it is the homage we owe to womankind and a duty to our souls  his fiancée is indeed the madonna of a truehearted man the thought of her is a shrine at the wayside of ones meditations and her presence a temple wherein we cleanse our souls  she is mysterious worshipful and inaccessible something perhaps of the woman possibly even propitious and helpful and yet something of the holy grail as well  you have no rights with her nor she with you you owe her no definite duties and yet she is singularly yours  a smile is a favour a touch of her fingers a faint pressure of your hand is an infinite privilege  you cannot demand the slightest help or concern of her so you ask it with diffident grace and there is an overflowing stream of gratitude from small occasions whatever you give her is a gift too while a husband is just property a mere draughtcamel for her service  all your functions are decorative you hang her shrine with flowers and precious stones  you treat her to art and literature and as for vulgar necessitiessome one else sees to that  until you are married began i  i am speaking of being engaged  marriage is altogether a different thing  the essence of a proper engagement is reverence distance and mystery the essence of marriage is familiarity  a fiancée is a living eidolon a wife from my point of view at least should be a confidential companion a fellowconspirator an accessory after the fact at least to ones little errors should take some share of the burthen and heat of the day with one and have the humour to bear with a mood of vexation or a fit of the blues  i doubt do you know if the same kind of girl is suitable for engagements as for marriage  for an engagement give me something very innocent a little aweinspiring on that account absolutely and tenderly worshipful yet given to moods of caressing affection and altogether graceful and beautiful  a man i think ought to be incapable of smoking or lounging in front of the girl he professes to love so reverent ought his love to be  but for marriage let me have humour and some community of taste a woman who can climb stiles and stand tobacco smoke and who knows a good cook by her fruits  it is a complicated business this marrying  the familiarity of the marriage state if it does not breed positive contempt on the part of the angel engenders at times i think a considerable craving for change on the side of both parties  we men are poor creatures at the besti always pity your euphemia  married people for instance always get too much of each others conversation they do not have sufficient opportunity to recuperate their topics from original sources  they get interested in outside people merely from a perfectly legitimate desire to get some amusing novel ideas for each other and then comes jealousy  i sometimes think that if adam and eve had been merely engaged she would not have talked with the serpent and the world had been saved an infinity of misery  no george engagements for me  it is the state we were made for  i have delayed this matter all too long  but thank heaven i am engaged at lasti hope for all the rest of my life  now will you not congratulate me  it may be very nice as you put it but engagements end as well as begin i insisted  you cannot be a law unto yourself in these matters  when will you get married  good heavens exclaimed my uncle  get married and end this delightful state  you dont think she will want me to marry her do you  besides she told me some time ago that she did not intend to marry again  it was only that encouraged me to suggest an engagement to her  though she is a wonderful woman georgea wonderful woman still i think she looks at things very much as i do  he paused thoughtfully  then added with fervour at least i hope so     la belle dame sans merci  a rhapsody  i found him in his own apartments and strangely disordered  he went to and fro ravingbeginning so soon as i entered the room  i noticed a book half out of its cover flung carelessly into the corner of the room  i am enchanted of an impalpable woman george he said i am in bonds to a spirit of the air  i can neither think nor work nor eat nor sleep because of her  sometimes i go out suddenly tramping through seething streets through fog and drizzle or dry east wind mourning for her sake  my life is rapidly becoming one colourless melancholy through her spells and twining sorceries  i sometimes wish that i were dead  yet i have never seen her  often indeed i imagine her anon as of this shape and anon of that  i know her only by her victims those she slays daily and daily revives to slay  they come to me with their complaints mutilated pathetic terrible  i try to shut my ears to them in vain  i have tried wool but it made little or no difference  the business always begins with the slamming of a door and a healthy footfall across the room  the piano is opened  then some occasional noisesthe falling of a piece of music behind the piano perhaps and its extraction by means of the tongsi know it is tongs she uses by the clang  then the musicstool creaks and la belle dame is ready to play  she puts both her hands upon the keyboard and the treble shrieks apprehensively and the bass roars like a city in revolt after that this hush  just this interval  yet i sometimes think this hush is really the worst of it all  it is a voluminous apprehension a towering impendency  you dont understand george  you cant  the poor devil in poes pit and the pendulum must have had a taste of my sensations  a first victim is being chosen  i have a vision of the spirits of composers small and greatstanding up like suspects awaiting identification while her eye ranges over them  chopin tries to edge behind wagner a difficult and forbidding person and gounod seeks eclipse of mendelssohn who suddenly drops and crawls on all fours between gounods legs sullivan cowers and even piccolominis ironframed nerves desert him  she extends her hand  there is a frantic rush to escape  have you ever seen a little boy picking dormice out of a cage  i always see this same nightmare during that dreadful pause a vision of a writhing heap of kicking struggling maddened composers and of a ghoulish piano grinning expectant jaw raisedlid i meanand showing all its black and yellow keys    a melancholy shriek  do you hear george  tito mattel is captured  a song  pumso long the waypumso dark the daypumdear heart before you come  so tito mattel comes pumming through the wall into my presence  i dont pity him  indeed it is a positive relief that it is only tito mattel  the mans no deity at the best and a little pulling out and pulling crooked and general patching together of limbs in the wrong place scarcely matters so far as he and my taste are concerned yet i always leave my work george when that begins and walk about the room  i try to persuade myself that i need fresh air but the autumnal day the damp shiny street has all the uninviting harshness of truthi admit i do not  tito flops about is riddled with dropped notes and racked with hesitations and presently becomes still  the murder is over  what next  that study of chopins  this time the thing is more inspiring  once upon a time it was a favourite of mine  now it is a favourite of the unseen ladys  she plays it with spirit and conjures up strange fancies in my brain  the noises that come through the wall now quicker thicker louder are full of a tale of weltering confusion marine disaster a ship in sore labour there is a steady beating like the sound of pumps and a trickle of treble notes  there are black silences like thunderclouds that burst into flashes of music  now the poor melody swings up into the airthen comes one of those terrible pauses and now down into the abyss  a crash an ineffectual beating a spasmodic rush  i seem to hear the pumps again distant remote ineffectual  but that is not so the struggle is over  chopins study has been battered to pieces only disarticulated fragments toss amidst the froth  high up the confusion of the stormy sky she drives in a sieve dropping notesthe witch of the storm  la belle dame sans merci  but the third piece in her repertory has begunrubinstein  this at any rate is familiar  she plays with the confidence born of long unpunished misdoing  that rubinstein must indeed be sorry and unless their elysium is like the library of the linnæan society and fitted with double windows all the great departed musicians must be sorry too that he ever wrote a melody in f  daily from the altars of a thousand of ten thousand school pianos that melody cries to heaven from the empire of the music master upon which the sun never sets day and night week in week out from year to year rubinsteins melody in f streams up for ever  these school pieces are like the latin ritual before the reformation they link all christendom by a common use  as the earth spins and the sunlight sweeps ever westward that melody passes with the day  now it is tinkling in a grey moravian school now it dawns upon the adige and begins in alsace now it has reached madrid paris london  then a devotee in some connemara establishment for young ladies sets to  presently tall ships upon the silent main resound with it and they are at it in the azores and in iceland and thenone solitary tinkling doubling reduplicating manifolding into an innumerable multitudenew york takes up the wondrous tale  on then with the dawn to desolate cattle ranches the tablelands of mexico the level plains of illinois and michigan  so the great tide that started in rubinsteins cranium proceeds upon its destiny  always somewhere between the hours of eleven and two it comes back to me here poor hunted composition running its eternal world gauntlet pursuing its wandering jew pilgrimage and i curse and pity it as it goes by  it has gone  the maidens prayer is next usually  then one of the lieder ohne worte then the dead marchall of them but the meagre and mutilated skeletons of themselves things of gaps and tatters like gibbet trophies  they are as knocked about as a fleet coming out of action they are as twisted and garbled as a chinese war telegram it is like an hospital for congenitally diseased compositions taking the air  and they have to hobble along sharply too there is a certain cruel decision in the way the notes are struck a nurse gillespie touch about this invisible lady  or it may be the callousness of old habit a certain sense of a duty overdone a certain impatience at the long delay  you will hear  listentum tum tititumnotum  slight pause  tum tum twiddlevigorous crescendotum  this is unusual  a stranger  a new piece for la belle dame sans merci  her wonted reckless dash deserts her  she is as it were exploring a new region and advances with mischievous coyness with an affectation of a faltering heart with hesitating steps  my imagination is stimulated by these dripping notes  i see her as it were on an uneven pavement here the flags are set on end there fungi have tilted them a sharp turning of the page may reveal heaven knows what horrors presently comes a black gap with a vault of dusty silence below  a pause an incoherency a repetition  she has encountered some difficulty some slumbering coil of sharps and flats and it raises its bristling front in her way she has fled back to the opening again  i begin to wonder what unhappy musician lies hidden in this new ruin behind the bars of this melancholy confusion  there is something familiar but elusive like a face that one has known and loved and lost and met again after the cruel changes of intervening years  it conjures up oddly enough a vision of a long room in the twilight and an acacia in silhouette against the pale gold of the western sky  ah now i know  that of all pieces  i must have my walk george  i cannot bear to hear that oldfamiliar music so evilly entreated  but all the same the memory it has touched will vibrate and smart today and tomorrow and i know not for how many days it will reecho in my brain  all the old cloudy remorse that has subsided will be set astir again  i shall hear again a light touch upon the keys see again the shadowy face against the sunset try to recall the sound of a voice  what evil spirit has put this mockery into the head of la belle dame  surely without this  he made a dive at the folding doors and presently reappeared in his coat  it was the only intimation i ever had that my dear little uncle had such a thing as a past     on a tricycle  i sat on the parapet of the bridge and swung my feet over the water that frothed and fretted at the central pier below  above the bridge the stream broadened into a cressbespangled pool over which the sapphire dragonflies hovered and its earlier course was hidden by the big oak trees that bent towards each other from either bank  through their speckled tracery of green one saw the hazy blue depths of the further forest  i was watching the proceedings of some quickmoving brown bird amid the rushes and marsh marigolds of the opposite bank  pleasant said a voice beside me  i turned and saw my uncle  he was disguised in a costume of reddishbrown cloth  golf here said i and then i noticed the tricycle  a vagrom man on wheels  both the suit and the machine became him very well  the machine was low and singularly broad between the wheels and altogether equal to him and it had chubby pneumatic tires and a broad and even imposing wallet  yes said he following my eye  it is a handsome machine a full dress concern with all its plating and brown leather and in use it is as willing and quiet as any tricycle could be a most urbane and gentlemanly affairif you will pardon the adjective  i am glad these things have not come too late for me  frankly the bicycle is altogether too flippant for a man of my age and the tricycle hitherto with its two larger wheels behind and a smaller one in front has been so indecently suggestive of a perambulator that really george i could not bring myself to it  but a bishop might ride that thing  he swung himself up upon the parapet beside me and lit a cigar  the bicycle for boys georgeor fools  the things will not keep up for a moment without you work at them they need constant attention i would as soon ride a treadmill  you cannot loaf with them and the only true pleasure of cycling is to loaf  yet only this morning did i meet an elderly gentleman with a beard fit for abraham his face all crimson and deliquescent with heat and all distorted with the fury of his haste toiling up a hill on one of these unstable instruments when he saw me coming down in all my ease and dignity he damned at me with his bell  now i do not like to see a bicycle wobble under a load of years and steer into the irascible  as years increase tempers shorten and bicycles even the best of bicycles are seductively irritating  besides the devil of the wandering jew has power over all such as go upon two wheels  onward he says onward  faster thou man  this green and breezy earth is no abiding place for you  and hardbreathing crookshaped whirling bellbanging lunatics try and race you  they whiz by thinking indignities of your dignified progress and sometimes saying them  not one cyclist in a dozen george and seemingly not a solitary bicyclist seems to think of anything but getting to the end of his pleasure  i meet these servants of the wheel at the inns and they tell short stories and sketches about their pace and show each other their shoes and saddles and compare maps and roads some even try to trade machines  they talk most indecently of the makes and prices  i would as soon ask a man who was his tailor or where he got his hair cut and how much he paid  one man i met was not so much a man as a hoarding blatant about the gaspipe machine company  for them no flowers exist no wild birds no trees no landscapes no historical memorials and no geological associations nothing but the roads they traverse and the bicycles they ride  those that have other interests have them in the form of cheap portable cameras malignant things that can find no beauty in earth or heaven  george said my uncle suddenly and i knew he had come upon a great discovery real human beings are scarce in this world  you speak bitterly said i  i know what has happened  you are hot from an inn full of the viler type of cyclist and i presume that after their custom they mocked at your machinery  but dont blacken a popular exercise on that account  but these men are so aggressive  i tell you george it requires moral courage to ride a tricycle about at a moderate pace as a man of discretion should  they want to make a sport of it they are racestruck incapable of understanding a man who rides at seven miles an hour when he might ride at fifteen  read their special papers they mock and sneer at everything but pace they worship the makes of 94 in the interests of their advertising columns touring simply means hoteltouting to them and landscape deals in cameras in the end they will kill cyclingindeed they are killing it  it is not nice to be mocked at even when you are in the right a blatant cad is like a rhinoceros and admits of no parleying only since you must not kill him you are obliged to keep out of his way  the common cyclist has already driven ladies off the roads by forcing the pace the honeymoon tandem returns with its feelings hurt at his jesting and now he is driving off all quiet men  all this said i because they said something disrespectful about your machine at the last inn  you dont i see approve of the feminine bicycle  my uncle did his best to be calm and judicial  a woman in a hurry is one of the most painful sights in the world for exertion does not become a woman as it does a man  let us avoid all prejudice in this matter george and discuss it with open minds  she has in the first place a considerable length of hair and she does it up into rich and beautiful shapes with things called hairpins and with curling irons  very few people have hair that curls naturally george you are young but you are married and i see nothing improper in telling you these things  well when a woman rides about exerting herself violently to keep a bicycle going her hair gets damp and the pleasing curls lose their curliness and become wet straggling bands of hair plastered over her venous forehead  and a tragic anxiety is manifest an expression painful for a man to meet  also her hairpins come out and fall on the road to wait for pneumatic tires and her hair is no longer rich and beautiful in form  then she gets dirty horribly dirty as though she had been used to sweep the roads with  and her skirts have to be weirdly altered even to the divided skirt so that when she rides she looks like a short squat little man  she not only loses her beauty but her dignity  now for my own part i think a man wants a woman to worshipit is a mans point of view of course but i cant help my sexand the worshipping of these zouaves is incredible she is nothing more than a shorter fuller and feebler man  heaven help her  for the woman on the tricycle there are ampler excuses as well as ampler skirts the exertion is not too violent for grace and coolness and the offensive bulging above one narrow wheel is avoided but women will never sacrifice so much for so little worshipfulness beauty repose and comfort for a paltry two or three miles more an hour of pace  they know too well the graces of delay  to do things slowly george is part of the art of living  our sex learns that when its youthful fervour is over and all the things are done  but women are born wise  by the bye said i how is mrs harborough  very well thanks  how is euphemia  your bit of view george is pretty but i think i will have some heather now  there is a common three miles ahead  this indeed is the true merit of cycling  for a view a panorama for one picture a gallery  your true artist in cycling sits by the roadside and rides only by way of an interlude as for the worship of the machine i would as soon worship a sceneshifter  he dropped off the bridge and mounted his machine and was presently pursuing his smooth and noiseless way  as he vanished round the corner he sounded his gong  it was really a most potent grave and reverend gong with a certain note of philosophical melancholy in its tone as different from the vulgar tang of your common cycle as one can well imagine  it asked you at your convenience sir or madam to get out of the way to stand aside and see a most worthy and dignified spectacle roll by if so be you had the mind for it  as for any scolding insistence any threat of imminent collision there was none of it  it was the bell of a man who loved margins who was at his ease and would have all the world at its ease  more than anything else it reminded me of the boom of some ivyclad church tower warning the world without unseemly haste that another hour had with leisurely completeness accomplished itself  and so he passed out of my sight and was gone     an unsuspected masterpiece  authoress unknown  he pushed it away from him  i felt as though i had disturbed the graves of the long departed he said with a grimace and then addressing the egg forgive me the sacrilege they sold you to me as new laid a mere thing of yesterday i had no idea i was opening the immemorial past  de mortuis nihil nisi bonumto you at least the quotation will be novel  or i might call you bad you poor mummy  unhappy pentup ineffectual thing he said waving his jilted bread and butter and addressing the discarded inedible  poor old maid among eggs  and so it has come to this absolute failure with you  why were you ever laid  surely since you were once alive some lurking aspiration some lowly and yet not lowly but most divine striving towards the higher and the better hath stirred within you  the warm sunlight shone through your translucent shell the sweet air stirred the sweet hay of the nest and life called you from your dreaming to awake and join it in its interplay  and now  you might have beenwhat might you not have been  a prize hen fountain of a broadening stream of hens chicks dozens of chicks hundreds of chicks a surging ocean of chickens  had you been hatched among the early victorian chickens that were i presume your contemporaries by now you might have been a million fowl and the delight and support of hundreds of thousands of homes  you might have been worth thousands of pounds and have eaten corn by the ton  they might have written articles about you in halfcrown reviews and devoted poultry farms to your sole support  and instead you have been narrowed down to this sordid backstreet tragedy a mere offence tempting a struggling tradesman to risk the honour of my patronage of his books for a paltry fraction of a pennyworth of profit  why i ask you were you not hatched  was it lack of courage a fear of the unknown dangers that lie outside the shell  an indescribable pity wells up in me for this lost egg this dead end in the tree of life george  one thinks of the humble but deserving amoeba the primordial metazöon the first fish the remote reptile ancestor the countless generations of forefathers that so far as this egg went have lived and learnt and suffered in vain  the torrent of life had split and rushed by on either side of it  and you might cried he turning to the egg again have been a variety a novelty and an improvement in chickens  no chick now will ever be exactly the chick you might have been  only an olive schreiner could do full justice to your failure you poor nun you futile eremite you absolute and hopeless impasse  was it i ask again a lack of courage  perhaps a lack of opportunity  it may be you stirred and hoped in the distant past and the warmth to quicken you never came  ambition may have fretted you  indeed now i think of it there is something in the flavour of you singularly suggestive of disappointed ambition  in literature and more particularly in criticism i can assure you i have met the very fellow of your quality from literary rotten eggs whose opening came too late  they are like the genii in the arabian nights whom solomon the son of david sealed in the pot  at first he promised infinite delights to his discovererand his discoverer lagged  in the end he was filled with unreasonable hatred against all the feeble free and emerged as a malignant fume eager to wreak himself upon the world  a sudden thought george  i see my egg in a new light and all my pity changes to respect  surely it is a most potent egg a gallinaceous swift  after all anything but pointless and childless since it has this strange quality of being offensive and engendering thought  food for the mind if not food for the bodydidactic if not delightfula bit of modern literature earnest and fundamentally real i must try and understand you ibsen ovarum  possibly it is a profound parable i have stumbled upon  though i scarcely reckoned on a parable with my bread and butter  frankly i must confess i bought it for the eating  now that my uncle had at last begun to grasp the true greatness of his egg he apparently considered it becoming to drop the tone of halfpatronising pity he had previously adopted  come said he smiling with a dash of raillery over his coffeecup admit you are a humbug you whitened sepulchre of an anticipated chick  until you found a congenial soul and overwhelmed me with your confidence what a career of deceptionnot mean of course but cynicalironicalyou have been leading  what a jest it must have been to you to be sold as new laid  how you laughed in your quiet way at the mockery of life surely it was a worthy pair to swift in cassock and bands conducting a marriage service  i can well fancy your silent scorn of the hand that put you in the bag  new laid  but now i have the full humour of you you must pardon my dulness of apprehension  i grasp your meaning now your quiet insistent teaching that all life is decay and all decay is life  no forcing the accent no crudity but a pervading persuasion a noble gospel  he paused impressively placed the egg respectfully upon his bureau and presently went off at a tangent to something else  shall i throw this away said the girl  good heavens  throw it away  certainly not  put it in the library the library used to be the corner of the room by the window  she stared at me with a certain attempt at confidence  she is a callous impertinent kind of girl and i fear inclined to be bold  it do smell sir she said to him  thats the merit of it  its irony  go and put it on the fourth shelf near the window  there are some yellowcovered books there and swift some comedies by a gentleman named ibsen and a couple of novels by two gentlemen named george   but there you dont know one book from another  the fourth shelf from the top on the righthand side  as the girl did so she looked over her hand at me and lifted her eyebrows very slightly     the great change  my uncle had been hectic all day  i knew and dreaded what was coming and said nothing that by any chance could lead up to it  he absentmindedly tipped the emu sixpence  then we came to the wart hog  a bachelor he said meditatively scratching the brutes back  i hastily felt for a saving topic in the apprehensive darkness of my mind and could find none  i expect i shall be married in october said my uncle  then sighing the idyll of my engagement was shortlived  it was out  now the daymy last idle day with my poor unclewas a hideous wreck  all the topics he had fluttered round vanished and cold and awful there loomed over us the one great topic  what do you think of marriage george said my uncle after a pause prodding the wart hog suddenly  thats your privilege said i  married men dont dare to think of it  bigamy  privilege  is it such a headlong wreck of ones ideals as they say said my uncle  is that dreamland furniture really so unstable in use  of course said i its different from what one expects  but it seems to be worse for the other party  at least to judge from the novels they engender in their agony  so far as i can see he proceeded what happens is very similar to a thing a scientific chap was explaining to me the other day  there are some little beasts in the sea called ascidians and they begin life as cheerful little tadpole things with waggling tails and big expressive eyes  they move freely about hither and thither and often travel vast distances in an adventurous way  then what he called metamorphosis begins  the little tadpole waggles his way to a rock and fixes himself head downward  then he undergoes the oddest changes becomes indeed a mere vegetative excrescence on the stone secretes a lot of tough muck round himself and is altogether lost to free oceanic society  he loses the cheerful tail loses most of his brain loses his bright expressive eye  the bother of it said i is that very often the wandering expressive eye is not lost in the human metamorphosis  putting it in another way one might say that the kind of story that ovid is so fond of describing the affairs of daphne and io for instance are fables of the same thing an interlude of sentiment and then a change into something new and domesticated rooted fixed and bounded in  it is certainly always a settling down said i  i dont like this idea of settling down george  he shuddered  it must be a dreadful thing to go about always with a house on your mind  you get used to it  and besides you dont go about so much  he gave the bachelor wart hog a parting dig and we walked slowly and silently through the zebrahouse towards the elephants  of course we do not intend to settle down he said presently with a clumsy effort to render his previous remarks impersonal  a marriage invalidates all promises i explained  the law recognises this in the case of wills  thats a new view he said evidently uncomfortable about something  it follows from your doctrine of metamorphosis  a marries b  then the great change begins  a gradually alters into a new fixed form c while b flattens and broadens out as d  it is a different couple and they cannot reasonably be held responsible for the vagaries of a and b  that ought to be better understood  it would perhaps be as well  before marriage edwin vows to devote his life to angelina and angelina vows she will devote her life to edwin after marriage this leads to confusion if they continue to believe such promises  marriage certainly has that odd effect on the memory  you remember angelinas promises and forget your own and vice versa  there is no apparition more distressing than the ghost of a dead promise said my uncle  especially when it is raised in the house of your friends  we passed through the elephant house in silence  i wonder what kind of man i shall be after the change george  its all a tossup he continued after an interval  i have seen some men improved by it  you for instance  you were a mere useless indecent aspirant to genius before the thing came upon you  now you are a respectable journalist and gracefully anxious to give satisfaction to your editor  but my own impression is that a man has to be a bit of an ass before he can be improved by marriage  most men get so mercenary they simply work and do nothing a rational creature should  they are like the male ants that shed their wings after the nuptial flight  and their wives go round talking fashion articles and calling them dear old stupids and flirting over teacups with the unmarried men or writing novelettes about the childman and living their own lives ive been an unmarried man and i know all about it  every intelligent woman now seems to want to live her own life when she is not engaged in taking the childman out into polite society and trying to wean him from alcohol and tobacco  however this scarcely applies to me  not now i said  and he winced  i wonder how it feels  most men go into this without knowing of the change that hangs over them  but i am older  it would not be nice for a caterpillar if he knew he was going to rip up all along his back in a minute or so  yet i could sympathise with such a caterpillar now anyhow george i hope the change will be complete  i would not like to undergo only a partial metamorphosis and become a queer speckled monster all spotted with bachelor habits  yet i sometimes think i am beyond the adolescent stage and my habits rather deeply rooted hitherto i have always damned a little at braces and collars and things like that  i wish i knew where one could pick up a few admissible expletives  and i loaf about london all day sometimes without any very clear idea of what i am after telling chaps in studios how to paint and talking to leisurely barristers and all that kind of thing  she i said will probably help you to conquer habits of that sort  yes i dare say she will said my uncle  i forgot that for the minute     the pains of marriage  my uncle came to a stop outside a stationers shop in oxfordstreet when i saw what had caught his attention i reproached myself for my thoughtlessness  come said i tell me what you think ofof representative government  its no good george  you did the same thing at the cake shop  do you think i never saw the cake shop  since this affair was settled i think every shop i pass reminds me of iteven the gunsmiths  i never suspected before how entirely retail trade turned on marriageexcept perhaps the secondhand book shops  the whole world seems amarrying  its queer said he that a little while ago the thing that worried me to the exclusion of everything else was the idea of being married and now it is so near its entirely the getting married that upsets me i have forgotten the horrid consequences in the horror of the operation  its much the same said i at an execution  look at those cards  he waved his hand towards a neat array of silver and white pasteboard  jemima smith with an arrow through the smith and podger written above it and on the opposite side mr and mrs john podger  that is where it has me george  we went on past a display of electroplate with a card about presents in the window past a window full of white flowers past a carriagebuilders and a glove shop  its like death said my uncle it turns up everywhere and is just the same for everybody  in that cake shop there were piles and piles of cakes from little cakes ten inches across up to cakes of three hundredweight or so all just the same rich uneatable greasy stuff and with just the same white sugar on the top of them  i suppose every day they pack off scores  it makes one think of marrying in swarms like the gnats  i catch myself wondering sometimes if the run of people really are separate individuals or only a kind of replicas without any tastes of their own  there are people who would rather not marry than marry without one of those cakes george  to me it seems to be almost the most asinine position a couple of adults can be in to have to buy a stone or so of that concentrated biliousness and cut it up or procure other people to cut it up and send it round to other adults who would almost as soon eat arsenic  and why cakeinfantile cake  why not biscuits or cigarettes or chocolate  it seems to me to be playing the fool with a solemn occasion  you see it is the custom to have cake  well anyhow i intend to break the custom  so did i but i had it all the same  my uncle looked at me  you see said i when a woman says you must do this or thatmust have cake at a wedding for instanceyou must do it  it is not a case for argument  it is a kind of privilege they havethe categorical imperative  you will soon learn that  evidently the question was open  but why do they say you must  other women tell them to  they would despise any one dreadfully who did not have a really big cakefrom that shop  but why  my dear uncle said i you are going into matrimony  you do not show a proper spirit  the cake said my uncle is only a type  there is this trousseau business again  why should a woman who is going to marry require a complete outfit of that sort  it seems to suggestwell prenuptial rags at least george  then the costume  why should a sane healthy woman be covered up in white gauze like the confectionery in a shop window when the flies are about  and why  he was going on in quite an aggressive tone  there isnt a why i said for any of it  this sort of talk always irritates a married man because it revives his own troubles  its just the rule  surely if a wife is worth having she is worth being ridiculous for  you ought to be jolly glad you dont have to wear a fools cap and paint your nose red  more precious than rubies  dont he said  it must be these tradesmen he began bitterly after an interval some one must be responsible and its just their way  do you know george i sometimes fancy that they have hypnotised womankind into the belief that all these uncomfortable things are absolutely necessary to a valid marriagejust as they have persuaded the landlady class that no house is complete without a big mirror over the fireplace and a bulgy sideboard  there is a very strong flavour of mesmeric suggestion about a womans attitude towards these matters considered in the light of her customary common sense  do you know george i really believe there is a secret society of tradesmen a kind of priesthood who get hold of our womenkind and muddle them up with all these fancies  its a sort of white magic  have you ever been in a drapers shop george  never i said i always wait outsideamong the dogs  have you ever read a ladies newspaper  i didnt know said i that there was any part to read  its all advertisements all the articles are advertisements all the paragraphs the stories the answers to correspondentseverything  thats exactly what makes me think the tradesmen have hypnotised the sex  it may be they do it in those drapers dens  a man spots that kind of thing at once and drops the paper  women go on year after year simply worshipping a paper hoarding of that kind and doing patiently everything they are told to do therein  anyhow it is only in this way that i can account for all these expensive miseries of matrimony  i cant understand a woman in full possession of her faculties deliberately exasperating the man she has to live withi suppose all men submit to it under protestfor these stale and stereotyped antics  she must be magnetised  they are not stale to her i said  mrs harborough he began  of course a widowi forgot i said  but she seems so young you know  and putting aside the details said my uncle with a transient dash of cheerfulness at my mistake i object to the publicity of the whole thing  its not nice  to bring the street arab into the affair to subject yourself to the impertinent congratulations and presents of every aspirant to your intimacy to be patted on the back in the local newspapers as though you were going to do something clever  confound them  its not their affair  and im too old to be a blushing bridegroom  then think what am i to do george if that cad hagshot sends me a present  it would be like him if he did i said  i fancy he will  i cant go and kick him said my uncle  declined with thanks i suggested owing to pressure of other matter  you are getting shoppy george said my uncle in as near an approach to a querulous tone as i have heard from him  you are getting married i replied with the complacency of one whose troubles are over  but its a horrible nuisance anyhow  still the world grows wiser and the burden is not quite so bad as it used to be a hundred years hence  id be willing enough to wait said my uncle but im not the only party in this affair   he was willing enough to wait perhaps but time was inexorable  save for one hurried interview i did not see him again for a week and then it was before the altar  his garrulity had fallen from him like a garment  he was preoccupied and a trifle bashful  he fumbled with the ring  i felt almost as though he was my younger brother  i stood by him to the end and at last came the hour of parting  i grasped his hand in silence silently he mastered a becoming emotion and in silence he went from me unto the new life     a misunderstood artist  the gentleman with the jovian coiffure began to speak as the train moved  tis the utmost degradation of art he said  he had apparently fallen into conversation with his companion upon the platform  i dont see it said this companion a prosperouslooking gentleman with a gold watchchain  this art for arts sakei dont believe in it i tell you  art should have an aim  if it dont do you good if it aint moral id as soon not have it  what good is it  i believe in ruskin  i tell you  bah said the gentleman in the corner with almost explosive violence  he fired it like a big gun across the path of the incipient argument and slew the prosperouslooking gentleman at once  he met our eyes as we turned to him with a complacent smile on his large white cleanshaven face  he was a corpulent person dressed in black and with something of the quality of a secondhand bishop in his appearance  the demolished owner of the watchchain made some beginnings of a posthumous speech  bah said the gentleman in the corner with even more force than before and so finished him  these people will never understand he said after a momentary pause addressing the gentleman with the jovian coiffure and indicating the remains of the prosperous gentleman by a wave of a large white hand why do you argue  art is ever for the few  i did not argue said the gentleman with the hair  i was interrupted  the owner of the watchchain who had been sitting struggling with his breath now began to sob out his indignation  what do you mean sir  saying bah sir when i am talking  the gentleman with the large face held up a soothing hand  peace peace he said  i did not interrupt you  i annihilated you  why did you presume to talk to artists about art  go away or i shall have to say bah again  go and have a fit  leave ustwo rare souls who may not meet againto our talking  did you ever see such abominable rudeness sir said the gentleman with the watchchain appealing to me  there were tears in his eyes at the same time the young man with the aureole made some remark to the corpulent gentleman that i failed to catch  these artists said i are unaccountable irresponsible  you must  take it from whence it comes said the insulted one very loudly and bitterly glaring at his opponent  but the two artists were conversing serenely  i felt the undignified quality of our conversation  have you seen punch said i thrusting it into his hand  he looked at the paper for a moment in a puzzled way then understood thanked me and began to read with a thunderous scowl every now and then shooting murderous glances at his antagonist in the opposite corner or coughing in an aggressive manner  you do your best the gentleman with the long hair was saying and they say what is it for  it is for itself you say  like the stars  but these people said the stout gentleman think the stars were made to set their clocks by  they lack the magnanimity to drop the personal reference  a friend a confrère saw a party of these horrible extension people at rome before that exquisite venus of titian  and now mr somethingorother said one of the young ladies addressing the pedagogue in command what is this to teach us  i have had the same experience said the young gentleman with the hair  a man sent to me only a week ago to ask what my sonnet the scarlet thread meant  the stout person shook his head as though such things passed all belief  gurrrr said the gentleman with punch and scraped with his foot on the floor of the carriage  i gave him answer said the poet twas a sonnet not a symbol  precisely said the stout gentleman  tis the fate of all art to be misunderstood  i am always grossly misunderstoodby every one  they call me fantastic whereas i am but inevitably new indecent because i am unfettered by mere trivial personal restrictions unwholesome  it is what they say to me  they are always trying to pull me to earth  is it wholesome they say  nutritious  i say to them i do not know  i am an artist  i do not care  it is beautiful  you rhyme said the poet  no  my work ismore plastic  i cook  for a moment perhaps the poet was disconcerted  a noble art he said recovering  the noblest said the cook  but sorely misunderstood degraded to utilitarian ends tested by impossible standards  i have been seriously asked to render oily food palatable to a delicate patient seriously  he said bah  bah to me mumbled the defunct gentleman with punch apparently addressing the cartoon  a cook  good lord  i resigned  cookery i said is an art  i am not a fattener of human cattle  think is it art to write a book with an object to paint a picture for strategy  are we i said in the sixties or the nineties  here in your kitchen i am inspired with beautiful dinners and i produce them  it is your place to gather together from this place one and from that one the few precious souls who can appreciate that rare and wonderful thing a dinner graceful harmonious exquisite perfect  and he argued i must study his guests  no artist is of any worth said the poet who primarily studies what the public needs  as i told him  but the next man was worsehygienic  while with this creature i read poe for the first time and i was singularly fascinated by some of his grotesques  i triedit was an altogether new development i believe in culinary artthe bizarre  i made some curious arrangements in pork and strawberries with a sauce containing beer  quite by accident i mentioned my design to him on the evening of the festival  all the philistine was aroused in him  it will ruin my digestion  my friend i said i am not your doctor i have nothing to do with your digestion  only here is a beautiful japanese thing a quaint queer almost eerie dinner that is in my humble opinion worth many digestions  you may take it or leave it but tis the last dinner i cook for you   i knew i was wasted upon him  then i produced some nocturnes in imitation of mr whistler with mushrooms truffles grilled meat pickled walnuts black pudding french plums portera dinner in soft velvety black eaten in a starlight of small scattered candles  that too led to a resignation art will ever demand its martyrs  the poet made sympathetic noises  always  the awful many will never understand  their conception of my skill is altogether on a level with their conceptions of music of literature of painting  for wall decorations they love autotypes for literature harmless volumes of twaddle that leave no vivid impressions on the mind for dinners harmless dishes that are forgotten as they are eaten  my dinners stick in the memory  i cannot study these peoplemy genius is all too imperative  if i needed a flavour of almonds and had nothing else to hand i would use prussic acid  do right i say as your art instinct commands and take no heed of the consequences  our function is to make the beautiful gastronomic thing not to pander to gluttony not to be the jesuits of hygiene  my friend you should see some of my compositions  at home i have books and books in manuscript symphonies picnics fantasies etudes  the train was now entering clapham junction  the gentleman with the gold watchchain returned my punch  a cook he said in a whisper just a common cook  he lifted his eyebrows and shook his head at me and proceeded to extricate himself and his umbrella from the carriage out of a situation too he saida little louderas i prepared to follow him  mere dripping said the artist in cookery with a regal wave of the hand  had i felt sure i was included i should of course have resented the phrase     the man with a nose  i never see thy face but i think upon hellfire and dives that lived in purple for there he is in his robes burning burning   my nose has been the curse of my life  the other man started  they had not spoken before  they were sitting one at either end on that seat on the stony summit of primrose hill which looks towards regents park  it was night  the paths on the slope below were dotted out by yellow lamps the albertroad was a line of faintly luminous pale greenthe tint of gaslight seen among trees beyond the park lay black and mysterious and still further a yellow mist beneath and a coppery hue in the sky above marked the blaze of the marylebone thoroughfares  the nearer houses in the albertterrace loomed large and black their blackness pierced irregularly by luminous windows above starlight  both men had been silent lost apparently in their own thoughts mere dim black figures to each other until one had seen fit to become a voice also with this confidence  yes he said after an interval my nose has always stood in my way always  the second man had scarcely seemed to notice the first remark but now he peered through the night at his interlocutor  it was a little man he saw with face turned towards him  i see nothing wrong with your nose  if it were luminous you might said the first speaker  however i will illuminate it  he fumbled with something in his pocket then held this object in his hand  there was a scratch a streak of greenish phosphorescent light and then all the world beyond became black as a fusee vesta flared  there was silence for the space of a minute  an impressive pause  well said the man with the nose putting his heel on the light  i have seen worse said the second man  i doubt it said the man with the nose and even so it is poor comfort  did you notice the shape the size the colour  like snowdon it has a steep side and a gentle slope  the size is preposterous my face is like a henhouse built behind a portico  and the tints  it is not all red said the second man anyhow  no there is purple and blue lapis lazuli blue as a vein over the madonnas breast and in one place a greyish mole  bah the thing is not a nose at all but a bit of primordial chaos clapped on to my face  but being where the nose should be it gets the credit of its position from unthinking people  there is a gap in the order of the universe in front of my face a lump of unwrought material left over in that my true nose is hidden as a statue is hidden in a lump of marble until the appointed time for the revelation shall come  at the resurrection  but one must not anticipate  well well  i do not often talk about my nose my friend but you sat with a sympathetic pose it seemed to me and tonight my heart is full of it  this cursed nose  but do i weary you thrusting my nose into your meditations  if said the second man his voice a little unsteady as though he was moved if it eases your mind to talk of your nose pray talk  this nose i say then makes me think of the false noses of carnival times  your dullest man has but to stick one on and lo mirth wit and jollity  they are enough to make anything funny  i doubt if even an anglican bishop could wear one with impunity  put an angel in one how would you like one popped on to you now  think of going lovemaking or addressing a public meeting or dying gloriously in a nose like mine  angelina laughs in your face the public laughs the executioner at your martyrdom can hardly light the faggots for laughing  by heaven it is no joke  often and often i have rebelled and said i will not have this nose  but what can one do  it is destiny  the bitter tragedy of it is that it is so comic only god knows how glad i shall be when the carnival is over and i may take the thing off and put it aside  the worst has been this business of love  my mind is not unrefined my body is healthy  i know what tenderness is  but what woman could overlook a nose like mine  how could she shut out her visions of it and look her love into my eyes glaring at her over its immensity  i should have to make love through an inquisitors hood with its holes cut for the eyesand even then the shape would show  i have read i have been told i can imagine what a lovers face is likea sweet womans face radiant with love  but this millbank penitentiary of flesh chills their dear hearts  he broke off suddenly with loud ferocious curses  a young man who had been sitting very close to a young woman on an adjacent seat started up and said ssh  he whom the man with the nose had addressed now spoke  i have certainly never thought before of a red nose as a sorrowful thing but as you put it  i thought you would understand  i have had this nose all my life the outline was done even though the colour was wanting in my school days  they called me nosey ovid cicero rhino and the excrescence  it has ripened with the slow years as fate deepens in the progress of a tragedy  love the business of life is a sealed book to me  to be alone  i would thank heaven  but no a blind woman could feel the shape of it  besides love interrupted the young man thoughtfully there are other things worth living forduty  an unattractive nose would not interfere with that  some people think it is rather more important than love  i admit your loss of course  that only carries out the evidence of your voice and tells me you are young  my dear young fellow duty is a very fine thing indeed but believe me it is too colourless as a motive  there is no delight in duty  you will know that at my age  and besides i have an infinite capacity for love and sympathy an infinite bitterness in this solitude of my soul  i infer that you would moralise on my discontent but i know i have seen a little of men and things from behind this ambuscadeonly a truly artistic man would fall into the sympathetic attitude that attracted me  my life has had even too much of observation in it and to the systematic anthropologist nothing tells a mans character more than his pose after dark when nobody seems watching  as you sit the black outline of you is clear against the sky  ah now you are sitting stiffer  but you are no calvinist  my friend the best of life is its delights and the best of delights is loving and being loved  and for thatthis nose  well there are plenty of secondbest things  after dark i can forget the monster a little  spring is delightful air on the downs is delightful it is fine to see the stars circling in the sky while lying among the heather  even this london sky is soothing at night though the edge is all inflamed  the shadow of my nose is darkest by day  but tonight i am bitter because of tomorrow  why tomorrow said the younger man  i have to meet some new people tomorrow said the man with the nose there is an odd look a mingling of amusement and pity i am only too familiar with  my cousin who is a gifted hostess promises people my nose as a treat  yes that must be bad for you said the young man  and then the silence healed again and presently the man with the nose got up and passed into the dimness upon the slope of the hill  the young man watched him vanish wondering vainly how it would be possible to console a soul under such a burthen
