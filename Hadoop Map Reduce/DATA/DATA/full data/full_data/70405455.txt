70405455	red rooney by rm ballantyne  a tale of eskimo innuit life in greenland at the end of the eighteenth century    chapter one  the last of the crew  lost and found  there is a particular spot in those wild regions which lie somewhere near the northern parts of baffins bay where nature seems to have set up her workshop for the manufacture of icebergs where polar bears in company with seals and greenland whales are wont to gambol and where the family of jack frost may be said to have taken permanent possession of the land  one winter day in the early part of the eighteenth century a solitary man might have been seen in that neighbourhood travelling on foot over the frozen sea in a staggering stumbling hurried manner as if his powers though not his will were exhausted  the mans hairy garb of grey sealskin might have suggested that he was a denizen of those northern wilds had not the colour of his face his brown locks and his bushy beard betokened him a native of a very different region  although possessing a broad and stalwart frame his movements indicated as we have said excessive weakness  a morsel of ice in his path that would have been no impediment even to a child caused him to stumble recovering himself with an evidently painful effort he continued to advance with quick yet wavering steps  there was however a strange mixture of determination with his feebleness  energy and despair seemed to be conjoined in his look and actionand no wonder for red rooney although brave and resolute by nature was alone in that arctic wilderness and reduced to nearly the last extremity by fatigue and famine  for some dayshow many he scarcely rememberedhe had maintained life by chewing a bit of raw sealskin as he travelled over the frozen waste but this source of strength had at last been consumed and he was now sinking from absolute want  the indomitable spirit of the man however kept his weakened body moving even after the mind had begun to sink into that dreamy lethargic state which is said to indicate the immediate approach of death and there was still a red spot in each of his pale and hollow cheeks as well as an eager gleam of hope in his sunken eyes for the purpose that red rooney had in view was to reach the land  it was indeed a miserably faint hope that urged the poor fellow on for the desolate shore of western greenland offered little better prospect of shelter than did the iceclad sea but as in the case of the drowning man he clutched at this miserable straw of hope and held on for life  there was the bare possibility that some of the migratory eskimos might be there or if not that some scraps of their foodsome bits of refuse even a few bonesmight be found  death he felt was quickly closing with him on the sea  the great enemy might perhaps be fought with and kept at bay for a time if he could only reach the land  encouraging himself with such thoughts he pushed on but again stumbled and fellthis time at full length  he lay quiet for a few seconds  it was so inexpressibly sweet to rest and feel the wornout senses floating away as it were into dreamland  but the strong will burst the tightening bands of death and rising once more with the exclamation god help me he resumed his weary march  all around him the great ocean was covered with its coat of solid unbroken ice for although winter was past and the sun of early spring was at the time gleaming on bergs that raised their battlements and pinnacles into a bright blue sky the hoary king of the far north refused as yet to resign his sceptre and submit to the interregnum of the genial sun  a large hummock or ridge of ice lay in front of the man blocking his view of the horizon in that direction  it had probably been heaved up by one of the convulsions of the previous autumn and was broken into a chaotic mass  here he stopped and looked up with a sigh  but the sinking of the heart was momentary  deep snow had so filled up the crevices of the shattered blocks that it was possible to advance slowly by winding in and out among them  as the ascent grew steeper the forlorn man dropped on allfours and crawled upwards until he reached the top  the view that burst upon him would have roused enthusiasm if his situation had been less critical  even as it was an exclamation of surprise broke from him for there not five miles distant was the coast of greenland desolate indeed and iceboundhe had expected thatbut inexpressibly grand even in its desolation  a mighty tongue of a great glacier protruded itself into the frozen sea  the tip of this tongue had been broken off and the edge presented a gigantic wall of crystal several hundred feet high on which the sun glittered in blinding rays  this tonguea mere offshoot of the great glacier itselffilled a valley full ten miles in length measuring from its tip in the ocean to its root on the mountain brow where the snowline was seen to cut sharply against the sky  for some minutes red rooney sat on one of the iceblocks gazing with intense eagerness along the shore in the hope of discerning smoke or some other evidence of mans presence  but nothing met his disappointed gaze save the same uniform interminable waste of white and grey with here and there a few dark frowning patches where the cliffs were too precipitous to sustain the snow  another despairing sigh rose to the mans lips but these refused to give it passage  with stern resolve he arose and stumbled hurriedly forward  the strain however proved too great  on reaching the level ice on the other side of the ridge he fell apparently for the last time and lay perfectly still  ah how many must have fallen thus to rise no more since men first began to search out the secrets of that grand mysterious region  but red rooney was not doomed to be among those who have perished there not far from the spot where he fell one of the short but muscular and hairyrobed denizens of that country was busily engaged in removing the skin from a polar bear which he had just succeeded in spearing after a combat which very nearly cost him his life  during the heat of the battle the brave little mans foot had slipped and the desperately wounded monster making a rush at the moment overturned him into a crevice between two iceblocks fortunately the impetus of the rush caused the animal to shoot into another crevice beyond and the man proving more active than the bear sprang out of his hole in time to meet his foe with a spearthrust so deadly that it killed him on the spot  immediately he began to skin the animal intending to go home with the skin and return with a team of dogs for the meat and the carcass of a recentlycaught seal  meanwhile having removed and packed up the bearskin he swung it on his broad shoulders and made for the shore as fast as his short legs would carry him  on the way he came to the spot where the fallen traveller lay  his first act was to open his eyes to the uttermost and considering the small twinkling appearance of those eyes just a minute before the change was marvellous  hoi then burst from him with tremendous emphasis after which he dropped his bundle turned poor rooney over on his back and looked at his face with an expression of awe  dead said the eskimo under his breathin his own tongue of course not in english of which we need scarcely add he knew nothing  after feeling the mans breast under his coat for a few seconds he murmured the word kablunet foreigner and shook his head mournfully  it was not so much grief for the mans fate that agitated this child of the northern wilderness as regret at his own bad fortune  marvellous were the reports which from the south of greenland had reached him in his far northern home of the strange kablunets or foreigners who had arrived there to trade with the eskimosmen who so the reports went wore smooth coats without hair little round things on their heads instead of hoods and flapping things on their legs instead of sealskin bootsmen who had come in monster kayaks canoes as big as icebergs men who seemed to possess everything had the power to do anything and feared nothing  no fabrications in the arabian nights or gulliver or baron munchausen ever transcended the stories about those kablunets which had reached this broad short sturdy eskimostories which no doubt began in the south of greenland with a substratum of truth but which in travelling several hundreds of miles northward had grown as a snowball might have grown if rolled the same distance over the arctic wastes with this differencethat whereas the snowball would have retained its original shape though not its size the tales lost not only their pristine form and size but became so amazingly distorted that the original reporters would probably have failed to recognise them  and now at last here was actually a kabluneta real foreigner in the body but not alive  it was extremely disappointing  our sturdy eskimo however was not a good judge of kablunet vitality he was yet rubbing the mans broad chest with a sort of pathetic pity when a flutter of the heart startled him  he rubbed with more vigour he became excited and seizing red rooney by the arms shook him with considerable violence the result being that the foreigner opened his eyes and looked at him inquiringly  hallo my lad said rooney in a faint voice not quite so hard  im all right  just help me up like a good fellow  he spoke in english which was of course a waste of breath in the circumstances  in proof of his being all right he fell back again and fainted away  the eskimo leaped up  he was one of those energetic beings who seem to know in all emergencies what is best to be done and do it promptly unrolling the bearskin which yet retained a little of its first owners warmth he wrapped the kablunet in it from head to foot leaving an opening in front of his mouth for breathing purposes  with his knifea stone onehe cut off a little lump of blubber from the seal and placed that in the opening so that the stranger might eat on reviving if so inclined or let it alone if so disposed  then turning his face towards the land he scurried away over the ice like a hunted partridge or a hairy ball driven before an arctic breeze  he made such good use of his short legs that in less than an hour he reached a little hut which seemed to nestle under the wing of a great cliff in order to avoid destruction by the glittering walls of an impending glacier  the hut had no proper doorway but a tunnelshaped entrance about three feet high and several feet long  falling on his knees the eskimo crept into the tunnel and disappeared  gaining the inner end of it he stood up and glared speechless at his astonished wife  she had cause for surprise for never since their weddingday had nuna beheld such an expression on the fat face of her amiable husband  okiok she said have you seen an evil spirit  no he replied  why then do you glare  of course nuna spoke in choice eskimo which we render into english with as much fidelity to the native idiom as seems consistent with the agreeable narration of our tale  hoi exclaimed okiok in reply to her question but without ceasing to glare and breathe hard  has my husband become a walrus that he can only shout and snort inquired nuna with the slightest possible twinkle in her eyes as she raised herself out of the lampsmoke and laid down the stick with which she had been stirring the contents of a stone pot  instead of answering the question okiok turned to two chubby and staring youths of about fifteen and sixteen respectively who were mending spears and said sharply norrak ermigit go harness the dogs  norrak rose with a bound and dived into the tunnel  ermigit although willing enough was not quite so sharp  as he crawled into the tunnel and was disappearing his father sent his foot in the same direction and having thus intimated the necessity for urgent haste he turned again to his wife with a somewhat softened expression  give me food nuna  little food has passed into me since yesterday at sunrise  i starve  when i have eaten you shall hear words that will make you dream for a moon  i have seenhe became solemn at this point and lowered his voice to a whisper as he advanced his head and glared againi have seen aakablunet  he drew back and gazed at his wife as connoisseurs are wont to do when examining a picture  and truly nunas countenance was a pictureround fat comely oily also openmouthed and eyed with unbounded astonishment depicted thereon for she thoroughly believed her husband knowing that he was upright and never told lies  her mental condition did not however interfere with her duties  a wooden slab or plate laden with a mess of broiled meat soon smoked before her lord  he quickly seated himself on a raised platform and had done some justice to it before nuna recovered the use of her tongue  a kablunet she exclaimed almost solemnly  is he dead  okiok paused with a lump of blubber in his fingers close to his mouth  no he is alive  at least he was alive when i left him  if he has not died since he is alive still  having uttered this truism he thrust the blubber well home and continued his meal  nunas curiosity having been aroused was not easily allayed  she sat down beside her spouse and plied him with numerous questions to which okiok gave her brief and very tantalising replies until he was gorged when throwing down the platter he turned abruptly to his wife and said impressively  open your ears nuna  okiok is no longer what he was  he has been born only today  he has at last seen with his two eyesa kablunet  he paused to restrain his excitement  his wife clasped her hands and looked at him excitedly waiting for more  this kablunet he continued is very white and not so ruddy as we have been told they are  his hair is brown and twists in little circles  he wears it on the top of his head and on the bottom of his head alsoall round  he is not small or short  no he is long and broadbut he is thin very thin like the young ice at the beginning of winter  his eyes are the colour of the summer sky  his nose is like the eagles beak but not so long  his mouthi know not what his mouth is like it is hid in a nest of hair  his words i understand not  they seem to me nonsense but his voice is soft and deep  and his dresshow does he dress asked nuna with natural feminine curiosity  like ourselves replied okiok with a touch of disappointment in his tone  the men who said the kablunets wear strange things on their heads and long flapping things on their legs told lies  why did you not bring him here asked nuna after a few moments meditation on these marvels  because he is too heavy to lift and too weak to walk  he has been starving  i wrapped him in the skin of a bear and left him with a piece of blubber at his nose  when he wakes up he will smell then he will eat  perhaps he will live perhaps he will die  who can tell  i go to fetch him  as the eskimo spoke the yelping of dogs outside told that his sons had obeyed his commands and got ready the sledge  without another word he crept out of the hut and jumped on the sledge which was covered with two or three warm bearskins  ermigit restrained the dogs of which there were about eight each fastened to the vehicle by a single line norrak handed his father the shorthandled but heavy longlashed whip  okiok looked at norrak as he grasped the instrument of punishment  jump on he said  norrak did so with evident goodwill  the whip flashed in the air with a serpentine swing and went off like a pistol  the dogs yelled in alarm and springing away at full speed were soon lost among the hummocks of the arctic sea    chapter two  describes a rescue and a happy family  while the eskimos were thus rushing to his rescue poor red rooney whose shipmates we may explain at once had thus contracted his christian name of reginaldbegan to recover from his swoon and to wonder in a listless fashion where he was  feeling comparatively comfortable in his bearskin he did not at first care to press the inquiry but as okiok had anticipated the peculiar smell near his nose tended to arouse him  drawing his hand gently up he touched the object in front of his mouth  it felt very like blubber with which substance he was familiar  extending his tongue he found that it also tasted like blubber  to a starving man this was enough  he pulled the end of the raw morsel into his mouth and began to chew  ah reader turn not up your refined nose  when you have been for several months on short allowance when you have scraped every shred of meat off the very last bones of your provisions and sucked out the last drop of marrow and then roasted and eaten your spare boots you may perhaps be in a position to estimate and enjoy a morsel of raw blubber  regardless of time place and circumstance our poor wanderer continued to chew until in his great weakness he fell into a sort of half slumber and dreameddreamed of feasting on viands more delightful than the waking imagination of man has ever conceived  from this state of bliss he was rudely awakened by a roughish poke in the back  the poke was accompanied by a snuffing sound which caused the blood of the poor man to curdle  could it be a bear  he was not left long in doubt  after giving him another poke on the shoulder the creature walked round him snuffing as it went and on reaching the airhole already referred to thrust its snout in and snorted  rooney turned his face aside to avoid the blast but otherwise lay quite still knowing well that whatever animal his visitor might be his only hope lay in absolute inaction  venturing in a few seconds to turn his face round and peep through the opening he found that the animal was in very deed a large white bear which having found and abstracted the remains of the blubber he had been chewing was at that moment licking its lips after swallowing it  of course finding the morsel satisfactory the bear returned to the hole for more  it is easier to conceive than to describe the poor mans feelings at that moment therefore we leave the reader to conceive them  the natural and desperate tendency to spring up and defend himself had to be combated by the certain knowledge that encased as he was he could not spring up and had nothing wherewith to defend himself except his fingers which were no match for the claws of a polar bear  the blood which a moment before had begun apparently to curdle now seemed turned into liquid fire and when the snout again entered and touched his own he could contain himself no longer but gave vent to a yell which caused the startled bear to draw sharply back in alarm probably it had never heard a yell through the medium of its nose before and every one must know how strong is the influence of a new sensation  for some minutes the monster stood in silent contemplation of the mysterious hole  rooney of course lay perfectly still  the success of his involuntary explosion encouraged hope  what the bear might have done next we cannot tell for at that moment a shout was heard  it was followed by what seemed a succession of pistol shots and the howling of dogs  it was the arrival of okiok on the scene with his sledge and team  never was an arrival more opportune  the bear looked round with a distinct expression of indignation on his countenance  possibly the voice of okiok was familiar to him  it may be that relations or friends of that bear had mysteriously disappeared after the sounding of that voice  perhaps the animal in whose skin rooney was encased had been a brother  at all events the increasing hullabaloo of the approaching eskimo had the effect of intimidating the animal for it retired quickly though with evident sulkiness from the scene  a few seconds more and okiok dashed up leaped from his vehicle left the panting team to the control of norrak and ran eagerly to the prostrate figure  unwrapping the head so as to set it free the eskimo saw with intense satisfaction that the kablunet was still alive  he called at once to norrak who fetched from the sledge a platter made of a seals shoulderblade on which was a mass of cooked food  this he presented to the starving man who with a look of intense gratitude but with no words eagerly ate it up  the eskimo and his son meanwhile stood looking at him with an expression of mingled interest awe and surprise on their round faces  when the meal was ended red rooney heaving a deep sigh of satisfaction said thank god and thank you my friends  there was reason for the increase of surprise with which this was received by the two natives for this time the foreigner spoke to them in their own language  is the kablunet a messenger from heaven asked okiok with increased solemnity that he speaks with the tongue of the innuit  no my friend replied rooney with a faint smile i bring no message either from heaven or anywhere else  im only a wrecked seaman  but after a fashion you are messengers from heaven to me and the message you bring is that im not to die just yet  if it had not been for you my friends it strikes me i should have been dead by this time  as to my speaking your lingo its no mystery  ive learned it by livin a long time wi the traders in the south of greenland and i suppose ive got a sort o talent that way dye see  red rooney delivered these remarks fluently in a curious sort of eskimo language but we have rendered it into that kind of english which the wrecked seaman was in the habit of usingchiefly because by so doing we shall give the reader a more correct idea of the character of the man  we are very glad to see you returned okiok  we have heard of you for many moons  we have wished for you very hard  now you have come we will treat you well  are your huts far off asked the seaman anxiously  not far  they are close to the icemountainon the land  take me to them then like a good fellow for im deadbeat and stand much in need of rest  the poor man was so helpless that he could not walk to the sledge when they unrolled him  it seemed as if his power of will and energy had collapsed at the very moment of his rescue  up to that time the fear of death had urged him on but now feeling that he was comparatively speaking safe he gave way to the languor which had so long oppressed him and thus the impulse of the will being removed he suddenly became as helpless as an infant  seeing his condition the father and son lifted him on the sledge wrapped him in skins and drove back to the huts at full speed  nuna was awaiting them outside with eager eyes and beating heart for the discovery of a real live kablunet was to her an object of as solemn and anxious curiosity as the finding of a veritable living ghost might be to a civilised man  but nuna was not alone  there were two other members of the household present who had been absent when okiok first arrived and whom we will now introduce to the reader  one was nunas only daughter an exceedingly pretty girlaccording to eskimo notions of female beauty  she was seventeen years of age blackeyed healthilycomplexioned roundfaced sweetexpressioned comfortably stout and unusually gracefulfor an eskimo  among her other charms modesty and goodnature shone conspicuous  she was in all respects a superior counterpart of her mother and her name was nunaga nuna was small nunaga was smaller  nuna was comparatively young nunaga was necessarily younger  the former was kind the latter was kinder  the mother was graceful and pretty the daughter was more graceful and prettier  nuna wore her hair gathered on the top of her head into a high topknot nunaga wore a higher topknot  in regard to costume nuna wore sealskin boots the whole length of her legswhich were not longand a frock or skirt reaching nearly to her knees with a short tail in front and a long tail behind nunaga being similarly clothed had a shorter tail in front and a longer tail behind  it may be interesting to note here that eskimos are sometimes named because of qualities possessed or appearance or peculiar circumstances connected with them  the word nuna signifies land in eskimo  we cannot tell why this particular lady was named land unless it were that she was born on the land and not on the ice or perhaps because she was so nice that when any man came into her company he might have thought that he had reached the land of his hopes and was disposed to settle down there and remain  certainly many of the eskimo young men seemed to be of that mind until okiok carried her off in triumph  and let us tell you reader that a good and pretty woman is as much esteemed among the eskimos as among ourselves  we do not say that she is better treated neither do we hint that she is sometimes treated worse  the eskimo word nunaga signifies my land and was bestowed by okiok on his eldestborn in a flood of tenderness at her birth  apologising for this philological digression we proceed  besides nuna and nunaga there was a baby boya fat oily contented boywithout a name at that time and without a particle of clothing of any sort his proper condition of heat being maintained when out of doors chiefly by being carried between his mothers dress and her shoulders also by being stuffed to repletion with blubber  the whole family cried out vigorously with delight in various keys when the team came yelping home with the kablunet  even the baby gave a joyous crowin eskimo  but the exclamations were changed to pity when the kablunet was assisted to rise and staggered feebly towards the hut even when supported by okiok and his sons  the sailor was not ignorant of eskimo ways  his residence in south greenland had taught him many things  he dropped therefore quite naturallyindeed gladlyon his hands and knees on coming to the mouth of the tunnel and crept slowly into the hut followed by the whole family except ermigit who was left to unfasten the dogs  the weather at the time was by no means cold for spring was rapidly advancing nevertheless to one who had been so reduced in strength the warmth of the eskimo hut was inexpressibly grateful  with a great sigh of relief the rescued man flung himself on the raised part of the floor on which eskimos are wont to sit and sleep  thank god and again i thank you my friends he said repeating the phrase which he had already used for the sudden change from despair to hope from all but death to restored life had filled his heart with gratitude  you are weary said okiok  ay ayvery weary wellnigh to death he replied  will the kablunet sleep asked nuna pointing to a couch of skins close behind the seaman  rooney looked round  thankee yes i will  he crept to the couch and dropped upon it with his head resting on an eiderdown pillow  like a tired infant his eyes closed and he was asleep almost instantaneously  seeing this the eskimos began to move about with care and to speak in whispers though it was needless caution for in his condition the man would probably have continued to sleep through the wildest thunderstorm even when baby tumbling headlong off the elevated floor narrowly missed spiking himself on a walrus spear and set up a yell that might have startled the stone deaf the wearied kablunet did not move  okiok did however  he moved smartly towards the infant caught him by the throat and almost strangled him in a fierce attempt to keep him quiet  stupid tumbler he growledreferring to the childs general and awkward habit of fallingcant you shut your mouth  curious similarity between the thoughts and words of civilised and savage man in similar circumstances  and it is interesting to note the truth of what the song says  we little know what great things from little things may rise  from that slight incident the eskimo child derived his future name of tumbler  we forget what the precise eskimo term is but the english equivalent will do as well  when suppertime arrived that night okiok and nuna consulted as to whether they should waken their guest or let him lie stillfor from the instant he lay down he had remained without the slightest motion save the slow regular heaving of his broad chest  let him sleep  he is tired said okiok  but he must be hungry and he is weak said nuna  he can feed when he wakens returned the man admiring his guest as a collector might admire a foreign curiosity which he had just found  kablunets sleep sounder than eskimos remarked the woman  stupid one  your head is thick like the skull of the walrus said the man  dont you see that it is because he is wornout  eskimos are singularly simple and straightforward in their speech  they express their opinions with the utmost candour and without the slightest intention of hurting each others feelings  nuna took no offence at her husbands plain speaking but continued to gaze with a gratified expression at the stranger  and sooth to say reginald rooney was a pleasant object for contemplation as well as a striking contrast to the men with whom nuna had been hitherto associated  his brow was broad the nose which had been compared to the eagles beak was in reality a fine aquiline the mouth although partially concealed by a brown drooping moustache was well formed large and firm the beard bushy and the hair voluminous as well as curly  altogether this poor castaway was as fine a specimen of a british tar as one could wish to see despite his wasted condition and his unbritish garb  it was finally decided to leave him undisturbed and the eskimo family took care while supping to eat their food in comparative silence usually the evening meal was a noisy hilarious festival at which okiok and norrak and ermigit were wont to relate the various incidents of the days hunt with more or less of exaggeration not unmingled with fun and only a little of that shameless boasting which is too strong a characteristic of the north american indian  the women of the household were excellent listeners also splendid laughers and tumbler was unrivalled in the matter of crowing so that noise as well as feasting was usually the order of the night  but on this great occasion that was all changed  the feasting was done in dead silence and another very striking peculiarity of the occasion was that while the six pairs of jaws kept moving with unflagging pertinacity the twelve wideopen eyes kept glaring with unwinking intensity at the sleeping man  indeed this unwavering glare continued long after supper was over for each member of the family lay down to rest with his or her face towards the stranger and kept up the glare until irresistible nature closed the lids and thus put out the eyes like the stars of morning one by one perhaps it would be more strictly correct to say two by two  okiok and his wife were the last to succumb  long after the others were buried in slumber these two sat up by the lamplight solacing themselves with little scraps and titbits of walrus during the intervals of whispered conversation  what shall we do with him asked okiok after a brief silence  keep him replied nuna with decision  but we cannot force him to stay  he cannot travel alone said nuna and we will not help him to go  we are not the only innuits in all the land  others will help him if we refuse  this was so obvious that the woman could not reply but gazed for some time in perplexity at the lampsmoke  and really there was much inspiration to be derived from the lampsmoke for the wick being a mass of moss steeped in an open cup of sealoil the smoke of it rose in varied convolutions that afforded almost as much scope for suggestive contemplation as our familiar coalfires  suddenly the little woman glanced at her slumbering household cast a meaning look at her husband and laughedsilently of course  has nuna become a fool that she laughs at nothing demanded okiok simply  instead of replying to the wellmeant though impolite question nuna laughed again and looked into the dark corner where the pretty little round face of nunaga was dimly visible with the eyes shut and the little mouth wideopen  we will marry him to nunaga she said suddenly becoming grave  pooh exclaimed okiokor some expression equivalent to thatmarry nunaga to a kablunet  never  do you not know that angut wants her  it was evident from the look of surprise with which nuna received this piece of information that she was not aware of anguts aspirations and it was equally evident from the perplexed expression that followed that her hastilyconceived little matrimonial speculation had been knocked on the head  after this their thoughts either strayed into other channels or became too deep for utterance for they conversed no more but soon joined the rest of the family in the realms of oblivion    chapter three  our hero and his friends become familiar  it was a fine balmy brilliant morning when red rooney awoke from the most refreshing sleep he had enjoyed for many a day gazed thoughtfully up at the blackened roof of the eskimo hut and wondered where he was  there was nothing that met his eyes to recall his scattered senses for all the members of the family had gone out to their various avocations and one of them having thrust a sealskin into the hole in the wall which served for a window the sun found admittance only through crevices and but faintly illumined the interior  the poor man felt intensely weak yet delightfully restfulso much so that mere curiosity seemed to have died within him and he was content to lie still and think of whatever his wayward mind chose to fasten on or not to think at all if his mind saw fit to adopt that course in its vagaries  in short he felt as if he had no more control over his thoughts than a man in a dream and was quite satisfied that it should be so  as his eyes became accustomed to the dim light however he began slowly to perceive that the walls around him were made of rough unhewn stone that the rafters were of drift timber and the roof of moss or something like it but the whole was so thickly coated with soot as to present a uniform appearance of blackness  he also saw from the position in which he lay a stone vessel like a primitive classical lamp with a wick projecting from its lip but no flame  several skulls of large animals lay on the floor within the range of his vision and some sealskin and other garments hung on pegs of bone driven into the wall  just opposite to him was the entrance to the tunnel which formed the passage or corridor of the mansion and within it gleamed a subdued light which entered from the outer end  rooney knew that he saw these things and took note of them yet if you had asked him what he had seen it is probable that he would have been unable to tellso near had he approached to the confines of that land from which no traveller returns  heaving a deep sigh the man uttered the words thank god for the third time within the last fourandtwenty hours  it was an appropriate prelude to his sinking into that mysterious region of oblivion in which the mind of wornout man finds rest and out of which it can be so familiarly yet mysteriously summonedsometimes by his own predetermination but more frequently by a fellowmortal  he had not lain long thus when the tunnel was suddenly darkened by an advancing body which proved to be the mistress of the mansion  nuna on thrusting her head into the interior looked inquiringly up before venturing to rise  after a good stare at the slumbering kablunet she went cautiously towards the window and removed the obstruction  a flood of light was let in which illumined but did not awaken the sleeper  cautiously and on tiptoe the considerate little woman went about her household duties but with her eyes fixed as if in fascination on her interesting guest  it is at all times an awkward as well as a dangerous mode of proceeding to walk in one direction and look in another  in crossing the hut nuna fell over a walrus skull upset the lamp and sent several other articles of furniture against the opposite wall with a startling crash the poor creature did not rise  she was too much overwhelmed with shame  she merely turned her head as she lay and cast a horrified gaze at the sleeper  to her great joy she saw that red rooney had not been disturbed  he slept through it all with the placidity of an infant  much relieved the little woman got up and moved about more freely  she replenished the lamp with oil and kindled it  then she proceeded to roast and fry and grill bear ribs seal chops and walrus steaks with a dexterity that was quite marvellous considering the rude culinary implements with which she had to deal  in a short time breakfast was prepared and nuna went out to announce the fact  slowly and with the utmost caution each member of the family crept in and before rising cast the same admiring inquiring partially awestricken gaze at the unconscious kablunet  okiok nunaga norrak ermigit and tumbler all filed in and sat down in solemn silence  okiok took tumbler on his knee so as to be ready to throttle him on the shortest notice if he should venture to cry or even crow  but as the best of human arrangements often fail through unforeseen circumstances so the quietude was broken a second time that morning unexpectedly  one of the hungry dogs outside rendered desperate by the delicious fumes that issued from the hut took heart dashed in caught up a mass of blubber and attempted to make off  a walrus rib however from norraks unerring hand caught him on the haunch as he entered the tunnel and caused him to utter such a piercing howl that red rooney not only awoke but sat bolt upright and gazed at the horrified eskimos inquiringly  evidently the seaman was touched with a sense of the ludicrous for he merely smiled and lay down again  but he did not try to sleep  having been by that time thoroughly refreshed he began to sniff the scent of savoury food as the warhorse is said to scent the battle from afar that is with an intense longing to go at it  okiok guessing the state of his feelings brought him a walrus rib  red rooney accepted it and began to eat at once without the use of knife or fork  thankee friend  its the same ill do for yourself if you ever come to starvation point when ive got a crust to spare  charmed beyond measure at hearing their native tongue from the mouth of a foreigner the stare of the whole party became more intense and for a few moments they actually ceased to chewa sure sign that they were so to speak transfixed with interest  my man said rooney after a few minutes intense application to the rib what is your name  okiok replied the eskimo  okiok muttered the seaman to himself in english why thats the eskimo word for winter  then after a few minutes further attention to the rib why did they name you after the cold season o the year  i know not said okiok  when my father named me i was very small and could not ask his reason  he never told any one  before i was old enough to ask a bear killed him  my mother thought it was because the winter when i was born was very cold and long  again the hungry man applied himself to the rib and nothing more was said till it was finished  feeling still somewhat fatigued rooney settled himself among his furs in a more upright position and gave his attention to the natives who instantly removed their eyes from him and resumed eating with a will  of course they could not restrain furtive glances but they had ceased to stare  in a few minutes okiok paused and in turn became the questioner  no kablunet ever came here before he said  we are glad to see you but why do you come and why alone and why starving  not very easy to answer these questions offhand to the likes of you said rooney  however ill try  youve heard of the settlementsthe tradersno doubt in the faroff land over there  rooney pointed to the southward the direction of which he knew from the position of the sun and the time of day which latter he guessed roughly  the eskimo nodded  from the special character of the nod it was evident that he meant it to express intelligence  and it did  well continued rooney you may have heard that big bigtremendous bigkayaks or rather oomiaks have come to that country an landed men and women who have built housesigloosand have settled there to trade  at this his host nodded with such decision and so frequently as to show that he not only knew of the kablunet settlements but was deeply interested in them and would be glad to know something more  well then continued the sailor i came out from a great and rich country called england in one o these big tradin canoes which was wrecked close to the settlements and there i stayed with my mates waiting for another big kayak to come an take us off but no kayak came for two wintersso thats the way i came to understand an speak the eskimo  at this point as if it could endure the strangers voice no longer tumbler set up a sudden and tremendous howl  he was instantly seized half strangled metaphorically sat upon and reduced to sobbing silence when the sailor resumed his narrative  all that time i was workin off and on for the  he stopped abruptly not having any words in the native language by which to name the moravian missionaries  the eskimos waited with eager looks for the next word  well well resumed rooney with a pathetic smile it is a pity the whole world dont speak one language  i was workin for forthese kablunets who have come to greenland thats the name weve given to your country you must knowwho have come to greenland not to trade but to teach men about godabout torngarsuk the good spiritwho made all the world and men and beasts  at this point the interest of okiok became if possible more intense  do the kablunets know god the good spirit  have they seen him he asked  they havent exactly seen him replied the sailor but they have got a book a writing which tells about him and they know something of his nature and his wishes  of course this reference to a book and a writingwhich rooney had learned to speak of from the moravianswas quite incomprehensible to the eskimo  he understood enough of what was said however to see the drift of his visitors meaning  huk he exclaimed with a look of satisfaction angut will be glad to hear this  who is angut asked the sailor  the whole party looked peculiarly solemn at this question  angut is a great angekok answered okiok in a low voice  oh he is one of your wise men is he returned rooney with an involuntary shrug of his shoulders for he had heard and seen enough during his residence at the settlements to convince him that the angekoks or sorcerers or wise men of the eskimos were mostly a set of clever charlatans like the medicinemen of the north american indians who practised on the credulity and superstition of their fellowmen in order to gain their own ends  some of these angekoks no doubt were partly selfdeceivers believing to some extent the deceptions which they practised and desiring more or less the welfare of their dupes but others were thorough as well as clever rogues whose sole object was selfinterest  well then continued rooney after id been two winters with these kablunets another big kayak came to the settlement not to trade nor to teach about god but to go as far as they could into the ice and try to discover new lands  poor men remarked okiok pitifully had they no lands of their own  o yes they had lands at home replied the sailor laughing  huk exclaimed several of the natives glancing at each other with quite a pleased expression  it was evident that they were relieved as well as glad to find that their visitor could laugh for his worn and woebegone expression which was just beginning to disappear under the influence of rest and food had induced the belief that he could only go the length of smiling  yes continued the sailor they had lands more or lesssome of them at leastand some of them had money but you must know okiok that however much a kablunet may have he always wants more  is he never content asked the eskimo  never at least not often  wonderful exclaimed okiok when i am stuffed with sealblubber as full as i can hold i want nothing more  again the sailor laughed and there was something so hearty and jovial in the sound that it became infectious and the natives joined him though quite ignorant of the exciting cause  even tumbler took advantage of the occasion to give vent to another howl which having something of the risible in it was tolerated  when silence was restored the visitor resumed  i joined these searchers as they wanted an interpreter and we came away north here  nothing particular happened at first  we had a deal of squeezing an bumping in the ice of course but got little damage till about six days back i think or thereabouts when we got a nip that seemed to me to cut the bottom clean out o the big kayak for when the ice eased off again it went straight to the bottom  we had only time to throw some provisions on the ice and jump out before it went down  as our provisions were not sufficient to last more than a few days i was sent off with some men over the floe to hunt for seals  we only saw one asleep near its hole  bein afraid that the sailors might waken it i told them to wait and i would go after it alone  they agreed but i failed  the seal was lively  he saw me before i got near enough and dived into his hole  on returnin to where i had left the men i found a great split in the ice which cut me off from them  the space widened  i had no small kayak to take me across  it was too cold to swim  the floe on which my comrades stood was driftin along wi the big floe where the rest of them were  the ice on which i stood was fast  a breeze was blowin at the time which soon carried the pack away  in an hour they were out of sight and i saw them no more  i knew that it was landice on which i stood and also that the coast could not be far off but the hummocks and the snowdrift prevented me from seein far in any direction  i knew also that death would be my portion if i remained where i was so i set off straight for land as fast as i could go  how long ive been on the way i cant tell for i dont feel quite sure and latterly my brain has got into a confused state  i had a small piece of seal meat in my pouch when i started when it was done i cut a strip off my sealskin coat an sucked that  it just kept body and soul together  at last i saw the land but fell and should have died there if the good spirit had not sent you to save me okiokso give us a shake of your hand old boy  to this narrative the natives listened with breathless attention but at the conclusion okiok looked at the extended hand in surprise not knowing what was expected of him  seeing this rooney leaned forward grasped the mans right hand shook it warmly patted it on the back then raising it to his lips kissed it  stupid indeed would the man have been and unusually savage who could have failed to understand that friendship and goodwill lay in these actions  but okiok was not stupid  on the contrary he was brightly intelligent and being somewhat humorous in addition he seized rooneys hand instantly after and repeated the operation with a broad smile on his beaming face  then turning suddenly to tumbler he grasped and shook that naked infants hand as it sat on the floor in a pool of oil from a lamp which it had overturned  an explosion of laughter from everybody showed that the little joke was appreciated but okiok became suddenly grave and sobered his family instantly as he turned to rooney and said  i wish that angut had been there  he would have saved your big oomiak and all the men  indeed  is he then such a powerful angekok  yes very very powerful  there never was an angekok like him  i suppose not returned rooney with a feeling of doubt which however he took care to hide  what like is this great wise manvery big i suppose  no he is not big but he is not small  he is middling and very strong like the bear very active and supple like the seal or the white fox and very swift like the deerand very different from other angekoks  he must be a fine man said the sailor becoming interested in this angekok tell me wherein he differs from others  he is not only strong and wise but he is good and he cares nothing for our customs or for the ways of other angekoks  he says that they are all lies and nonsense  yes he even says that he is not an angekok at all but we know better for he is  everybody can see that he is he knows everything he can do anything  do i not speak what is true  he turned to his wife and daughter as he spoke  thus appealed to nuna said it was all true and nunaga said it was all very true and blushedand really for an eskimo she looked quite pretty  dont laugh good reader at the idea of an eskimo blushing  depend upon it that that is one of those touches of nature which prove the kinship of the world everywhere  while they were talking a step was heard outside and the eskimos looked intelligently at each other  they knew that the comer must be a friend because had he been a stranger the dogs would have given notice of his approach  besides these animals were heard fawning round him as he spoke to them  ujarak exclaimed okiok in a low voice  is ujarak a friend asked the sailor  he is an angekok said the eskimo evasivelya great angekok but not so great as angut  another moment and a man was seen to creep into the tunnel  standing up when inside he proved to be a tall powerful eskimo with a not unhandsome but stern countenance which was somewhat marred by a deep scar over the left eye    chapter four  okiok becomes simple but deep and the wizard tries to make capital out of events  of course ujarak wise man though he was esteemed to be could not help being struck dumb by the unexpected sight of the gaunt foreigner indeed having so long held supposed intercourse with familiar spirits it is not improbable that he imagined that one of them had at last come without waiting for a summons to punish him because of his deceptive practices for he turned paleor rather faintly greenand breathed hard  perceiving his state it suddenly occurred to the sailor to saydont be afraid  i wont hurt you  he inadvertently said it in english however so that ujarak was none the wiser  who is he demanded the angekokperhaps it were more correct to call him wizard  okiok expecting rooney to reply looked at him but a spirit of silence seemed to have come over the stranger for he made no reply but shut his eyes as if he had dropped asleep  he is a kablunet said okiok  i could see that even if i had not the double sight of the angekok replied the other with a touch of sarcasm for eskimos although by no means addicted to quarrelling are very fond of satire  they are also prone to go straight to the point in conversation and although fond of similes and figurative language they seldom indulge in bombast  with much solemnity okiok rejoined that he had no doubt of ujaraks being aware that the man was a kablunet  and i am glad you have come he added for of course you can also tell me where the kablunet has come from and whither he is going  the angekok glanced at his host quickly for he knewat least he strongly suspectedthat he was one of that uncomfortable class of sceptics who refuse to swallow without question all that selfconstituted wise men choose to tell them  okiok was gazing at him however with an air of the most infantine simplicity and deference  i cannot tell you that replied the wizard because i have not consulted my torngak about him  it must be explained here that each angekok has a private spirit or familiar whose business it is to enlighten him on all points and conduct him on his occasional visits to the land of spirits  this familiar is styled his torngak  did your torngak tell you that he was a kablunet asked okiok simply so simply that there was no room for ujarak to take offence  no my eyes told me that  i did not know that you had ever seen a kablunet returned the other with a look of surprise  nor have i  but have i not often heard them described by the men of the south and has not my torngak showed them to me in dreams  the wizard said this somewhat tartly and okiok feeling that he had gone far enough turned away his sharp little eyes and gazed at the lampsmoke with an air of profound humility  you have got sealflesh said ujarak glad to change the subject  yes i killed it yesterday  you are hungry  nuna will give you some  no i am not hungry  nevertheless i will eat  it is good to eat at all times  except when we are stuffed quite full murmured okiok casting at nunaga a sly glance which threw that eskimo maiden into what strongly resembled a suppressed giggle  it was catching for her brothers norrak and ermigit were thrown into a similar condition and even the baby crowed out of sympathy  indeed red rooney himself who only simulated sleep found it difficult to restrain his feelings for he began to understand okioks character and to perceive that he was more than a match for the wizard with all his wisdom  whatever ujarak may have felt he revealed nothing for he possessed that wellknown quality of the eskimothe power to restrain and conceal his feelingsin a high degree  with a quiet patronising smile he bent down in quite a loverlike way and asked nunaga if the sealflesh was good  yes it is good very good answered the maiden looking modestly down and toying with the end of her tail  you see she had no scentbottle or fan to toy with  to be sure she had glovesthick sealskin mittensbut these were not available at the moment  i knew you had a seal said the angekok pausing between bites after the edge of his appetite had been taken off my torngak told me you had found one at last  did he tell you that i had also found a bear asked okiok with deeper simplicity than ever  the wizard without raising his head and stuffing his mouth full to prevent the power of speech glanced keenly about the floor  observing the fresh skin in a corner and one or two ribs he bolted the bite and said  o yes  my torngak is kind he tells me many things without being asked  he said to me two days ago okiok is a clever man  though all the people are starving just now he has killed a seal and a bear  can torngaks make mistakes asked okiok with a puzzled look  it was yesterday that i killed the seal and the bear  torngaks never make mistakes was the wizards prompt and solemn reply but they see and know the future as well as the past and they sometimes speak of both as the present  how puzzling returned the other meekly  he meant you then to understand that i was going to kill a seal and a bear  glad am i that i am not an angekok for it would be very difficult work for a stupid manenough almost to kill him  you are right  it is difficult and hard work  so you see the torngak told me go feast with okiok and at his bidding of course i have come on purpose to do so  thats a lie  you came to see my nunaga and you hope to get her but you never will said okiok  he said it only to himself however being far too polite to say it to his guest to whom he replied deferentially  if they are starving at your village why did you not bring your mother and your father  they would have been welcome for a seal and a bear would be enough to stuff us all quite full and leave something to send to the rest  for some minutes the wizard did not reply  perhaps he was meditating perchance inventing  i brought no one he said at last because i want you and your family to return with me to the village  you know it is only two days distant and we can take the seal and the bear with us  we are going to have a great feast and games  did you not say the people were starving asked okiok with a look of gentle surprise  they were starving returned ujarak quickly but two walruses and four seals were brought in yesterday and my torngak has told me that he will point out where many more are to be found if i consult him on the night of the feast  will you come back with me  okiok glanced at the kablunet  i cannot leave my guest he said  true but we can take him with us  impossible  do you not see he is only bones in a bag of skin  he must rest and feed  that will be no difficulty returned the wizard for the feast is not to be held for twice seven days  by that time the kablunet will be well and getting strong  of course he must rest and be well stuffed just now  so i will go back and say that you are coming and tell them also what you have founda kablunet  huk  yes and he speaks our language said okiok  that was not our language which he spoke when i came in  no yet he speaks it  i should like to hear him speak  you must not wake him said okiok with an assumed look of horror he would be sure to kill you with a look or a breath if you did  see he moves  rooney certainly did move at the moment for the conversation had tickled him a good deal and the last remark was almost too much for him  not wishing however to let the angekok go without some conversation he conveniently awoke yawned and stretched himself  in the act he displayed an amount of bone and sinew if not flesh which made a very favourable impression on the eskimos for physical strength and capacity is always and naturally rated highly among savages  our shipwrecked hero had now heard and seen enough to understand something of the character of the men with whom he had to deal  he went therefore direct to the point without introduction or ceremony by asking the angekok who he was and where he came from  after catechising him closely he then sought to establish a kind of superiority over him by voluntarily relating his own story as we have already given it and thus preventing his being questioned in return by the wizard  now said red rooney in conclusion when you go home to your village tell the people that the kablunet having been nearly starved must have some days to get well  he will stay with his friend okiok and rest till he is strong  then he will go to your village with his friends and join in the feast and games  there was a quiet matterofcourse tone of command about the seaman which completely overawed the poor angekok inducing him to submit at once to the implied superiority though hitherto accustomed to carry matters with a high hand among his compatriots  his selfesteem however was somewhat compensated by the fact that he should be the bearer of such wonderful news to his people and by the consideration that he could say his torngak had told him of the arrival of the kablunetan assertion which they would believe all the more readily that he had left home with some mysterious statements that something wonderful was likely to be discovered  in truth this astute wizard never failed to leave some such prediction behind him every time he quitted home so as to prepare the people for whatever might occur and should nothing occur he could generally manage to colour some event or incident with sufficient importance to make it fulfil the prediction at least in some degree  when at last he rose to depart ujarak turned to nunaga  as her father had rightly guessed the wizard who was quite a young man had come there on matrimonial views intent and he was not the man to leave the main purpose of his journey unattempted  nunaga he said in a comparatively low yet sufficiently audible voice my sledge is large  it is too large for one  he was interrupted suddenly at this point by rooney who saw at once what was coming  okiok he said i want nunaga to mend and patch my torn garments for the next few days  her mother has enough to do with cooking and looking after the house  can you spare her for that work  yes okiok could spare her and was very glad to do all that he could to accommodate the foreigner  will ujarak carry a message from the kablunet to his village asked rooney turning to the wizard  he will replied the latter somewhat sulkily  does he know the angekok named angut  it is doubtful whether anger or surprise was most strongly expressed in the countenance of the eskimo as he replied sternly yes  then tell him that the kablunet will stay in his hut when he visits your village  having delivered this message he turned his face to the wall and without awaiting a reply coolly went to sleep or appeared to do so while ujarak went off with a storm of very mingled feelings harrowing his savage breast  when he was gone red rooney raised himself on one elbow and looked over his shoulder at okiok with a broad grin  okiok who felt grave enough at the moment and somewhat perplexed opened his eyes gradually and reciprocated the smile with interest  by degrees he closed the eyes and allowed the smile to develop into a high falsetto chuckle which convulsed his broad hairy shoulders for full five minutes  from that hour okiok and the kablunet were united  they understood each other  the chords of sympathetic humour had vibrated within them in harmony  they were thenceforward en rapport and felt towards each other like brothers or rather like father and son for okiok was fortyfive years of age at least while rooney was not yet thirty  hes a very bad man is he not asked the seaman when the heaving of the shoulders had subsided  ho yes  bad bad very bad  he lies and steals and cheats and talks nonsense and wants nunaga for a wife  and you dont want him for a son  novery decidedly  rooney laughed and turning away with a wink and a nod lay down to sleepthis time in earnest  okiok responded with a falsetto chuckle after which he proceeded to solace himself with a mass of halfcooked blubber  observing that tumbler was regarding him with longing looks he goodnaturedly cut off part of the savoury morsel and handed it to the child  it is wellknown that the force of example is strong stronger than that of precept  in a few minutes the entire family set to work again on the viands with as much gusto as though they had eaten little or nothing for a week  leaving them thus pleasantly and profitably occupied let us follow ujarak to his village  every man and woman of superior intelligence in this world has probably one blind worshipper if not moresome weak brother who admires believes in perhaps envies but always bows to the demigod  such a worshipper had ujarak in ippegoo a tall young man of weak physical frame and still weaker mental capacity  ippegoo was not malevolent like his master but he was sufficiently wicked to laugh at his evil doings and to assist him in his various plans in the implicit belief that he was aiding a great and wise man he did so all the more readily that he himself aimed at the high and dignified office of an angekok an aspiration which had at first been planted in him and afterwards been carefully encouraged by his deceiver because it made his dupe if possible a blinder and more willing tool  ippegoo said ujarak on drawing near to the outskirts of his village and coming unexpectedly on his satellite who was in the act of dragging home a seal which he had just killed i meet you in the nick of time but that is no wonder for did not my torngak tell me he would cause you to meet me near the village  i want your assistance just now  i am glad then that we have met said ippegoo with a cringing motion not unlike a bowthough of the ceremonial bow the eskimos have no knowledge  yes strange things have happened continued the angekok rolling his eyes impressively  did i not tell you before i started to visit okiok that strange things would happen  ippegoo who had a good deal of straightforward simplicity in his nature looked puzzled and tried hard to recollect what ujarak had told him  you will never make an angekok said ujarak with a look of displeasure if you do not rouse up your memory more  do you not remember when i whispered to you in a dream last night that strange things were going to happen  o yeeesin a dream yes i remember now returned the satellite in some confusion yet with a good deal of faith for he was a heavy feeder and subject to nightmares so that it was not difficult to imagine the whisper which had been suggested to him  yes you remember now stupid walrus  well then what was the strange thing like  ujarak looked awfully solemn while he put this question  what was it like repeated the poor youth with hesitation and an uneasy glance at the sky as if for inspiration  whatwasitoh i remember it was bigbig very bigso high holding his hand up about seven feet from the ice  no ippegoo not so big  he was about my size  dont you remember and he was pale with hair twisted into little rings all over his head and  yes yes and a nose as long as my leg interrupted the eager pupil  not at all stupid puffin  a nose no longer than your own and much bettershaped  the angekok said this so sternly that the too willing ippegoo collapsed and looked as he felt superlatively humble  now go resumed ujarak with an unrelaxed brow go tell your story to the people assembled in the big hut  they feast there tonight i know tell them what your dream has revealed  tell them how i spoke to you before i left the villagebut dont be too particular in your description  let that belike your own mindconfused and then it will be true to nature  tell them also that you expect me soon but say not that you have met me today for that might displease my torngak whom i go to consult  without giving his pupil time to reply the wizard strode off and disappeared among the ice hummocks as a bad actor might strut behind the side scenes  deeply impressed with the solemnity of the whole affair and with the importance of his mission the young eskimo went off to the village dragging his seal behind him and wondering what new discovery had been made by his mysterious patron  that something of unusual import had occurred he never doubted for although he had often seen ujarak with unbounded admiration wriggle out of unfulfilled prophecy like an eel he had never seen him give way to demonstrations such as we have described without something real and surprising turning up ere long  strong in this faith he ran into the large hut where a considerable party of his tribe were feasting on a recently captured walrus and told them that something tremendous something marrowthrilling had occurred to the great angekok ujarak who before leaving the village had told him that he was going off to find aasomethinghe knew not exactly whatwith rings of hair all over its body pale as the icefloe more wonderful than the streaming lightsincomprehensibleimmense  at this point he glared and became dumb  not knowing well what to say next he judiciously remained silent then sat down and gasped while the united company exclaimed huk with unusual emphasis  the consultation which ujarak had with his torngak was somewhat peculiar  it consisted chiefly in a wild run at full speed out upon the floes  having pretty well exhausted himself by this device and brought on profuse perspiration he turned homewards  drawing near to the village he flung back his hood ran his fingers through his long black hair until it was wildly dishevelled then springing suddenly into the midst of the festive party he overturned feasters right and left as he made his way to the part of the edifice furthest from the door  a close observer might have noted however that there was method in his madness for he overturned only women and children and kept carefully clear of menat least of such men as he knew would resent his roughness  wheeling suddenly round and facing the solemnised assembly he addressed it as if with difficulty in a lowtoned awesome voice    chapter five  plots and counterplots already  it is not necessary neither would it be profitable to give in full detail what ujarak said to the gaping crowd  enough to know that like other statesmen he made the most of his subject and fully impressed his audience with the belief that this first of kablunets who had ever visited these icebound regions had been mysteriously yet irresistibly drawn there through his ujaraks influence with the assistance of his torngak or familiar spirit  one man there was in that assembly however who seemed to be not very deeply touched by the wizards eloquence  yet he did not express unbelief by his looks but received all that was said with profound gravity  this was angut the reputed angekok to whom reference has been made in a previous chapter  although a thorough eskimo in dress and in cast of feature there was a refinement a gravity a kindliness and a something quite indescribable about this man which marked him out as an exceptional character among his fellows  as we have said elsewhere he was not unusually large though he was unusually strong for his power lay rather in a wellknit and splendidly proportioned than a bulky frame ujarak was taller and broader yet did not possess half his muscular strength  ujarak knew this and had hitherto avoided coming into collision with him  but there was also a moral strength and enthusiasm in angut which placed him on a platform high above not only ujarak but all the other men of his time and country  in short he was one of those farseeing and thoughtful characters who exist in all countries in all ranks and conditions of life civilised and savage and who are sometimes styled natures gentlemen  despite his surroundings temptations examples trials and worries angut was at all times unvaryingly urbane kind sedate equable obliging honest and selfsacrificing  it mattered not that other men spoke freelysometimes even a little boastfullyof their exploits angut never did so of his although no other man could hold a candle perhaps we should say a lampto him in the matter of daring  it signified not that eskimos in general were in the habit of treating friendless widows and orphans ill even robbing as well as neglecting them angut always treated well those with whom he had to do  other men might neglect people in distress but he helped and defended them and it was a matter of absolute indifference to him what people thought of his conduct  there is a modified mrs grundy even in eskimo land but angut despised her  indeed she was the only creature or thing in his limited world that this good man did despise  he puzzled his countrymen very much for they could not understand him  other men they could put to shame or laugh out of their ideas and plans or frighten into submissionat least into conformity  not so angut  he was immovable like an ancient iceberg proof against threats wheedling cajoling terrifying sarcasmproof against everything but kindness  he could not stand before that  he went down before it as bergs go down before the summer sun  angut was shrewd also and profound of thought insomuch that mentally he stood high above his kinsfolk  he seemed to see through his fellows as if their bosoms and brains had been made of glass and all their thoughts visible  ujarak knew this also and did not like it  but no one suffered because of anguts superior penetration for he was too amiable to hurt the feelings of a mosquito  after all that we have said the reader will perhaps be prepared to expect that angut never opened his mouth save to drop words of love and wisdom  not so  angut was modest to excess  he doubted his own wisdom he suspected his own feelings he felt a strong tendency to defer to the opinion of others and was prone rather to listen than to speak  he was fond of a joke too but seldom perpetrated one and was seldom severe  while ujarak was speaking angut listened with that look of unmoved gravity with which he always met a new thing or idea and which effectually concealed his real feelings though the concealment was unintentional  but when at last the wizard came to the most distasteful part of his discourse namely the message from reginald rooney that on the occasion of his visit to the camp he would take up his abode with angut that heros countenance lighted up with surprise not unmingled with pleasure  is ujarak sure that the kablunet said this asked angut  quite sure replied the wizard  huk exclaimed angut by which exclamation you may be sure that he meant to express much satisfaction  but continued the wizard the kablunet is ill  he is thin he is weak  he wants rest  i have consulted with my torngak who tells me he will get better soon if we do not trouble him  at this point ujarak glanced at angut but that worthys countenance had resumed its look of impenetrable gravity  we must not worry him or go near him for some days continued the wizard  we must let him alone  and this will not try our patience for my torngak tells me that seals have come  yesterday i went to the house of the great fury under the sea and wrestled with her and my torngak and i overcame her and set many of the seals and other animals free  huk exclaimed the assembly in gratified surprise  lest the reader should feel some surprise also we may as well explain what the greenlanders believed in former times  they held perhaps they still hold that there were two great spiritsthe one was good named torngarsuk the other was bad and a femalea furywithout a name  this malevolent woman was supposed to live in a great house under the ocean in which by the power of her spells she enthralled and imprisoned many of the sea monsters and birds thus causing scarcity of food among the eskimos  the angekoks claimed to have the power of remedying this state of things by paying a visit to the abode of the fury  when an angekok has sufficient courage to undertake this journey his torngak after giving him minute instructions how to act conducts him under the earth or sea passing on the way through the kingdom of those good souls who spend their lives in felicity and ease  soon they come to a frightful vacuitya sort of vasty deepover which is suspended a narrow wheel which whirls round with great rapidity  this awful abyss is bridged by a rope and guarded by seal sentinels  taking the angekok by the hand his torngak leads him on the rope over the chasm and past the sentinels into the palace of the fury  no sooner does the wicked creature spy the unwelcome visitors than trembling and foaming with rage she immediately sets on fire the wing of a seafowl with the stench of which she hopes to suffocate angekok and torngak together and make both of them captives  the heroes however are prepared for this  they seize the fury before she has succeeded in setting fire to the wing pull her down and strip her of those amulets by the occult powers of which she has enslaved the inhabitants of ocean  thus the spell is broken for the time at least and the creatures being set free ascend to their proper abodes at the surface of the sea  after this explanation the reader will easily understand the flutter of excitement that passed through the assembly for although feasting at that moment on a walrus they had suffered much during the latter part of that winter from the scarcity of animals of all kinds  but angut did not flutter  that peculiar man was an incorrigible sceptic  he merely smiled and chucking a rotund little boy beside him under the chin said what think ye of that my little ball of fat or some eskimo equivalent for that question  our intelligent wizard had not however ventured on these statements without some ground to go on the fact is that being a close observer and good judge of the weather he had perceived a change of some sort coming on  while on his way to the hut of okiok he had also observed that a few seals were playing about on the margin of some icefloes and from other symptoms recognisable only by angekoks he had come to the conclusion that it would be safe as well as wise at that time to prophesy a period of plenty  now i would advise he said in concluding his discourse that we should send off a hunting party to the south for i can tell you that seals will be found thereif the young men do not put off time on the way  this last proviso was a judicious backdoor of escape  slight delays he knew were almost inevitable so that if the hunt should prove a failure he would have little difficulty in accounting for it and saving his credit  the most of his credulous and simpleminded hearers did not reflect on the significance of the backdoor remark but angut did and grinned a peculiar grin at the little fat boy whom he chucked a second time under the chin  ujarak noted the grin and did not like it  among the people there who gave strongest expression to their joy at the prospect of the good living in store for them were several young and middleaged females who sat in a corner grouped together and conveyed their approval of what was said to each other by sundry smirks and smiles and nods of the head which went far to prove that they constituted a little coterie or clique  one of these was the wife of simek the best hunter of the tribe  her name was pussimek  she was round and short comely and young and given to giggling  she had a babya female babynamed after her but more briefly pussi which resembled her in all respects except size  beside her sat the mother of ippegoo  we know not her maiden name but as her dead husband had been called by the same name as the son we will style her mrs ippegoo  there was also the mother of arbalik a youth who was celebrated as a wonderful killer of birds on the winga sort of eskimo robin hoodwith the small spear or dart  the mother of arbalik was elderly and sternfor an eskimo  she was sister to the great hunter simek  kannoa a very old driedup but lively woman with sparkling black eyes also formed one of the group  wont we be happy whispered pussimek when ujarak spoke in glowing terms of the abundance that was in prospect  she followed up the whisper by hugging the baby  yes a good time is coming said the mother of ippegoo with a pleasant nod  we will keep the cookinglamps blazing night and  and stuff rejoined pussimek with a giggle till we can hold no more  do you want to grow fatter asked the mother of arbalik in a sharp tone which drew forth a smothered laugh all round for pussimek had reached that condition of embonpoint which rendered an increase undesirable  i would not object to be fatter replied the wife of simek with perfect goodhumour for eskimos as a rule do not take offence easily  stuff stuff murmured kannoa nodding her old head contemplatively thats what im fond of stuffstuffstuff  all your stuffing will never make you fat said the stern and rather cynical mother of arbalik  she paid no attention to kannoas replywhich to do her justice was very mildfor at the moment arbalik himself rose to address the assembly  he was a fine specimen of an eskimoa goodlooking young savage slim and wiry with a nose not too flat and only a little turned up a mouth that was well shaped and pleasant to look at though very large and absolutely cavernous when in the act of yawning and his eyes looked sharp and eager as if always on the outlook for some passing bird with a view to transfixion  the words of ujarak are wise he said  i was down at the high bluffs yesterday and saw that what he says is true for many seals are coming up already and birds too  let us go out to the hunt  we would like much to see this wonderful kablunet remarked the jovial big hunter simek with a bland look at the company but ujarak knows best  if the kablunet needs rest he must have it  if he needs sleep he must have it  if he wants food he must have it  by all means let him have it  we will not disturb him  what the torngak of ujarak advises we will do  several of the other leading men also spoke on this occasionsome inclining to accept the wizards advice others who were intolerably anxious to see the kablunet rather inclining to the opinion that they should remain where they were till he recovered strength enough to be able to pay his contemplated visit  ippegoo spoke last  indeed it was not usual for him to raise his voice in council but as he had been the first to carry the important news and was known to be an ardent admirer and pupil of ujarak he felt that he was bound to back his patron and his arguments though not cogent prevailed  let us not doubt the wisdom of the angekok he said  his torngak speaks  it is our business to obey  we have starved much for some moons let us now feast and grow fat and strong  huk exclaimed the auditors who had been touched on their weakest point  but angut has not yet uttered his mind said the jovial simek turning with a bland expression to the man in question he is an angekok though he will not admit it  has not his familiar spirit said anything to him  angut looked gravely at the speaker for a moment or two and shook his head  dead silence prevailed  then in a voice that was unusually soft and deep he said i am no angekok  no torngak ever speaks to me  the winds that whistle round the icebergs and rush among the hummocks on the frozen sea speak to me sometimes the crashing icecliffs that thunder down the glens speak to me the noisy rivulets the rising sun and moon and winking stars all speak to me though it is difficult to understand what they say but no familiar spirit ever speaks to me  the man said this quietly and in a tone of regret but without the slightest intention of expressing poetical ideas or laying claim to originality of thought  yet his distinct denial of being an angekok or wise man and his sentiments regarding the voices of nature only confirmed his countrymen in their belief that he was the greatest angekok they had ever seen or heard of  but surely urged simek if so many spirits speak to you they must tell you something  they tell me much replied angut in a contemplative tone but nothing about hunting  have you no opinion then on that subject  yes i have an opinion and it is strong  let all the hunters go south after seals without delay but i will not go  i shall go among the icebergsalone  he will go to hold converse with his numerous torngaks whispered old kannoa to pussimek  he will go to visit okiok and see the kablunet and court nunaga thought the jealous and suspicious ujarak  and ujarak was right yet he dared not follow for he feared the grave thoughtful man in spite of his determination to regard and treat him with lofty disdain  utterly ignorant of the wizards feelings towards himfor he was slow to observe or believe in illwill towards himself when he felt none to any one elseangut set off alone next morning in the direction that led to the great glacier while his countrymen harnessed their dogs loaded their sledges with lines and weapons and went away southward on a hunting expedition  wishing the latter all success we will follow the fortunes of angut the eccentric angekok  had you and i reader been obliged to follow him in the body we should soon have been left far behind fortunately spirit is more powerful and fleet than matter  without rest or halt the stalwart eskimo journeyed over the ice until he reached the residence of okiok  the dogs knew his step well and gave no noisy sign of his approach though they rose to welcome him with wagging tails and rubbed their noses against his fur coat as he patted their heads  creeping into the hut he presented himself unexpectedly  okiok bade him silent welcome with a broad grin of satisfaction  nunaga did the same with a pleased smile and a decided blush  the other inmates of the hut showed similar friendship and tumbler trying to look up fell over into an oilpuddle with a loud crow of joy  they all then gazed suddenly and simultaneously with mysterious meaning at red rooney who lay coiled up and apparently sound asleep in the innermost corner  angut also gazed with intense interest though nothing of the sleeping man was visible save the point of his nose and a mass of curling brown hair protruding from his deerskin coverings  seating himself quietly between nunaga and nuna and taking the oily tumbler on his knee the visitor entered into a lowtoned conversation respecting this great event of their livesthe arrival of a real live kablunet  they also talked of kablunets in general and their reported ways and manners  it is to be noted here that they did not talk in whispers  okiok and nuna had indeed begun the conversation thus but had been immediately checked by angut whose intelligence had long ago taught him that no sound is so apt to awaken a sleeper as the hiss of a whisper and that a steady lowtoned hum of conversation is more fitted to deepen than interrupt slumber  is he very thin asked angut who had been somewhat impressed by ujaraks description of the stranger and his evident desire that no one should go near him  he is not fat answered okiok but he has not been starving long sleeping and stuffing will soon make him strong  dont you think so norrak  you saw him at his worst when we found him on the ice  thus appealed to okioks eldest son laid down the piece of blubber with which he had been engaged nodded his head several times and said yes he will be able to run and jump soon  and he speaks our language well said okiok with a look of great interest  i know it returned his friend ujarak told us about that  it is because of that that i have come at once to see him  nunaga winced here for she had timidly hoped that angut had come to see her  i would not continued the visitor that ujarak should be the first to speak to him for he will poison his ears  yes ujarak is a dreadful liar said okiok solemnly but without the slightest touch of ill feeling  an awful liar remarked nuna softly  nunaga smiled as though acquiescing in the sentiment but said nothing  just as they gave utterance to this decided opinion as to the character of the wizard red rooney turned round stretched himself yawned and sat up    chapter six  angut and rooney hold converse on many things  at first rooney did not observe that there was a visitor in the hut but when his eyes alighted on him he rose at once for he felt that he was in the presence of a man possessed of intelligence vastly superior to that of the ordinary natives  it was not so much that anguts presence was commanding or noble as that his grave expression broad forehead and earnest gaze suggested the idea of a man of profound thought  the angekok who had been so graphically described to him by okiok at once recurred to rooneys mind  turning to his host he said with a bland expression  i suppose this is your friend angut the angekok  yes replied okiok  while the mysterious foreigner was speaking angut gazed at him with looks and feelings of awe but when he stepped forward and frankly held out his hand the eskimo looked puzzled  a whispered word from his host however sufficed to explain  falling in at once with the idea he grasped the offered hand and gave it a squeeze of goodwill that almost caused the seaman to wince  i am glad to meet you said rooney  i am more than glad exclaimed the eskimo with enthusiasm i have not language to tell of what is in my mind  i have heard of kablunets dreamed of them thought of them  now my longings are gratifiedi behold one  i have been told that kablunets know nearly everything i know next to nothing  we will talk much  it seems to me as if i had been born only today  come let us begin  my friend you expect too much replied rooney with a laugh as he sat down to devote himself to the bearsteak which nunaga had placed before him  i am but an average sort of sailor and cant boast of very much education though i have a smattering but we have men in my country who do seem to know most everythingwise men they are  we call them philosophers you call em angekoks  here wont you go in for a steak or a rib  if you were as hungry as i am youd be only too glad and thankful to have the chance  angut accepted a rib evidently under the impression that the kablunet would think it impolite were he to refuse  he began to eat however in a languid manner being far too deeply engaged with mental food just then to care for grosser forms of nourishment  tell me said the eskimo who was impatient to begin his catechising do your countrymen all dress like this  he touched the sealskin coat worn by the sailor  o no said rooney laughing i only dress this way because i am in eskimo land and it is well suited to the country but the men in my landireland we call itdress in all sorts of fine cloth made from the hair of small animalswhy what do you stare at angut  oh i seemy knife  i forgot that you are not used to such things though you have knivesstone ones at least  this one you see is made of steel or ironthe stuff you know that the southern eskimos bring sometimes to barter with you northern men for the horns of the narwhal an other things  yes i have seen iron but never had any said angut with a little sigh they bring very little of it here  the innuits of the south catch nearly the whole of it on its journey north and they keep it  greedy fellows said rooney  well this knife is called a claspknife because it shuts and opens as you see and it has three bladesa big one for cuttin up your victuals with as you see me doin and two little ones for parin your nails and pickin your teeth an mendin pens an pencilsthough of course you dont know what that means  then here you see there are two little things stuck into the handle  one is called tweezers an is of no earthly use that i know of except to pull the hairs out o your nose which no man in his senses ever wants to do and the other thing is i suppose for borin small holes in thingsits almost as useless  this thing on the back is for pickin stones out of horses hoofsbut i forgot you never saw horses or hoofs  well no matter its for pickin things out of things whenwhen you want to pick em out  but below this is an uncommon useful thinga screwa thing for drawin corks out of bottlesthere again im forgettin  you never saw corks or bottles  happy people as the people who dont drink spirits would call youand to say truth i think they are right  indeed ive been one of them myself ever since i came to this region  give us another steak nunaga my dearno not a bear one i like the walrus better  its like yourselftender  the fair nunaga fell into a tremendous giggle at this joke for although our heros eskimo was not very perfect he possessed all an irishmans capacity for making his meaning understood more or less and truly it was a sight to behold the varied expressions of facethe childlike surprise admiration curiosity and something approaching to awewith which those unsophisticated natives received the explanation of the different parts of that claspknife  but what did we begin our talk about he continued as he tackled the walrus  o yes it was about our garments  well besides using different kinds of cloths our coats are of many different shapes we have short coats called jackets and long coats and coats with tails behind  do your men wear tails behind asked angut in surprise  yes two tails replied rooney and two buttons above them  strange remarked angut it is only our women who have tails and they have only one tail each with one button in frontnot behindto fasten the end of the tail to when on a journey  women with tails look very well remarked okiok especially when they swing them about in a neat way that i know well but cannot describe but men with tails must look very funny  here mrs okiok ventured to ask how the kablunet women dressed  well its not easy to describe that to folk who have never seen them said the sailor with a slight grin  in the first place they dont wear boots the whole length of their legs like you nuna  surely then remarked the hostess their legs must be cold  by no means for they cover em well up with loose flapping garments extending from the waist all the way down to the feet  then they dont wear hoods like you but stick queer things on their heads of all shapes and sizessometimes of no shape at all and very small size which they cover over with feathers an flowers an fluttering things of all colours besides lots of other gimcracks  how rooney rendered gimcracks into eskimo we are not prepared to say but the whole description sent nunaga and her mother into fits of giggling for those simpleminded creatures of the icy northunlike sedate europeansare easily made to laugh  at this point angut struck in again for he felt that the conversation was becoming frivolous  tell me kablunet he began but rooney interrupted him  dont call me kablunet  call me red rooney  it will be more friendlylike and will remind me of my poor shipmates  then tell me ridroonee said angut is it true what i have heard that your countrymen can make marks on flat white stuff like the thin skin of the duck which will tell men far away what they are thinking about  ay thats true enough replied the sailor with an easy smile of patronage we call it writing  a look of grave perplexity rested on the visage of the eskimo  its quite easy when you understand it and know how to do it continued rooney nothing easier  a humorous look chased away the eskimos perplexity as he replied  everything is easy when you understand it  ha you have me there angut laughed the sailor youre a cute fellow as the yankees say  but come ill try to show you how easy it is  see here  he pulled a small notebook from his pocket and drew thereon the picture of a walrus  now you understand that dont you  yes we draw like that and understand each other  well then we put down for that walrus and there you have it walrus nothing simpler  the perplexed look returned and angut said  that is not very easy to understand  yet i see somethingalways the same marks for the same beast other marks for other beasts  just so  youve hit it exclaimed rooney quite pleased with the intelligence of his pupil  but how if it is not a beast asked the eskimo  how if you cannot see him at all yet want to tell of him ininwhat did you say writing  i want to send marks to my mother to say that i have talked with my torngak  how do you mark torngak  i never saw him  no man ever saw a torngak  and how do you make marks for cold for wind for all our thoughts and for the light  it was now red rooneys turn to look perplexed  he knew that writing was easy enough to him who understands it and he felt that there must be some method of explaining the matter but how to go about the explanation to one so utterly ignorant did not at once occur to him  we have seen however that rooney was a resolute man not to be easily baffled  after a few moments thought he said  look here now angut  your people can count  yes they can go up to twenty  i can go a little further but most of the innuits get confused in mind beyond twenty because they have only ten fingers and ten toes to look at  well now continued rooney holding up his left hand with the fingers extended thats five  yes angut understood that well  well then resumed rooney jotting down the figure 5 there you have itfive  any boy at school could tell you what that is  the eskimo pondered deeply and stared  the other eskimos did the same  but what asked okiok if a boy should say that it was six and not five  why then wed whack him and hed never say that again  there was an explosion of laughter at this for eskimos are tender and indulgent to their children and seldom or never whack them  it would be tedious to go further into this subject or to describe the ingenious methods by which the seaman sought to break up the fallow ground of anguts eminently receptive mind  suffice it to say that rooney made the discovery that the possession of knowledge is one thing and the power to communicate it another and a very different thing angut also came to the conclusion that ignorant as he had thought himself to be his first talk with the kablunet had proved him to be immeasurably more ignorant than he had supposed  the sailor marked the depression which was caused by this piece of knowledge and set himself goodnaturedly to counteract the evil by displaying his watch at sight of which there was a wild exclamation of surprise and delight from all except angut who however deep his feelings might be always kept them bridled  the expansion of his nostrils and glitter of his eyes however told their tale though no exclamation passed his lips  once or twice when rooney attempted to explain the use of the instrument the inquisitive man was almost irresistibly led to put some leading questions as to the nature of time but whenever he observed this tendency the sailor thinking that he had given him quite enough of philosophy for one evening adroitly turned him off the scent by drawing particular attention to some other portion of the timepiece  the watch and the knife to which they reverted later on kept the lecturer and audience going till late in the evening by which time our sailor had completely won the hearts of the eskimos and they had all become again so hungry that okiok gave a hint to his wife to stir up the lamp and prepare supper  then with a sigh of relief they all allowed their strained minds to relax and the conversation took a more general turn  it is but fair to add that as the sailor had won the hearts of the natives so his heart had been effectually enthralled by them  for angut in particular rooney felt that powerful attraction which is the result of similar tastes mutual sympathies and diversity of character rooney had a strong tendency to explain and teach angut a stronger tendency to listen and learn  the former was impulsive and hasty the latter meditative and patient  rooney was humorously disposed and jovial while his eskimo friend though by no means devoid of humour was naturally grave and sedate  thus their dispositions formed a pleasing contrast and their tastes an agreeable harmony  what did you say was the name of your country asked angut during a brief pause in the consumption of the meal  england said rooney  that was not the name you told me before  true i suppose i said ireland before but the fact is i can scarcely claim it as my own for you see my father was irish and my mother was scotch  i was born in wales an ive lived a good bit o my life in england  so you see i cant claim to be anything in particular  as this was utterly incomprehensible to the eskimo he resumed his bit of blubber without saying a word  after a brief silence he looked at the kablunet again and said  have they houses in your land  houses  o yes plenty of emmade of stone  like the summerhouses of the innuit i suppose said angut  are they as big  rooney laughed at this and said yes they were much biggeras big as the cliffs alongside  huk exclaimed the eskimos in various tones  okioks tone indeed was one of doubt but angut did not doubt his new friend for a moment though his credulity was severely tested when the seaman told him that one of the villages of his countrymen covered a space as big as they could seeaway to the very horizon and beyond it  but angut said rooney growing somewhat weary at last youve asked me many questions will you answer a few now  i will answer  i have heard it said began the sailor that angut is a wise manan angekokamong his people but that he denies the fact  why does he deny it  the eskimo exchanged solemn glances with his host then looked round the circle and said that some things could not be explained easily  he would think first and afterwards he would talk  that is well said returned rooney  think well before you speak is a saying among my own people  he remained silent for a few moments after that and observed that okiok made a signal to his two boys  they rose immediately and left the hut  now said okiok angut may speak  there are none but safe tongues here  my boys are good but their tongues wag too freely  yes they wag too freely echoed mrs okiok with a nod  thus freed from the danger of being misreported angut turned to the seaman and said  i deny that i am an angekok because angekoks are deceivers  they deceive foolish men and women  some of them are wicked and only peopledeceivers  they do not believe what they teach  some of them are selfdeceivers  they are good enough men and believe what they teach though it is false  these men puzzle me  i cannot understand them  the eskimo became meditative at this point as if his mind were running on the abstract idea of selfdelusion  indeed he said as much  rooney admitted that it was somewhat puzzling  i suppose resumed the eskimo that kablunets never deceive themselves or others they are too wise  is it so  well now you put the question said rooney i rather fear that some of us do occasionally an theres not a few who have a decided tendency to deceive others  and so that is the reason you wont be an angekok is it  well it does you credit  but what sort o things do they believe in these northern regions that you cant go in with much the same i fancy that the southern eskimos believe  i know not what the southern eskimos believe for i have met them seldom  but our angekoks believe in torngaks familiar spirits which they say meet and talk with them  there is no torngak  it is a lie  but you believe in one great and good spirit dont you asked the seaman with a serious look  yes i believe in one returned the eskimo in a low voice one who made me and all things and who must be good  there are people in my land who deny that there is one because they never saw or felt or heard himso they say they cannot know said rooney  angut looked surprised  they must be fools he said  i see a sledge and i know that some man made itfor who ever heard of a sledge making itself  i see a world and i know that the great spirit made it because a world cannot make itself  the greatest spirit must be one because two greatests are impossible and he is goodbecause good is better than evil and the greatest includes the best  the seaman stared as well he might while the eskimo spoke these words gazing dreamily at the lampflame as if he were communing with his own spirit rather than with his companion  evidently okiok had a glimmering of what he meant for he looked pleased as well as solemn  it might be tedious to continue the conversation  leaving them therefore to their profound discussions we will turn to another and very different social group    chapter seven  treats of crosspurposes and difficulties  partially concealed in a cavern at the base of a stupendous almost perpendicular cliff stood the wizard ujarak and his pupil ippegoo the former silently watched the latter as he fitted a slender spear or rather giant arrow to a short handle and prepared to discharge it at a flock of seabirds which were flying about in front of them within what we would call easy gunshot  the handle referred to acted as a short lever by means of which the spear could be launched not only with more precision but with much greater force than if thrown simply by hand like a javelin  there dart it now cried ujarak as a bird swept close to the caves mouth  boh you are too slow  here is another quick dart  ippegoo let fly hastily and missed  poo you are of no more use than the rotten ice of spring  there try again said ujarak pointing to a flock of birds which came sweeping towards them  the crestfallen youth fitted another spear to the handlefor he carried severaland launched it in desperation into the middle of the flock it ruffled the wings of one bird and sent it screaming up the cliffs but brought down none  boo exclaimed the wizard varying the expression of his contempt it is well that your mother has only a small family  ippegoo was accustomed to severe backhanders from his patron he was not offended but smiled in a pathetic manner as he went out in silence to pick up his weapons  just as he was returning arbalik nephew to the jovial simek appeared upon the scene and joined them  the wizard appeared to be slightly annoyed but had completely dissembled his feelings when the young man walked up  have the hunters found no seals asked ujarak  yes plenty answered arbalik cheerily for he had a good deal of his old uncles spirit in him but you know variety is agreeable  birds are good at a feast  they enable you to go on eating when you can hold no more seal or walrus blubber  that is true returned the wizard with a grave nod of appreciation show ippegoo how to dart the spear  he is yet a baby  arbalik laughed lightly as he let fly a spear with a jaunty almost careless air and transfixed a bird on the wing  well done cried the wizard with a burst of genuine admiration your wife will never know hunger  not after i get her returned the youth with a laugh as he flung another spear and transfixed a second bird  ippegoo looked on with slightly envious but not malevolent feelings for he was a harmless lad  try again cried arbalik turning to him with a broad grin as he offered him one of his own spears  ippegoo took the weapon launched it and to his own great surprise and delight sent it straight through the heart of a bird which fell like a stone  a shout of pleasure burst from arbalik who was far too good a shot to entertain mean feelings of jealousy at the success of others  it is the luck of the spear said ujarak not the skill of the hunter  this would have been an unkind cut to ordinary mortals but it fell as harmless on ippegoo as water on the back of the eiderduck  a snub from the wizard he took almost as a compliment and the mere success of his shot afforded him unbounded pleasure  the goodnatured arbalik offered him another spear but ujarak interposed  no ippegoo must come with me he said  i have work for him to do one who would be an angekok must leave birdspearing to boys  then turning to arbalikdid you not say that the hunters have found plenty of game  yes plenty  i told you so said the wizard using a phrase not unfamiliar to civilised ears  remain here and spear plenty of birds or go where you will  having thus graciously given the youth free permission to do as he pleasedwhich arbalik received with inward scorn though outward respecthe left the cave followed meekly by his satellite  after walking in silence till well out of earshot of the expert young hunter the wizard said in solemn tones  ippegoo i have work of more importance for you to do than spearing birdswork that requires the wisdom of a young angekok  all ujaraks backhanders vanished before this confidential remark and the poor tool began to feel as if he were growing taller and broader even as he walked  you know the hut of okiok continued the wizard  yes under the icetopped cliff  well angut is there  i hate angut  so do i said ippegoo with emphasis quite equal to that of his master  and nunaga is there continued ujarak  ii love nunaga  so do i exclaimed ippegoo fervently but seeing by the wizards majestic frown that he had been precipitate he took refuge in the hasty explanationof course i mean thatthati love her because you love her  i do not love her for herself  if you did not love her i would hate her  to me she is not of so much value as the snout of a seal  the wizard seemed pacified for his frown relaxed and after a few moments thought he went on savagely  angut also loves nunaga  the madman the insolent the fool exclaimed ippegoo what can he expect but death  nothing else and nothing less growled the wizard clenching his teethif he gets her  but he shall never get her  i will stop that and that is why i ask you to listenfor you must be ready to act and in haste  as ippegoo began to entertain uncomfortable suspicions that the wizard was about to use him as an instrument of vengeance he made no response whatever to the last remark  now continued his master you will go to the hut of okiok  enter it hurriedly and say to nunaga that her fathers grandmother kannoa is illill in her mindand will not rest till she comes to see her  take a small sledge that will only hold her and yourself and if okiok or angut offer to go with you say that old kannoa wants to see the girl alone that there is a spell upon her that she is bewitched and will see no one else  they will trust you for they know that your mind is weak and your heart good  if my mind is weak said ippegoo somewhat sadly how can i ever become an angekok  with much affectation of confidence the wizard replied that there were two kinds of men who were fit to be angekoksmen with weak minds and warm hearts or men with strong minds and cold hearts  and have you the strong mind asked ippegoo  yes of course very strongand also the cold heart replied ujarak  but how can that be returned the pupil with a puzzled look when your heart is warmed by nunaga  becausebecause rejoined the wizard slowly with some hesitation and a look of profound wisdom because men of strong mind do not love as other men  they are quite differentso different that you cannot understand them  ippegoo felt the reproof and was silent  so when you have got nunaga on the sledge resumed ujarak you will drive her towards the village but you will turn off at the cliff of seals and drive at full speed to the spot where i speared the white bear last moon  you know it  yes near walrus bay  just so  there you will find me with two sledges  on one i will drive nunaga away to the farsouth where the innuit who have much iron dwell on the other you will follow  we will live there for ever  they will be glad to receive us  butbut said ippegoo hesitatingly and with some anxiety for he did not like to differ on any point from his masteri cannot leave mymy mother  why not  i suppose it is because i love her  you know you told me that the weak minds have warm heartsand my mind must be very very weak indeed for my heart is very warmquite hotfor my mother  the wizard perceived that incipient rebellion was in the air so like a wise man a true angekok he trimmed his sails accordingly  bring your mother with you he said abruptly  but she wont come  command her to come  command my mother exclaimed ippegoo in amazement  again the wizard was obliged to have recourse to his wisdom in order to subdue this weak mind  yes of course he replied tell your mother that your torngakno you havent got one yetthat ujaraks torngaktold him in a vision that a visit to the lands of the farsouth would do her good would remove the pains that sometimes stiffen her joints and the cough that has troubled her so much  so you will incline her to obey  go tell her to prepare for a journey but say nothing more except that i will call for her soon and take her on my sledge  away  the peremptory tone of the last word decided the poor youths wavering mind  without a word more he ran to the place where his dogs were fastened harnessed them to his sledge and was soon driving furiously back to the eskimo village over the frozen sea while the wizard returned to the place where the hunters of his tribe were still busy hauling in the carcases of seals and other game which they had succeeded in killing in considerable numbers  approaching one of the band of hunters which was headed by the jovial simek and had halted for the purpose of refreshment ujarak accosted them with  have the young men become impatient women that they cannot wait to have their food cooked  ha ha laughed simek holding up a strip of raw and bloody seals flesh with which he had already besmeared the region of his mouth and nose yes we have become like women we know what is good for us and take it when we need it not caring much about the cooking  my young men are hungry  must they wait till the lamps are lighted before they eat  come ujarak join us  even an angekok may find a bit of good fat seal worth swallowing  did you not set them free  you deserve a bit  there was a spice of chaff as well as jollity in the big eskimos tone and manner but he was such a gushing fellow and withal so powerful that the wizard deemed it wise not to take offence  it is not long since i fed he replied with a grim smile i have other work on hand just now  i also have workplenty of it and i work best when stuffed full  so saying simek put a full stop as it were to the sentence with a mass of blubber while the wizard went off as he said to consult his torngak as to state affairs of importance  meanwhile ippegoo went careering over the ice plying his longlashed whip with the energy of a man who had pressing business on hand  arrived at the village he sought his mothers hut  kunelik as his mother was named was seated therein not exactly darning his socks but engaged in the eskimo equivalentmending his waterproof boots  these were made of undressed sealskin with soles of walrus hide and the pleasantfaced little woman was stitching together the sides of a rent in the upper leather using a fine sharp fishbone as a needle and a delicate shred of sinew as a thread when her son entered  mother he said in a somewhat excited tone as he sat down beside his maternal parent i go to the hut of okiok  kunelik bestowed an inquiring glance upon her boy  ippe she said for eskimos sometimes use endearing abbreviations has nunaga turned you upside down  the lad protested fervently that his head was yet in its proper position  but he added the mother of okino the grandmother of okiokis sickvery sickand i am to go and fetch the mother ofno i mean the daughter ofof okiok to see her becausebecause  take time ippe interrupted kunelik i see that your head is down and your boots are in the air  again ippegoo protested earnestly that he was in the reverse position and that nunaga was no more to him than the snout of a seal but he protested in vain for his pleasant little mother believed that she understood the language of symptoms and nodded her disbelief smilingly  but why do you say that kannoa is very ill ippe she asked i have just come from her hut where she was seemingly quite well  moreover she has agreed to sup this very night with the mother of arbalik and she could not do that if she was ill for that means much stuffing because the mother of arbalik has plenty of food and cooks it very fast  oh but it is not kannoas body that is ill said ippegoo quickly it is her mind that is illvery ill and nothing will make it better but a sight of nunaga  it was ujarak that told me so and you know mother that whatever he says must be true somehow whether it be true or not  ujarak is a fool said kunelik quietly and you are another my son  we must again remind the reader here that the eskimos are a simple as well as straightforward folk  they say what they mean and mean what they say without the smallest intention of hurting each others feelings  and mother continued the son scarce noticing her remark i want you to prepare for a journey  kunelik looked surprised  where to my son  it matters not just now  you shall know in time  will you get ready  no my son i wont  but ujarak says you are to get ready  still my son i wont  mother exclaimed ippegoo with that look and tone which usually follows the saying of something very wicked but the pleasant little woman went on with her work with an air of such calm goodnatured resolution that her son felt helpless  then mother i know not what to do  what did he tell you to do asked kunelik abruptly  the youth gave as much of his conversation with the wizard as sufficed to utterly perplex his mothers mind without enlightening it much  when he had finished or rather had come to an abrupt stop she looked at him calmly and said  my son whatever he told you to do go and do it  leave the rest to me  from infancy ippegoo had rejoiced in his wise little mothers decisions to be saved the trouble of thinking to have a straight and simple course clearly pointed out to him so that he should have nothing to do but shut his eyes and walk thereinor if need be runwas the height of ippegoos ambitionnext to solid feeding  but be not hard on him good reader  remember that he was an ignorant savage and that you could not expect him to be as absolutely and entirely free from this low type of spirit as civilised people are  without another word therefore the youth leaped on to his sledge cracked his whip and set off on his delicate mission  poor lad disappointment was in store for him  but compensation was in store also  while he was galloping along under the icecliffs on the east side of a great berg not far from the end of his journey okiok with his wife and daughter on a sledge chanced to be galloping with equal speed in the opposite direction on the west side of the same berg  it was a mighty bergan icemountain of nearly half a mile in lengthso that no sound of cracking lash or yelping dogs passed from the one party to the other  thus when ippegoo arrived at his destination he found his fair bird flown  but he found a much more interesting personage in the kablunet who had been left under the care of angut and ermigit  this great sight effectually banished disappointment and every other feeling from his breast  he first caught a glimpse of the wonderful man when halfway through the tunnellobby and the sight rooted him to the spot for red rooney had just finished making a fulldress suit of clothes for little tumbler and was in the act of fitting them on when the young eskimo arrived  that day ermigit had managed to spear a huge raven  rooney being something of a naturalist had skinned it and it was while little tumbler was gazing at him in openeyed admiration that the thought struck himtumbler being very small and the raven very large  come said he seizing the childwith whom he was by that time on the most intimate terms of affectioncome ill dress you up  tumbler was naked at the moment and willingly consented  a few stitches with needle and thread which the sailor always carried in his pocket soon converted the wings of the bird into sleeves a button at the chest formed the skin into a rude cutaway coat the head with the beak in front formed a convenient cap and the tail hung most naturally down behind  a better fulldress coat was never more quickly manufactured  ermigit went into convulsions of laughter over it and the sailor charmed with his work kept up a running commentary in mingled english and eskimo  splendid he cried the best slopshop in portsmouth couldnt match it  cap and coat all in one  the fit perfectand what a magnificent tail  at this point ermigit caught sight of the gaping and glaring ippegoo in the passage  with a bound he fell upon him caught him by the hair and dragged him in  of course there followed a deal of questioning which the hapless youth tried to answer but the fascination of the kablunet was too much for him  he could do nothing but give random replies and stare seeing which rooney suggested that the best way to revive him would be to give him something to eat    chapter eight  mrs okioks little evening party  in eskimo land as in england power and industry result in the elevation and enrichment of individuals though they have not yet resulted there as here in vast accumulations of wealth or in class distinctions  the elevating tendency of superior power and practice is seen in the fact that while some hunters are nearly always pretty well offwelltodo as we would express itothers are often in a state of poverty and semistarvation  a few of them possess two establishments and some even go the length of possessing two wives  it is but just to add however that these last are rare  most eskimo men deem one wife quite as much as they can manage to feed  our friend okiok was what we may style one of the aristocracy of the land  he did not indeed derive his position from inheritance but from the circumstance of his being a successful hunter a splendid canoeman and a tremendous fighter  when it is added that his fights were often singlehanded against the polar bear it may be understood that both his activity and courage were great  he was not an angekok for like his friend angut he did not believe in wizards nevertheless he was very truly an angekok in the sense of being an uncommonly wise man and his countrymen recognising the fact paid him suitable respect  okiok possessed a town and a country mansion  that is to say besides the solitary residence already mentioned close to the great glacier he owned the largest hut in the eskimo village  it was indeed quite a palatial residence capable of holding several families and having several holes in itor windowswhich were glazed if we may say so with the scraped intestines of animals  it was to this residence that okiok drove on the afternoon of the day that he missed ippegoos visit  on finding that most of the men had gone southward to hunt he resolved to follow them for his purpose was to consult about the kablunet who had so recently fallen like a meteor from the sky into their midst  but you will stop here nuna with nunaga and tell the women all about the kablunet while i go south alone  make a feast you have plenty to give them  here help me to carry the things inside  okiok had brought quite a sledgeload of provisions with him for it had been his intention to give a feast to as many of the community as could be got inside his hut  the carrying in of the supplies therefore involving as it did creeping on hands and knees through a low tunnel with each article was not a trifling duty  now said he when at last ready to start be sure that you ask the liars and the stupid ones to the feast as well as the wise and make them sit near you for if these dont hear all about it from your own mouth they will be sure to carry away nonsense and spread it  dont give them the chance to invent  while her husband was rattling away south over the hummocky sea in his empty sledge nuna lighted her lamps opened her stores and began to cook  go now nunaga she said and tell the women who are to feed with us tonight  who shall i invite mother asked pretty little nunaga preparing to set forth on her mission  invite old kannoa of course  she is good  yes mother and she is also griggy  we may remark in passing that it is impossible to convey the exact meaning of the eskimo word which we have rendered griggy  enough to say once for all that in difficult words and phrases we give as nearly as possible our english equivalents  and kunelik said nuna continuing to enumerate her guests i like the mother of ippegoo  she is a pleasant little woman  but father said we were to ask liars remarked nunaga with a sweet look  im coming to them child said mrs okiok with a touch of petulancethe result of a gulp of lampsmoke yes you may ask pussimek also  the wife of simek is always full of wise talk and her baby does not squall which is lucky for she cannot be forced to leave pussi behind  but name the liars and stupid ones mother urged nunaga who being a dutiful child and anxious to carry out her fathers wishes to the letter stuck to her point  tell issek then the mother of arbalik to come returned nuna making a wry face  if she is not stupid she is wicked enough and dreadful at lies  and the sisters kabelaw and sigokow they are the worst liars in all the village besides being stupider than puffins there that will be enough for our first feed  when these have stuffed we can have more  too many at once makes much cooking and little talk go my child  an hour later and the gossips of the eskimo village were assembled round mrs okioks hospitable lampshe had no boardthe raised floor at the further end of the hut serving both for seat and table in the daytime and for bed at night  of course they were all bursting with curiosity and eager to talk  but food at first claimed too much attention to permit of free conversation  yet it must not be supposed that the company was gluttonous or greedy  whatever eskimos may feel at a feast it is a point of etiquette that guests should not appear anxious about what is set before them  indeed they require a little pressing on the part of the host at first but they always contrive to make amends for such selfrestraint before the feast is over  and it was by no means a simple feast to which that party sat down there were dried herrings and dried seals flesh and the same boiled also boiled auks dried salmon dried reindeer venison and a muchesteemed dish consisting of half raw and slightly putrid seals flesh called mikiaksomething similar in these respects to our own game  but the principal dish was part of a whales tail in a high or gamey condition  besides these delicacies there was a pudding or dessert of preserved crowberries mixed with chyle from the maw of the reindeer with train oil for sauce  see note  gradually as appetite was satisfied tongues were loosened and information about the wonderful foreigner which had been fragmentary at first flowed in a copious stream  then commentary and question began in right earnest  have some more mikiak said mrs okiok to pussimek  no replied mrs p with a sigh  these northern eskimos did not at least at the time of which we write say thank younot that there was any want of good feeling or civility among them but simply because it was not customary to do so  mrs okiok then offered some more of the delicacy mentioned to the mother of ippegoo  no said kunelik leaning back with a contented air against the wall i am pleasantly stuffed already  but tell me cried issek the stern mother of arbalik what does the kablunet say the people eat in his own land  they eat no whales said nuna they have no whales  no whales exclaimed pussimek with a huk of surprise  no no whales said nunaand no bears she added impressively ridroonee thats his name says they eat a thing called bread which grows out of the ground like grass  eat grass exclaimed the mother of arbalik  so he says and also beasts that have horns  reindeer suggested kunelik  no the horns are short with only one point to each and the beasts are much heavier than reindeer  they have also great beasts with no name in our languagehurses or hosses he calls thembut they dont eat these they make them haul sledges on little round things called weels  i know cried sigokow they must be big dogs  huk exclaimed old kannoa who confined her observations chiefly to that monosyllable and a quiet chuckle  no returned nuna becoming a little impatient under these frequent interruptions they are not dogs at all but hurseshosseswith hard feet like stones and iron boots on them  a general exclamation of incredulous surprise broke forth at this point and the mother of arbalik silently came to the conclusion that nuna had at last joined the liars of the community and was making the most of her opportunities and coming out strong  let there be no talk and i will speak said nuna somewhat indignantly if you interrupt me again i will send you all away to your huts  this threat produced silence and a sniff from arbaliks mother  mrs okiok went on  the land ridroonee says is very rich  they have all that they wish and more  huk from the companyexcept a great many people called poooor who have not all that they wishand who sometimes want a little more  a groan of remonstrative pity from the audience but they have not many seals and they never eat them  poo  i would not care to live there said pussimek  and no walruses at all added mrs okiok  boo a miserable country exclaimed ippegoos mother  then they have villagesso bigoh  nuna paused from incapacity to describe for eskimos being unable to comprehend large numbers are often obliged to have recourse to illustration  listen continued nuna holding up a finger if all the whales we catch in a year were to be cooked they would not feed the people of their largest village for one day  the mother of arbalik now felt that she had sufficient ground for the belief that mrs okiok was utterly demoralised and lost in the matter of veracity  mrs okiok looking at her perceived this in her countenance and dropped that subject with a soft smile of conscious innocence  thereupon curiosity broke forth again with redoubled violence  but what is the kablunet like cried kabelaw as eagerly as if it were the first time of asking  i have told you six times replied nuna  tell her again cried the mother of arbalik with a sniff shes so used to lies that she finds it hard to take in the truth  there was a sort of double hit intended here which immensely tickled the eskimos who laughed heartily for they are fond of a touch of sarcastic humour  yes tell her again they cried unanimouslyfor added pussimek were not tired of it yet  are we pussi  the query was addressed to her stark naked baby which broke from a tremendous stare into a benignant laugh that had the effect of shutting up its eyes at the same time that it opened its little mouth  it must be remarked here that although we have called pussi a baby she was not exactly an infant  she could walk and understand and even talk  she did not however desirable child use her tongue freely in fact eskimo children seldom do so in the company of their elders they are prone to listen and gaze and swallow mentally and to reply only when questioned  but they seem to consider themselves free to laugh at willhence pussis explosion  well then continued mrs okiok goodnaturedly i will tell you again  the kablunet is a fine man  he must be very much finer when he is fat for he is broad and tall and looks strong but he is thin just nowoh so thinas thin almost as ippegoo  ippegoos mother took this in good part as indeed it was intended  but that will soon mend with stuffing continued nuna  and his hair is brownnot blackand is in little rings and there is nearly as much below his nose as above it so that his mouth can only be seen when open  he carries needles and soft sinews too in his bag but his needles are not fishbonesthey are iron and the sinews are not like our sinews  they arei know not what  he has a round thing also made of white iron in his pocket and it is alive  he says no it is a dead thing but he lies for one day when he was out i heard it speaking to itself in a low soft little voice but i was afraid to touch it for fear it should bite  lies again muttered issek the mother of arbalik to herself  he says that it tells him about time continued nuna but how can it tell him about anything if it is dead  alive and dead at the same time  impossible cried pussimek  ridiculous cried every one else  huk ejaculated old kannoa wrinkling up her mild face and exposing her toothless gums in a stupendous chuckle  yes impossible  but i think he does not tell many lies said nuna apologetically  i think he only does it a little  then he goes on his knees every night before lying down and every morning when he rises and speaks to himself  why cried every one in blazing astonishment  i know not replied nuna and he does not tell  he must be a fool suggested kunelik  i suppose so returned nuna yet he does not look like a fool  at this point the description of rooneys person and characteristics was interrupted by a tremendous splash  it was poor pussi who having grown wearied of the conversation had slipped from her mothers side and while wandering in the background had tumbled into the oiltub from which she quickly emerged gasping gazing and glittering  a mild remonstrance with a good wipe down soon put her to rights and nuna was about to resume her discourse when the sound of rushing footsteps outside arrested her  next moment a wild scrambling was heard in the tunnelas of a giant rat in a hurryand ippegoo tumbled into the hut in a state of wild excitement which irresistibly affected the women  what has happened demanded nuna  mother gasped the youth turning to the natural repository of all his cares and troubles he is coming  who is coming my son asked kunelik in a quiet soothing tone for the pleasant little woman unlike most of the others was not easily thrown into a state of agitation  the kablunet cried ippegoo  where when who how which what burst simultaneously from the gaping crowd  but for some minutes the evidently exhausted youth could not answer  he could only glare and pant  by degrees however and with much patience his mother extracted his news from him piecemeal to the following effect  after having sat and gazed in mute surprise at the kablunet for a considerable time as already mentioned and having devoured a good meal at the same time ippegoo had been closely questioned by angut as to the reason of his unexpected visit  he had done his best to conceal matters with which angut he said had nothing to do but somehow that wonderfully wise man had seen as it were into his brain and at once became suspicious  then he looked so fierce and demanded the truth so sternly that he ippegoo had fled in terror from the hut of okiok and did not stop till he had reached the top of a hummock where he paused to recover breath  looking back he saw that angut had already harnessed the dogs to his sledge and was packing the kablunet upon itall lies interrupted arbaliks mother issek at this point  if this is true how comes it that ippegoo is here first  no doubt the legs of the simple one are the best part of him but every one knows that they could not beat the dogs of angut  issek is wise said kunelik pleasantly almost too wisebut no doubt the simple one can explain  speak my son  yes mother i can explain  you must know that angut was in such a fierce hurry that he made his whip crack like the splitting of an iceberg and the dogs gave such a yell and bound that they dashed the sledge against a hummock and broke some part of it  what part of it i did not stop to see  only i saw that they had to unload and the kablunet helped to mend it  then i turned and ran  so i am here first  there was a huk of approval at this explanation which was given in a slightly exulting tone and with a glance of mild defiance at arbaliks mother  but issek was not a woman to be put down easily by a simpleton  she at once returned to the charge  no doubt ippegoo is right she said with forced calmness but he has talked of a message to okiok  i dare say the wife of okiok would like to hear what that message is  huk  that is true said nuna quickly  and continued issek ippegoo speaks of the suspicions of angut what does he suspect  we would all like to know that  huk huk  that is also true exclaimed every one  my son whispered kunelik silence is the only hope of a fool  speak not at all  ippegoo was so accustomed to render blind and willing obedience to his mother that he instantly brought his teeth together with a snap and thereafter not one word good bad or indifferent was to be extracted from the simple one  from what he had revealed however it was evident that a speedy visit from the wonderful foreigner was to be looked for  the little party therefore broke up in much excitement each member of it going off in bursting importance to spread the news in her particular circle with exaggerations suitable to her special nature and disposition  while they are thus engaged we will return to the object of all their interest  when ippegoo fled from angut as already told the latter worthy turned quickly to rooney and said  there is danger somewherei know not where or what but i must leave you  ermigit will take good care of ridroonee till i come again  nay if there is danger anywhere i will share it returned rooney rising and stretching himself i am already twice the man i was with all this resting and feeding  the eskimo looked at the sailor doubtfully for a moment but when action was necessary he was a man of few words  merely uttering the word come he went out and harnessed his dogteam in a few minutes  then after wrapping the kablunet carefully up in furs he leaped on the forepart of the sledge cracked his whip and went off at full speed  what is the danger that threatens think you asked rooney you must have some notion about it  i know not but i guess answered angut with a sternness that surprised his companion  ippegoo is a poor tool in the hands of a bad man  he comes from ujarak and he asks too earnestly for nunaga ujarak is fond of nunaga  rooney looked pointedly and gravely at angut  that eskimo returned the look even more pointedly and with deeper gravity  then what we may term a grave smile flitted across the features of the eskimo  a similar smile enlivened the features of the seaman  he spoke no word but from that moment rooney knew that angut was also fond of nunaga and he made up his mind to aid him to the utmost of his capacity both in love and warfor sympathy is not confined to races creeds or classes but gloriously permeates the whole human family  it was at this point that the crash described by ippegoo occurred fortunately no damage was done to the occupants of the sledge though the vehicle itself had suffered fractures which it took them several hours to repair  having finished the repairs they set off again at greater speed than ever in the direction of the eskimo village accompanied by ermigit and tumbler who not caring to be left behind had followed on a smaller sledge and overtaken them    note for further light on this interesting subject see history of greenland and the moravian brethren volume one page 159  longman 1820    chapter nine  shows that the wise are a match for the wicked and exhibits tumbler and pussi in danger  when red rooney and his friend reached the village and found that most of the men had gone south to hunt and that nunaga was living in peace with her mother in her fathers town mansion their fears were greatly relieved although angut was still rendered somewhat anxious by the suspicion that mischief of some sort was brewing  being resolved if possible to discover and counteract it he told rooney that he meant to continue his journey southward and join the hunters  good  i will rest here till you return said the seaman for i feel that im not strong enough yet for much exertion  but ridroonee promised to dwell with me returned angut somewhat anxiously  so i did and so i will friend when you come back  at present you tell me your hut is closed because you have no wifeno kinswoman  that is true returned the eskimo my mother is dead my father was killed i have no brothers no sisters  but when i am at home old kannoa cooks for me  she is a good woman and can make us comfortable  just so angut  ill be content to have the old woman for a nurse as long as i need one  good luck to you and i say keep a sharp lookout on ujarak  hes not to be trusted if i am any judge of mens faces  angut said no word in reply but he smiled a grim smile as he turned and went his way  being much fatigued with his recent exertions red rooney turned into okioks hut to the great sorrow of the women and children who had gathered from all parts of the village to gaze at and admire him  he is realand alive remarked kunelik in a low voice  and nuna is not a liar said the mother of arbalik  yes he is tall said one  and broad observed another  but very thin said pussimek  no matter he can stuff said kabelaw with a nod to her sister sigokow who was remarkably stout and doubtless understood the virtue of the process  while this commentary was going on the object of it was making himself comfortable on a couch of skins which nuna had spread for him on the raised floor at the upper end of her hut  in a few minutes the wearied man was sound asleep as was indicated by his nose  no sooner did mrs okiok note the peculiar sound than she went out and said to her assembled friendsnow you may come in butforget not no word is to be spoken  use your eyes and bite your tongues  the one who speaks shall be put out  under these conditions the multitude filed into the mansion where they sat down in rows to gaze their fill in profound silence and there they sat for more than an hour rapt in contemplation of the wonderful sight  he snorts was on the lips of pussimek but a warning glance from nuna checked the sentence in the bud  he dreams had almost slipped from the lips of kunelik but she caught it in time  certainly these primitive people availed themselves of the permission to use their eyes nay more they also used their eyebrowsand indeed their entire faces for the lips being sealed they not only drank in rooney so to speak with their eyes but tried to comment upon him with the same organs  finding them very imperfect in this respect they ventured to use their lips without soundto speak as it were in dumb showand the contortions of visage thus produced were indescribable  this state of things was at its height when rooney chanced to awake  as he lay with his face to the foe the tableau vivant met his gaze the instant he opened his eyes  rooney was quickwitted and had great power of selfcommand  he reclosed the eyes at once and then through the merest chink between the lids continued to watch the scene  but the wink had been observed  it caused an abrupt stoppage of the pantomime and an intense glare of expectancy  this was too much for rooney  he threw up his arms and gave way to a violent explosion of loud and hearty laughter  if a bombshell had burst among the spectators it could scarcely have caused greater consternation  a panic ensued  incontinently the mother of ippegoo plunged head first into the tunnel  the mother of arbalik followed overtook her friend tried to pass and stuck fast  the others dashing in sought to force them through but only rammed them tighter  seeing that egress was impossible those in rear crouched against the furthest wall and turned looks of horror on the kablunet who they thought had suddenly gone mad  but observing that nuna and her daughter did not share their alarm they soon recovered and when rooney at last sat up and began to look grave they evidently felt somewhat ashamed of themselves  pussimek at last seized the mother of ippegoo by the legs and with a strong pull extracted her from the tunnel  issek being thus set free quickly made her exit  the rest followed by degrees until rooney was left with nuna and her daughter  your friends have had a fright remarked the sailor  they are easily frightened  are you hungry  yes i feel as if i could eat a white bear raw  so i expected returned the little woman with a laugh as she placed a platter of broiled meat before her guest who at once set to work  let us now return to ippegoo  having borrowed a sledge he had driven off to the appointed place of rendezvous before the arrival of rooney and angut as fast as the team could take him  arrived there he found ujarak awaiting him  you have failed said the wizard gravely  yes because nunaga had left with her father and mother and is now in the village  so is the kablunet  whatever ujarak might have felt he took good care that his countenance should not betray him  indeed this capacity to conceal his feelings under a calm exterior constituted a large element of the power which he had obtained over his fellows  without deigning a reply of any kind to his humble and humbled follower he stepped quietly into the sledge and drove away to the southward intending to rejoin the hunters  arrived at the ground he set off on foot over the ice until he found a seals breathinghole  here he arranged his spears erected a screen of snowblocks and sat down to watch  ippegoo he said at last breaking silence we must not be beaten  no that must not be replied his pupil firmly  this time we have failed continued the wizard because i did not think that okiok would leave his guest  i thought said ippegoo somewhat timidly that your torngak told you everything  you are a fool ippegoo  i know it master but can you not make me more wise by teaching me  some people are hard to teach said ujarak  that is also true returned the youth mournfully  i know that you can never make me an angekok  perhaps it would be better not to try  no  you are mistaken said the wizard in a more cheerful tone for he felt that he had gone too far  you will make a good enough angekok in time if you will only attend to what i say and be obedient  come i will explain to you  torngaks you must understand do not always tell all that they know  sometimes they leave the angekok dark for a purpose that is best known to themselves  but they always tell enough for the guidance of a wise man  butbuti am not a wise man you know ippegoo ventured to remark  true but when i have made you an angekok then you will become a wise mandont you see  as the word angekok signifies wise man ippegoo would have been a fool indeed had he failed to see the truism  the sight raised his spirits and made him look hopeful  well then stupid one speak not but listen  as i have before told you i love nunaga and nunaga loves me  ii thought she loved angut said ippegoo  o idiot exclaimed the wizard did i not tell you that you cannot understand  the loves of angekoks are not as the loves of ordinary men sometimes ones torngak makes the girl seem uncertain which man she likes best  yeyes but in this case there seems no uncertainty for she and angut  silence you worse than baby walrus  ippegoo shut his mouth and humbly drooped his eyelids  after a few minutes ujarak having swallowed his wrath continued in a calm tone  this time we have failed  next time we will be sure to succeed and  i suppose your torngak told  silence weakminded puffin thundered the wizard to the great astonishment of a seal which came up at that moment to breathe and prudently retired in time to save its life  once again the angekok with a mighty effort restrained his wrath and after a time resumed  now ippegoo we dare not venture again to try till after the feast for the suspicion which you have roused in angut by the foolish wagging of your tongue must be allowed to die out  but in the meantimethough you cannot must not speakyou can listen and you can get your mother to listen and when you hear anything that you think i ought to know you will tell me  but if said the pupil timidly i should only find out things that your torngak has already told you what  he stopped short for ujarak springing up walked smartly away leaving his follower behind to finish the question and gather up the spears  yes he is right  i am a fool murmured ippegoo  yet his conduct does seem strange  but he is an angekok  that must be the reason  consoling himself with this reflection the puzzled youth putting the spears and hunting tackle on his shoulders followed after his irate master towards the bay where the other hunters were encamped  we turn now to two other actors in our tale who although not very important characters deserve passing notice  when nunas youngest son little tumbler was brought to the eskimo village he made his appearance in the new black dress suit with which rooney had clothed himmuch to the surprise and delight of the whole community  not long after arriving he waddled away through the village in search of some piece of amusing mischief to do  on his ramble he fell in with a companion of about his own size whose costume was that of a woman in miniaturenamely a short coat with a fully developed tail which trailed on the ground with the approved fashionable swing this was none other than pussi the little daughter of simek the great hunter  now it chanced that there was a mutual likinga strong bond of sympathybetween tumbler and pussi which induced them always to play together when possible  no sooner therefore did tumbler catch sight of his friend than he ran after her grasped her greasy little hand and waddled away to do in company with her what mischief might chance to be possible at the time  immediately behind the village there stood a small iceberg which had grounded there some years before and was so little reduced in size or shape by the action of each brief summers sun that it had become to the people almost as familiar a landmark as the solid rocks  in this berg there was a beautiful seagreen cavern whose depths had never yet been fathomed  it was supposed to be haunted and was therefore visited only by the more daring and courageous among the children of the tribe tumbler and pussi were unquestionably the most daring among these partly owing to native bravery in both and partly to profound ignorance and inexperience of danger  lets go to ze geen cave suggested tumbler  pussi returned that most familiar of repliesa nod  we cannot of course convey the slightest idea of the infantine eskimo lisp  as before said we must be content with the nearest english equivalent  the green cave was not more than half a mile distant from the village to reach it the children had to get upon the seaice and this involved crossing what has been termed the icefootnamely that belt of broken up and shattered ice caused by the daily tidesat the point where the grounded ice meets that which is afloat  it is a chaotic belt varying in character and width according to position and depth of water and always more or less dangerous to the tender limbs of childhood  encountering thus an opportunity for mischievous daring at the very beginning of their ramble our jovial hero and heroine proceeded to cross with all the breathless silent and awesome delight that surrounds halfsuspected wickednessfor they were quite old enough to know that they were on forbidden ground  come yous not frighted said tumbler holding out his hand as he stood on the top of a block encouraging his companion to advance  nonot frifrightedbut  she caught the extended hand slipped her little foot and slid violently downward dragging the boy along with her  scrambling to their feet pussi looked inclined to whimper but as tumbler laughed heartily she thought better of it and joined him  few of the riven masses by which they were surrounded were much above five or six feet thick but as the children were short of stature the place seemed to the poor creatures an illimitable world of icy confusion and many were the slips glissades and semifalls which they experienced before reaching the other side  reach it they did however in a very panting and dishevelled condition and it said much for red rooneys tailoring capacity that the black dress coat was not riven to pieces in the process  look help me  shove me here said tumbler as he laid hold of a block which formed the last difficulty  pussi helped and shoved to the best of her small ability so that tumbler soon found himself on a ledge which communicated with the seaice  seizing pussi by her topknot of hair he hauled while she scrambled until he caught a hand then an arm then her tail finally one of her legs and at last deposited her flushed and panting at his side  after a few minutes rest they began to runperhaps it were more correct to say waddlein the direction of ze geen cave  now it chanced that the said cave was haunted at that time not by torngaks or other ghosts but by two men one of whom at least was filled with an evil spirit  ujarak having ascertained that okiok had joined the hunting party and that the kablunet had reached the village resolved to make a daring attempt to carry off the fair nunaga from the very midst of her female friends and for this purpose sought and found his dupe ippegoo whom he sent off to the green cave to await his arrival  we must not go together he said for we might be suspected but you will go off to hunt seals to the south and i will go out on the floes to consult my torngak  but master if i go to the south after seals how can we ever meet at the green cave  o stupid one  do you not understand that you are only to pretend to go south  when you are well out of sight then turn north and make for the berg  you will find me there  without further remark the stupid one went off and in process of time the master and pupil met at the appointed rendezvous  the entrance to the cavern was light owing to the transparency of the ice and farther in it assumed that lovely bluishgreen colour from which it derived its name but the profound depths which had never yet been fathomed were as black as ebonyforming a splendid background against which the icicles and crystal edges of the entrance were beautifully and sharply defined  retiring sufficiently far within this natural grotto to be safe from observation in the event of any one chancing to pass by the wizard looked earnestly into the anxious countenance of the young man  ippegoo he said with an air of unwonted solemnity for having made up his mind to a desperate venture the wizard wished to subdue his tool entirely as well as promptly to his will ippegoo my torngak says the thing must be done tonight if it is to be done at all  putting off he says will perhaps produce failure  perhaps echoed the youth with that perplexed look which so frequently crossed his features when the wizards words puzzled him  i thought that torngaks knew everything and never needed to say perhaps  you think too much said ujarak testily  was it not yesterday returned the pupil humbly that you told me to think well before speaking  true o simple one but there are times to think and times not to think  your misfortune is that you always do both at the wrong time and never do either at the right time  i wish returned ippegoo with a sigh that it were always the time not to think  how much pleasanter it would be  well it is time to listen just now said the wizard so give me your attention  i shall this night harness my dogs and carry off nunaga by force  and you must harness your dogs in another sledge and follow me  butbutmy mother murmured the youth  must be left behind said the wizard with tremendous decision and a dark frown but he had underestimated his tool who replied with decision quite equal to his own  that must not be  although taken much by surprise ujarak managed to dissemble  well then he said you must carry her away by force  that is impossible returned ippegoo with a faint smile and shake of the head  for the first time in his life the wizard lost all patience with his poor worshipper and was on the point of giving way to wrath when the sound of approaching footsteps outside the cave arrested him  not caring to be interrupted at that moment and without waiting to see who approached ujarak suddenly gave vent to a fearful intermittent yell which was well understood by all eskimos to be the laughter of a torngak or fiend and therefore calculated to scare away any one who approached  in the present instance it did so most effectually for poor little pussi and tumbler were already rather awed by the grandeur and mysterious appearance of the seagreen cave  turning instantly they fledor toddledon the wings of terror and with so little regard to personal safety that pussi found herself suddenly on the edge of an icecliff without the power to stop  tumbler however had himself more under command  he pulled up in time and caught hold of his companion by the tail but she being already on a steep gradient dragged her champion on and it is certain that both would have gone over the ice precipice and been killed if tumbler had not got both heels against an opportune lump of ice  holding on to the tail with heroic resolution while pussi was already swinging in midair the poor boy opened wide his eyes and mouth and gave vent to a series of yells so tremendous that the hearts of ujarak and ippegoo leaped into their throats as they rushed out of the cavern and hastened to the rescue  but another ear had been assailed by those cries  just as ippegoowho was fleeter than his mastercaught tumbler with one hand and pussis tail with the other and lifted both children out of danger reginald rooney who chanced to be wandering in the vicinity appeared in a state of great anxiety on the scene  glad am i you were in time ippegoo said the seaman shouldering the little girl while the young eskimo put the boy on his back but i thought that you and ujarak were away south with the hunters  what has brought you back so soon  nothing wrong i trust  no all goes well returned ippegoo as they went towards the village we have only come back toto  to make preparation for the feast when they return said the wizard coming quickly to the rescue of his unready follower  then they will be back immediately i suppose said rooney looking pointedly at the wizard  yes immediately answered ujarak without appearing to observe the pointed look unless something happens to detain them  suspecting that there was something behind this reply the sailor said no more  ujarak feeling that he was suspected and that his plan therefore must be given up for the time being determined to set himself to work to allay suspicion by making himself generally useful and giving himself up entirely to the festivities that were about to take place on the return of the men from their successful hunt    chapter ten  red rooney becomes a spectacle and then a president  late on the evening of the following day the furclad hunters arrived at their village with shouts of rejoicinghairy and happyfor they brought with them many a carcass of walrus and seal wherewith to replenish their wardrobes and larders and banish hunger and care from their dwellings for a considerable time to come  be not too ready most refined reader to condemn those people for their somewhat gross and low ideas of enjoyment  remember that they were to the manner born  consider also that things are not what they seem and that the difference between you and savages is in some very important respects at least not so great as would at first sight appear  you rejoice in literature music fine art etcetera but how about one or two oclock  would these afford you much satisfaction at such a time  bah you exclaim what a question  the animal wants must of course be supplied  true most refined one but a hunk of bread and a plate of soup would fully suffice for animal needs  would your refined pleasures have as keen a relish for you if you had only to look forward to bread and water between six and nine  answer ye sportsmen how would you get through your days work if there were not a glorious dinner at the end of it  speak ye ballroom frequenters how would you skip even with the light of brilliant eyes to encourage you if there were not what you call a jolly good supper somewhere in the background be honest all of you and confesswhat you tacitly and obviously admit by your actions every daythat our mere animal wants are of vast importance and that in our ministering to these the only difference between ourselves and the eskimos is a somewhat greater variety of viands a little less of toil in obtaining them a little more of refinement and cleanliness in the consumption of them and perchance a little less of appetite  we feel impelled thus to claim for our northern brothers some forbearance and a little genuine sympathy because we have to record that their first act on arriving was to fly to the cookinglamps and commence a feast which extended far into the night and finally terminated in lethargic repose  but this was not the feast to which we have more than once referred  it was merely a mild preliminary whet  the hunters were hungry and tired after their recent exertions as might have been expected and went in for refreshment with a will  they did not however forget the kablunet  eager expectation was on tiptoe and even hunger was forgotten for a short time in the desire to see the foreigner but okiok had made up his mind to give them only one glimpsea sort of moral appetiserand reserve the full display of his lion until the following day  just before arriving at the village therefore he called a halt and explained to the hunters that the kablunet had been very much wearied by his recent journey that he would not permit him to be disturbed that night but as he was to dwell with angut and was at that time in his okioks hut they would have an opportunity of seeing him during his brief passage from the one hut to the other  they were however to be very careful not to crowd upon him or question him and not to speak at allin short only to look  this having been settled and agreed to okiok pushed on alone in advance to prevent rooney from showing himself too soon  arriving at his town residence the eskimo found his guest asleep as usual for the poor seaman found that alternate food and repose were the best means for the recovery of lost vigour  nuna was quietly cooking the seamans next meal and nunaga was mending one of his garments when okiok entered  both held up a warning finger when he appeared  where is tumbler he asked softly looking round  gone to the hut of pussimek to play with pussi replied the wife we could not keep him quiet so we  she stopped and looked solemn for rooney moved  the talking had roused him  sitting up he looked gravely first at nunaga then at her mother then at her father after which he smiled mildly and yawned  so youve got back okiok  yes ridroonee  and all the hunters are coming with plenty to eat great plenty  the womens eyes seemed to sparkle at these words but they said nothing  thats a good job old boy said the seaman rising  i think ill go out and meet them  it will be dark in a short time  here okiok interposed with an earnest petition that he would not go out to the people that night explaining that if he were to sit with them during supper none except the gluttons would be able to eat  the rest would only wonder and stare  of course our seaman was amenable to reason  but he said with a humorous glance would it not be good for them especially for the gluttonsto be prevented from eating too much  it was evident from the blank look of his visage that okiok did not understand his guest  the idea of an eskimo eating too much had never before entered his imagination  how can a man eat too much he asked  until a man is quite full he is not satisfied  when he is quite full he wants no more he can hold no more  that says a good deal for eskimo digestion thought our hero but as he knew no native word for digestion he only laughed and expressed his readiness to act as his host wished  just then the noise of cracking whips and yelping dogs was heard outside  remain here said okiok i will come again  not long after the hospitable mans exit all the noise ceased but the seaman could hear murmuring voices and stealthy footsteps gathering round the hut  in a few minutes okiok returned  angut is now ready he said to receive you  the people will look at you as you pass but they will not disturb you  im ready to gothough sorry to leave nuna and nunaga said the gallant rooney rising  the sounds outside and okioks words had prepared him for some display of curiosity but he was quite taken aback by the sight that met his eyes on emerging from the tunnel for there in absolute silence with wide expectant eyes and mouths agape stood every man woman and child capable of motion in the eskimo village  they did not stand in a confused group but in two long lines with a space of four or five feet between thus forming a living lane extending from the door of okioks hut to that of angut which stood not far distant  at first our seaman felt an almost irresistible inclination to burst into a hearty fit of laughter there seemed something so absurdly solemn in this cumulative stare but good feeling fortunately checked him yet he walked with his host along the lane with such a genuine expression of glee and goodwill on his manly face that a softly uttered but universal and emphatic huk assured him he had made a good first impression  when he had entered the abode of angut a deep sigh of relief escaped from the multitude and they made up for their enforced silence by breaking into a gush of noisy conversation  in his new abode red rooney found angut and old kannoa with a blazing lamp and steaming stovekettle ready to receive him  few were the words of welcome uttered by angut for eskimos are not addicted to ceremonial nevertheless with the promptitude of one ever ready to learn he seized his visitors hand and shook it heartily in the manner which rooney had taught himwith the slight mistake that he shook it from side to side instead of up and down  at the same time he pointed to a deerskin seat on the raised floor of the hut where kannoa had already placed a stone dish of smoking viands  the smile which had overspread rooneys face at the handshaking faded away as he laid his hand on the old womans shoulder and stooping down gazed at her with an expression of great tenderness  ah  rooney what is there in that old wrinkled visage so scarred by the rude assaults of time yet with such a strong touch of pathos in the expression that causes thy broad bosom to swell and thine eagle eyes to moisten  does it remind thee of something very different yet wonderfully like in the old country  rooney never distinctly told what it was but as he had left a much loved grandmother at home we may be permitted to guess  from that hour he took a tender interest in that little old woman and somehowfrom the expression of his eye perhaps or the touch of his strong handthe old creature seemed to know it and chuckled in her own peculiar style immensely  for old kannoa had not been overburdened with demonstrative affection by the members of her tribe some of whom had even called her an old witcha name which had sent a thrill of great terror through her trembling old heart for the doom of witches in eskimo land in those days was very terrible  next day being that of the great feast the entire village bestirred itself with the first light of morning  men and women put on their best garments the lamps were kindled the cookingkettles put on and preparations generally commenced on a grand scale  awaking and stretching himself with his arms above his head and his mouth open young ermigit yawned vociferously  hah how strong i feel he said a white bear would be but a baby in my hands  going through a similar stretchyawny process his brother norrak said that he felt as if he had strength to turn a walrus inside out  come boys turn yourselves out o the house and help to cut up the meat  it is not wise to boast in the morning said okiok  true father returned norrak quietly but if we dont boast in the morning the men do it so much all the rest of the day that well have no chance  these two will be a match for you in talk before long remarked nuna after her sons had left  ay and also in body returned the father who was rather proud of his wellgrown boys  huk what is tumbler putting on he asked in astonishment  the dress that the kablunet made for him said nunaga with a merry laugh  doesnt it fit well  my only fear is that if arbalik sees him he will pierce him with a dart before discovering his mistake  what are you going to begin the day with asked nuna as she stirred her kettle  with a feed replied okiok glancing slyly at his better half  as if i didnt know that returned the wife  when did okiok ever do anything before having his morning feed  when he was starving retorted the husband promptly  this pleasantry was received with a giggle by the women  well father and what comes after the morning feed asked nunaga  kickball answered okiok  that is a hard game said the wife it makes even the young men blow like walruses  ay and eat like whales added the husband  and sleep like seals remarked nunaga  and snore likelike okioks said nuna  this was a hard hit being founded on some degree of truth and set okiok off in a roar of laughter  becoming suddenly serious he asked if anything had been seen the day before of ujarak the angekok  yes he was in the village in the evening replied nuna as she arranged the food on platters  he and ippegoo were found in the green cave yesterday by the kablunet  he was out about the iceheaps and came on them just as tumbler saved pussi and ippegoo saved them both  tumbler saved pussi exclaimed the eskimo looking first at his daughter and then at his wife  yes pussi was tumbling over an icecliff said nunaga and tumbler held on to her  by the tail said nuna  so ippegoo rushed out of the cave and saved them both  ujarak would have been too late  it seems strange to me that his torngak did not warn him in time  torngaks must be very hardhearted said okiok with a look and tone of contempt that he did not care to conceal  but what were they doing in the cave  who knows replied nuna  these two are always plotting  ridroonee says they looked as if worried at having been discovered  come fallto  you must be strong today if you would play kickball well  okiok glanced with a look of care upon his brow at nunaga shook his head gravely once or twice in silence and began breakfast  after the meal was over he sallied forth to join in the sports which were soon to begin  going first to the hut of angut he found the most of his countrymen and women surrounding red rooney who having finished breakfast was seated on a sledge conversing with angut and simek and others of the chief men of the tribe  all the rest were gazing and listening with greedy eyes and ears  hi  okiok exclaimed the sailor heartily as he rose and held out his hand which his former host shook heartily to the great surprise and delight of the crowd have you joined the gluttons that you take so long to your morning feed or have you slept longer than usual to make you a better match for the young men  no i was in dreamland answered the eskimo with profound gravity which his countrymen knew quite well was pretended and i met a torngak there who told me that the kablunet needed much sleep as well as food and must not be roused by me although other fools might disturb him  how kind of the torngak returned rooney  but he was not polite for if he spoke to you of other fools he must have thought of you as one fool  was he your own torngak  no i have no torngak  he was my grandmothers  and he told me that the kablunet was a great angekok and would have a torngak of his own soon  moreover he said the games must begin at onceso come along ippegoo  as he spoke okiok caught the slender youth in his powerful arms laid him gently on his back flung some snow in his face and then ran away  ippegoo entering at once into the spirit of the fun arose and gave chase  excelling in speed as much as his opponent did in strength the youth soon overtook him managed to trip him up and fell on the top of him  he was wildly cheered by the delighted crowd and tried to punish okiok but his efforts were not very successful for that worthy put both his mittened hands over his head and curling himself up like a hedgehog lay invulnerable on the ice  poor ippegoo had not strength either to uncoil or lift or even move his foe and failed to find a crevice in his hairy dress into which he might stuff snow  after a few minutes okiok straightened himself out jumped up and scurried off again over the ice in the direction of the berg of the green cave followed by the entire village  it was on a level field of ice close to the berg referred to that the game of kickball was to be played  as rooney was not yet strong enough to engage in rough play a pile of deerskins was placed on a point of the berg slightly higher than the heads of the people and he was requested to mount thereon  there as on a throne he presided over the games and became the gazingstock of the tribe during the intervals of play  but these intervals were not numerous or prolonged for most of the players were powerful men and boys so thoroughly inured by the nature of their lives to hardship and vigorous action in every possible position of body that their muscles were always in the condition of those of a welltrained athlete  even ippegoo with all his natural defects of mind and body was by no means contemptible as a player in those games especially which required agility and powers of endurance  first they had a game of handball  it was very simple  the players who were not selected but entered the lists at their own pleasure divided themselves into two parties which stood a little apart from each other  then an ordinary handball was tossed into the air by okiok who led one of the parties  simek the mighty hunter led the other  these men although approaching middle age were still at the height of their strength and activity and therefore fitting leaders of the younger men in this as well as the more serious affairs of life  it seemed to rooney at first as if okiok and his band were bent on having all the fun to themselves for they began to toss the ball to each other without any regard to their opponents  but suddenly simek and some of his best men made a rush into the midst of the other party with shouts and amazing bounds  their object was to catch or wrest the ball from okioks party and throw it into the midst of their own friends who would then begin to amuse themselves with it until their opponents succeeded in wresting it from them  of course this led to scenes of violent action and wild but goodhumoured excitement  wrestling and grasping each other were forbidden in this game but hustling tripping up pushing and charging were allowed so that the victory did not always incline either to the strong or the agile  and the difficulty of taking the ball from either party was much greater than one might suppose  for full half an hour they played with the utmost energy insomuch that they had to pause for a few seconds to recover breath  then with one accord eyes were turned to the president to see how he took it  delight filled every bosom for they saw that he was powerfully sympathetic  indeed rooney had become so excited as well as interested in the game that it was all he could do to restrain himself from leaping into the midst of the struggling mass and taking a part  he greeted the pause and the inquiring gaze with a true british cheer which additionally charmed as well as surprised the natives  but their period of rest was brief  simek had the ball at the time  he suddenly sent it with a wild huk hoooo whirling into the air  the kablunet was instantly forgotten the ball came straight down towards a clumsy young man who extended his hands clawlike to receive it  at that moment lppegoo launched himself like a thunderbolt into the small of the clumsy youths back and sent him sprawling on the snow amid shouts of laughter while norrak leaped neatly in and catching the ball as it rebounded sent it up again on the same side  as it went up straight and came down perpendicularly there was a concentric rush from all sides  ujarak chanced to be the buffer who received the shock and his big body was well able to sustain it  at the same moment he deftly caught the ball  ho his torngak helps him shouted okiok ironically  so he does cried the wizard with a scoffing laugh as he hurled the ball aloft why does not your torngak help you  there was a loud titter at this but the laugh was turned in favour of the other side when ermigit caught the ball and sent it over to the okiok band while their leader echoed the words so he does and spun the ball from him with such force that it flew over all heads and chanced to alight in the lap of red rooney  it could not have landed better for that worthy returned it as a pointblank shot which took full effect on the unexpectant nose of ermigit  the spirited lad was equal to the occasion  although water rose unbidden to his eyes he caught the ball and with a shout of laughter flung it into the midst of his own side  thus the play went on fast and furious until both sides were gasping  then with one consent they stopped for a more prolonged restfor there was no winning or losing at this game  their only aim was to see which side could get hold of the ball oftenest and keep it longest until all were exhausted  but the fun did not cease although the game did for another and quieter game of strength was instituted  the whole party drew closer round their president and many of them mounted to points of vantage on the berg on the sides of which groups of the women and children had already taken up positions  it may be remarked here that the snowcovered ice on which the game of ball had been played was like a sheet of white marble but not so hard for a heavy stamp with a heel could produce an indentation though no mark was left by the ordinary pressure of a foot  the competitors in the game of strength or rather of endurance were only two in number  one was okioks eldest son norrak the other the clumsy young man to whom reference has been already made  the former although the smaller and much the younger of the two was remarkably strong for his age  these two engaged in a singular style of boxing in which strange to say the combatants did not face each other nor did they guard or jump about  stripped to the waist like real heroes of the ring they walked up to each other and the clumsy youth turned his naked back to norrak who doubled his fist and gave him a sounding thump thereon  then norrak wheeled about and submitted to a blow which was delivered with such goodwill that he almost tumbled forward  again he turned about and the clumsy one presented his back a second time and thus they continued to pommel each others backs until they began to pant vehemently  at last norrak hit his adversary such a whack on the right shoulder that he absolutely spun him round and caused him to roll over on his back amid the plaudits of the assembly  the clumsy one rose with a somewhat confused look but was not allowed to continue the battle  there was no such thing as fighting it out to the bitter end among these hilarious eskimos  in fact they were playing not fighting  at this point simek approached rooney with a smiling countenance and said  there is another game of strength which we sometimes play and it is the custom to appoint a man to choose the players  will the kablunet act this part today  of course our seaman was quite ready to comply  after a few moments consideration he looked round with a spice of mischief in his heart but a smile on his countenance and said  what could be more agreeable than to see the striving of two such good friends as angut my host and ujarak the angekok  there was a sudden silence and opening of eyes at this for every one was well aware that a latent feeling of enmity existed between these two and their personal strength and courage being equally wellknown no one up to that time had ventured to pit these two against each other there was no help for it now however  they were bound in honour as well as by the laws of the community to enter into conflict  indeed they showed no inclination to avoid the trial for angut at once stepped quietly into the space in front of the president and began to strip off his upper garments while ujarak leaped forward with something of a bounce and did the same  they were splendid specimens of physical manhood both of them for their welltrained muscles lay bulging on their limbs in a way that would have gladdened the sculptors of hercules to behold  but there was a vast difference in the aspect of the two men  both were about equal in height and breadth of shoulder but angut was much the slimmer and more elegant about the waist as well as considerably lighter than his adversary  it was in the bearing of angut however that the chief difference lay  there was a refinement of physiognomy and a grace of motion about him of which the other was utterly destitute and it was plain that while the wizard was burning to come off victorious the other was only willing in a goodhumoured way to comply with the demands of custom  there was neither daring defiance contempt nor fear in his countenance which wore its wonted aspect of thoughtful serenity  after this description of the champions we feel almost unwilling to disappoint the reader by saying that the game or trial was the reverse of martial or noble  sitting down on the hard snow they linked their legs and arms together in a most indescribable manner and strove to outpull each other  there was indeed much more of the comic than the grand in this display yet as the struggle went on a feeling of breathless interest arose for it was not often that two such stalwart frames were seen in what appeared to be a mortal effort  the great muscles seemed to leap up from arm and thigh as each made sudden and desperate effortsright and leftsometimes pulling and sometimes pushing back in order to throw each other off guard while perspiration burst forth and stood in beads upon their foreheads  at last ujarak thrust his opponent back to the utmost extent of his long arms and with a sudden pull raised him almost to his feet  there was a gasp of excitement almost of regret among the onlookers for angut was a decided favourite  but the pull was not quite powerful enough  angut began to sink back to his old position  he seemed to feel that now or never was his chance taking advantage of his descending weight he added to it a wrench which seemed to sink his ten fingers into the flesh of ujaraks shoulders a momentary check threw the latter off his guard and next instant angut not only pulled him over but hurled him over his own head and rolled him like a porpoise on the snow  a mighty shout hailed the victory as the wizard arose and retired crestfallen from the scene while the victor gravely resumed his coat and mingled with the crowd  ujarak chanced in retiring to pass close to okiok  although naturally amiable that worthy feeling certain that the wizard was playing a double part and was actuated by sinister motives in some of his recent proceedings could not resist the temptation to whisper  was your torngak asleep that he failed to help you just now  the whisper was overheard by some of the women near who could not suppress a subdued laugh  the wizard who was not at that moment in a condition to take a jest with equanimity turned a fierce look upon okiok  i challenge you he said to a singing combat  with all my heart replied okiok when shall it be  tomorrow said the wizard sternly  tomorrow let it be returned okiok with the cool indifference of an arctic hunter to the immense delight of the women and others who heard the challenge and anticipated rare sport from the impending duel    chapter eleven  the hairy ones feast and are happy  lest the reader should anticipate from the conclusion of the last chapter that we are about to describe a scene of bloodshed and savagery we may as well explain in passing that the custom of duelling as practised among some tribes of the eskimos is entirely intellectual and well worthy of recommendation to those civilised nations which still cling fondly and foolishly to the rapier and pistol  if an eskimo of the region about which we write thinks himself aggrieved by another he challenges him to a singing and dancing combat  the idea of taking their revenge or satisfying their honour by risking their lives and proving their courage in mortal combat does not seem to have occurred to themprobably because the act would be without significance among men whose whole existence is passed in the daily risk of life and limb and proof of courage  certainly the singing combat has this advantage that intellect triumphs over mere brute force and the physically weak may prove to be more than a match for the strong  but as this duel was postponed to the following day for the very good reason that a hearty supper and night of social enjoyment had first to be disposed of we will turn again to the players on the icefloe  come angut said rooney descending from his throne or presidential chair and taking the arm of his host im getting cold sitting up there  let us have a walk together and explain to me the meaning of this challenge  they went off in the direction of the seagreen cave while simek organised a game of kickball  okiok tells me continued rooney that there is to be no fighting or bloodshed in the matter  how is that  angut expounded as we have already explained and then asked  have they no singing combats in your land  well not exactly at least not for the purpose of settling quarrels  how then are quarrels settled  by law sometimes and often by swordyou would call it spearand pistol  a pistol is a thing that spouts fire and kills  nations occasionally settle their quarrels in the same way and call it war  angut looked puzzledas well he might  when two men quarrel can killing do any good he asked  i fear not answered the seaman for the mere gratification of revenge is not good  but they do not always kill  they sometimes only wound slightly and then they say that honour is satisfied and they become friends  butbut said the still puzzled eskimo a wound cannot prove which quarreller is right  is it the one who wounds that is thought right  no  is it then the wounded one  o no  it is neither  the fact is the proving of who is right and who is wrong has nothing to do with the matter  all they want is to prove that they are both very brave  often when one is slightly woundedno matter whichthey say they are satisfied  with what are they satisfied  thats more than i can tell angut  but it is only a class of men called gentlemen who settle their quarrels thus  common fellows like me are supposed to have no honour worth fighting about  the eskimo looked at his companion supposing that he might be jesting but seeing that he was quite grave and earnest he rejoined in an undertone  then my thoughts have been wrong  in what respect angut  it has often come into my mind that the greatest fools in the world were to be found among the innuit but there must be greater fools in the lands you tell of  as he spoke the sound of childvoices arrested them and one was heard to utter the name of nunaga  the two men paused to listen  they were close to the entrance to the icecave which was on the side of the berg opposite to the spot where the games were being held and the voices were recognised as those of pussi and tumbler  with the indomitable perseverance that was natural to him the latter had made a second attempt to lead pussi to the cave and had been successful  what is he goin to do asked pussi in a voice of alarm  goin to run away vid sister nunaga replied tumbler  i heard ippegoo say dat to his mudder  ujarak is goin to take her away an nebber nebber come back no more  there was silence after this silence so dead and prolonged that the listeners began to wonder  it was suddenly broken  evidently the horrified pussi had been gathering up her utmost energies for there burst from the seagreen depths of the cave a roar of dismay so stupendous that angut and our seaman ran hastily forward under the impression that some accident had occurred but the children were sitting there all safetumbler gazing in surprise at his companion whose eyes were tight shut and her mouth wideopen  the truth is that pussi loved and was beloved by nunaga and the boys information had told upon her much more powerfully than he had expected of course tumbler was closely questioned by angut but beyond the scrap of information he had already given nothing more was to be gathered from him  the two friends were therefore obliged to rest content with the little they had learned which was enough to put them on their guard  ere long the sinking of the sun put an end to the games but not before the whole community had kickballed themselves into a state of utter incapacity for anything but feeding  to this process they now devoted themselves heart and soul by the light of the cookinglamps within the shelter of their huts  the feast was indeed a grand one  not only had they superabundance of the dishes which we have described in a previous chapter but several others of a nature so savoury as to be almost overpowering to the poor man who was the honoured guest of the evening  but red rooney laid strong constraint on himself and stood it bravely  there was something grandly picturesque and rembrandtish in the whole scene for the smoke of the lamps combined with the deep shadows of the rotund and hairy figures formed a background out of which the animated oily faces shone with ruddy and glittering effect  at first of course little sound was heard save the working of their jaws but as nature began to feel more than adequately supplied soft sighs began to be interpolated and murmuring conversation intervened then some of the more moderate began to dally with titbits and the buzz of conversation swelled  at this point rooney took tumbler on his knee and began to tempt him with savoury morsels  it is only just to the child who still wore his raven coat to say that he yielded readily to persuasion  rooney also amused and somewhat scandalised his friends by insisting on old kannoa sitting beside him  ho  ujarak at last shouted the jovial simek who was one of those genial uproarious loudlaughing spirits that can keep the fun of a social assembly going by the mere force and enthusiasm of his animal spirits come tell us about that wonderful bear you had such a fight with last moon you remember  remember exclaimed the wizard with a pleased look for there was nothing he liked better than to be called on to relate his adventures and it must be added that there was nothing he found easier for when his genuine adventures were not sufficiently telling he could without difficulty expand exaggerate modify or even invent so as to fit them for the ears of a fastidious company  remember he repeated in a loud voice which attracted all eyes and produced a sudden silence of course i remember  the difficulty with me is to forgetand i would that i could forgetfor the adventure was horrrible  a low murmur of curiosity hope and joyful expectation amounting to what we might style applause broke from the company as the wizard dwelt on the last word  you see eskimos love excitement fully as much as other people and as they have no spirituous drinks wherewith to render their festivities unnaturally hilarious they are obliged to have recourse to exciting tales comic songs games and other reasonable modes of creating that rapid flow of blood which is sometimes styled the feast of reason and the flow of soul  simeks soul flowed chiefly from his eyes and from his smiling lips in the form of hearty laughter and encouragement to othersfor in truth he was an unselfish man preferring rather to draw out his friends than to be drawn out by them  tell us all about it then ujarak he cried  come we are ready our ears are openyes they are very wide open  there was a slight titter at this sly reference to the magnitude of the lies that would have to be taken in but ujaraks vanity rendered him invulnerable to such light shafts  after glaring round with impressive solemnity so as to deepen the silence and intensify the expectation he began  it was about the time when the ravens lay their eggs and the small birds appear  my torngak had told me to go out on the ice far over the sea in a certain direction where i should find a great berg with many white peaks mounting up to the very sky  there he said i should find what i was to do  it was blowing hard at the time also snowing and freezing  i did not wish to go but an angekok must go forward and fear nothing when his torngak points the way  therefore i went  took no food no sleigh no dogs asked okiok in surprise  no  when it is a mans duty to obey he must not think of small things  it is the business of a wise man to do or to die  there was such an air of stern grandeur about ujarak as he gave utterance to this highflown sentiment that a murmur of approval burst from his believers who formed decidedly the greater part of the revellers and okiok hid his diminished head in the breast of his coat to conceal his laughter  i had no food with meonly my walrus spear and line continued the wizard  many times i was swept off my feet by the violence of the gale and once i was carried with such force towards a mass of upheaved ice that i expected to be dashed against it and killed but just as this was about to happen the  torngak helpedeh interrupted okiok with a simple look  no torngaks never help while we are above ground  they only advise and leave it to the angekoks wisdom and courage to do the rest retorted the wizard who although roused to wrath by these interruptions of okiok felt that his character would be damaged if he allowed the slightest appearance of it to escape him  when as i said i was about to be hurled against the berg of ice the wind seemed to bear me up  no doubt it was a long hollow at the foot of the ice that sent the wind upwards but my mind was quick  instead of resisting the impulse i made a bound and went up into the air and over the berg  it was a very low one added the wizard as a reply to some exclamations of extreme surprisenot unmingled with doubtfrom some of his audience  after that continued ujarak the air cleared a little and i could see a short way around me as i scudded on  small bergs were on every side of me  there were many white foxes crouching in the lee of these for shelter  among them i noticed some white bears  becoming tired of thus scudding before the wind i made a dash to one side to get under the shelter of a small berg and take rest  through the driving snow i could see the figure of a man crouching there before me  i ran to him and grasped his coat to check my speed  he stood upoh so high  it was not a man the wizard deepened his voice and slowed hereit wasawhitebear  huks and groans burst at this point from the audience who were covered with the perspiration of anxiety which would have been cold if the place had not been so warm  i turned and ran continued the angekok the bear followed  we came to a small hummock of ice  i doubled round it  the bear went past like one of arbaliks arrowssitting on its haunches and trying to stop itself in vain for the wind carried it on like an oomiak with the sail spread  when the bear stopped it turned back and soon came up with me for i had doubled and was by that time running nearly against the wind  then my courage rose  i resolved to face the monster with my walrus spear  it was a desperate venture but it was my duty  just then the snow partly ceased and i could see a berg with sloping sides perhaps i may find a point of vantage there that i have not on the flat ice i thought and away i ran for the sloping berg  it was rugged and broken  among its masses i managed to dodge the bear till i got to the top  here i resolved to stand and meet my foe but as i stood i saw that the other side of the berg had been partly melted by the sun  it was a clear steep slope from the top to the bottom  the bear was scrambling up foaming in its fury with its eyes glaring like living lamps and its red mouth agape  another thought came to mei have been quick of thought from my birth  just as the bear was rising to the attack i sat down on the slope and flew rather than slid to the bottom  it was an awful plunge  i almost shut my eyes in horrorbut butkept them open  at the bottom there was a curve like a frozen wave  i left the top of this curve and finished the descent in the air the crash at the end was awful but i survived it  there was no time for thought  i looked back  the bear as i expected had watched me in amazement and was preparing to followfor bears you know fear nothing  it sat down at the top of the slope and stuck its claws well into the ice in front of it  i ran back to the foot of the slope to meet it  its claws lost hold and it came down thundering like a huge round stone from a mountain side  i stood and measuring exactly its line of descent stuck the butt of my spear into the ice with the point sloping upwards  then i retired to see the end for i did not dare to stand near to it  it happened as i had wished the bear came straight on my spear  the point went in at the breastbone and came out at the small of the back but the bear was not checked  it went on taking the spear along with it and sending out streams of blood like the spouts of a dying whale  when at last it ceased to roll it lay stretched out upon the icedead  the wizard paused and looked round  there was a deepdrawn sigh as if the audience had been relieved from a severe strain of attention  and so they had and the wizard accepted that involuntary sigh as an evidence of the success of his effort to amuse  how big was that bear asked ippegoo gazing on his master with a look of envious admiration  how big repeated ujarak oh as bigfar bigger thanthanthe biggest bear i have ever seen  oh then it was an invisible bear was it asked okiok in surprise  how  what do you mean demanded the wizard with an air of what was meant for grave contempt  if it was bigger than the biggest bear you have ever seen replied okiok with a stupid look then you could not have seen it because you know it could not well be bigger than itself  huk thats true exclaimed one while others laughed heartily for eskimos dearly love a little banter  boh ba boo exclaimed simek after a sudden guffaw thats not equal to what i did to the walrus  did i ever tell it you friends but never mind whether i did or not  ill tell it to our guest the kablunet now  the jovial hunter was moved to this voluntary and abrupt offer of a story by his desire to prevent anything like angry feeling arising between okiok and the wizard  of course the company as well as rooney greeted the proposal with pleasure for although simek did not often tell of his own exploits and made no pretension to be a graphic storyteller they all knew that whatever he undertook he did passably well while his irrepressible goodhumour and hilarity threw a sort of halo round all that he said  well my friends it was a terrible business  simek paused and looked round on the company with a solemn stare which produced a smothered laughin some cases a little shriek of delight for every one except the wizard himself recognised in the look and manner an imitation of ujarak  a dreadful business continued simek but i got over it as you shall hear  i too have a torngak  you need not laugh my friends  it is true  he is only a little one howeverabout so high holding up his thumb and he never visits me except at night  one night he came to me as i was lying on my back gazing through a hole in the roof at our departed friends dancing in the sky  see note he sat down on the bridge of my nose and looked at me  i looked at him  then he changed his position sat down on my chin and looked at me over my nose  then he spoke  do you know whitebear bay he asked  know it said ido i know my own mother  what answer is that he said in surprise  then i remembered that torngaksespecially little onesdont understand jokes nothing but simple speech so i laughed  dont laugh he said your breath is strong  and that was true besides i had a bad cold at the time so i advised him to get off my chin for if i happened to cough he might fall in and be swallowed before i could prevent it  tell me said he with a frown do you know whitebear bay  yes said i in a shout that made him stagger  go there said he and you shall see a great walrus as big as one of the boats of the women  kill it  the cold getting bad at that moment i gave a tremendous sneeze which blew my torngak away  a shriek of delight especially from the children interrupted simek at this point  little tumbler who still sat on rooneys knee was the last to recover gravity and little pussi who still nestled beside nunaga nearly rolled on the floor from sympathy  before the story could be resumed one of the women announced that a favourite dish which had been for some time preparing was ready  the desire for that dish proving stronger than the desire for the story the company including simek set to work on it with as much gusto as if they had eaten nothing for hours past    note  such is the eskimo notion of the aurora borealis    chapter twelve  combines storytelling in both senses with fasting fun and more serious matters  the favourite dish having been disposed of simek continued his story  well said he after my little torngak had been blown away i waited a short time hoping that he would come back but he did not so i got up took a spear in my hand and went off to whitebear bay determined to see if the little spirit had spoken the truth  sure enough when i got to the bay there was the walrus sitting beside its hole and looking about in all directions as if it were expecting me  it was a giant walrus said simek lowering his remarkably deep voice to a sort of thunderous grumble that filled the hearts of his auditors with awe in spite of themselves amostawful walrus  it was biggerhere he looked pointedly at okiokthanthan the very biggest walrus i have ever seen  i have not much courage friends but i went forward and threw my spear at it  the listeners gasped it missed  they groaned then i turned and being filled with fear i ran  did you ever see me run  yes yes from the eager company  no my friends you never saw me run  anything you ever saw me do was mere walkingcreepingstanding still compared with what i did then on that occasion  you know i run fast  yes yes but that big walrus ran faster  it overtook me it overturned me it swallowed me  here simek paused as if to observe how many of them swallowed that and after all the appeal to their credulity was not as much overstrained as the civilised reader may fancy for in their superstitious beliefs eskimos held that there was one point in the training of a superior class of angekoks which necessitated the swallowing of the neophyte by a bear and his returning to his friends alive and well after the operation  besides simek had such an honest truthful expression of countenance and tone of voice that he could almost make people believe anything he chose to assert  some there were among his hearers who understood the man well and guessed what was coming others there were who having begun by thinking him in jest now grew serious under the impression that he was in earnest but by far the greater number believed every word he said  all however remained in expectant silence while he gravely went on  my friends you will not doubt me when i say that it was very hot inside of that walrus  i stripped myself but was still too hot  then i sat down on one of his ribs to think  suddenly it occurred to me to draw my knife and cut myself out  to my dismay i found that my knife had been lost in the struggle when i was swallowed  i was in despair for you all know my friends how impossible it is to cut up a walrus either from out or inside without a knife  in my agony i seized the monsters heart and tried to tear it but it was too hardhearted for that  the effort only made the creature tremble and jump which i found inconvenient  i also knew from the curious muffled sound outside that it was roaring  i sat down again on a rib to consider  if i had been a real angekok my torngak no doubt would have helped me at that timebut he did not  how could you have a torngak at all if you are not a real angekok demanded the wizard in a tone that savoured of contempt  you shall hear  patience returned simek quietly and then went on  i had not sat long when i knew by the motions of the beast that he was travelling over the iceno doubt making for his waterhole  if he gets into the sea i thought it will be the end of me  i knew of course that he could not breathe under water and that he could hold his breath so long that before he came up again for fresh air i should be suffocated  my feelings became dreadful  i hope my friends that you will never be in a situation like it  in my despair i rushed about from the head to the tail  i must have hurt him dreadfully in doing soat least i thought so from the way he jumped about  once or twice i was tossed from side to side as if he was rolling over  you know i am a man of tender heart  my wife says that so it must be true but my heart was hardened by that time i cared not  i cared for nothing  suddenly i saw a small sinew in the form of a loop close to the creatures tail  as a last hope without knowing why i seized it and tugged  the tail to my surprise came slightly inwards  i tugged again  it came further in  a new thought came to me suddenly  this was curious for you know that never since i was a little child have my thoughts been quick and very seldom new  but somehow the thought camewithout the aid of my torngak too  i tugged away at that tail with all my might  it came further and further in each tug  at last i got it in as far as the stomach  i was perspiring all over  suddenly i felt a terrific heave  i guessed what that was  the walrus was sick and was trying to vomit his own tail  it was awful  each heave brought me nearer to the mouth  but now the difficulty of moving the mass that i had managed to get inside had become so great that i felt the thing to be quite beyond my power and that i must leave the rest to nature still however i continued the tugging in order to keep up the sicknessalso to keep me employed for whenever i paused to recover breath i was forced to resume work to prevent my fainting away altogether being so terrified at the mere thought of my situation  to be inside a walrus is bad enough but to be inside of a sick walrusmy friends i cannot describe it  suddenly there was a heave that almost rent the ribs of the creature apart  like an arrow from a bow i was shot out upon the ice and with a clap like thunder that walrus turned inside out  and then said simek with glaring solemnity i awokefor it was all a dream  there was a gasp and cheer of delight at this mingled with prolonged laughter for now the most obtuse even among the children understood that simek had been indulging in a tale of the imagination while those whose wits were sharper saw and enjoyed the sly hits which had been launched at ujarak throughout  indeed the wizard himself condescended to smile at the conclusion for the tale being a dream removed from it the only objectionable part in his estimation namely that any torngak great or small would condescend to have intercourse with one who was not an angekok  now cried okiok starting up bring more meat we are hungry again  huk huk exclaimed the assenting company  and when we are stuffed continued okiok we will be glad to hear what the kablunet has to tell about his own land  the approval of this suggestion was so decided and hearty that red rooney felt it to be his duty to gratify his hospitable friends to the utmost of his power  accordingly he prepared himself while they were engaged with the second edition of supper  the task however proved to be surrounded with difficulties much greater than he had expected deeming it not only wise but polite to begin with something complimentary he said  my friends the innuits are a great people  they work hard they are strong and brave and have powerful wills  as these were facts which every one admitted and rooney uttered them with considerable emphasis and animation the statement of them was received with nods and huks and other marks of approval  the innuits are also hospitable he continued  a kablunet came to them starving dying  the great spirit who made us all and without whose permission nothing at all can happen sent okiok to help him okiok is kind so is his wife also his daughter  they took the poor kablunet to their house  they fedthey stuffedhim  now he is getting strong and will soon be able to join in kickball and pullover and he may perhaps before long teach your great angekok ujarak some things that he does not yet know  as this was said with a motion in one eye which strongly resembled a wink the audience burst into mingled applause and laughter  to some the idea of their wise man being taught anything by a poor benighted kablunet was ridiculous  to others the hope of seeing the wizards pride humbled was what is slangily termed nuts  ujarak himself took the remark in good part in consequence of the word great having been prefixed to his title  but continued the seaman with much earnestness having said that i am grateful i will not say more about the innuit just now  i will only tell you in few words some things about my own country which will interest you  i have been asked if we have big villages  yes my friends we have very big villagesso big that i fear you will find it difficult to understand what i say  the innuit have big understandings said simek with a bland smile describing a great circle with his outspread arms do not fear to try them  well one village we have resumed rooney is as broad as from here to the house of okiok under the great cliff and it is equally long  the huks and hois with which this was received proved that big as their understandings were the eskimos were not prepared to take in so vast an idea  moreover said the seaman because there is not enough of space the houses are built on the top of each otheronetwothreefoureven five and sixone standing on the other  as each number was named the eyes of the assembly opened wider with surprise until they could open no further  men women and children live in these houses and if you were to spread them all over the ice here away as far as you can see in every direction you would not be able to see the ice at all for the houses  what a liar murmured the mother of arbalik to the mother of ippegoo  dreadful responded the latter  moreover continued rooney these people can put their words and thoughts down on a substance called paper and send them to each other so that men and women who may be hundreds of miles away can talk with each other and understand what they say and think though they cannot hear or see each other and though their words and thoughts take days and moons to travel  the breathless eskimos glanced at each other and tried to open their eyes wider but having already reached the utmost limit they failed unfortunately at that moment our hero was so tickled by the appearance of the faces around him that he smiled  in a moment the eyes collapsed and the mouths opened  ha haaa roared simek rubbing his hands the kablunet is trying to beat my walrus  and he has succeeded cried angut who felt it his duty to stand up for the credit of his guest though he greatly wished that he had on this occasion confined himself to sober truth  a beaming expression forthwith took the place of surprise on every face as it suddenly dawned upon the company that ridroonee was to be classed with the funny dogs whose chief delight it is to recount fairy tales and other exaggerated stories with a view to make the men shout the women laugh and the children squeak with amusement  go on they cried tell us more  rooney at once perceived his mistake and the misfortune that had befallen him  his character for veracity was shaken  he felt that it would be better to say no more to leave what he had said to be regarded as a fairy tale and to confine himself entirely to simple matters such as an eskimo might credit  he looked at his friend angut  angut returned the look with profound gravity almost sorrow  evidently his faith in the kablunet was severely shaken  ill try them once more thought rooney  it wont do to have a vast range of subjects tabooed just because they wont believe  come ill try again  putting on a look of intense earnestness which was meant to carry irresistible conviction he continued  we have kayaksoomiaksin my country which are big enough to carry three or four times as many people as you have in this village  another roar of laughter greeted this statement  isnt he a good liar whispered arbaliks mother  and so grave about it too replied kunelik  red rooney stopped  the mother of ippegoo fearing he had divined her thoughts was overwhelmed and tried to hide her blushing face behind issek  they dont believe me said the seaman in a low voice to okiok  of course they dont  you might as well tell us that the world is round when we see that it is flat  rooney sighed  he felt depressed  the impossibility of his ever getting these people to understand or believe many things was forced upon him  the undisguised assurance that they looked upon him as the best liar they had ever met with was unsatisfactory  besides all this my friends he cried with a feeling and air of reckless gaiety we have grand feasts just as you have and games too and dances and songs  songs shouted simek with an excited look have you songs can you sing  well after a fashion i can returned rooney with a modest look though i dont pretend to be much of a dab at it  are you fond o singin  fond echoed simek with a gaze of enthusiasm i love it  i love it nearly as much as i love pussimek better far than i love blubber ho sing to us ridroonee  with all my heart said rooney starting off with all his lungpower which was by no means slight  rule britannia rendered in good time with tremendous energy and all the additional flourishes possible nearly drove the audience wild with delight  they had never heard anything like it before  that beats you okiok said simek  that is true replied okiok humbly  what does he sing asked rooney  yes he is our maker of songs and sings a little  then he must sing to me cried the sailor  in my land the man who sings last has the right to say who shall sing next  i demand a song from okiok  as the company approved highly of the demand and okiok was quite willing there was neither difficulty nor delay  the goodnatured man began at once with an air of humorous modesty if we may say so  eskimos as a rule are not highly poetical in their sentiments and their versification has not usually the grace of rhyme to render it agreeable but okiok was an exception to the rule in that he could compose verses in rhyme and was much esteemed because of this power in a tuneful and moderate voice he sang  of course being rendered into english his song necessarily loses much of its humour but that as every linguist knows is unavoidable  it was red rooney who translated it which will account for the slightly hibernian tone throughout  i fear also that rooney must have translated rather freely but of course at this late period of the worlds history it is impossible to ascertain anything certain on the point  we therefore give the song for what it is worth  okioks song    i    a seal once rowled upon the sea   beneath the shining sun   said i my friend this very day   your rowlin days are done   no no said he that must not be   and splashed the snowy foam   beneath the wave there wait for me   a wife and six at home    ii    a lie said i so you shall die   i launched my whistling spear   right up his nose the weapon goes   and out behind his ear   he looked reproachful then he sank   my heart was very sore   for down and down and down he went   i never saw him more    iii    then straight from out the sea arose   a female seal and six   o kill us now and let our blood   with that of fathers mix   we cannot hunt we dare not beg   to steal we will not try   theres nothing now that we can do   but blubber burst and die    iv    they seized my kayak by the point   they pulled me oer the sea   they led me to an island lone   and thus they spoke to me   bad man are there not bachelors   both old and young to spare   whom you might kill and eat your fill   for all the world would care    v    why stain your weapon with the blood   of one whose very life   was spent in trying to provide   for little ones and wife   they paused and wept and raised a howl   the youngest only squealed   it stirred the marrow in my bones   my very conscience reeled    vi    i fell at once upon my knees   i begged them to forgive   i said id stay and fish for them   as long as i should live   and marry me the widow cried   id rather not said i   but thats a point wed better leave   to talk of by and by    vii    i dwelt upon that island lone   for many a wretched year   serving that mother seal and six   with kayak line and spear   and strange to say the little ones   no bigger ever grew   but strangest sight of all they changed   from grey to brilliant blue    vii    o set me free  o set me free   i cried in my despair   for by enchantments unexplained   they held and kept me there   i will  but promise first she said   youll never more transfix   the father of a family   with little children six    ix    i promise  scarce the words had fled   when far upon the sea   careering gaily homeward went   my good kayak and me   a mist rolled off my wondring eyes   i heard my nuna scream   like simek with his walrus big   id only had a dream  the reception that this peculiar song met with was compound though enthusiastic  as we have said okiok was an original genius among his people who had never before heard the jingle of rhymes until he invented and introduced them  besides being struck by the novelty of his verses which greatly charmed them they seemed to be much impressed with the wickedness of killing the father of a family and some of the eskimo widows then present experienced probably for the first time in their lives a touch of sympathy with widowed seals who happened to have large families to provide for  but there was one member of the company whose thoughts and feelings were very differently affected by the song of this national poetthis eskimo burns or byronnamely the wizard ujarak  in a moment of reckless anger he had challenged okiok to combat and knowing that they would be called on to enter the arena and measure not swords but intellects on the morrow he felt ill at ease for he could not hope to come off victorious  if it had been the ordinary battle of wits in blank verse he might have had some chance he thought but with this new and telling jingle at the end of alternate lines he knew that he must of a surety fail  this was extremely galling because by the union of smartness shrewd common sense and at times judicious silence he had managed up to that time to maintain his supremacy among his fellows  but on this unlucky day he had been physically overcome by his rival angut and now there was the prospect of being intellectually beaten by okiok  strange thought the wizard i wonder if it was my intention to run away with nunaga that brought this disgrace upon me  it was said a voice very close to him  the wizard looked round quickly but no one seemed to be thinking of him  it was the voice of conscience  ujarak felt uneasy and stifled it at once  everybody can do that without much difficulty as the reader knows though nobody has ever yet succeeded in killing conscience outright  he then set himself to devise some plan for escaping from this duel  his imagination was fertile  while the revellers continued to amuse themselves with food and song and story the wizard took to thinking  no one thought his conduct strange or sought to disturb him for angekoks belong to a privileged class  but think as hard and as profoundly as he could no way of escape presented itself until the evening was far advanced and then without an appreciable effort of thought a door seemed to fly open and that door wasippegoo  yes thought the wizard that will do  nothing could be better ill make him an angekok  it may be needful to explain here that the creation of an angekok is a serious matter  it involves much ceremonial action on the part of him who operates and preparation on the part of him who is operated on moreover it is an important matter  when once it has been decided on nothing can be allowed to interfere with it  all other thingssave the unavoidable and urgentmust give way before it  he would announce it that very night  he would boldly omit some of the preliminary ceremonial  the morrow would be a day of preparation  next day would be the day of the ceremony of induction  after that it would be necessary for him to accompany the newmade wizard on his first journey to the realm of spirits  thus the singing duel would have to be delayed  ultimately he would manage to carry off nunaga to the land of the southern eskimo thus he would be able to escape the ordeal altogether and to laugh at okiok and his jingling rhymes  when he stood up and made the announcement declaring that his torngak had told him that another angekok must be created though who that other one was had not yet been revealed to him there was a slight feeling of disappointment for eskimos dearly love a musical combat but when he pointed out that after the ceremonies were over the singing duel might then come off the people became reconciled to the delay  being by that time exhausted in body and mind they soon after retired to rest  ere long oblivion brooded over the late hilarious crew who lay down like bundles of hair in their festal garments and the northern lights threw a flickering radiance over a scene of profound quietude and peace    chapter thirteen  mischief hatching  at early dawn next morning ippegoo was awakened from a most refreshing slumber by a gentle shake of the shoulder  oh not yet mother groaned the youth in the drowsiest of accents ive only just begun to sleep  he turned slowly on the other side and tried to continue his repose but another shake disturbed him and a deep voice said awake arise sleepy one  mother he murmured still half asleep you have got the throat ssickness vvvery bad referring to what we would style a cold  a grim smile played for a moment on the visage of the wizard as he gave the youth a most unmotherly shake and said yes my son i am very sick and want you to cure me  ippegoo was wide awake in a moment  rising with a somewhat abashed look he followed his evil genius out of the hut where in another compartment his mother lay openmouthed singing a song of welcome to the dawning day through her nose  ujarak led the youth to the berg with the seagreen cave  stopping at the entrance he turned a stern look on his pupil and pointing to the cavern uttered the single wordfollow  as ippegoo gazed into the seagreen depths of the placewhich darkened into absolute blackness with ghostly projections from the sides and dim icicles pendent from the invisible roof he felt a suspicion that the cave might be the vestibule to that dread world of the departed which he had often heard his master describe  youre not going far i hope he said anxiously remember i am not yet an angekok  true but you are yet a fool returned the wizard contemptuously  do you suppose i would lead you to certain death for no good end  no but i will make you an angekok tonight and after that we may explore the wonders of the spiritworld together  i have brought you here to speak about that for the ears of some people are very quick  we shall be safe here  you have been long enough a fool  the time has arrived when you must join the ranks of the wise men  come  again he pointed to the cave and led the way into its dim seagreen interior  some men seek eagerly after honours which they cannot win others have honours which they do not desire thrust upon them  ippegoo was of the latter class  he followed humbly and rather closely for the bare idea of being alone in such a place terrified him  although pronounced a fool the poor fellow was wise enough to perceive that he was utterly unfitted physically as well as mentally for the high honour to which ujarak destined him but he was so thoroughly under the power of his influence that he felt resistance or refusal to be impossible  he advanced therefore with a heavy heart  everything around was fitted to chill his ambition even if he had possessed any and to arouse the terrors of his weak and superstitious mind  when they had walked over the icy floor of the cave until the entrance behind them seemed no larger than a bright star the wizard stopped abruptly  ippegoo stumbled up against him with a gasp of alarm  the light was so feeble that surrounding objects were barely visible  great blocks and spires and angular fragments of ice projected into observation out of profound obscurity  overhead mighty and grotesque forms attached to the invisible roof seemed like creatures floating in the air to which an imagination much less active than that of ippegoo might easily have given grinning mouths and glaring eyes and the atmosphere of the place was so intensely cold that even eskimo garments could not prevent a shudder  the wizard turned on his victim a solemn gaze  as he stood facing the entrance of the cavern there was just light enough to render his teeth and the whites of his eyes visible though the rest of his features were shadowy  ippegoo he said in a low voice the time has come  at that moment a tremendous crash drowned his voice and seemed to rend the cavern in twain  the reverberating echoes had not ceased when a clap as of the loudest thunder seemed to burst their ears  it was followed for a few seconds by a pattering shower as of giant hail and ippegoos very marrow quailed  it was only a crack in the berg followed by the dislodgement of a great mass which fell from the roof to the floor belowfortunately at some distance from the spot on which the eskimos stood  bergs sometimes rend and fall asunder gasped the trembling youth  ujaraks voice was unwontedly solemn as he replied  not in the springtime foolish one  fear not but listen  tonight you must be prepared to go through the customs that will admit you to the ranks of the wise men  dont you think interposed the youth with a shiver that it would be better to try it on some one elseon angut or okiok or even norrak  norrak is a fine boy wellgrown and strong as well as clever and i am such a fool you know  you have said truth ippegoo  but all that will be changed tomorrow once an angekok your foolishness will depart and wisdom will come  the poor youth was much cheered by this because although he felt utterly unfit for the grave and responsible character he had enough of faith in his teacher to believe that the needed change would take placeand change he was well aware could achieve wonders  did he not see it when the change from summer to winter drove nearly all the birds away converted the liquid sea into a solid plain and turned the bright day into dismal night and did he not feel it when the returning summer changed all that again sent the sparkling waves for his light kayak to dance upon and the glorious sunshine to call back the feathered tribes to open the lovely flowers to melt the hard ice and gladden all the land  yes he knew well what change meant though it never occurred to him to connect all this with a creator who changes not  in this respect he resembled his master  besides continued the wizard in a more confidential tone which invariably had the effect of drawing the poor youths heart towards him i cannot make whom i will an angekok  it is my torngak who settles that i have only to obey  now what i want you to do is to become very solemn in your manner and speech from this moment till the deed is finished  will you remember  ippegoo hesitated a moment  he felt just then so unusually solemn that he had difficulty in conceiving it possible to become more so but remembering the change that was about to take place he said brightly yes ill remember  you see continued his instructor we must get people to suppose that you are troubled by a spirit of some sort  oh only to suppose it cried ippegoo hopefully  then im not really to be troubled with a spirit  of course you are foolish man  but dont you understand people must see that you are else how are they to know it  ippegoo thought that if he was really to be troubled in that way the only difficulty would be to prevent people from knowing it but observing that his master was getting angry he wisely held his tongue and listened with earnest attention while ujarak related the details of the ordeal through which he was about to pass  at the time this conversation was being held in the seagreen cave okiok rising from his lair with a prodigious yawn said to his wife  nuna i go to see kunelik  and what may yeaoumy husband want with the mother of ippegoo asked nuna sleepily but without moving  i want to yeaouask about her son  yeaaoou exclaimed nuna turning on her other side go then and she collapsed  seeing that his wife was unfit just then to enter into conversation okiok got up accomplished what little toilet he deemed necessary in half a minute and took his way to the hut of ippegoos mother  it is not usual in eskimo land to indulge in ceremonious salutation okiok was naturally a straightforward and brusque man  it will not therefore surprise any one to be told that he began his interview with  kunelik your son ippegoo is a lanky fool  he is assented kunelik with quiet goodhumour  he has given himself continued okiok spirit and body to that villain ujarak  he has assented kunelik again  where is he now  i do not know  but me knows said a small sweet little childvoice from the midst of a bundle of furs  it was the voice of pussi  that eskimo atom had been so overcome with sleep at the breaking up of the festivities of the previous night that she was unable to distinguish between those whom she loved and those for whom she cared not  in these circumstances she had seized the first motherly tail that came within her reach and followed it home  it chanced to belong to kunelik so she dropped down and slept beside her  you know my dear little seal said okiok in surprise  yes me knows  when i was sleep a big man comes an stump on my toesnot much only a leetle  dat wokes me an i see ujiyak  he shooks ipgoo an bose hoed out degidder  okiok looked at kunelik kunelik looked at okiok and both gravely shook their heads  before they could resume the conversation ippegoos voice was heard outside asking if his mother was in  go said kunelik though he is a fool he is wise enough to hold his tongue when any one but me is near  okiok took the hint rose at once and went out passing the youth as he entered and being much struck with the lugubrious solemnity of his visage  mother said ippegoo sitting down on a skin beside the pleasant little woman it comes  what comes my son  i know not  if you know not how do you know that it comes asked kunelik who was slightly alarmed by the wild manner and unusual almost dreadful gravity of her boy  it is useless to ask me mother  i do not understand  my mind cannot take it in butbutit comes  yes when is it coming asked kunelik who knew well how to humour him  how can i tell  ii think it has come now said the youth growing paler or rather greener i think i feel it in my breast  ujarak said the torngak would come today and tonight i am to bechanged  oho exclaimed kunelik with a slight touch of asperity its a torngak that is to come is it and ujarak says so  dont you know ippe that ujarak is an idiot  mother exclaimed the youth remonstratively ujarak an idiot impossible  he is to make me an angekok tonight  you ippe  you are not more fit for an angekok than i am for a sealhunter  yes true but i am to bechanged returned the youth with a bright look then remembering that his role was solemnity he dropped the corners of his mouth elongated his visage turned up his eyes and groaned  have you the stomach twist my boy asked his mother tenderly  no but i suppose iiam changing  no you are not ippe  i have seen many angekoks made  there will be no change till you have gone through the customs so make your mind easy and have something to eat  the youth having had no breakfast was ravenously hungry and as the process of feeding would not necessarily interfere with solemnity he agreed to the proposal with his accustomed look of satisfactionwhich however he suddenly nipped in the bud  then settingto with an expression that might have indicated the woes of a lifetime he made a hearty breakfast  thereafter he kept moving about the village all day in absolute silence and with a profound gloom on his face by which the risibility of some was tickled while not a few were more or less awestricken  it soon began to be rumoured that ippegoo was the angekokelect  in the afternoon ujarak returned from a visit as he said to the nether world and with his brother wizardsfor there were several in the tribe confirmed the rumour  as evening approached rooney entered okioks hut  no one was at home except nuna and tumbler  the latter was playing as usual with his little friend pussi  the goodwife was busy over the cookinglamp  where is your husband nuna asked the sailor sitting down on a walrus skull  out after seals  and nunaga  visiting the mother of arbalik  the seaman looked thoughtfully at the lampsmoke for a few moments  she is a hard woman that mother of arbalik he said  issek is not so hard as she looks returned mrs okiok her voice is rough but her heart is soft  im glad to hear you speak well of her said rooney for i dont like to think ill of any one if i can help it but sometimes i cant help it now theres your angekok ujarak i cannot think well of him  have you a good word to say in his favour  no not one  he is bad through and throughfrom the skin to the bone i know him well said nuna with a flourish of her cookingstick that almost overturned the lamp  but you may be mistaken remarked rooney smiling  you are mistaken even in the matter of his body to say nothing of his spirit  how so asked nuna quickly  you said he is bad through and through  from skin to bone is not through and through  to be quite correct you must go from skin to marrow  nuna acknowledged this by violently plunging her cookingstick into the pot  well now nuna continued rooney in a confidential tone tell me  at that moment he was interrupted by the entrance of the master of the mansion who quietly sat down on another skull close to his friend  i was just going to ask your wife okiok what she and you think of this business of making an angekok of poor ippegoo said rooney  we think it is like a seal with its tail where its head should be its skin in its stomach and all its bones outside all nonsense foolishness answered okiok with more of indignation in his look and tone than he was wont to display  then you dont believe in angekoks asked rooney  no replied the eskimo earnestly i dont  i think they are clever scoundrelsclever fools  and more i dont believe in torngaks or any other spirits  in that you are wrong said rooney  there is one great and good spirit who made and rules the universe  im not sure of that returned the eskimo with a somewhat dogged and perplexed look that showed the subject was not quite new to him  i never saw or heard or tasted or smelt or felt a spirit  how can i know anything about it  do you believe in your own spirit okiok  yes i must  i cannot help it  i am like other men  when a man dies there is something gone out of him  it must be his spirit  then you believe in other mens spirits as well as your own spirit said rooney though you have never seen heard tasted smelt or felt them  for a moment the eskimo was puzzled  then suddenly his countenance brightened  but i have felt my own he cried  i have felt it moving within me so that it made me act  my legs and arms and brain would not go into action if they were dead if the spirit had gone out of them  in the very same way replied the seaman you may feel the great spirit for your own spirit could not go into action so as to cause your body to act unless a greater spirit had given it life  so also we may feel or understand the great spirit when we look at the growing flowers and hear the moving winds and behold the shining stars and feel the beating of our own hearts  im not much of a wise man an angekok which they would call scholar in my countrybut i know enough to believe that it is only the fool who has said in his heart there is no great spirit  there is something in what you say returned the eskimo as the lines of unusually intense thought wrinkled his brow but for all that you say i think there are no torngaks and that ujarak is a liar as well as a fool  i agree with you okiok because i think you have good reason for your disbelief  in the first place it is wellknown that ujarak is a liar but that is not enough for liar though he be he sometimes tells the truth  then in the second place he is an asshum  i forgotyou dont know what an ass is well it dont matter for in the third place he never gave any proof to anybody of what he and his torngak are said to have seen and done and strongest reason of all this familiar spirit of his acts unwiselyfor what could be more foolish than to choose out of all the tribe a poor halfwitted creature like ippegoo for the next angekok  a gleaming glance of intelligent humour lighted up okioks face as he said  ujarak is wiser than his torngak in that  he wants to make use of the poor lad for his own wicked ends  i know not what these arebut i have my suspicions  so have i broke in nuna at this point giving her pot a rap with the cookingstick by way of emphasis  rooney laughed  you think he must be watched and his mischief prevented he said  thats what i think said okiok firmly  tell me what are the ceremonies to be gone through by that poor unwilling ippegoo before he can be changed into a wise man  oh he has much to do returned okiok with his eyes on the lampflame and his head a little on one side as if he were thinking  but i am puzzled  ujarak is cunning though he is not wise and i am quite sure he has some secret reason for hurrying on this business  he is changing the customs and that is never done for nothing  what customs has he changed asked rooney  the customs for the young angekok before he gets a torngak replied the eskimo  okioks further elucidation of this point was so complex that we prefer to give the reader our own explanation  before assuming the office of an angekok or diviner an eskimo must procure one of the spirits of the elements for his own particular familiar spirit or torngak  these spirits would appear to be somewhat coquettish and difficult to win and marvellous tales are related of the manner in which they are wooed  the aspirant must retire for a time to a desert place where entirely cut off from the society of his fellows he may give himself up to fasting and profound meditation  he also prays to torngarsuk to give him a torngak  this torngarsuk is the chief of the good spirits and dwells in a pleasant abode under the earth or sea  he is not however supposed to be god who is named pirksoma ie he that is above and about whom most eskimos profess to know nothing  as might be expected the weakness of body and agitation of mind resulting from such exercises carried on in solitude throw into disorder the imaginative faculty of the wouldbe diviner so that wonderful figures of men and monsters swim before his mental vision which tend to throw his body into convulsionsall the more that he labours to cherish and increase such symptoms  how far the aspirants themselves believe in these delusions it is impossible to tell but the fact that after their utmost efforts some of them fail to achieve the coveted office leads one to think that some of them are too honest or too strongminded to be led by them others however being either weak or doubleminded are successful they assert that on torngarsuk appearing in answer to their earnest petition they shriek aloud and die from fear  at the end of three days they come to life again and receive a torngak who takes them forthwith on a journey to heaven and hell after which they return home fullfledged angekoks prepared to bless their fellows and guide them with their counsels  now you must know said okiok after explaining all this what puzzles me is that ujarak intends to alter the customs at the beginning of the affair  ippegoo is to be made an angekok tonight and to be let off all the fasting and hard thinking and fits  if i believed in these things at all i should think him only a halfmade angekok  as it is i dont care a puff of wind what they make of poor ippegooso long as they dont kill him but im uneasy because im afraid the rascal ujarak has some bad end in view in all this  im quite sure of it muttered nuna making a stab with her stick at the contents of her pot as if ujaraks heart were inside  at that moment nunaga entered looking radiant in all the glory of a new undergarment of eiderduck pelts and a new sealskin upper coat with an extra long tail  have you seen angut lately asked rooney of the young girl  yes she replied with a modest smile that displayed her brilliant teeth he is in his own hut  i will go and talk with him on this matter okiok said the seaman meanwhile do you say nothing about it to any one    chapter fourteen  solemn and mysterious doings are brought to a violent close  angut was seated at the further end of his abode when his friend entered apparently absorbed in contemplation of that remarkable specimen of eskimo longevity the grandmother of okiok  i have often wondered said angut as the seaman sat down beside him at the contentment and goodhumour and cheerfulness sometimes running into fun of that poor old woman kannoa  speak lower said rooney in a soft voice she will hear you  if she does she will hear no evil  but she is nearly deaf and takes no notice  it may be so poor thing returned the sailor in a tender tone as he looked at the shrivelledup old creature who was moving actively round the neveridle lamp and bending with inquiring interest over the earthen pot which seemed to engross her entire being  but why do you wonder  i wonder because she has so little to make her contented and so much to ruin her goodhumour and cheerfulness and to stop her fun  her life is a hard one  she has few relations to care for her  she is very old and must soon grow feeble and then  and then said rooney as the other paused  then she knows not what follows deathwho does knowand she does not believe in the nonsense that our people invent  it is a great mystery  the eskimo said the last words in a low voice and with a wistful gaze as if he were rather communing with himself than conversing with his friend  rooney felt perplexed  the thoughts of angut were often too profound for him  not knowing what to say he changed the subject by mentioning the object of his visit  at once angut turned and gave undivided attention to the subject while the seaman described his recent conversation with okiok  as he concluded a peculiar look flitted across anguts countenance  i guess his reason he said  yes what may it be think you  he fears to meet okiok in a singing duel  rooney laughed  well you know best he said i daresay you are right  okiok is a sharp fellow and ujarak is but a blundering booby after  a low chuckle in the region of the lamp attracted their attention at this point  they looked quickly at kannoa but that ancients face was absolutely owlish in its gravity and her little black eyes peered into her pot with a look of intense inquiry that was almost philosophic resuming their belief that she was as deaf as a post or an iceberg rooney and angut proceeded to discuss ujarak and his probable plans without any regard to her  after having talked the matter over for some time angut shook his head and said that ujarak must be closely watched  more than that said rooney with decision he must be stultified  the seamans rendering of the word stultified into eskimo was curious and cannot easily be explained but it was well understood by angut and apparently by kannoa for another chuckle came just then from the culinary department  again the two men glanced at the old woman inquiringly and again were they baffled by that look of owlish intensity at the stewing meat  she hears whispered rooney  impossible replied angut a dead seal is not much deafer  continuing the conversation the seaman explained how he thought it possible to stultify the wizard by discrediting him in the eyes of his own peopleby foiling him with his own weaponsand himself undertook to accomplish the task of stultification  he was in the act of concluding his explanation when another chuckle burst upon them from the region of the lamp  this time there was no attempt at concealment for there stood old kannoa partly enveloped in savoury steam her head thrown back and her mouth wideopen  with a laugh rooney leaped up and caught her by the arm  youve heard what ive been saying mother  yeyes  ive heard she replied trying to smother the laughter  now look here  you must promise me not to tell anybody said the seaman earnestly almost sternly  oh i not tell returned the old woman i love not ujarak  ah just so then youre pretty safe not to tell said rooney  no fear of kannoa remarked angut with a pleasant nod she never tells anything to anybody  satisfied apparently with this assurance the seaman took the old woman into his counsels congratulating himself not a little on having found an ally in the very hut in which it had been arranged that the mysterious performance was to take place  shortly after that angut left  now kannoa said rooney after some preliminary talk you remember the big white bear that angut killed two moons ago  remember it  ay said kannoa licking her lips it was the fattest and best bear i ever chewed  huk it was good  well where is that bears skin  the old dame pointed to a corner of the hut where the skin lay  rooney went and picked it up and laid it at the upper end of the hut farthest from the door  now mother said he youll not touch that skin  let it lie there and let no one touch it till i come again  you understand  yes answered kannoa with a look so intensely knowing that it made the seaman laugh  but tell me said the old woman becoming suddenly grave and laying her thin scraggy hand on the mans arm why do you call me mother  oh its just a way we have in my country whenwhen we feel kindly to an old woman  and i do feel kindly to you kannoa he added with sudden warmth and energy of look and tone because you are so like my own grandmotheronly she was younger than you and much betterlooking  rooney meant no rudeness by the last remark but having observed the straightforward simplicity of his new friends in saying exactly what they meant he willingly adopted their style  kannoa seemed much pleased with the explanation  it is strange she said pathetically that i should find you so very like my husband  indeed returned the seaman who did not feel flattered by the compliment is it long since he died  o yes long longvery long she answered with a sigh  moons moons moons without number have passed since that day  he was as young as you when he was killed but a far finer man  his face did not look dirty like yoursall over with hair  it was smooth and fat and round and oily  his cheeks were plump and they would shine when the sun was up  he was also bigger than youhigher and wider  huk he was grand  although rooney felt inclined to laugh as he listened to this description he restrained himself when he observed the tears gathering in the old eyes  observing and appreciating the look of sympathy she tightened her clutch on the seamans arm and said looking wistfully up in his face  has ridroonee ever felt something in hereshe laid a hand on her withered bosomas if it broke in two and then went dead for evermore that is what i felt the day they brought my man home he was so kind like my son okiok and angut  as the seaman looked down at the pitiful old soul that had thus broken the floodgates of a long silence and was pouring out her confidences to him he felt an unusual lump in his throat  under a sudden impulse he stooped and kissed the wrinkled brow and then turning abruptly left the hut  it was well he did so for by that time it was nearly dark and kannoa had yet to arrange the place for the expected meeting  as the time drew near the night seemed to sympathise with the occasion for the sky became overcast with clouds which obliterated the stars and rendered it intensely dark  the chief performer in the approaching ceremony was in a fearful state of mind  he would have done or given anything to escape being made a wise man  but ujarak was inexorable  poor ippegoo sought comfort from his mother and to say truth kunelik did her best for him but she could not resist the decrees of fateie of the wizard  be a man my son and all will go well she said as he sat beside her in her hut with his chin on his breast and his thin hands clasped  o mother i am such a fool  he might let me off  ill be disgraced forever  not you ippe youre not half such a fool as he is  just go boldly and do your best  look as fierce and wild as you can and make awful faces  theres nothing like frightening people  howl as much as possible and gasp sometimes  i have seen a good deal done in that way i only wish they would try to make an angekok of me  i would astonish them  the plucky little woman had to stop here for a moment to chuckle at her own conceit but her poor son did not respond  he had got far beyond the point where a perception of the ludicrous is possible  but it is time to go now my son  dont forget your drum and the facemaking  you know what youve got to do  yes yes i know said ippegoo looking anxiously over his shoulder as if he half expected to see a torngak already approaching him i know only too well what ive got to do  ujarak has been stuffing it into me the whole day till my brain feels ready to burst  the bitter tone in which the poor youth pronounced his masters name suggested to his mother that it would not require much more to make the worm turn upon its tormentor  but the time had arrived to send him off so she was obliged to bring her questions and advices to an abrupt close  as ippegoo walked towards the dreaded hut he was conscious of many glaring eyes and whispered words around him  this happily had the effect of stirring up his pride and made him resolve to strive to do his part creditably  at the door of the hut two dark figures glided swiftly in before him one he could perceive was angut the other he thought looked very like the kablunet ridroonee  the thought gave him some comfortnot much indeed but anything that distracted his mind for an instant from the business in hand afforded him comfort  he now braced himself desperately to the work  seizing the drum which he had been told not to forget he struck it several times and began to twist his body about violently  there was just light enough to show to onlookers that the poor youth was whirling himself round in contortions of the most surprising kind  this he did for the purpose of working himself up to the proper pitch of enthusiasm  there seems little doubt that the mere exertion of great muscular effort coupled with a resolute wish and intention to succeed in some object has a powerful tendency to brace the energies of the human mind ippegoo had not contorted himself and beaten his drum for many minutes when his feeling of warmth and physical power began to increase  the feeling seemed to break on his mind as a revelation  ho he thought here it comes it comes at last  ujarak told the truthi am becoming one of the wise men  so delighted was the poor fellow with the idea and with the strong hope created thereby that his blood began to course more rapidly and his heart to beat high  under the impulse he gave vent to a yell that drew a nod of gratified approval from his mother and quite astonished those who knew him best  redoubling his twistings and drummings he soon wore himself out and ere long fell down in a state of temporary exhaustion  having thus according to instruction worked himself up to the proper pitch of enthusiasm ippegoo lay still and panted  ujarak then coming forward led him into anguts hut which was lighted as usual with several cookinglamps  the people flocked in after them till it was nearly full but spaces in the centre and upper end were kept comparatively free  near the lamp the kablunet was seen seated observing the proceedings with much gravity okiok sat near him  when all were seated the wizard led his pupil into the centre space and making him sit down bent him forward until his head was between his legs  he fastened it in that position and then tied his hands behind his back  all the lights were now extinguished for no one is allowed to witness the interview of the unfinished angekok with the torngak nor to move a finger for fear of disturbing him  the room being now in the state which is described as darkness just visible ippegoo began to sing a song in which all joined  presently he took to groaning by way of variety then he puffed and gasped and in a quavering voice entreated his torngak to come  spirits however like human creatures are not always open to entreaty  at all events ippegoos torngak refused to appear  in such circumstances it is usual for an aspirant to writhe about until he brings on a sort of fit during the continuance of which his soul goes off to fetch the obstinate torngak  after a short time he returns with him laughing loudly for joy while a rustling noise resembling the wings of birds as they swoop about the roof is heard  but ippegoo was not a sufficiently wise man to get through this part of the programme  true he wrought himself into a wonderful state of excitement and then humbly lay down on his side to have a fit  but the fit would not come  he tried his best to have it  he wished with all his heart for it but all his efforts were vain  o why wont you come to me torngak demanded the poor youth with a pitiful whine  because you are wise enough already said a low voice which startled the audience very much and sent a thrill of alarm not unmingled with surprise to the hearts of ippegoo and his master  the voice seemed to come from the outside of the hut  ask him to come inside and speak to us whispered ujarak who was a good deal more surprised even than his pupil at this unexpected turn of affairs  wont you come in torngak said ippegoo timidly  it is very cold outside  you will be more comfortable inside and we shall hear you better  i suppose you can come as easily through the wall as by  stop your stupid tongue growled ujarak  at that moment a deep unearthly voice was heard inside the hut  every one trembled and there ensued a silence so oppressive as to suggest the idea that all present were holding their breath and afraid to move even by a hairsbreadth  suddenly there was a faint murmur for at the upper end of the hut a dark form was seen slowly to arise  it must be remembered that there was barely light enough to render darkness visible  no features could be distinguished on this apparition but it gradually assumed the form of a gigantic bear rising nearly to the roof and with its great forelegs extended as if it were brooding over the assembly  every one remained perfectly still as if spellbound  only one of the audience was sceptical  being himself a master of deception ujarak suspected some trick and slowly approached the giant bear with the intention of testing its realityin some trepidation however for he was naturally superstitious  when he had drawn near enough to touch it he received a tremendous blow on the forehead which laid him flat on his back in a partially stunned condition with his head in pussimeks lap  that amiable woman considerately allowed it to remain there and as the wizard felt mentally confused he did not care to change his position  presently a low musical voice broke upon the assembly  we need scarcely say that it was that of our hero red rooney but so changed in character and tone as to be quite unrecognisable by the company most of whom indeed were not yet very familiar with it  even his more intimate friends angut and the okiok family were startled by it  in fact the seaman besides being something of a mimic possessed a metallic bass voice of profound depth which like most bass voices was capable of mounting into the higher latitudes of tone by means of a falsetto  he utilised his gifts on the present occasion  ippegoo he said solemnly and very slowly i am not your torngak  i am an angekok and as i chanced to be passing by your hut in my wanderings i stopped to hear  i have heard enough to be able to tell you that you shall never be an angekok  nor shall you ever have a torngak  you do not need one  you are wise enough already much wiser than your master who is no better than a miserable puffin  is it not the duty of one who would be an angekok to go away and live alone for many days fasting and praying and meditating  has not ujarak advised you to change the ancient customs  pooh he is a fool  you cannot succeed now  all the spirits of water earth and air have been insulted  this assembly must break up  you must leave off trying  you may all be thankful that the ice does not burst up and crush you that the sky does not fall upon you that the great sea does not roll its maddest waves over you  up all of youbegone  rooney finished off with a roar so deep and fearsome that the very rafters trembled  a pile of wood stones and earthenware previously prepared for the purpose was tipped over and fell with a most awful crash  at the same moment the seaman culminated in a falsetto shriek that might have shamed a steam whistle  it was enough  had the tunnel entrance of the hut been long and strong suffocation to many must have been the result for they went into it pellmell rolling rather than running  fortunately it was short and weak  ujarak and simek sticking in it burst it up and swept it away thus clearing the passage for the rest  the last to disappear was kunelik whose tail flapped on the doorpost like a small pistolshot as she doubled round it and scrambled out leaving rooney angut kannoa and ippegoo to enjoy the situation    chapter fifteen  a great singing duel interrupted by a catastrophe  when the lamps were rekindled by kannoa it was discovered that the old ladys nostrils were twitching and her throat contracting in a remarkable manner with smothered laughter  very different was the condition of ippegoo who still lay bound in the middle of the room fear and surprise in equal proportions seemed to have taken possession of him  rooney having dropped the bearskin approached him while angut stood beside the lamp looking on with a sort of serious smile  now ippegoo said the sailor stooping and cutting his bonds i set you free  it is to be hoped also that i have freed you from superstition  but where is the bearangekok asked the bewildered youth  i am the bearangekok  impossible cried ippegoo  to this rooney replied by going back to his bearskin spreading it over himself getting on a stool so as to tower upwards spreading out his long arms and saying in his deepest bass tones  now ippegoo do you believe me  a gleam of intelligence flashed on the youths countenance and at that moment he became more of a wise man than he had ever before been in his life for he not only had his eyes opened as to the ease with which some people can be deceived but had his confidence in the infallibility of his old tyrant completely shaken  he reasoned somewhat thus  if ujaraks torngak was good and true it would have told him of the deceit about to be practised on him and would not have allowed him to submit to disgrace  if it did not care it was a bad spirit  if it did not know it was no better than a man and not worth havingso i dont want to have one and am very glad i have escaped so well  the poor fellow shrank from adding ujarak must be a deceiver but he began to think that red rooney might not have been far wrong after all when he called him a fool  ippegoo was now warned that he must keep carefully out of the wizards way and tell no one of the deceit that had been practised  he promised most faithfully to tell no one and then went straight home and told his mother all about itfor it never for a moment occurred to the poor fellow to imagine that he was meant to conceal it from his mother  fortunately kunelik was a wise little woman  she knew how to keep her own counsel and did not even by nod or look insinuate to any one that she was in possession of a secret  now then angut what is the next thing to be done asked rooney after ippegoo had left  make ujarak fight his duel said angut  what the singing duel with okiok  yes  the people have set their hearts on the thing and ujarak will try to escape  he will perhaps say that his torngak has told him to go hunting tomorrow  but our customs require him to keep his word  my fear is that he will sneak off in the night  he is a sly fox  i will stop that said rooney  how  you shall see  come with me to the hut of ujarak  on reaching the hut they found its owner as had been expected sharpening his spears and making other arrangements for a hunting expedition  when do you start asked rooney  immediately replied the wizard  of course after the duel remarked angut quietly  the wizard seemed annoyed  it is unfortunate he said with a vexed look  my torngak has told me of a place where a great number of seals have come  they may leave soon and it would be such a pity to lose them  that is true said angut but of course you cannot break our customs it would ruin your character  of course of course i will not break the custom returned ujarak quickly unless indeed my torngak orders me to go  but that is not likely  i want to ask you said rooney sitting down about that trip you had last year to the land of the departed  they tell me you had a hard time of it ujarak and barely escaped with your life  the sly seaman had spread a net with which the wizard could at all times be easily caught  he had turned him on to a tune at which he was always willing to work with the persistency of an organgrinder  the wizard went on hour after hour with unwearied zeal in his narrations being incited thereto by a judicious question now and then from the seaman when he betrayed any symptom of flagging  at last angut who had often heard it before could stand it no longer and rose to depart  having already picked up the kablunets mode of salutation he held out his hand and said goonite  goodnight friend returned rooney grasping the proffered hand  i cant leave till ive heard the end of this most interesting story so ill just sleep in ujaraks hut if he will allow me and thus avoid disturbing you by coming in late  goodnight  goonite responded angut and vanished from the scene  the wizard heaved a sigh  he perceived that his little plan of gliding away in the hours of darkness was knocked on the head so like a true philosopher he resigned himself to the inevitable and consoled himself by plunging into intricacies of fabulous adventure with a fertility of imagination which surprised even himselfso powerful is the influence of a sympathetic listener  when ujarak at last discovered that his guest had fallen into a profound slumber he brought his amazing narrative to an abrupt close and wrapping himself in a reindeerskin resigned himself to that repose which was so much needed to fit him for the combat of the approaching day  it was a brilliant sunny morning when red rooney awoke from a startling dream in which he had been wrestling with monstrous creatures in the depths of ocean as well as in the bowels of the earth  the wizard was still locked in apparently dreamless slumber  unwilling to disturb him the seaman glided quietly out and clambered to the top of a cliff whence a magnificent seaview was revealed to his wondering gaze  there are times when the atmosphere of this earth seems to be rarefied and freshened with celestial zephyrs which not only half intoxicate the spirit but intensify the powers of hearing and vision so that gentle sounds which are very far off come floating to us and mingle softly with those that are near at hand while objects are seen at such immense distances that one feels as if the world itself had suddenly grown larger  to these influences were added on this occasion a sea which absolutely glittered with the icy gems that decked her calm and waveless bosom  it was not only that millions of white and glittering peaks with facets and edges gleaming like diamonds rose into the blue sky but here and there open lanes of water and elsewhere lakes and little ponds upon the melting ice caught the full orb of the rising sun and sent its reflection into the mans eyes with dazzling refulgence while the ripple or rush of iceborn waterfalls and the plaintive cries of wildfowl gave variety and animation to the scene  in a mind less religiously disposed than that of our seaman the sights and sounds would have irresistibly aroused grateful thoughts to our creator  on rooney the effect was almost overpowering yet strange to say it drew no word of thanksgiving from his lips  clasping his hands and shutting his eyes he muttered with bowed head the words god be merciful to me a sinner  perhaps the recognition of the fathers great goodness and condescension coupled with his own absolute unworthiness and the impulse which called those words forth was nearly the highest act of worship which the sailor could have offered  far below under the sheltering cliff the huts of the eskimo village could be seen like little black specks dotting the still snowcovered land and the voices of children could be heard in faint but merry shouts and peals of laughter as their owners like still smaller specks romped about  one of those specks rooney recognised from its intense blackness to be his friend tumbler and a smaller and lighter speck he guessed to be pussi from the circumstance of its persistently following and keeping close to the ravenclad hero  the pleased look with which rooney at first regarded the children slowly passed away and was replaced by one of profound sadness for how could he escape dejection when he thought of a sweet irish wife and little ones with a dear old grandmother whom he had left in the old country and who must long before that time have given him up as dead  his melancholy thoughts were dissipated by a sudden increase in the shouting of the little ones  on regarding them attentively he observed that they scattered themselves in the direction of the several huts and disappeared therein  well did rooney know that the movement meant breakfast and having a personal interest in that game he left his perch and the glorious view and hastened down  after breakfast the entire community went with one consent to witness the singing combat  it was to take place on the ice near the scene of the recent kickball game close to the berg of the seagreen cave  the people were much elated for these savages were probably as much influenced by brilliant spring weather as civilised folk are though not given to descant so much on their feelings  they were also in that cheerful frame of mind which results from what they correctly referred to as being stuffed besides much fun was expected from the contest lest our readers should anticipate similar delight we must repeat that eskimos are a simple folk and easily pleased  wont it be a tussle remarked issek who marched in the centre of a group of women  it will for ujarak is tough  he is like a walrus responded an admirer of the wizard  poo exclaimed the mother of ippegoo contemptuously he can indeed roar like the walrus but he can do nothing else  yes and his strength goes for nothing cried a sympathiser for it is his brain not his body that has got to work  we shall see said kabelaw whose sister remarkedif we are not blind  this mild observation was meant for a touch of pleasantry  little touches of pleasantry often passed between these lying sisters as they were called and they not infrequently culminated in touches of temper which must have been the reverse of pleasant to either  arrived at the arena a ring was formed and the wisdom as well as amiability of these poor people was shown by their putting the children in front the little women in the second row the tall women in the third and the men behind  in a few minutes ujarak bounded into the centre of the circle with a small drum or tambourine in one hand which he beat vigorously with the other  okiok followed more sedately armed with a similar musical instrument and retired to one side of the arena for the wizard perhaps because he was the challenger had the right to begin  a good authority on the eskimo tongue says the language is not easily translatable the brevity and force of a single sentence requiring to be rendered in many words of another tongue  the same authority also informs us that angekoks speak in a metaphorical style sometimes in order to exhibit their assumed superiority in learning and penetration it will not be expected therefore that our translation should convey more than a general idea of the combat  ujaraks first act after bounding into the ring and drumming was to glare at his adversary  okiok returned the glare with interest and being liberal threw a sneer of contempt into the bargain  ujarak then glared round at the audience and began his song which consisted merely of short periods without rhyme or measure but with a sort of rhythmic musical cadence  he commenced with the chorusamna ajah ajah hey which was vociferously repeated by his supporters among the audience  what these words meanwhether they represent our fal lal la or runity idditywe have not been able to ascertain but they came in at irregular intervals greatly to the satisfaction of the audience thus    amna ajah ajah hey   there was once a mana man   so it is said but we are not sure   a puffin perhaps he wasor a stupid spirit   made in the likeness of a man   amna ajah ajah hey  here the wizard not only accompanied the chorus with the drum but with a species of dance which being a clumsy man he performed in an extremely elephantine manner  after a few moments he went on    this manthis puffinwas a liar   a liar because he was a teller of lies   did he not one time say that seals had come   and that birds were in the air   and when we went to look no seals or birds were there   amna ajah ajah hey  the extreme vigour with which the last word was uttered resulted from the wizard having tripped in his dance and come down heavily on the ice to the immense delight of his opponents and the children  but ujarak rose and quelling the laugh with a look of dignity continued    worse than a liar was this foolish puffin   he hunted badly  when he flung the spear   the seals would laugh before they went away   sometimes he missed sometimes he tipped the nose   sometimes hit the wrong animal   and sometimes touched the tail   amna ajah ajah hey  this verse was a hit for okiok was known to be but an indifferent marksman with the throwingspear yet such was his industry and his ability to approach very near to his prey that he was the reverse of a bad hunter  but men in all lands are prone to shut their eyes to the good and to open them very wide to the evil that may be said of an adversary  consequently at this point the chorus was given with great vigour by the wizard faction and the wizard himself having worked himself into a breathless condition by the mental effort and the furious dance deemed it a fitting occasion to take his first rest  the custom in those duels is for each combatant to devote a quarter of an hour or so to the attack and then make way for his opponent who at once steps forward and begins his counterattack  after a short time he in like manner gives way and his foe returns  thus they proceed until one is exhausted or overwhelmed and he who has the last word gains the victory after which the dispute is held as settled and they frequently become better friends than before  there was something in the expression of okiok as he stepped sedately into the ring which gladdened his friends and distressed his opponents unlike the wizard he was well formed and all his movements were comparatively elegant so that in his case the conventional bit of dance at the end of periods was pleasant to the eye while his peculiar advantage of rhyming power rendered his performance grateful to the ear after a little drumming he began    why must i step within this ring   to jump and dance and drum and sing   you all know well that okiok   was never made an angekok   amna ajah ajah hey  amna ajah ajah hey yelled the hunters admirers with enthusiasm    but ujaraks the man of skill   to kick or wrestle sing or kill   he bids me meet him here today   poor okiok he must obey   my torngak come here i say   thus loud i cried the other day   you always come to ujarak   thou come to me my torngak   but he was deaf and would not hear   although i roared it in his ear   at last he said no okiok   for you are not an angekok   amna ajah ajah hey  here the hunter after a neat pirouette and tickling of the drum changed his tone to a soft insinuating whine    tis true im not an angekok   im only hunter okiok   but torngak dear torngak   dont go away  o do come back   if youll be mine and stick to me   for evermore ill stick to thee   and every single thing i do   ill come and ask advice from you   consult you morning noon and night   consult you when i hunt or fight   consult you when i sing and roar   consult you when i sleep and snore   consult you more than ujarak   my tortortortortorngak  a roar of laughter and a stupendous amna ajah ajah hey greeted this flight while okiok gravely touched his drum and performed a few more of his graceful evolutions    no no he said ill never make   so gross and stupid a mistake   one man there is who tried to do it   he thinks the spirits never knew it   he tried to make an angekokstew   out of a lad named ippegoo  here another yell of delight was followed by the chorus and okiok was about to resume when a terrific rending sound seemed to paralyse every one  well did they know that sound  it was the rending of the solid ice on which they stood  the advancing spring had so far weakened it that a huge cake had broken off from the landice and was now detached a shriek from some of the women drew attention to the fact that the disruption of the mass had so disturbed the equilibrium of the neighbouring berg that it was slowly toppling to its fall  a universal stampede instantly took place for the danger of being crushed by its falling cliffs and pinnacles was very great  everything but personal safety was forgotten in the panic that ensued  red rooney was almost swept off his legs in the rush  women and children were overturned but fortunately not hurt  a very few minutes sufficed to take them all clear of danger but the succeeding crashes produced such an inconceivable roar that the terrified villagers ran on until close to the place where the ice had cracked off and where a lane of water about three feet wide presented itself  over this went men women and children at a flying leapall except poor little pussi  that fat little thing would have been left behind had not the mere force of the rush carried her on in a half running half rolling way  being unable to manage the jump she went in with a plunge and disappeared  a wild scream from the nearest female caused every one to stop and run back  pussi exclaimed nunaga pointing wildly to the water  wherewhere did she go in cried rooney  she must have gone under the ice gasped the poor girl  as she spoke a bubble of air rose to the surface  next moment the seaman cleft the cold black water and disappeared  then with a thrill of alarm the eskimos observed that the great icecake which had broken off was being driven shoreward by the rising tide and that the lane of water was rapidly closing  but they were not kept long in suspense  another moment and rooney appeared with little pussi in his arms  they were instantly seized by okiok and angut and dragged violently outnot much too soon for only a few seconds after they were rescued the ice closed with a grinding crash that served to increase the fervency of the thank god with which the seaman hailed their deliverance  the child was not quite insensible though nearly so  rooney seized her in his arms and ran as fast as he could towards the village whither the fleetfooted ippegoo had already been sent to prepare skins and warm food for the reception of rescued and rescuer    chapter sixteen  the rebellion of the worm and the fall of the wizard  the event which had so suddenly interrupted the singing duel was a matter of secret satisfaction to ujarak for he felt that he was no match for okiok and although he had intended to fight the battle out to the best of his ability he knew that his ultimate defeat was so probable that its abrupt termination before that event was a piece of great goodfortune  still his position was unsatisfactory for in addition to the fact that his credit as a genuine angekok had been sadly shaken because of ippegoos failure he was well aware that the combat which had been interrupted was only postponed  what was to be done in the circumstances became therefore the urgent question of the hour  in great perplexity he sought out his poor victim ippegoowith something of the feeling no doubt that induces a drowning man to clutch at a strawand silently walked with him to a secluded spot near the neighbouring cliffs  ippegoo he said turning round abruptly it is certain that you will never be an angekok  i dont want to be one returned the simpleton quietly  the wizard looked at him in surprise  what do you mean he asked sharply  i mean that if the torngak you were going to get for me is no better than your own he is a fool and i would rather not have him  this unexpected rebellion of the worm which he had so often twisted round his finger was too much for ujarak in his then irascible condition  he flew into a violent rage grasped the handle of his knife and glared fiercely at his pupil  ippegoo returned the look with a quiet smile  this was perplexing  there are few things more trying to passionate men than uncertainty as to how their bursts of anger will be received  as a rule such men are merely actors  no doubt their rage may be genuine but the manner in which they will display their anger depends very much on who are their witnesses and what their opponents  rage which fumes at some trifling insult and tears off the coat resolved on fighting when a timid wife seeks to soothe is likely to assume a very different appearance and follow some other course of action when a prizefighter pulls the nose and invites it to do its worst  if ippegoo had winced or stood on the defensive or stepped back or shown the slightest sign of fear it is probable that the strong and lawless man would have stabbed him to the heart in the first impulse of his anger for the poor youth was well acquainted with all his secrets and most of his bad intentions  but the motionless figure and the smiling face not only surprisedit alarmedujarak  it seemed so unnatural  what powers of sudden onslaught might not lie hidden within that calm exterior what dynamitic capacities of swift explosion might not underlie that fearless expression  ippegoo he said stifling his anger with a painful effort are you going to turn against your best friend  my mother is my best friend answered the youth stoutly  you are right i made a mistake  why does your torngak let you make so many mistakes  again a rush of anger prompted the wizard to sacrifice his quondam pupil and once more the youths imperturbable coolness overawed him bad as he was ujarak could not kill a smiling victim  ippegoo said the wizard suddenly changing his tone and becoming intensely earnest i see what is the matter  angut and the kablunet have bewitched you  but now i tell my torngak to enter into your heart and unbewitch you  now do you not feel that he has done it  the youth still smiling shook his head  i knew it continued the wizard purposely misunderstanding the sign you are all right again  once more i lay my commands on you  listen i want you to go at once and tell nunaga that angut wants to see her alone  who asked ippegoo in surprise  angut  what your rival  yes my rival  my torngak tells me that angut wants to meet her alone mindout on the floes at puffin island this afternoon  areare you sure your torngak has made no mistake asked the youth with something of his old hesitancy  quite sure replied ujarak sternly  now will you give her my message  anguts message you mean  yes yes i mean anguts message said the wizard impatiently youll be sure to do what i tell you wont you  quite sure replied ippegoo the smile again overspreading his visage as he turned and quitted the spot  half an hour later he entered okioks hut in quest of nunaga but only her mother was there  she told him that the girl had gone off with a sledge along the coast to moss bay to fetch a load of moss to stuff between the logs of the hut where they required repairing and that she had taken kabelaw as well as tumbler and pussi with her  thats good said ippegoo then she cant and wont go to puffin island  i said i would tell her that angut wants to meet her there alone  who told you to tell her that asked nuna  a fool answered ippegoo promptly  he must indeed have been a fool returned nuna for angut has just been helping nunaga to harness the dogs and he is now with my husband in his own hut  this information caused the messenger to shut his eyes open his mouth and laugh silently with evident enjoyment  i intended to deliver my message he said on recovering composure for i promised to do so and i also meant to tell nunaga that the message was a big lie  at this amazing depth of slyness on his part ippegoo fell into another hearty though inaudible laugh after which he went off to communicate his news to okiok and angut but these worthies having gone out to visit some snares and traps no one knew whither he was obliged to seek counsel of simek  on hearing of the plot that seemed to be hatching that jovial hunter at once ordered his sledge to be got ready and started off with two stalwart sons and his nephew arbalik for moss bay to warn nunaga of her enemys intentions and to fetch her home  but alas for even the best laid of human plans  it so happened that one of the eskimo youths who was rather inclined to tease nunaga had set a snowtrap for arctic foxes about two miles from the village  as the spot was not much out of the way the girl resolved to turn aside and visit the trap take out the fox if one chanced to be caught and in any case set the trap off or put a bit of stick into it by way of fun  the spot chanced to be only a short distance beyond the place where the wizard had met ippegoo but the seashore there was so covered with hummocks of ice that nunaga had approached without being observed by either the wizard or the pupil  it was not more than a few minutes after ippegoo had left on his errand to herself that she came suddenly in sight of ujarak  he was seated as if in contemplation on a rock at the base of the cliff  suspecting no evil nunaga stopped her team of dogs  it was her fathers best team consisting of the swiftest and most enduring animals in the village  the wizard observed this as he rose up and approached rejoicing to think that fortune had favoured him  and truly fortuneor rather godwas indeed favouring the wicked man at that time though not in the way that he imagined  in a few moments ujaraks plans were laid  the opportunity was too good to be lost  where goes nunaga today he asked quietly on reaching the sledge  to moss bay answered nunaga  has nunaga forgotten the road asked ujarak with a slight look of surprise  this is not the way to moss bay  it is not far out of the way said kabelaw who was the more selfassertive of the two lying sisters we go to visit a trap and have no time to waste with you  as she spoke she seized the heavy eskimo whip out of nunagas hand and brought it smartly down on the backs of the whole team which started off with a yelp and also with a bound that wellnigh left tumbler and pussi behind  but she was not quick enough for ujarak who exclaimed with a laugh as he leaped on to the sledge and assumed the place of driver  i too am fond of trapping and will go with you  he took the whip from kabelaw and guided the team  a few minutes at the speed they were going brought them close to a point or cape which in the form of a frowning cliff two or three hundred feet high jutted out into the sea  to round this and place the great cape between them and the village was ujaraks aim  the ice was comparatively smooth and unbroken close to the land  see exclaimed nunaga pointing towards the bushes on shore the trap is there  that is the place  ujarak paid no heed to her  the die was cast  he had taken the first step and must now go through with it at all hazards  plying the cruel whip so as to make the dogs run at their utmost speed he drove on until the other side of the cape was gained  then he relaxed the speed a little for he knew that no shriek however loud could penetrate the cliffs that lay between him and the eskimo village  taking up a walrusline with a running noose on it that lay on the sledge beside him the wizard turned dropped the noose suddenly over kabelaw and drew it tight so as to pin her arms to her sides  almost before she could realise what had occurred he took a quick turn of the same line round nunaga drew the girls together and fastened them to the sledge  they knew now full well but too late that ujarak meant mischief  screaming at the utmost pitch of their voices they struggled to free themselves but were too well secured for that  the wizard now glanced at the children  for a few moments he was perplexed  they could be of no use on a long journey and might be troublesomebesides they would have to be fed  there was one sure and easy method of getting rid of them  he grasped his knifehandle  the women observed the movement and became instantly silent with horror  but the bold free air of tumbler and the soft innocent look of pussi were too much for the wizard  he abandoned the halfformed thought and turning to the women said in a low stern voice  if you cry or struggle again these shall die  this was enough  the poor creatures remained perfectly silent and still after that while the wizard guided the dogs out upon the floes on a totally different route from that which led to moss bay  coming to a place where the ice had been cut up into many tracks by the eskimos sledges during the winter work of traffic to and from the huntinggrounds ujarak availed himself of the opportunity to lose as it were his own track among the others so that in the sure event of pursuit the pursuers might be effectually baffled  the only point he had to consider after that was the necessity of diverging from the track with such care that the point of divergence should be impossible to find  in this he was again favoured by circumstances  having driven at full speed straight out from the land in a westerly direction he came to a place where the ice had been considerably broken up so that the old tracks ended abruptly in many places where lanes of water had opened up a sharp frost had set these lanes and open spaces fast again and the new ice was just strong enough to bear a sledge  there was some risk in venturing on it but what of that  nothing bold can be successfully carried out in this world without more or less of risk  at a spot where the confusion of tracks was very great he turned at a sharp angle got upon a sheet of new ice and went off at greater speed than ever towards the farsouth  his aim was to travel some hundreds of miles till he reached the kablunet settlements on the southwestern shores of greenland in regard to which various and strange reports had reached the northern eskimos from time to time  he said nothing however to his captives but after driving some twenty miles or sowhich he did in a couple of hourshe cast off their bonds and bade them make themselves comfortable  the poor creatures were only too glad to avail themselves of the permission for although spring had set in and the cold was not very severe their constrained position had benumbed their limbs  tumbler and pussi after gazing for a considerable time at each other in a state of blank amazement at the whole proceedings had finally dropped off to sleep on a pile of deerskins  nunaga and kabelaw wrapping themselves in two of these leaned against each other and conversed in low whispers  and now the wizard began in good earnest a journey which was destined to lead him in more ways than one far beyond the point at which he originally aimed  he plied the whip with vigour for well did he know that it was a race for life  if any of the men of his tribe should overtake him he felt assured that death would be his portion  the dogs as we have said were splendid animals  there were ten of them resembling wolves both in size and appearance each being fastened to the sledge by a single independent line  the vehicle itself was okioks huntingsledge having spears bow and arrows lines bladders etcetera attached to it so that although there were no provisions on it except one small seal which its owner had probably thought was not worth removing the wizard knew that he possessed all the requisites for procuring a supply  the women being also well aware of this were filled with anxiety for their one hope of rescue lay in their friends discovering their flight and engaging in instant and hot pursuit  never since the commencement of his career had ujarak displayed such anxiety to increase the distance between himself and his tribe  never since that longlashed shorthandled heavy whip was made had it given forth such a rapid series of pistollike reports and never since they were pups had those ten lanky wolfish dogs stretched out their long legs and scampered over the arctic sea as they did on that occasion  the old ice was still sufficiently firm and smooth to afford a good road and the new ice was fortunately strong enough to bear for the pace was tremendous  with the world before him where to choose and death as he imagined on the track behind the wizards spirit had risen to the point of neck or nothing  mile after mile was passed at highest speed and in perfect silence except when broken by the crack of whip and yelp of dogs  occasional roughnesses in the way were crashed over  small obstructions were taken in flying leaps which rendered it necessary for the poor women to cling to each other to the sledge and to the children to prevent their being hurled off  once or twice a hummock which it seemed possible to leap turned out to be too high and obliged the driver to turn aside with such violence that the sledge went for a few seconds on one runner and all but turned over  this at last induced some degree of caution for to break the vehicle at the beginning of the journey would have been almost certainly fatal to the enterprise  and oh how earnestly nunaga longed for a spill  in her despair poor thing it did not occur to her that at such a pace an upset might break the necks of the whole party  towards sunset they rounded a high cape beyond which was a deep and wide bay  on this the sun shone apparently on what appeared to be open water  for one moment a look of alarm flitted over the wizards face as he glanced quickly shoreward to see whether the groundice was passable but it was only for a moment for immediately he perceived that the light had dazzled and deceived him  it was not water but new icesmooth and refulgent as a mirror  the fringe of old ice on shore was disrupted and impassable  there was therefore only one course open to him  knitting his brows and clenching his teeth ujarak resolved to take it at all hazards  bringing the cruel lash to bear with extreme violence he sent the dogs howling out upon the glassy surface  at first they slipped and sprawled a good deal but soon gathered themselves well together  they were accustomed to such work and the friction of the sledge being reduced they skimmed along with ease  although strong enough to bear the ice undulated terribly as they swept over it and sent forth rending sounds which cannot be conceived by those whose experience of young ice has been derived chiefly from lakelets and ponds  dogs in such circumstances are apt to become terrified and to stop in which case immersion is almost certain  but ujarak gave his team no time to think  with lash and voice he urged them on until they were nearly frantic  the undulations became greater as they advanced and the rending sounds continuous  still the wizard plied his whip and shouted  indeed it was his only chance  at the other side of the bay the old ice still adhered to the shore  if that could be reached they would be safe  eagerly the women strained their eyes and even stretched out their hands as if to grasp the shore for the fear of instant death had banished all other thoughts  a few minutes more and ujarak standing up in his eagerness flourishing the great whip and shouting at the pitch of his voice drove the yelling dogs off the crackling sheet of ice to a place of safety on the solid floe  it did not require the wizards altered tone to inform the sagacious animals that the danger was past  down they flopped at once to rest panting vehemently and with tongues out but they were not permitted to rest long ujaraks fear of pursuit was so great  even while securing on the sledge the articles that had been disarranged he could not help casting frequent suspicious glances in the direction from which they had come for guilt is ever ready to anticipate retribution even when it is far distant  as soon as the fastenings were arranged he prepared to continue the flight  where do you take us to asked kabelaw in a tone of humility which was very foreign to her nature  you shall know that in time was the stern reply  nunaga was too much frightened to speak but little tumbler was not  badbad man he exclaimed with a fierce look that caused the wizard for a moment to smile grimly  little pussi was so horrified at the reckless presumption of the remark that she hid her face in nunagas lap and did not venture to look up for some time  getting on the sledge without another word the wizard gave a hint to the dogs which was so unmistakable that they sprang up and resumed their journey at full gallop  slowly the sun went down and sea and berg and snowclad cliff grew grey in the light of departing day  still the panting team sped on over the frozen sea  soon it became too dark to travel with safety  the pace was slackened  the run became a canter then a trot and then a walk  at last the driver stopped jumped off the sledge and ordered the women to get out the seal and feed the dogs he also gave them permission to help themselves but as there was no lamp or fire it was evident that he meant them to eat their supper raw  leaving them while thus engaged he walked away out of sight  i wont have raw seal said tumbler in that tone of petulant resolve which tells of spoiltchildism  an me wont too said pussi profiting by example  but theres nothing else said nunaga gently  yes there is  i have got some cold seal in my bootsfrom this mornings breakfast said kabelaw extracting a goodlysized morsel i never go on a journey however short without a bit of cooked meat  lest the reader should be perplexed here we may explain that some eskimo ladies often make the wide tops of their long sealskin boots do duty for pockets  the party was still engaged in discussing the delicacy referred to and commenting in pitiable tones on their situation when ujarak returned bade them resume their places jumped on the sledge and continued to advance  in half an hour the moon rose in a clear sky  the stars shone brightly and to add to the beauty of the scene the aurora borealis played and shot about vividly overhead enabling them to resume a rapid gallop  it was not till the night was far advanced and his dogs were nearly wornout and full sixty miles lay between him and his native village that ujarak felt himself to be comparatively safe and halted for a prolonged rest  without a word he made for himself a shelter with a bearskin under a low bush devoured a lump of raw seals flesh and then went to sleep leaving the women to look after themselves the dogs and the children as best they might  fortunately they were well able to do so and being very weary were not long in doing it  while they went about the work however they could not help remarking the unusually morose and surly manner of their master and expressed the opinion that he was already troubled with that mental complaint to which we give the name of remorse  and they were right  bad as the wizard was he had hitherto kept within the bounds of eskimo propriety but now at last he had overstepped those bounds and become a criminalan outlaw  by one hasty act he had cut for ever the cords which had united him to his kindred    chapter seventeen  tells of despair and a wild pursuit  on discovering that nunaga and the children were not at moss bay and that there were no fresh sledge tracks in that region to tell of their whereabouts simek drove back to the village at a wild scamper in a state of mind very much the reverse of jovial  his hope was that the girl might have been to some other locality and had perhaps returned during his absence but the first glance at nuna put that hope to flight for the poor woman was in a state of terrible anxiety  cheery little kunelik and her mild son did their best to comfort her but without success for she knew well the determined character of the man who had probably carried off her children  has she not come back demanded simek appearing like an infuriated polar bear at the inside opening of the passage to okioks mansion  no gasped nuna  simek said no more but backed out faster than he had come in  ippegoo followed him  run ippe tell all the men to get all their sledges and dogs ready and come here to me  ippegoo ran off at once while the energetic hunter rearranged the fastenings of his own sledge and team as if for a long journey  he was thus engaged when okiok and angut were seen approaching the village at an easy trot  evidently they knew nothing of what had occurred  simek ran out to meet them  a few words sufficed to explain the news seemed to stun both men at first but the aftereffect on each was wonderfully different  the blood rushed to okioks face like a torrent  he clenched his hands and teeth glared and stamped and went on like one derangedas indeed for the moment he was  angut on the other hand was perfectly selfpossessed and subdued but his heaving chest quivering nostrils compressed lips and frowning brows told that a volcano of emotion raged within  turning suddenly to okiok he seized him by both arms as if his hands were vices  listen he said with a sort of subdued intensity that had the effect of quieting his friend get out your sledge and dogs  all are ready interposed simek eagerly  angut waited for no more but leaving his friends ran off at full speed towards the village  okiok and simek leaped on their respective sledges and followed  on arriving it was found that most of the active men of the tribe were already assembled with dogs harnessed provisions and huntinggear strapped down and all ready for a journey of any length  to these angut gave directions in a tone and manner that deeply impressed his friends  not that he was loud or eager or violent on the contrary he was unusually calm but deadly pale and with an air of tremendous resolution about him that made the men listen intently and obey with promptitude  in a very few minutes he had sent off one and another in almost every direction with instructions where to go what to do and how and when to return in the event of failure  then he leaped on his own sledge and turned to red rooney who was standing by  ridroonee he said in a somewhat sad tone i go to find nunaga  if i succeed not you will see me no more  he held out his hand to take farewell in the kablunets fashion  what say you exclaimed rooney taken by surprise nonsense see you nopoohhold on a bit  he ran into his friends hut and quickly returned with his bearskin sleepingbag and a small wallet which contained his little all  now then he cried jumping on the sledge away you go as soon as you like  im with ee lad  angut shook his head  but the kablunet is not yet strong enough to travel said the eskimo doubtfully  the kablunet is strong enough to pitch you over his head and hell do it too if you dont drive on  with another doubtful look and shake of the head angut seized his whip the dogs knowing the signal well sprang up  at that moment angut observed the little eyes of kannoa peering at him wistfully  come he said holding out a hand  the old womans visage beamed with joy as she seized the hand and scrambled on the sledge  then the lash came round with the wonted crack  the dogs winced but did not suffer for angut was merciful to his beasts and away they went at full speedokiok having dashed off in similar fashion with his two sons and simek in another direction a few minutes before them  north south east and west on land and sea did those eskimos search for tracks of the fugitives but the whole immediate neighbourhood was so cut up in all directions by the daily outgoing and incoming of their own hunters that the discovering of a special track was not easyindeed almost impossible  all day they sped over the ice and snow in widening circles  when night came they waited till the moon arose and then continued the search  it was not till the forenoon of the following day that the unsuccessful searchers began to drop in one by one wornout and disheartened  nuna and the other women had breakfast ready for them  little was said for the women were depressed and the men after eating immediately sought muchneeded repose  it was nearly evening before okiok and his sons returned  no sign anywhere he said in reply to his poor wifes mute inquiry ippegoo he added turning to the youth whose woebegone expression at another time would have been ludicrous i will sleep for some time let the dogs be well fed all round and be ready to start with me when the moon rises  without another word he stretched himself on the floor pillowed his head on a deerskin and went to sleep almost on the instant  meanwhile angut had driven straight to moss bay  his search was not one of a wild haphazard nature  despite the agitation of his breast his mind was clear and his head cool  judging that nunaga must at least have started for her intended destination whatever might afterwards have induced her to change her mind he drove slowly along observing with a lynx eye everything that looked in the slightest degree like a divergence from the route  the consequence was that on reaching the place where the divergence had actually taken place he pulled up and got off the sledge to examine  youre right remarked rooney who accompanied his friend while old kannoa remained with the dogs  its easy to see that a sledge has turned off here  quite easy responded the eskimo with suppressed eagerness we will follow  running back they turned the dogs into the fresh track and soon came to the place where ujarak had joined the women  angut pointed to the footprints with a gleam of unusual ferocity in his eyes  for some time they could easily follow the track and went along at a rapid pace but when it led them to the point where it joined other tracks the difficulty of following became great  of course angut at once understood the object of this ruse and became more attentive to every mark that seemed in the remotest degree to indicate another divergence but failed to hit upon the spot and finally came to a halt when far out on the floes where drift had obliterated the old sledgemarks and a recent track could not have escaped notice  then he made a wide circular sweep which was meant to cut across all the tracks that radiated from the village  in this manoeuvre he was more successful  towards evening he came upon a recent track which led straight to the southward  got him at last exclaimed rooney with a shout of excitement and satisfaction  i think so said angut as he went down on his knees and carefully examined the marks on the floe  his opinion was clearly shown by his starting up suddenly jumping on the sledge again flourishing his whip savagely and setting off at a pace that obliged rooney to seize the lashings with both hands and hold on tight  old kannoa did the same and stuck to the sledge like a limpet with her chin resting on her knees and her sharp little eyes gazing anxiously ahead  soon they came to the rough ground that had tried the quality of the wizards sledge and the vehicle bumped over the ice at such a rate that the poor old woman was almost pitched out  hallo hold on cried rooney as they went over a hummock with a crash that made kannoa gasp youll kill the poor thing if you  he stopped short for another crash almost tumbled himself over the stern of the vehicle  angut was roused to desperation  he scarcely knew what he was doing as he lashed the yelping team furiously hoping that when he should pass the cape ahead of him he would come in sight of the fugitives  here catch hold of me old woman cried rooney putting an arm round the poor creatures waist sit on my legs  theyll act something like a buffer to your old bones  kannoa gave a sort of lively chuckle at the novelty of the situation let go her hold of the sledge and made a sudden plunge at rooney grasping him tight round the neck with both arms  she was little more than a baby in the seamans huge grasp nevertheless having only one arm to spare and with a sledge that not only bumped but swung about like a wild thing he found her quite as much as he could manage  the night had fairly set in when the cape was rounded so that nothing could be distinguished not even the track they had been followingand travelling became dangerous  no use to push on angut remarked rooney as his friend pulled up we must have patience  yes the moon will be up soon returned his friend we will now rest and feed  the resting meant sitting there in the dark on the side of the sleigh and the feeding consisted in devouring a lump of seals flesh raw although not very palatable this was eminently profitable food as angut well knew  as for rooney he had learned by that time to eat whatever came in his way with thankfulnesswhen hungry and not to eat at all when otherwise  the moon rose at last and revealed the sheet of glassy ice which had previously disconcerted ujarak  angut also beheld it with much concern and went on foot to examine it  he returned with an anxious look  they have crossed he said moodily but the ice has cracked much and my sledge is i fear heavier than theirs  we can walk you know and so lighten it said rooney  no it is only by a dash at full speed that we can do it  will my friend run the risk  he would not be your friend if he were not willing returned the seaman gravely but what about kannoa  its not fair to risk her life  we cannot leave her behind said angut with a perplexed glance at the cowering figure on the sledge  she could not return to the village on foot  that would be greater risk to her than going on with us  at this point the old woman looked up with a sort of pleasant grin and croaked  kannoa is not heavy  take her with you  she is quite willing to live or die with angut and ridroonee  with a slight smile the eskimo resumed his place and whip  rooney patted kannoa on the head as he sat down beside her and called her a brave old girl  another moment and the dogs were out on the glassy plain galloping as well as they could and yelping as much from fear of the rending and bending ice as the cracking whip  they had not advanced twenty yards when one of the sledgerunners broke through  this brought them to a sudden halt  next moment the sledge went down and angut found himself struggling with the dogs in the sea fortunately rooney being near the back part of the sledge was able to roll off in a sort of backsomersault before the vehicle was quite submerged  even in the act he did not forget kannoa  he made a blind grasp at her in passing but found her not for that remarkable woman at the first alarm and being well aware of what was coming had sprawled off at the rear and was already on the ice in safety  the two now set to work to rescue angut and the dogs  the former had cut the latter free from the sledge so that it was not difficult to haul them out along with their master  for it must be remembered that although the thin ice had failed to bear the sledge it was sufficiently strong to support the individuals singly  to get the sledge out of the water was however a matter of much greater difficulty but they accomplished it in the course of an hour or so  the process of doing this helped to dry anguts garments which was fortunate  it was also fortunate that the sharp spring frost which had set fast the space of open water had by that time given way so that there was no fear of evil consequences from the ducking either to dogs or man  but now came the serious question what was to be done  it is of no use trying it again said angut in a frame of mind amounting almost to despair  could we not send kannoa back with the sledge and you and i make sail after them on foot asked rooney  angut shook his head despondingly  of no use he said they have the best dogs in our village  as well might a rabbit pursue a deer  no there is but one course  the landice is impassable but the floes out on the sea seem still to be fast  if they break up while we are on them we shall be lost  will ridroonee agree to take old kannoa back to her friends and i will go forward with the sledge alone  what say you kannoa asked rooney turning to the old woman with a halfhumorous look  kannoa says she will live or die with angut and ridroonee she replied firmly  youre a trump exclaimed the seaman in english  then turning to the eskimo  you see angut its impossible to get rid of us so up anchor my boy and off we go seaward  the truth is i ought to feel more in my element when we get out to sea  seeing that they were resolved angut made no further objection but directing the dogs heads away from the land flourished his long whip over them and set off at as breakneck a pace as before over the seaward icefloes    chapter eighteen  a terrible encounter disastrous results and singular termination  let us return now to the wizard and his captives  after travelling for several days at the utmost possible speed the guilty man began to feel at ease as regarded pursuit and commenced to advance at a more reasonable rate giving the poor dogs time for sufficient rest and going out once or twice on the floes to procure fresh supplies of sealflesh for himself and his party  the thaw which had by that time set steadily in had not broken up the old ice to the southward so that no more thin ice or open water was met with  but although he had thus begun to take things more easily ujarak did not by any means waste time  the wretched man was very morose even savage insomuch that he would scarcely reply to the questions which were timidly put to him at times by the women  it was evident that he repented of his hasty flight and no doubt was rendered desperate by the reflection that the matter was by that time past remedy  one morning on rounding one of those bluff precipitous capes which jut out from the western coast of greenland into baffins bay they came unexpectedly in sight of a band of eskimos who were travelling northwards  ujarak pulled up at once and for some moments seemed uncertain what to do  he had not yet been observed so that there was a possibility of turning aside if he were so disposed and hiding among the rugged masses of ice which lined the bottom of the cliffs  before he could make up his mind however on the subject a loud shout from the eskimos showed that he had been observed  turning sharply and with a savage scowl to the women he said in a low voice  if you say that i have run away with you i will kill you and the children  a smile of contempt flickered on the face of kabelaw at the moment observing it the wizard added  there will be no escape for you  your death will be certain for even if these people were to kill me and carry you back to the village my torngak would follow you and kill you  he said no more for he knew well that he had said enough  at first sight of the eskimo band kabelaws heart had leaped for joy because she at once made up her mind to explain how matters stood and claim protection which she had no doubt they would grant  but some eskimos not less than many civilised people are deeply imbued with superstition and the bare idea of an invisible torngak pursuing her to the deathin the possibility of which she and nunaga more or less believedwas too much for her  in fear and trembling she made up her mind to be silent and submit to her fate  it need scarcely be added so did her more timid companion  where do you come from asked the leader of the party when they met  from the faraway there replied the wily wizard pointing northward  i do not ask where you come from  why not demanded the leader in some surprise  because i know already answered ujarak that you come from the faraway there pointing southward and i know that because i am an angekok  you have come from a spot near to the land where the kablunets have settled and you are bringing iron and other things to exchange with my kinsmen for horns of the narwhal and tusks of the walrus  knowing as he did from rumour that eskimos from the moravian settlements were in the habit of travelling northward for the purposes of barter though they had not up to that time travelled so far north as his own tribe and observing bundles of hoopiron on the sledges it did not require much penetration on the part of a quick mind like that of ujarak to guess whence the strangers had come and what their object was nevertheless the leader and most of the party who had circled round the wizard and his sledge opened their eyes in amazement at this smart statement of their affairs  my brother must indeed be a great angekok for he seems to know all things  but we did not come from near the land where the kablunets have built their huts  we have come from it said the matteroffact leader  did i not say that returned ujarak promptly  no you said near itwhereas we came from it from inside of itself  inside of itself must be very near it surely retorted the wizard with a grave look of appeal to those around him  a laugh and nod of approval was the reply for eskimos appreciate even the small end of a joke however poor and often allow it to sway their judgment more powerfully than the best of reasoningin which characteristic do they not strongly resemble some people who ought to know better  the matteroffact leader smiled grimly and made no further objection to the wizards claim to correct intelligence  now continued ujarak for he felt the importance of at once taking and keeping the upper hand my tribe is not far from here but they are going away on a hunting expedition so you must lose no time else they will be gone before you arrive  they want iron very much  they have horns and tusks in plenty  they will be glad to see you  my torngak told me you were coming so i came out a long way to meet you  i brought my wives and children with me because i want to visit the kablunets and inquire about their new religion  he paused for a moment or two to let his tissue of lies have full effect but the very matteroffact leader took advantage of the pause to ask how it was that if he ujarak had been told by his torngak of the coming of the trading party he had failed to tell his tribe not to go on a hunting expedition but to await their arrival  ha ho exclaimed several of the eskimos turning a sharp gaze upon the wizard as much as to say theres a puzzler for you angekok  but ujarak although pulled up for a moment was not to be overturned easily  torngaks he said do not always reveal all they know at once  if they did angekoks would only have to listen to all they had to tell on every subject and there would be an end of it they would have no occasion to use their judgments at all  no the torngaks tell what they choose by degrees  mine told me to leave my tribe and visit the kablunets  on the way he told me more but not all  this explanation seemed quite satisfactory to some but not to all of them  seeing this the wizard hastened to turn their minds from the subject by asking how far it was to the land of the kablunets  four suns journey replied the leader  it is the same to the village of my kindred exclaimed ujarak getting quickly on his sledge  i must hasten on and so must you  time must not be wasted  with a flourish of his whip he started his team at full speed scattering the eskimos right and left and scouring over the ice like the wind  for a moment or two the leader of the band thought of pursuit but seeing at a glance that none of his teams were equal to that of ujarak and feeling perhaps that it might be dangerous to pursue an angekok he gave up the idea and resumed his northward route  for two days more the wizard continued his journey encamping each night at sunset eating his supper apart making his bed of bearskins in the lee of a shrub or under the shelter of an overhanging cliff and leaving his captives to make themselves comfortable as best they could on the sledge  this they did without difficulty all of them being well accustomed to rough it and having plenty of bear and deerskins to keep them warm  the dogs also contributed to this end by crowding round the party with deep humility of expression as close as they were allowed to come  at the end of these two days an incident occurred which totally changed the aspect of affairs  on the morning of the third day they started with the dawn and drove steadily southward for a couple of hours  they had just traversed a small bay and were close to the high cape which formed its southern extremity when one of the bars of the sledge broke rendering a halt necessary  breaking the gloomy silence which he had so long maintained the wizard spoke  go he said cook some food under the cliffs there  i will mend the sledge  the women replied not by words but by the more emphatic method of at once obeying the order  kabelaw seized and shouldered a large piece of raw seals flesh  nunaga took up little pussi with one hand and the materials for producing fire with the other and followed her companion tumbler brought up the rear staggering under the weight of the cookinglamp  they had only a couple of hundred yards to go  in a few minutes kabelaw was busy under the cliffs producing fire in the usual eskimo fashion with two pieces of dry wood while her friend set up the lamp and sliced the meat  the children inheriting as they did the sterling helpful propensities of their parents went actively about interfering with everything in their earnest endeavours to assist  isnt he strange remarked kabelaw glancing in the direction of ujarak as she diligently twirled the firestick between her palms so different from what he was  i think said nunaga pouring oil into the lamp that he is sorry for what he has done  no him not sorry said tumbler as he assisted pussi to rise for she had tripped and fallen him not sorryhim sulky  kabelaw took no notice of this juvenile observation but blowing the spark which she had at last evoked into a flame expressed some doubt as to ujaraks repentance and said she had never seen him in a state of sorrytude before  whereupon tumbler pertly rejoined that he had often seen him in a state of sulkytude  the damage to the sledge was slight  it was soon repaired and the wizard brought it round with him to the spot where breakfast was being got ready  this was the first time he had eaten with them since the flight began his manner however was not much changed  he was still silent and gloomy though once or twice he condescended to make a remark or two about the weather  when a man talks upon the weather the ice is fairly brokeneven in arctic regionsand from that wellnigh universal startingpoint ujarak went on to make a few more remarks  he did so very sternly however as though to protest against the idea that he was softening to the smallest extent  nunaga he said holding up a finger in two suns or less we shall arrive at the land where the kablunets have built houses and settled down  we may explain that the wizard here referred to the moravians who had about that time sent out their first mission to greenland  of course he knew nothing of the object those selfsacrificing men had in view in thus establishing themselves in greenland only vague rumours having at that time reached his distant tribe  all he knew was that they were kablunets or foreigners and that they had something mysterious to tell about the god of the kablunets  nunaga received ujaraks information in silence and waited for more  and now he continued i want you to say when you arrive there that you are my wife  but i am not your wife returned nunaga gently yet firmly  the wizard frowned then he glared fiercely then he looked sad then there settled on his visage a sulky look which gradually faded away leaving nothing but a simple blank behind  after that he opened his lips and was about to speak when nunaga opened her pretty eyes to their widest also her pretty mouth and gave vent to a tremendous shriek which reverberating among the cliffs caused all the creatures around her canine and human to leap electrically to their feet  to account for this we must take the reader round to the other side of the cliff at the foot of which the party sat enjoying their breakfast  there all ignorant of the human beings so near at hand sauntered an enormous polar bear  it seated itself presently on its haunches and swayed itself gently to and fro with its head on one side as if admiring the arctic scenery  there was not much more than a space of five hundred yards between the parties but owing to the great promontory which formed an effectual screen between them and the fact that the light air blew from the land to the sea neither bear nor dogs had scented each other  it seemed as if bruin had only just got out of bed for his little eyes blinked sleepily his motions were exceedingly slow and his yawns were frequent as well as remonstrative in tone  doubtless bears like men dislike early rising  having gazed at the scenery long enough and shaken off its lethargy to some extent the bear began probably to think of food  then it arose sauntered round the promontory and presented itself to the more than astonished gaze of nunaga who was the only one that chanced to sit facing in its direction  the resulting shriek and its consequences seemed to have a petrifying effect on the animal for it stood stock still for some moments and simply gazed  this condition of things was instantly changed by three of the dogs breaking their traces and rushing wildly at the animal with two nimble pats of its great paws it sent two of the dogs into the air almost killing them while the third it dismissed yelling hideously with a bad tear in its flank  quick as thought ujarak set the other dogs free and the whole pack ran openmouthed at their natural foe but another dog being promptly sent away howling the rest were cowed and confined themselves to barking furiously round their powerful foe  apparently this was an old bear confident perhaps in its strength and used it might be to dogassaults for it paid no further attention to its canine opponents but advanced with a very threatening aspect towards the sledge  it is pretty wellknown that two eskimo men of average strength and courage are more than a snatch for the polar bear if armed with spears the mode of attack is simple  the two men separate  the one who arranges to be the slayer of the animal advances on its left side the other on its right  thus the victims attention is distracted it becomes undecided which foe to attack first  the hunter on the right settles the question by running in and giving him a prick with the spear  turning in fury on this man the bear exposes its left side to the full force of a deadly thrust of the spear which usually reaches the heart and finishes it  the chances however are very much in favour of the bear when the man is alone  hence single hunters are not fond of attacking a polar bear except when unusually strong and courageous as well as confident of their dexterity  now it happened that ujarak although strong and courageous enough was not overconfident of his dexterity  with a tried comrade he would readily have faced any bear in the arctic regions but on this occasion he felt he had to depend entirely on himself  seizing a spear quickly he looked at the approaching animal and glanced uneasily at nunaga  if i am killed he said you will have to defend the children  there was a tone of pathos in the voice which showed that no touch of selfish fear influenced the man  hitherto the women and children had stood absolutely horrorstruck and helpless but the vigorous nature of kabelaw came to her aid  we will help you she suddenly cried catching up two spears and thrusting one into the hands of nunaga two women may perhaps be equal to one man  the wizard smiled grimly in spite of circumstances at this heroic action but there was no time for reply as the bear was already close to them  poor timid nunaga trembling from skin to marrow had just courage enough to grasp her spear and follow kabelaw  the latter understood well how to act  she had often seen her own kinsmen do the work that was required of her  as for the two little ones they continued throughout to stand limp and motionless with eyes and mouths wideopen  of course kabelaw ran to the right and ujarak to the left of the foe advancing as in duty bound a step or two ahead of her male friend the former proceeded to prick the bear but when the monster rose on his hind legs and towered to a height of eight feet if not more her heart failed her  nevertheless she made a gallant thrust which might have at least incommoded the animal had not the spear received a blow which not only sent it spinning out of the womans hand but hurled poor kabelaw herself on the ice a small lump of which cut open her temple and rendered her for the moment insensible  at the same instant the wizard took prompt advantage of his opportunity and delivered what should have been the deathwound  but the very energy of the man foiled him for the spear entered too near the shoulder and stuck upon the bone  the fall of kabelaw had the peculiar effect of producing a gush of desperation in the tender heart of nunaga which amounted almost to courage  with a lively shriek she shut her eyes rushed in on the bear and gave it a dab in the side which actually sent her weapon into the flesh about an inch deep and there it stuck fast  feeling this new sting the bear turned on her with a gasp of rage  she looked up  the great paws were extended over her head  the dreadful jaws were open  letting go her weapon nunaga cast up her arms shut her eyes again and sank shuddering on the ice  down came the bear but at that critical moment an irresistible force effected what the united party had failed to accomplish  the butt of nunagas spear chanced to enter a crack in the ice where it stuck fast and the weight of the descending animal sent the point through flesh ribs and heart and out at his backbone  the spear broke of course but in breaking it turned the monster on one side and saved the poor girl from being smothered at the same moment ujarak had made another desperate thrust which unlike the former entered deep but being misdirected did not touch a vital part  in the violence of his effort the man fell and the dying bear rolled upon him rendering him also insensible  when poor little nunaga recovering from her state of semiconsciousness opened her eyes and sat up her first impression was that the bear the wizard and kabelaw lay around her dead  bad as the state of matters was however it was not quite so bad as that  the poor girls first act was to burst into a hysterical fit of laughterso wonderfully constituted are some female mindsand she followed that up with an equally hysterical fit of weeping  but to do her justice the fits did not last above half a minute  then she suddenly stopped dried her eyes jumped up and pursing her lips and knitting her brows ran to her friend whom she found just returning to a state of consciousness  what has happened asked kabelaw in a dazed manner as she looked at the blood which flowed from her wound  nunaga did not answer but ran to the bear which was quite dead and began to drag it off ujarak  with great difficulty and by first hauling at its neck and then at its tail she managed to move it just enough to set the mans head and chest free  the wizard thus partially relieved soon began to show signs of returning life  in a few minutes he was able to sit up and drag his right leg from under the bear but he was much exhausted and only got it free after great exertion  are you hurt asked nunaga in a tone of commiseration  not much i think  ii am not sure  i feel as if i had been much shaken and my leg is painful  i hope he added feeling the limb with both hands that it is not  he finished the sentence with a deep groan  but it was not a groan of pain so much as of despair for his leg he found was broken just above the ankle  it may perhaps require a little thought on the part of those who dwell in civilised lands to understand fully all that this implied to the eskimo  if it did not absolutely mean death by exposure and starvation it at all events meant life under extremely uncomfortable conditions of helplessness and pain it meant being completely at the mercy of two women whom he had grievously wronged and it meant that at the best he could not avoid ultimately falling into the hands of his angry and outraged kinsmen  all this the wizard perceived at a glancehence his groan  now it may not be out of place to remark here that the qualities of mercy pity forgiveness etcetera are not by any means confined to the people of christian lands  we believe that as our saviour died for the sins of the whole world so the spirit of jesus is to be found working righteousness among individuals of even the worst and most savage nations of the earth  the extreme helplessness and pain to which her enemy was reduced instead of gratifying revenge in nunaga aroused in her gentle breast feelings of the tenderest pity and she not only showed her sympathy in her looks and tones but by her actions for she at once set to work to bind up the broken limb to the best of her ability  in this operation she was gleefully assisted by little tumbler and pussi who having recovered from their horror when the bear fell dead seemed to think that all succeeding acts were part of a play got up for their special amusement  when the surgical work was done nunaga again turned her attention to kabelaw  she had indeed felt a little surprised that her friend seemed to take no interest in the work in which she was engaged and was still more surprised when on going up to her she found her sitting in the same position in which she had left her and wearing the same stupid halfstunned look on her face  a few words sufficed to reveal the truth and to nunagas consternation she found that her friend was suffering from what is known among the civilised as concussion of the brain  when the full significance of her condition at last forced itself upon the poor girl when she came to see clearly that she was as it were cast away in the arctic wilderness with the whole care of a helpless man and woman and two equally helpless children besides a sledge and team of dogs devolving on her she proved herself to be a true heroine by rising nobly to the occasion  her first act was to return with characteristic humility and ask ujarak what she must do  you must take the dogs and sledge and the children he answered in a low voice and save yourselves  what and leave you here  yes i am bad  it is well that i should die  but kabelaw said the girl with a glance at her friend  she has got the headsickness and cannot help herself  leave her to die also said the wizard carelessly she is not worth much  never cried nunaga with emphasis  i will save her i will save you all  did you not tell me that the village of the kablunets is only two suns from here  that is so nunaga  can you creep to the sledge asked the girl quickly  i think i can  try then  the wizard tried and found that he could creep on his hands and one knee dragging the wounded limb on the ice  it gave him excruciating pain but he was too much of a man to mind that  in a few minutes he was lying at full length on the sledge  now tumbler and pussi said nunaga cover him well up with skins while i go and fetch kabelaw but dont touch his leg  she found that kabelaw could walk slowly with support and after much exertion succeeded in getting her also laid out upon the sledge alongside of the wizard  then nunaga tied them both firmly down with long walruslines  she also attached the children to the sledge with lines round their waists to prevent their being jolted off  having thus made things secure and having cut off some choice portions of the bear for food she harnessed the dogs grasped the whip mounted to the drivers place brought the heavy lash down with wonderful effect on the backs of the whole team and set off at full gallop towards the land where kablunets were said to dwell  fortunately the ice was smooth most of the way for jolting was not only injurious to poor kabelaw but gave the wizard great additional pain  it also had the effect of bumping tumbler and pussi against each other and sometimes strained their lashings almost to the breaking point  at night nunaga selected as comfortable a spot as she could find under the shelter of the greenland cliffs and thereafter detaching the children redressing ujaraks leg arranging the couch of the semiconscious kabelaw and feeding the hungry dogsshe set up her lamp and cooked savoury seal and bear cutlets for the whole party and not withstanding the prejudices with which fastidious people may receive the information it is an unquestionable fact that the frying of seal and bear cutlets sends a most delicious influence up the nose though perhaps it may require intense hunger and an eskimos digestion to enable one to appreciate to the full the value of such food  these labours ended nunaga put the little ones to bed made the wizard and kabelaw as comfortable as possible for the night fastened up the dogs and spreading her own couch in the most convenient spot beside them commenced her wellearned nights repose  the first night her bed was a flat rock the second a patch of sand but on both occasions the cheery little woman softened the place with a thick bearskin and curling up covered herself with the soft skin of a reindeer  and what were the thoughts of the wicked ujarak as he lay there helpless and suffering silently watching nunaga  we can tell for he afterwards made a partial confession of them  she is very pretty he thought and very kind  i always knew that but now i see that she is much more  she is forgiving  i took her from her home by force and would have made her my wife against her willyet she is good to me  i have been harsh unkind cruel sulky to her ever since we left homeyet she is good to me  i have torn her from all those whom she loves with the intention that she should never see them againyet she is good to me  she might have left me to die and might easily have gone home by herself and it would have served me right butbut she is good to me  i am not a man  i am a beasta beara foxa walrus  as the wizard thought thus a couple of tears overflowed their boundaries and rolled down the hitherto untried channel of his cheeks  do you think reader that this line of thought and emotion even in a savage was unnatural  is not the same principle set forth in scripture in reference to far higher things  need we remind you that it is the goodness of god which leadeth thee or any one else to repentance  as it is in the spiritual world so is it in the natural  at the time of which we write the same grand principle was powerfully at work in nature  thickribbed ice which the united forces of humanity could not have disrupted was being silently yet rapidly dissolved by the genial influence of the sun insomuch that on the evening of the day after nunaga had been compelled by circumstances to assume command of the expedition several sheets of open water appeared where ice had been expected and the anxious charioteer was more than once obliged to risk the lives of the whole party by driving out to sea on the floesthat being better than the alternative of remaining where they were to die of starvation  but by that time they were not far distant from the kablunet settlements    chapter nineteen  spring returnskayak evolutionsangut is puzzled  why some people should wink and blink as well as smirk when they are comfortable is a question which might possibly be answered by cats if they could speak but which we do not profess to understand nevertheless we are bound to record the fact that on the very day when nunaga and her invalids drew near to the first moravian settlements in greenland ippegoo slowly mounted a hillside which overlooked the icy sea flung himself down on a mossclad bank and began to wink and blink and smirk in a way that surpassed the most comfortable cat that ever revelled on rug or slumbered in sunshine  ippegoo was supremely happy and his felicity like that of most simple folk reposed on a simple basis  it was merely thisthat spring had returned to the arctic regions  spring  ha who among the dwellers in our favoured land has the faintest idea ofofpoohwords are wanting  the british poets alive and dead have sung of spring and doubtless have fancied that they understood it  they had no more idea of what they were singing about thanthan the man in the moon if we may venture to use a rather hackneyed comparison  listen reader humbly as becometh the ignorant  imagine yourself an eskimo  dont overdo it  you need not in imagination adopt the hairy garments or smear yourself with oil or eat raw blubber  for our purpose it will suffice to transport yourself into the arctic regions and invest yourself with the average intelligence of an ordinary human being who has not been debased by the artificial evils that surround modern civilisation or demoralised by strong drink  in this condition of happy simplicity you draw near to the end of an arctic winter  during eight months or so you have been more or less shrivelledup petrified mummified by frost of the most intense and wellnigh intolerable description  your whole body has frequently been pierced by winds the constituents of which seemed to be needles and fire  shelter has been one of your chief subjects of meditation every dayofttimes all day unwillingness to quit that shelter and eagerness to return to it being your dominant characteristic  darkness palpable has been around you for many weeks followed by a twilight of gloom so prolonged that you feel as if light were a longpast memory  your eyes have become so accustomed to ice and snow that white or rather whiteygrey has long since usurped and exclusively held the place of colour in your imagination so that even blacka black cliff or a black rock cropping up out of the snowbecomes a mitigated joy  your ears have been so attuned to the howling blast with interludes of dead calm and variations of rending icebergs and bellowing walrus accompaniments that melodious harmonies have fled affrighted from your brain  as for your noseesprit de marrow fat extract of singed hide essence of lampsmoke eau de cuisine and deoxygenised atmosphere of snowhut have often inclined you to dash into the open air regardless of frost and snow for purposes of revivification  imagine all these things intensified to the uttermost and prolonged to nigh the limits of endurance so that genial ideas and softening influences seem to have become things of the longforgotten past and then try to imagine a change compared to which all the transformation scenes of all the pantomimes that ever blazed are as a tomtits chirp to a lions roar or aawords fail again  no matter  but dont give in yet  try now to imagine this sudden transformation wrought perhaps in a few days to the slow music of southern zephyrs bearing on their wings light and heat and sunshine  your ear is surprisedabsolutely startledby the sound of trickling water  old memories that you thought were dead come back in the trumpet of the wildgoose the whistling wing of the duck the plaintive cry of the plover  your noseah your nose cocks up and snuffs a smellpardon a scent  it is the scent of the great orb on which you stand saturated at last with lifegiving water and beginning to vivify all the green things that have so long been hidden in her capacious bosom  but it is to your eye perhaps that the strongest appeal is made for while you throw off one by one the garments which have protected you for so many months and open up body and soul to the loved longabsent influences of warmth and sound and odour your eye drinks up the mighty draughts of lightlight not only blazing in the blue above but reflected from the blue belowfor the solid icefields are now split into fragments the swell of old ocean sends a musical ripple to the shore great icebergs are being shed from their parent glaciers and are seen floating away in solemn procession to the south lifting their pinnacles towards their grandparent clouds until finally reduced to the melting mood and merged in their greatgrandparent the sea  imagine such visions and sensations coming suddenly almost as a surprise at the end of the stern arctic winter and then perchance you will have some idea of the bounding joy that fills the soul on the advent of spring inducing it to feel if not to say let every thing that hath breath praise the lord  this is spring  the eskimos understand it and so do the dwellers in ruperts land perchance also the poor exiles of siberiabut the poetspooh  far down below the perch occupied by ippegoo lay a little sandy bay around which were scattered a number of eskimo hutsrude and temporary buildings meant to afford shelter for a time and then be forsaken this was the bay which angut okiok simek red rooney and the others had reached in their pursuit of the wizard when the ice broke up and effectually stopped them  as it was utterly impossible to advance farther with dog and sledge they were compelled to restrain their impatience as best they could and await open water when they might resume their journey in kayaks meanwhile as there was a lead of open water to the northward as far as they could see the youth arbalik had been despatched with a small sledge and four of the strongest dogs along the strip of landice or icefoot which clung to the shore  his mission was to reach the village and fetch nuna pussimek kunelik sigokow and his own mother in one of the oomiaks or womens boats when open water should permit  it was while our eskimos were thus idly waiting for their wives that the beforementioned southern eskimos arrived and met them with every demonstration of friendliness and goodwill  these men who had been forced to make a long difficult detour inland after the ice gave way were not a little pleased to find that the icefoot to the northward was still practicable and that the eskimo village was so near  of course they told of their meeting with ujaraks sledge which rendered inaction on the part of the pursuers still more unbearable  but they were all men who could accept the inevitable with a good grace and as they knew it was impossible to advance without kayaks and oomiaks they awaited the return of arbalik as patiently as possible  meanwhile they made themselves agreeable to the new arrivals whose hearts they gladdened by telling them that their friends in the north had plenty of narwhal horns and bones and walrus tusks and sinews to exchange for their wood and iron  but to return to ippegoo on his distant and elevated outlook  while he gazed at the busy groups below our weakminded youth observed two of the party step into kayaks which lay on the beach push off into the bay and commence what may be styled kayak exercise  as ippegoo greatly enjoyed witnessing such exercises he threw off his lethargy and leaping up quickly descended to the shore  the kayaks were old ones which had been found by the party on arriving at the deserted village  they had probably been left as useless by previous visitors but okioks boys norrak and ermigit being energetic and ingenious fellows had set to work with fishboneneedles and sinewthreads and repaired them with sealskin patches  they were now about to test their workmanship and practise their drill  do they leak shouted okiok as the lads pushed off  not more than i can soak up replied norrak looking back with a laugh  only a little cried ermigit and hoh the water is still very cold  paddle hard and youll soon warm it cried rooney  when they had got fairly off a spirit of emulation seized the brothers and without a direct challenge they paddled side by side gradually increasing their efforts until they were putting forth their utmost exertions and going through the water at racing speed  well done norrak shouted the father in rising excitement  not so fast ermigit not so fast roared simek  heedless of the advice the brothers pushed on until they were brought up by the packice at the mouth of the bay  here they turned as quickly as possible and raced back with such equal speed that they came in close togetherso close that it was impossible for those on shore to judge which was winning as they approached  as in all similar caseswhether on the thames or on the greenland seasexcitement became intense as the competitors neared the goal they were still a hundred yards or so from land when ermigit missed a stroke of his paddle  the consequence was that the kayak overturned and ermigit disappeared  a kayak as is generally known is a very long and narrow canoe made of a light wooden frame and covered all over with sealskin with the exception of a single hole in what may be called the deck which is just big enough to admit one man  this hole is surrounded by a strip of wood which prevents water washing into the canoe and serves as a ledge over which the eskimo fastens his sealskin coat  as canoe and coat are waterproof the paddler is kept dry even in rough weather and these cockleshell craft will ride on a sea that would swamp an open boat but the kayak is easily overturned and if the paddler is not expert in the use of his paddle he runs a chance of being drowned for it is not easy to disengage himself from his craft  constant practice however makes most natives as expert and fearless as tightrope dancers and quite as safe  no sooner therefore did ermigit find himself in the water head downwards than with a rapid and peculiar action of the paddle he sent himself quite round and up on the other side into the right position dripping however like a seal emerging from the sea  he lost the race as a matter of course  norrak after touching the beach returned to ermigit laughing at his mishap  you laugh said his brother somewhat sharply but you cannot do that as quickly as i did it  without a word of reply norrak threw himself on one side vanished in the water and came up on the other side in a decidedly shorter time  well done cried ermigit who was in truth a goodnatured fellow come let us practise  agreed responded norrak and both brothers pushed a little nearer to land so that their father and the others might observe and criticise their evolutions  as the exercises which they went through are practised by eskimos in order to fit them to cope with the accidents and emergencies of actual life we will briefly describe them  first norrak leaned over on one side of course carrying the kayak with him until his body lay on the water in which position he maintained himself and prevented a total overset by manipulating his paddle and then with a downward dash of the blade and a vigorous jerk of his body he regained his position amid expressions of approval from the shore having performed the same feat on the other side he nodded to ermigit and said  now you go to work  ermigit went to work so well that even a critical judge could not have pronounced him better or worse than his brother  after that they both repeated the complete overturn and recovery already described  in this effort however the lads had the free use of their paddles but as in actual service the paddle may easily get entangled with straps and fishing cordage a special exercise is arranged to prepare the hunter against such misfortunes  accordingly norrak pushed one blade of his paddle among the straps and cordage overset the kayak and worked himself up again with a quick motion of the other blade  of course this was not done either easily or quickly  nevertheless it was accomplished by both lads to the entire satisfaction of their critics  next they performed the same feat of upsetting and recovering position with the paddle held fast behind their backs and then with it held across the nape of the neckand in several other positions all of which represented cases of possible entanglement  sometimes however the paddle may be lost in an upset  this is the most serious misfortune that can befall a hunter  to prepare for it therefore the eskimo boys and youths have a special drill which norrak now proceeded to go through  overturning his kayak as before he purposely let go the oar in the act so that it floated on the water and then while thus inverted he made an upward grasp caught the paddle pulled it down and with it recovered his position  there would have been great danger in this if he had been alone for in the event of his failing to catch the paddle he would probably have been drowned but with ermigit at hand to help there was no danger  other exercises there are which the sons of okiok were not able to practise at that time because of the weather being unsuitable  one of these consists in threading their way among sunken rocks and dashing surges another in breasting the billows of a tempest  it must not be supposed that all eskimos become efficient in rough work of this kind many do become exceedingly expert others moderately so but some there are who although very fair sealhunters never become experts in the management of the kayak and who in cases of great difficulty are apt to be lost during the seasons of sealfishing  now it chanced while the youths were thus training themselves for future work that a solitary seal put up its head as if to have a look at the state of things in general above water  it also chanced that the eskimos were to leeward of him and a blaze of sunshine was at their backs so that the seal when looking towards its human foes had its eyes dazzled  ermigit had no weapons at the time but by goodfortune a harpoon line and bladder were attached to norraks vessel  as the cat pounces on the unwary mouse so norrak crouching low dipped his paddle twice with noiseless vigour and shot his craft like an arrow towards the seal  it happened to be a stupid attarsoak and it raised its bullet head with a look that said plainly what in all the ocean is that queer thing in the sunshine  half a minute brought that queer thing in the sunshine within ten yards of him  norrak grasped the light harpoon and sent it whistling to its mark  truer than the needle to the pole the weapon went carrying its line with it and sank deep into the shoulder of the seal  ermigit meanwhile had made for the shore got a lance thrown to him by the excited okiok received an encouraging nod from rooney with an english recommendation to go it and was off again to render aid  and not a moment too soon did that aid come for contrary to usual experience that sealinstead of diving and giving them an hours hot pursuitmade a furious assault on norrak  probably the spear had touched it in a tender spot  at all events the creatures ire was roused to such an extent that when it reached him it seized the kayak and tore a large hole in it  down went the bow as a matter of course and up went the stern  norrak hastily disengaged himself so as to be ready to spring clear of the sinking wreck and was on the point of jumping out when his brothers kayak shot past him and ermigit sent a spear deep into the vitals of the sealso deep indeed that it turned over and died without a groan  by that time norrak was in the water but he made a vigorous grasp at his brothers kayak with one hand while with the other he clutched the line of the harpoonfor well did he know that dead seals sink and that if it went down it would perhaps carry the bladder along with it and so be lost  give me the line brother said ermigit extending a hand  no  i can hold it  you make for shorequick  ermigit plied his paddle with a will and in a few minutes reached the shore with norrak bladder line and seal like a huge tail behind him  need we say that they were received by their friends as well as by the strange eskimos with enthusiasm  we think not  neither is it necessary to comment on the enjoyment they found that night in a supper of fresh meat and in fighting the battle as well as a good many other battles over again  but in the midst of it all there was a cloud on the brows of angut simek and okiok for their anxiety about the fate of nunaga pussi and tumbler was intense  angut was particularly restless during the night and got up several times to take a look at the weather as rooney expressed it  on one of these occasions he found the kablunet standing by the shore of the calm sea  i dont like the look o things said rooney giving a sailorlike glance at the horizon and the sky  it seems to me as if we were goin to have dirty weather  instead of replying to this remark the eskimo looked earnestly at his friend and asked  can ridroonee tell me why the great spirit allows men to do evil  no angut no  that is beyond my knowledge  indeed i remember puttin the same question or somethin like it to a learned man in my country and he said it is beyond the knowledge of the wisest men that have ever livedso its no wonder that its beyond you and me  but the great spirit is good said angut rather as if he were soliloquising than addressing his friend  yes he is goodmust be good returned the sailor it cannot be otherwise  then why does evil exist asked angut quickly  why did he make evil you have told me he made everything  so he did but evil is not a thing  it is a state of being so to speak  it is a great mystery said angut  it would be a greater mystery returned the seaman if the great spirit was not mysterious  he has allowed ujarak to carry off nunaga though she loves not ujarak and ujarak does not love her else he could not have treated her so badly  why did the great spirit allow that demanded the eskimo with some bitterness of tone  i know not angut yet i know it is for good because the great spirit is our great father and if human fathers know how to treat their children well does the great father of all not know  the eskimo gravely bowed his head in assent to this proposition and the seaman continued  i have spoken to you more than once angut about the men in our land called surgeonsthat you call knifemenhow they will cut and carve your body and tie you down sometimes and give you terrible and prolonged suffering for the purpose of curing you and relieving your pain  true replied angut who at once saw the drift of his friends remark but then you know that the knifemans object is good  it is to cure to relieve  but suppose argued rooney that you did not know that his object was goodthat you looked on him as a cruel bloody heartless monster who cared not for your cries of painwould your ignorance change his character  no no he would remain good whatever you might think said angut quickly i see  i see  i will try to think as you thinkthe great father is good must be good  and he will prove it some day  dont you think so ridroonee  ay truly i think so i am sure of it  but listen  do you not hear sounds  they both listened intently and gazed towards the northern headland of the bay which at the time was bathed in brilliant moonlight  presently two black specks one larger than the other were seen to round the point and the chattering of womens voices was heard  it was arbalik in a kayak preceding an oomiak propelled by several women  in her impatience to join her lord madame okiok had insisted on a forced march  a few minutes more and the women landed amid noisy demonstrations of satisfaction  ere long the united party were busy round the unfailing lamps enjoying social intercourse over an intermediate meal which as it came between supper and breakfast has not yet obtained a name    chapter twenty  the chase continued and disastrously interrupted  the day following that on which the wives of simek and okiok and the mothers of arbalik and ippegoo with the spinster sigokow arrived the southern eskimos resumed their route northward and the pursuers continued their journey to the souththe former in their sledges over the still unmelted icefoot along the shore the latter in kayaks by a lead of open water which extended as far as the eye could reach  angut okiok and simek led the way in kayaks the kayak damaged by the seal having been repaired  the other men were forced to embark in the womens boat  eskimo men deem this an undignified position and will not usually condescend to work in oomiaks which are invariably paddled by the women but rooney being influenced by no such feelings quietly took the steering paddle and ultimately shamed arbalik and ippegoo as well as the sons of okiok into lending a hand  during the first part of the voyage all went well but next day the lead of open water was found to trend off the land and run out into the pack where numerous great glaciers were seensome aground others surging slowly southward with the polar current  i dont like the look of it remarked angut when the other leaders of the party ranged alongside of him for a brief consultation  neither do i said simek  the season is far advanced and if there should be a general breakup of the ice while we are out among the floes we should be lost  but it is impossible for us to travel by land said okiok  no man knows the land here  the sea runs so far in that we might spend many moons in going round the bays without advancing far on our journey  so there is nothing left for us but to go on by water said angut with decision  nunaga must be rescued  and so must tumbler said okiok  and so must pussi said simek  what are you fellows consulting about shouted red rooney coming up at that moment with the others in the oomiak  we are talking of the danger of the ice breaking up answered angut but there is no other way to travel than by the open lead so we have decided to go on  of course you have returned rooney what else can we do  we must risk something to save nunaga pussi and tumbler to say nothing of kabelaw  get along my hearties  how rooney translated the last phrase into eskimo is a point on which we can throw no lightbut no matter  in a short time the party reached the neighbourhood of one of the largest bergs one of those gigantic masses of ice which resemble moderatelysized mountains the peaks of which rose several hundred feet above the sealevel while its base was more than a mile in diameter there were little valleys extending into its interior through which flowed rivulets whose winding courses were broken here and there by cascades  in short the berg resembled a veritable island made of white sugar the glittering sunlit slopes of which contrasted finely with its greengrey shadows and the darkblue depths of its wide rifts and profound caverns  the lead or lane of water ran to within fifty yards of this iceisland so that rooney had a splendid view of it and being of a romantic turn of mind amused himself as the oomiak glided past by peopling the white cliffs and valleys with snowwhite inhabitants  while he was thus employed there occurred a sudden crashing and rending in the surrounding pack which filled him with consternation  it produced indeed the same effect on the eskimos as well it might for the very catastrophe which they all dreaded was now taking place  a slight swell on the sea appeared to be the originating cause but whatever it was the whole surface was soon broken up and the disintegrated masses began to grind against each other in confusion  at the same time the lead which the voyagers had been following grew narrower and that so rapidly that they had barely time to jump upon a mass of ice when the opening closed and crushed the oomiak and okioks kayak to pieces  angut and simek had time to lift their kayaks on to the ice but that as it turned out was of no advantage  make for the berg shouted angut to the women at the same time seizing the hand of kunelik who chanced to be nearest to him and assisting her to leap from one heaving mass to another  rooney performed the same act of gallantry for old kannoa who to his surprise went over the ice like an antique squirrel  okiok took his own wife in hand  as for pussimek she did not wait for assistance but being of a lively and active as well as a stout and cheery disposition she set off at a pace which caused her tail to fly straight out behind her and made it difficult for simek to keep up with her  ippegoo and arbalik with the sons of okiok tried their best to save the two kayaks for well they knew the danger of being left on the ice without the means of escaping but the suddenness of the disruption the width of the various channels they had to leap and the instability of the masses compelled them after much delay to drop their burdens and save themselves  they only managed to reach the berg with extreme difficulty  thank god all safebut we have had a close shave exclaimed rooney as he held out his hand to assist ippegoo who was the last of the party to clamber up the rugged side of the berg from the broken floepieces which were grinding against it  i wish we could say with truth all safe was okioks gloomy response as he surveyed the iceladen sea we have escaped being crushed or drowned but only to be starved to death  a living man may hope returned angut gravely  ay and where there is life added rooney there ought to be thankfulness  i would be more thankful said ippegoo with a woebegone expression if we had saved even a spear but what can we do without food or weapons  do my son said kunelik can we not at least keep up heart  who ever heard of any good coming of groaning and looking miserable  right you are old girl cried rooney giving the mother of ippegoo a hearty pat on the shoulder  there is no use in despairing at the very beginning of our troubles besides is there not the great spirit who takes care of us although we cannot see or hear him  i believe in god my friends and ill ask him to help us now  so saying to the surprise of the eskimos the seaman uncovered his head and looking upwards uttered a few words of earnest prayer in the name of jesus  at first the unsophisticated natives looked about as if they expected some visible and immediate answer to the petition but rooney explained that the great spirit did not always answer at once or in the way that man might expect  god works by means of us and through us he said  we have committed the care of ourselves to him  what we have now to do is to go to work and do the best we can and see what things he will throw in our way or enable us to do in answer to our prayer  now the first thing that occurs to me is to get away from where we stand because that overhanging cliff beside us may fall at any moment and crush us  next we should go and search out some safe cavern in which we may spend the night for we shant be able to find such a place easily in the dark and though it will be but a cold shelter still cold shelter is better than noneso come along  these remarks of the sailor though so familiarperhaps commonplaceto us seemed so just and full of wisdom to the unsophisticated natives and were uttered in such an offhand cheery tone that a powerful effect was created and the whole party at once followed the seaman who by this display of coolness firmness and trustfulness in a higher power established a complete ascendancy over his friends  from that time they regarded him as their leader even although in regard to the details of eskimo life he was of course immeasurably their inferior  they soon found a small cave not far from the spot where they had landedif we may use that expressionand there made preparation to spend the night which by that time was drawing on  although their craft had been thus suddenly destroyed and lost they were not left absolutely destitute for each one with that prompt mental activity which is usually found in people whose lives are passed in the midst of danger had seized the bearskin deerskin or fur bag on which he or she happened to be sitting and had flung it on to the floes before leaping thereon and ippegoo with that regard for internal sustenance which was one of his chief characteristics had grasped a huge lump of seals flesh and carried it along with him  thus the whole party possessed bedding and food for at least one meal  of course the meal was eaten not only cold but raw  in the circumstances however they were only too thankful to care much about the style of it  before it was finished daylight fled the stars came out and the aurora borealis was shooting brilliantly athwart the sky gradually the various members of the party spread their skins on the most level spot discoverable and with lumps of ice covered with bits of hide for pillows went to sleep with what resembled freeandeasy indifference  two of the party however could not thus easily drop into happy oblivion  red rooney felt ill at ease  his knowledge of those arctic seas had taught him that their position was most critical and that escape would be almost miraculous for they were eight or ten miles at least off the land on a perishable iceberg with an iceencumbered sea around and no means of going afloat even if the water had been free a feeling of gloom which he had not felt before and which he could not banish rendered sleep impossible he therefore rose and sauntered out of the cave  outside he found angut standing motionless near the edge of an icecliff gazing up into the glorious constellations overhead  i cant sleep angut said the seaman i suppose you are much in the same way  i do not know  i did not try returned the eskimo in a low voice i wish to think not to sleep  why cannot the kablunet sleep  well its hard to tell  i suppose thinking too much has something to do with it  the fact is angut that weve got into what i call a fix and i cant for the life of me see how we are to get out of it  indeed i greatly fear that we shall never get out of it  if the great spirit wills that our end should be now said angut is the kablunet afraid to die  the question puzzled rooney not a little  well he replied i cant say that im afraid butbuti dont exactly want to die just yet you see  the fact is my friend that ive got a wife and children and a dear old grandmother at home and i dont quite relish the idea of never seein them again  have you not told me said angut with a look of solemn surprise that all who love the great spirit shall meet again up there  he pointed to the sky as he spoke  ay truly i said that and i believe that  but a man sometimes wants to see his wife and children again in this lifeand to my thinkin thats not likely with me as things go at present  have you much hope that we shall escape  yes i have hope answered the eskimo with a touch of enthusiasm in his tone  i know not why  i know not how  perhaps the great spirit who made me put it into me  i cannot tell  all around and within me is beyond my understandingbutthe great spirit is allwise allpowerful andgood  did you not say so  yes i said so and thats a trustworthy foundation anyhow returned the sailor meditatively wise powerful and gooda safe anchorage but now tell me what chances think you have we of deliverance  i can think of only one said angut  if the pack sets fast again we may walk over it to the land  once there we could manage to live though not to continue our pursuit of ujarak  that is at an end  in spite of himself the poor fellow said the last words in a tone which showed how deeply he was affected by the destruction of his hope to rescue nunaga  now my friend seems to me inconsistent said rooney  he trusts the great spirit for deliverance from danger  is then the rescue of nunaga too hard for him  i know not returned angut who was how ever cheered a little by his friends tone and manner  everything is mystery  i look up i look around i look within all is dark mysterious  only on this is my mind clearthe great spirit is good  he cannot be otherwise  i will trust him  one day perhaps he will explain all  what i understood not as a little boy i understand now as a man  why should there not be more light when i am an older man  if things go on in the mind as they have been going ever since i can remember perfect light may perhaps come at last  you dont think like most of your countrymen said rooney regarding the grave earnest face of his friend with increased interest  there was a touch of sadness in the tone of the eskimo as he replied  no i sometimes wonderfor their minds seem to remain in the childish condition though okiok and simek do seem at times as if they were struggling into more light  i often wonder that they think so little and think so foolishly but i do not speak much about it it only makes them fear that i am growing mad  i have never asked you angutdo your tribes in the north here hold the same wild notions about the earth and heavens as the southern eskimos do  i believe they do replied angut but i know not all they think in the south  in this land they thinkhere a smile of goodnatured pity flickered for a moment on the mans facethat the earth rests on pillars which are now mouldering away by age so that they frequently crack  these pillars would have fallen long ago if they had not been kept in repair by the angekoks who try to prove the truth of what they say by bringing home bits of themrotten pieces of wood  and the strange thing is that the people believe them  why dont you believe them angut  i know not why  and what do your kinsmen think about heaven asked rooney  they think it is supported on the peak of a lofty mountain in the north on which it revolves  the stars are supposed to be ancient greenlanders or animals which have managed in some mysterious way to mount up there and who shine with varied brightness according to the nature of their food  the streaming lights of winter are the souls of the dead dancing and playing ball in the sky  these are strange ideas observed rooney what have you to say about them  i think they are childish thoughts replied the eskimo  what then are your thoughts about these stars and streaming lights persisted the seaman who was anxious to understand more of the mind of his philosophical companion  i know not what i think  when i try to think on these things my mind gets confused  only this am i sure ofthat they are they must be the wonderful works of the good spirit  but how do you know that asked rooney  angut looked at his questioner very earnestly for a few moments  how does ridroonee know that he is alive he asked abruptly  oh as to that you know everything tells me that i am alive  i look around and i see  i listen and i hear  i think and i understand leastwise to some extentand i feel in mind and heart  now will i answer said angut  everything tells me that the great spirit is good and the maker of all things  i look and i see him in the things that exist  i listen and i hear him in the whispering wind in the running water in the voice of man and beast  i think and i understand him to some extent and i feel him both in mind and heart  i believe you are right angut and your words bring strongly to my remembrance many of the words of the great spirit that my mother used to teach me when i was a little boy  from this point in the conversation angut became the questioner being anxious to know all that the kablunet had to tell about the mysterious book of which he had spoken to him more than once and the teachings of his mother  it was long past midnight when the descending moon warned them to turn their steps towards the icecave where they had left their slumbering companions  the frost is sharp tonight remarked rooney as they were about to enter  angut turned round and cast a parting glance on sea and sky  if it holds on like this continued the sailor the ice will be firm enough to carry us to land in the morning  it will not hold on like this said angut  the innuit are very ignorant but they know many things about the weather for they are always watching it  tomorrow will be warm  we cannot escape  it will be safest and wisest to remain where we are  remaining means starving said the sailor in a desponding tone  it may be so we cannot tell returned the eskimo  with these uncomfortable reflections the two men entered the cavern quietly so as not to disturb their comrades  spreading their bearskins on the icefloor they laid heads on icepillows and soon fell into that dreamless restful slumber which is the usual accompaniment of youth health and vigour    chapter twenty one  shows a gloomy prospectstarvation threatened and wonderfully averted  angut was a true prophet  when rooney awoke next morning his ears told him that the rushing of icecold rivulets through icevalleys and the roar of iceborn cataracts had increased considerably during the hours of darkness  the warmth which caused this did not indeed at first strike him for the air of the cavern and the character of his bed had chilled him so much that he was shivering with cold  on glancing at his still sleeping comrades in misfortune he observed that these tough creatures slept with the peaceful aspect of infants whom being both fat and rotund they resembled in nearly everything except size  rising and going quietly out he beat his arms vigorously across his chest until circulation was fully restored  then he mounted a neighbouring iceledge and saw at a glance that their case had become desperate  angut was right he murmured bitterly and then stood for a long time contemplating the scene in silence  considered apart from their circumstances the scene was indeed glorious  not only had the warmth of the air begun to swell the rivulets which leaped and brawled down the palegreen slopes around him but the pack had opened out so as to completely change the aspect of the sea  instead of being clothed with ice showing only a lane of water here and there it was now an open sea crowded with innumerable iceislets of every fantastic shape and size  it added something to the bitterness of the poor mans feelings that this state of things would he knew have been the very best for their escape in kayaks and oomiaks for a profound calm prevailed and the sea where clear of ice glittered in the rising sun like a shield of polished gold  he was roused from his meditations by the sound of footsteps behind him turning quickly he beheld ippegoo holding his jaws with both hands and with an expression of unutterable woe on his face  halo ippe whats wrong with you  a groan was the reply and rooney although somewhat anxious found it difficult to restrain a laugh  ive gotoh oh oh oha mad tooth gasped the poor youth  a mad tooth  poor fellowwe call that toothache where i come from  what care i whether you call it mad tooth or tootik cried ippegoo petulantly  it is horrible dreadful awfullike fire and fury in the heart  the sufferer used one or two more eskimo expressions suggestive of excruciating agony which are not translatable into english  if i only had a pair of pincers butlook ippe look said rooney pointing to the sea in the hope of distracting his mind from present pain by referring to threatening danger lookour kayaks being lost we have no hope of escaping so we must starve  his little device wellmeant though it was failed  a groan and glance of indifference was the eskimos reply for starvation and danger were familiar and prospective evils whereas toothache was a present horror  we fear it must be told of ippegoo that he was not celebrated for endurance of pain and that being fond of sympathy he was apt to give full vent to his feelingsthe result perhaps of having an overindulgent mother  toothacheone of the diseases to which greenlanders are peculiarly liableinvariably drew forth ippegoos tenderest feelings for himself accompanied by touching lamentations  come ippe be more of a man  even your mother would scold you for groaning like that  but it is so shriekingly bad returned the afflicted youth with increasing petulance  of course it is  i know that poor fellow  but come i will try to cure you said rooney who under the impression that violent physical exertion coupled with distraction of mind would produce good effect had suddenly conceived a simple ruse  do you see yon jutting icecliff that runs down to a point near the edge of the berg  yes i see whimpered ippegoo  well it will require you to run at your top speed to get there while you count fifteen twenties  now if you run there within that timeat your very top speed mind rooney paused and looked serious  yes well said ippegoo whose curiosity had already begun to check the groans  if you run there continued the seaman with a look and tone of deep solemnity at the very toppest speed that you can do and look round that icepoint you will see  what gasped ippegoo excitedlyfor he was easily excited  something returned rooney mysteriously  i cannot tell exactly what you will see because i am not an angekok and have no torngak to tell me but i am quite sure that you will see something  only the benefit of seeing it will depend on your running as fast as you can now are you ready  yes quite ready exclaimed the youth tightening his girdle of sealskin eagerly  well thenaway shouted rooney  off went ippegoo at a pace which was obviously the best that he was capable of putting forth  rooney counted as he ran and in a much shorter time than had been specified he reached the point for the level track or what we may style seashore of the berg was not a bad racecourse  suddenly however he came to an abrupt halt and threw up his arms as if in amazement  then he turned round and ran back at a pace that was even greater than he had achieved on the outward run rooney was himself greatly surprised at this for as the youth drew nearer the expression of his face showed that he had indeed seen something which had not been in the seamans calculations  he spluttered and gasped as he came near in his effort to speak  what is ittake time lad said rooney quietly  a bbear a bear cried ippegoo  what did it run at you asked rooney becoming slightly excited in his turn and keeping his eye on the icepoint  nno no  it was sitting onon its tailllooking at thethe ssea  and weve no weapon bigger than an eskimo knife exclaimed the sailor with a frown of discontentnot even a bit of stick to tie the knife to  what a chance lost  he would have kept us in food for some weeks well well this is bad luck  come ippe well go back to the cave and consult about this  on returning to the cheerless retreat they found the rest of the party just awakening  the men were yawning and rubbing their eyes while the women with characteristic activity and selfdenial were gathering together the few scraps of food that remained from the previous nights supper  there is a bear just round the pointso ippe sayswhats to be done asked rooney on entering  up jumped the four men and two boys as if they had been made of indiarubber  attack it cried arbalik  kill it exclaimed norrak  and eat it said ermigit  what will you attack it with asked simek in a slightly contemptuous tonewith your fingernails  if so you had better send sigokow to do battle for she could beat the three of you  the youths stood abashed  we have no spears said simek and knives are useless  bad luck follows us  it is my opinion said okiok that whatever we do or try to do we had better eat something before doing it  bring the victuals nuna  okiok is right said angut and arbalik had better go out and watch while we consult so as to give us timely warning if the bear comes this way  without a word arbalik caught up a piece of blubber and went out of the cave to enjoy his frugal breakfast while acting sentinel  the others sitting down on their respective bearskins ate and consulted hastily  the consultation was of little use for they were utterly helpless and the breakfast was not much more profitable for there was far too little of it  still as rooney truly remarked when the last morsel was consumed it was better than nothing  well now my friends said angut at last since our food is done and all our talk has come to nothing i propose that we go out in a body to see this bear  as we cannot kill him we must get rid of him by driving him away for if we let him remain on the berg he will come upon us when we are asleep perhaps and kill us  yes that is best said okiok  if we separate so as to distract him and then make a united rush from all points shrieking that will drive him into the sea  let us put ippe in front suggested simek with a twinkling eye he yells better than any of us  specially when hes got the toothache added rooney  the object of this touch of pleasantry smiled in a goodhumouredly imbecile manner  it was clear that his malady had been cured at least for the time  but we must be very cautious remarked rooney becoming serious as they rose to proceed on their adventure  it would not do to let any of our party get hurt  to my thinking the women should take to the icecliffs before we begin and get upon pinnacles up which the bear could not climb  while he was speaking arbalik came running in with the information that the bear was approaching  has it seen you asked angut as they all ran out  i think not  from the way it walks i think it has no suspicion of any one being on the berg  in a few seconds they reached the point of the promontory or cliff in which their cave lay and each member of the party peeped round with excessive caution and there sure enough they beheld a white polar bear of truly formidable size  but it had changed its course after arbalik saw it for by that time it had turned up one of the icevalleys beforementioned and begun to ascend into the interior of the berg  the slow heavy gait of the unwieldy animal suggested to rooney the idea that an active man could easily get out of its way but the catlike activity with which it bounded over one or two rivulets that came in its way quickly dissipated that idea  the farther he goes up that valley whispered simek the more trouble we shall have in driving him into the sea  he does not seem to know his own mind remarked okiok as the bear again changed his course and entered one of the small gorges that opened into the larger valley  he knows it well enough said ermigit  dont you see he is making for the icetop where these gulls are sitting  the fool expects to catch them asleep  ermigit seemed to have guessed rightly for after clambering up the icegorge referred to until he gained a high ledge or plateau he began regularly to stalk the birds with the sly patience of a cat  there was much in the bears favour for the recent fall of a pinnacle had covered the ledge with shattered blocks of all shapes and sizes in the shelter of which it could creep towards its prey  our eskimos watched the proceeding openmouthed with profound interest  to within twenty yards or so of its game did that whiterobed arctic hunter approach  then it crouched for a rush at the unconscious birds for no other lump of ice lay between them and their foe  the charge was vigorously made almost too vigorously for when the birds flew lightly off the ledge and descended to a narrower one a little farther down it was all the bear could do to check itself on the very edge of the precipice  if it had gone over the consequences would have been dire for the precipice was not sheer but still a very steep slope of ice several hundred feet deep which terminated in those rugged masses on the bergshore that had fallen from the cliffs above there was only one break in the vast slope namely the narrow ledge halfway down on which the birds had taken refuge  going to the extreme edge of the precipice the bear sat down on his haunches and hungrily contemplated the birds which were now beyond his reach twittering noisily as if to tantalise him  i would that i had a spear growled okiok  i would venture at him even with a big stick said simek  my friends said rooney with sudden animation listen to me  if you will promise me to keep very quiet and not to follow me whatever may happen i will show you how kablunets overcome difficulties  of course the eskimos were ready to make any promises that might be required of them and looked at their friend with surprise as he threw off his sealskin coat and tightened the belt round his waist  but they were still more surprised when without another word he set off in only shirt and trousers to climb the valley of ice and make for the spot where the bear sat in melancholy meditation  while ascending rooney took care to avail himself of the rugged nature of the ice so as to conceal himself entirely from the bearthough this was scarcely needful for the animals back was turned towards the kablunet and his whole attention was concentrated on the gulls  as rooney wore eskimo bootsthe soles of which are softhe made little or no noise in walking and thus managed to gain the platform unperceived by the bear though visible all the time to the eskimos to whom he looked little bigger than a crow on the height  their delight however began to be tempered with anxiety when they saw the reckless man creep to within twenty yards of the monster making use of the iceblocks as it had done before him  the intentions of the kablunet were incomprehensible to his friends could it be that ignorant of the strength of the beast and its tenacity of life the foolish man hoped to stab it to death with a small knife impossible  and yet he was evidently preparing for action of some sort  but red rooney was not quite so foolish as they supposed him to be having gained the nearest possible point to his victim he made a sudden and tremendous rush at it  he knew that life and death were in the balance at any rate but he also knew that to remain inactive on that iceberg would remove life out of the balance altogether  he therefore threw all his energy of soul and body into that rush and launched himself against the broad back of the bear  it was an awful shock rooney was swift as well as heavy so that his weight multiplied into his velocity sufficed to dislodge the wonderstricken animal  one wild spasmodic effort it made to recover itself and in doing so gave rooney what may be called a backhander on the head that sent him reeling on the ice  curiously enough it was this that saved the daring man for if he had not received that blow the impetus of his attack would have certainly sent himself as well as the bear over the cliff  as it was the monster went over headlong with a sort of compound shriek and howl that made the very icecliffs ring  then down he wentnot head or feet first or sideways or any way but every way by turns and no way long  indeed he spun and as it were spurted down that mighty face of ice  each instant intensified the velocity each whirl increased the complex nature of the force  the ledge halfway down from which the affrighted gulls fled shrieking did not even check the descent but with bursting violence shunted the victim out into space through which he hurled till remet by the terrific slope farther down which let him glissade like a shooting star into indescribable ruin  enough of that bear was left however to render it worth while picking up the fragments  shouting with laughter and yelling with glee the eskimos made for the spot where the mangled carcass lay  soon after they were joined by the hero of the day  food enough now for a moon or more said rooney as he came up  yes and no need to beat the meat to make it tender responded okiok lifting and letting fall one of the limp legs of the creature whose every bone seemed to have been smashed to pieces in the tremendous descent  it was no doubt a considerable reduction of their satisfaction at supper that evening that they had to eat their bearchops raw not having the means of making fire but they were not disposed to find fault with their goodfortune on that account  if they had only possessed two small pieces of wood with which to create the necessary friction they could easily have made a lamp out of one of the bears shoulderblades and found oil enough in his own fat while a tag of sealskin or some other portion of clothing might have supplied a wick but not a scrap of wood was to be obtained on that verdureless island  okiok did indeed suggest that norrak and ippegoo being both possessed of hard and prominent noses might rub these organs together till they caught fire but norrak turned up his nose at the suggestion and ippegoo shook his head doubtfully  in the circumstances therefore they obtained light at least for the purposes of vision by commencing supper long before sunset and most of them continued it long after dark  thus the second night was passed on the berg  on the third day the weather being still warm and calm angut simek okiok and rooney ascended after their bearbreakfast to the breakneck height from which that breakfast had been precipitated for the purpose of taking a meteorological observation  it is quite plain to me said rooneywho being in some sort at sea was as it were more at home than his companionsit is quite plain to me that we have got fairly into the great polar current and are travelling in a sousouwest direction down davis straits  no doubt rooney gave sousouwest in some sort of eskimo jargon with which we are not acquainted  his lingual powers were indeed marvellous and when simple words failed him he took refuge in compound phraseology  but asked okiok how can you tell that we are going south  the mist is thick we cannot see land  do you not see the small pieces of ice replied rooney pointing to the sea  yes said the eskimo they are going north faster than we are that is all  why do they go north faster than we do asked rooney  that i know not  i will tell you okiok  it is because there is a surface current here flowing northward and the small pieces of ice go with it because they are not deep  but this berg is very deep  there is far more of it below water than what we see above  its bottom goes deep down into the undercurrent which flows south and so it is being carried southnot north at allagainst the variable surfacecurrents and it would go even against the wind if there was any  do you understand  huk exclaimed the eskimo though he still looked perplexed  i have seen these bergs breaking from the great landice since i was a little boy said angut with earnest gravity and i have seen them float away and away till they vanished in the faroff  can ridroonee tell where they go to  truly i can  they are carried by currents out into the great seawe call it the atlanticand there they melt and disappear  then shall we disappear with this berg if we dont escape from it said okiok with a look so serious that it was almost humorous  that is the pleasant prospect in store for us as you say returned rooney but cheer up lad  we intend to escape from it so dont let your heart sink else your body wont be able to swim  on the strength of this consolatory remark the four men returned to the cave to recruit their energies and hopes on a fresh supply of the raw bear    chapter twenty two  a brief but singular voyage winds up with a great surprise  the calm which had fortunately prevailed since angut and his friends found refuge on the iceberg was not destined to continue  a smart breeze at last sprang up from the northward which soon freshened into a gale accompanied with heavy showers of snow driving the party into the cave where the cold was so severe that they were forced to take refuge in its deepest recesses and to sit wrapped in their bearskins and huddled together for warmth as monkeys are sometimes seen on a cold day in a menagerie  being from the north the wind not only intensified the cold and brought back for a time all the worst conditions of winter but assisted the great ocean current to carry the berg southward at a high rate of speed  their progress however was not very apparent to the eyes of our voyagers because all the surrounding bergs travelled in the same direction and at nearly the same speed  the blinding snow effectually hid the land from their view and the only point of which they were quite sure was that their berg must be the nearest to the greenland coast because all the others lay on their right hand  towards noon of the following day it was observed that the packice thickened around them and was seen in large fields here and there through some of which the great berg ploughed its way with resistless momentum  before the afternoon the pack had closed entirely around them as if it had been one mass of solid rugged icenot a drop of water being visible  even through this mass the berg ploughed its way slowly but with great noise  there is something very awful to me in the sight of such tremendous force said red rooney to angut as they stood contemplating the havoc their strange ship was making  does it not make you think returned the eskimo how powerful must be the great spirit who made all things when a little part of his work is so tremendous  rooney did not reply for at that moment the berg grounded with a shock that sent all its spires and pinnacles tumbling  fortunately the eskimos were near their cavern into which they rushed and escaped the terrible shower  but the cave could no longer be regarded as a place of safety  it did indeed shelter them from the immediate shower of masses even the smaller of which were heavy enough to have killed a walrus but at that advanced period of spring the bergs were becoming so to speak rotten and liable at any moment to fall to pieces and float away in the form of packice  if such an event had occurred when our eskimos were in the cave the destruction of all would of course have been inevitable  we dare not remain here said angut when the icy shower had ceased  no we must take to the floes said simek  another shake like that remarked okiok might bring the whole berg down on our heads  let us go then at once said rooney the sky clears a little so well know how to steer  no one replied for all were already engaged with the utmost activity making bundles of their bearskins and as much of the bearmeat as the men could carryeach of the women taking a smaller piece according to her strength or her prudence  the sailor followed their example in silence and in a very few minutes they issued from the cavern and made for the shore of the berg  some difficulty was experienced in scrambling over the chaotic masses which had been thrown up in front of them by the ploughing process before referred to  when they stood fairly on the floes however they found that although very rough these were sufficiently level to admit of slow travelling  they were in the act of arranging the order of march when the berg slid off into deep water and wheeling round as if annoyed at the slight detention rejoined its stately comrades in their solemn procession to their doom in more southerly seas  just in time said rooney as they watched the berg floating slowly away nodding its shattered head as if bidding them farewell  now then ho for the greenland shore  come old kannoa ill take you under my special care  he took the old womans bundle from her as he spoke and putting his left hand under her right arm began to help her over the frozen sea  but poor old thing though she certainly was that antiquated creature became a griggy old thing immediately and was so tickled with the idea of the stoutest and handsomest man of the party devoting himself entirely to her when all the younger women were allowed to look after themselves that she could scarcely walk during the first few minutes for laughing  but it must be said in justification of the eskimo men that their young women were quite capable of looking after themselves and would indeed have been incommoded as well as surprised by offers of assistance  rooney had spoken cheerily though his feelings were anything but cheerful for he knew well the extreme danger of their position but he felt it a duty to do his best to encourage his friends  the eskimos were equally well if not better aware of their danger and took to the floes with resolute purpose and in profound silencefor true men in such circumstances are not garrulous  a gleam of sunshine from a rift in the dark clouds seemed sent as a heavenly messenger to guide them  by it the eskimos as well as the sailor were enabled to judge of the position of land and to steer accordingly in what western hunters would call a beeline  the great danger of course lay in the risk of the pack breaking up before they could reach the shore  there was also the possibility of the pack being a limited strip of floeice unconnected with the shore which if it had been so would have decided their fate  in these circumstances they all pushed on at their best speed  at first the women seemed to get along as well as the men but after a while the former showed evident symptoms of exhaustion and towards dusk old kannoa despite rooneys powerful aid fairly broke down and refused to walk another step  the seaman overcame the difficulty by raising her in his arms and carrying her  as he had not at that time quite recovered his full strength and was himself pretty well fatigued he was constrained to think pretty steadily of the old womans resemblance to his grandmother to enable him to hold out  after another mile or so the mother of arbalik succumbed whereupon her son put his arm round her waist and helped her on  then the pleasant little mother of ippegoo broke down with a pitiful wail but her son was unable to help her for he was already undulating about like a piece of tape as if he had no backbone to speak of  okiok therefore came to her aid  as for the hardy spinster sikogow she seemed inexhaustible and scorned assistance  nuna was also vigorous but her sons norrak and ermigit being amiable came on each side of her and took her in tow before the breakingdown point was reached  thus they continued to advance until the darkness became so profound as to render further travelling impossible  the danger of delay they knew was extreme but men must perforce bow to the inevitable  to advance without light over rugged ice in which were cracks and fissures and hummocks innumerable being out of the question rooney called a halt  rest and food friends he said are essential to life  huk was the brief reply  without wasting breath on another word they untied their bundles spread their bearskins in the lee of a hummock fed hastily but heartily rolled themselves in their simple bedding and went to sleep  during the night there occurred one of those sudden changes which are common in arctic lands at that season of the year  snow ceased to fall the sky cleared and the temperature rose until the air became quite balmy  the ice of the floes eased off narrow openings grew into lanes and leads and wide pools until water predominated and the ice finally resolved itself into innumerable islets  when rooney was at last awakened by a blaze of sunshine in his face he found that the party occupied a small cake of ice in the midst of a grand crystal archipelago  not a zephyr ruffled the sea and the hills of greenland were visible not more than six or eight miles distant on their left hand  what particular part of greenland it was of course they had no means of knowing  the sight was indeed such as might have filled human hearts with admiration and joy but neither joy nor admiration touched the hearts of red rooney and his companions  so far from land on a bit of ice scarce large enough to sustain them and melting rapidly away exposed to the vicissitudes of a changeful and stormy climate without the means of escapethe case seemed very desperate  the great spirit has forsaken us said angut gloomily as he surveyed the scene  that he has not returned the sailor whatever may befall  an exclamation from arbalik drew attention to a particular part of the horizon  a flat island said okiok after a long earnest gaze but we cannot reach it he added in a low voice  you know not said angut  the current sets that way i think  a few minutes will show said rooney  with almost trembling eagerness they watched the islet and as rooney had said it soon became evident that the current was indeed carrying their iceraft slowly towards the spot  we can scarcely expect to drift right on to it said rooney and it is apparently our last chance so we shall have to take to the water when near it  can we all swimeh  to this question some answered yes and some no while others shook their heads as if uncertain on the point  but the seaman was wrong  straight as an arrow to a bulls eye the raft went at that islet and struck on its upper end with such force as to send a tongue of ice high on the shore so that the whole party actually landed dryshod  even old kannoa got on shore without assistance  the joy of the party at this piece of unlookedfor goodfortune was unbounded although after all the improvement in their circumstances did not seem to be great for the islet was not more than a hundred yards in diameter and appeared to be quite barren with only a clump of willows in its centre  still their recent danger had been so imminent that the spot seemed quite a secure refuge by contrast  the men of the party after landing were only just beginning to comment on their prospects when they saw the willows in the centre of the islet part asunder and a man of strange aspect and costume stood before them  the stranger who had burst thus unexpectedly upon them like a visitant from another world bereaving them for a few minutes of speech and motion was evidently not a native of the land  his pale and somewhat melancholy face as well as parts of his costume betokened him one who had come from civilised lands and rooneys first thought was that he must be a shipwrecked sailor like himself but a second glance caused him to reject the idea  the calm dignity of his carriage the intellectuality of his expression and withal the look of gentle humility in his manner were not the usual characteristics of seamen in those days  he also looked very haggard and worn as if from severe fatigue or illness  a slight smile played for a moment on his lips as he observed the blank amazement which his appearance had produced  hastening forward he held out his hand to rooney whom he at once recognised as a man of civilised lands  let me congratulate you friends on your escape for i can see that you must have been in great jeopardy from which the lord has delivered you  the stranger spoke in the danish language which was of course utterly incomprehensible to the natives  not so however to red rooney who in his seafaring life had frequently visited copenhagen bergen and christiania and other scandinavian ports and had learned to speak danish at least fluently if not very correctly  he at once replied at the same time returning the warm grasp of the strangers hand  we have indeed just escaped from great danger through the mercy of god  but who are you and how come you to be in such a lonely place and if i do not greatly mistake in a starving condition  i am a missionary to the eskimos replied the stranger and have been forced to take refuge here by stress of weather  but i am not absolutely alone as you seem to think  there are five natives with me and we have an oomiak up there in the bushes  they are now asleep under it  for five days we have been detained here almost without food by the recent storm and the packice  now thanks to my father in heaven we shall be able to launch our little boat and get away  in fact being the first of my party to awake this morning i rose very quietly so as not to disturb the poor people who stand much in need of rest and i had come to look at the state of the ice when i unexpectedly discovered you on the shore  stay now sir not another word till you have broken your fast said rooney with kindly violence as he hastily cut a large slice from his piece of bears meat  sit down on that stone and eat it at once  a fasting man should not talk  but my companions need food to the full as much as i do objected the missionary  do as i bid ye sir returned rooney with decision  you say they are asleep  well sleep is as needful as food and sleeping men cannot eat  when you have eaten we will go up and awake and feed them  thus urged the poor man began to eat the raw meat with as much relish as if it had been the finest venison cooked to a turn  before commencing however he clasped his hands closed his eyes and audibly thanked god for the supply  while he was thus engaged red rooney did not speak but sat looking at his new friend with profound interest  perchance his interest would have deepened had he known that the man was none other than the famous norwegian clergyman hans egede the originator of the danish mission to greenland who founded the colony of godhaab in the year 1721 about twelve years before the commencement of the missions of the moravian brethren to that land  the surprise which our voyagers had received by the unexpected appearance of the missionary was however as nothing compared with the surprise that was yet in store for them on that eventful day    chapter twenty three  describes a most amazing surprise and treats of hans egede  when the starving missionary had taken the edge off his appetite he closed the claspknife with which he had been eating  now my friend he said looking at rooney i have eaten quite enough to do me good in my present conditionperhaps more than enough  you know it is not safe for starving men to eat heartily  besides i am anxious to give some food to the poor fellows who are with me  one of them has met with a severe accident and is dying i fear  he does not belong to my party i found him on the mainland and brought him here just before the storm burst on us intending to take him on to godhaab he stands more in need of food than sleep i think  come then we will go to him at once said rooney tying up the remains of egedes breakfast  how did he come by his accident continued the sailor as the party walked up towards the bushes  the girl who takes care of himhis daughter i thinksays he was injured by a bear  if it is a case of broken bones perhaps i may be of use to him said rooney for ive had some experience in that way  egede shook his head i fear it is too late he replied  besides his mind seems to give him more trouble even than his wasted frame  he has come he says from the far north and would certainly have perished after his accident if it had not been for the care and kindness of the women who are with himespecially the younger woman  see there she comes  her father must have awakened for she rests near him at night and never leaves him in the morning till he wakes up  the missionary was startled at that moment by a loud shout from his companion  next instant angut rushed past him and catching the girl in his arms gave her a most fervent and loverlike embrace to which she seemed in no ways averse  it soon became obvious to the missionary that a most unexpected and pleasant meeting of friends was taking place but the surprise expressed on his grave visage had barely given place to a benignant smile of sympathy when a female shriek was heard and sigokow was seen running towards her sister kabelaw  these two did not leap into each others arms  the feelings of eskimo females do not usually find vent in that way but they waltzed round each other and grinned and smoothed each others hair and when kabelaw observed that her sister had a huge black eye and a yet unhealed cut across the bridge of her rather flat nose she clapped her hands and went into fits of laughter which helped her somewhat to relieve her feelings  the surprise and pleasure of this meeting was still at its height when two shrill cries were heard  these were instantly followed by the bursting of pussi and tumbler on the scene the former of whom rushed into the ready arms of pussimek while the latter plunged into the bosom of nuna  ippegoo unable to contain himself for joy began an impromptu and original waltz round his own mother  of course it was some time before the party calmed down sufficiently to give or receive explanations  when this state however was arrived at a feeling of sadness was cast over them all by the reannouncement of the fact that ujarak was certainly dying  he had been carried out of the hole in the snow in which egede and his party had taken refuge from the storm and laid on a dry spot among the bushes where he could enjoy the sunshine so that he became visible to his former friends the instant they entered the cleared space where he lay  any feelings of revenge that may have lingered in the breast of angut were dissipated like a summer cloud when he saw the thin worn frame and the pale haggard countenance of the poor wizard  he went forward at once and kneeling beside him took hold of one of his hands  youyouforgive me i see said ujarak anxiously  yes i forgive you replied angut with fervour for his heart was touched at the sight of the once strong and selfreliant man who in so short a time had been reduced to such utter helplessness  i am gladglad continued ujarak that you have come before i die i thank god for sending you  i have prayed for this  you thank god you have prayed exclaimed angut in surprise  is it the kablunets god you thank and pray to  yes jesusnot only the kablunets god but the god and saviour of the innuit alsothe saviour of the whole world  i have found himor rather he has found me the wicked angekok since i came here  the dying man turned a grateful look on egede as he spoke  it is true said the missionary coming forward  i believe that god who brings about all good things sent me here and sent this man here so that we should meet for the purpose of bringing about his salvation the almighty is confined to no such plans yet it pleases him to work by means and often with poor tools  egede spoke now in the language of the eskimos having long before that time learned to speak it sufficiently well to be understood  angut said ujarak after a few moments listen to me  i cannot live long  before i go let me tell you that nunaga is goodgoodgood she is true to you and she has been very very good to me  she forgives me though i meant to take her from you and from her home for ever  but for her i should have been left to die on the ice  she must have had the spirit of jesus in her before she heard his name  take care of her angut  she will serve you well  listen to her and she will teach you to be wise  he ceased abruptly  the energy with which he spoke proved to be the last flare of the mysterious lamp of life  next moment only the wornout tenement of the angekok lay before his people for his spirit had returned to god who gave it  the joy which had been so suddenly created by this unexpected union of friends and kindred was damped not only by the sad though happy death of the wizard but by the recurrence of the storm which had already proved almost fatal to them all  the recent clearing up of the weather was only a lull in the gale  soon the sky overclouded again snow began to fall so thickly that they could not see more than a few yards in any direction and the wind drove them back into the hole or cave in the snow out of which the shortlived sunshine had drawn them  the body of ujarak was buried under a heap of stones for they had no implements with which to dig a grave  then okiok and his party hastily constructed a rude snowhut to protect them from the storm  here for two more days and nights they were imprisoned and much of that time they passed in listening to the pleasant discourse of hans egede as he told the northern natives the wonderful story of redemption through jesus christ or recounted some of his own difficulties in getting out to greenland  few missionaries we should imagine have experienced or overcome greater difficulties in getting to their field of labour than this same earnest norwegian hans egede though doubtless many may have equalled him in their experience of dangers and difficulties after the fight began  even after having made up his mind to go to greenland out of pure desire for the salvation of soulsfor his knowledge of that inhospitable land precluded the possibility of his having been tempted to go to it from any other motivehe had to spend over ten years of his life in overcoming objections and obstructions to his starting  at first his friends gave him credit for being mad for people are somewhat slow to believe in disinterested selfsacrifice and the idea of a clergyman with a comfortable living in norway who had besides a wife and four small children voluntarily resolving to go to a region in which men could be barely said to live merely for the purpose of preaching christ to uncivilised savages seemed to them absurd  they little knew the power of the missionary spirit or rather the power of the holy spirit by which some great men are actuated  but after all if in the worlds experience many men are found ready to take their lives in their hands and cheerfully go to the coldest hottest and wildest regions of earth at the call of duty or glory or gold is it strange that some men should be found willing to do the same thing for the love of god and the souls of men  be this as it may it is certain that the soul of good hans egede became inflamed with a burning desire to go as a missionary to greenland and from the time that the desire arose he never ceased to pray and strive towards the accomplishment of his purpose  his thoughts were first turned in that direction by reading of christian men from his own country who centuries before had gone to greenland established colonies been decimated by sickness and then almost exterminated by the nativesat least so it was thought but all knowledge of them had long been lost  a friend in bergen who had made several voyages to greenland aroused egedes pity for his lost countrymen some of whom it was supposed had sunk back into paganism for want of teachers  his thoughts and his desires grew and the first difficulty presented itself in the form of a doubt as to whether it was allowable to forsake his congregation  besides several near relations as well as wife and children were dependent on him for sustenance which increased the initial difficulty  but where theres a will theres a way is a proverb the truth of which hans egede very soon began to exemplify  not least among this good mans difficulties seemed to be his modesty for he was troubled with extreme diffidence and the fear of being charged with presumption  at last in the year 1710 he determined to make a humble proposal to bishop randulph of bergen and to bishop krog of drontheim entreating them to support at court his plans for the conversion of the greenlanders  both bishops replied favourably but when his friends saw that he was in earnest they set up vehement opposition to what they styled his preposterous enterprise  even his wife and family were at first among his foes so that the poor man was greatly perplexed and wellnigh gave up in despair  happily his wife at the time became involved in a series of troubles and persecutions which so affected her that she left the enemy and ever afterwards supported her husband loyally heart and soul  that egede regarded his wifes opposition as more formidable than that of all the rest of his kith and kin put together may be gathered from the fact that he says on her coming over that his joy was complete and that he believed every obstacle to have been vanquished  in the strength of these feelings he immediately drew up a memorial to the worthy college of missions and again entreated the help of the bishops of bergen and drontheim  but bishops then as now were not to be unduly hurried  they recommended patience till more favourable and peaceful times  thus egedes plans were postponed from year to year for peaceful times seemed very far off  moreover he was assailed with all kinds of reproaches and misunderstandings as to motives so that in the year 1715 he thought it necessary to draw up a vindication of his conduct entitled a scriptural and rational solution and explanation of the difficulties and objections raised against the design of converting the heathen greenlanders  then people tried to divert egede from his purpose by picturing to him the dangers of his enterprise the miseries he must endure the cruelty of endangering the lives of his wife and children and lastly by pointing out the madness of relinquishing a certain for an uncertain livelihood  they even went so far as to insinuate that under a cloak of religious motive he wished to aggrandise his reputation but egede was heroically firmsome folk would say obstinate  wearied with delays and having reason to believe that his memorial was not properly supported he resolved at last to go himself to the fountainhead  resigning his office in 1718 he went to bergen from which port there had been in time past considerable trade with greenland  here he received little or no encouragement but the sudden death at this time of king charles the twelfth giving hopes of the speedy restoration of peace egede thought it advisable to go to copenhagen and personally present his memorial to the college of missions  he did so and received the encouraging answer that the king would consider his matter  kings have a wonderful capacity for taking time to consider matters sometimes to the extent of passing out of time altogether and leaving the consideration to successors  but the king on this occasion was true to his word  he gave egede a private audience and in 1719 sent orders to the magistrates of bergen to collect all the opinions and information that could be gathered in regard to the trade with greenland and the propriety of establishing a colony there with a statement of the privileges that might be desired by adventurers wishing to settle in the new land  but alas no adventurers wished to settle there the royal efforts failed and poor egede was left to fall back on his own exertions and private enterprise  for another year this indefatigable man vainly importuned the king and the college of missions  at last he prevailed on a number of sympathisers to hold a conference  these under his persuasive powers subscribed forty pounds apiece towards a mission fund  egede set a good example by giving sixty pounds  then by begging from the bishop and people of bergen he raised the fund to about two thousand pounds with this sum he bought a ship and called it the hope  two other vessels were chartered and freightedone for the whale fishery the other to take home news of the colony  the king although unable to start the enterprise appointed egede missionary to the colony with a salary of sixty pounds a year besides a present of a hundred pounds for immediate expenses and finally on the 12th may 1721 the indomitable hans with his heroic wife and four children set sail for greenlands icy mountains after an unprecedented ten years conflict  dangers and partial disasters greeted them on their arrival in july at baals river latitude 64 degrees where they established the colony of godhaab  it would require a volume to tell of hans egedes difficulties doings and sufferings in the new land  suffice it to say that they were tremendous and that he acted as the pioneer to the interesting missions of the moravian brethren to the same neighbourhood  hans egede had been several years at his post when the meeting already described took place between him and the northern eskimos    chapter twenty four  escape from present danger and a curious instance of the effects of gin  although nunaga kabelaw and the children were now happily reunited to friends and kindred their dangers were by no means over for a wide space of iceblocked sea separated the small island from the shores of greenland and their supply of meat was not sufficient even with economy to maintain the whole party for more than a couple of days  in these circumstances they were much comforted after the storm had blown itself out to find that the pack had been considerably loosened and that several lanes of open water extended through it in the direction of the shore  there is a temporary settlement of natives not far from here on the mainland said egede when he and some of the men were assembled on the beach discussing their plans  although not very friendly they would nevertheless help us i think in this hour of need  they have been demoralised by traders and drawn away from the mission at godhaab  but how we are to get to the mainland it is difficult to see unless god mercifully clears away the ice  why dont you ask your god to clear it away demanded simek  have you not told us that he answers prayer offered in the name of jesus  egede looked at his questioner in some surprise mingled with pleasure for his experience had taught him that too many of the natives either assented without thought to whatever he said or listened with absolute indifference if not aversionespecially when he attempted to bring truth home or apply it personally  i am glad you ask the question simek he replied because it gives me the opportunity of telling you that i have asked god in the name of jesus to bring us out of our present trouble and also of explaining that i never pray without adding the words if it be thy willfor god does not always answer prayer exactly in accordance with our request but according to his own wisdom so that if he were hereafter to say now is not that better than you asked we would be obliged to reply yes lord it is better  as the expression on simeks face showed that he was not quite convinced egede added  listen simek  i and my people were starving here  i prayed to god in jesus name to send us deliverance  did he not answer my prayer by sending you and your party with food  true assented simek  listen again simek  were you not in great danger when your oomiak and kayaks were crushed in the ice  yes  were you not in very great danger when you were imprisoned on the icebergin danger of starvation in danger of being crushed by its disruption  yes  well now if you had believed in the great and good spirit at that time what would you have asked him to do for you  i would have asked him to clear the sea of ice replied the eskimo promptly and send us kayaks and oomiaks to take us on shore  and if he had answered you according to your prayer you would have said no doubt that is well  yes answered simek emphatically and with a smile  but suppose continued egede that god had answered you by delivering you in another wayby keeping you on the berg by making that berg as it were into a great oomiak and causing it to voyage as no oomiak ever voyagedcausing it to plough through packice as no ship made by man ever ploughed to go straight to an island to which no human power could have brought you and to have done it all in time to save your own dear pussi and all the rest of us from starvationwould you not have said that god had answered your prayer in a way that was far better  while the missionary was speaking profound gravity took the place of the puzzled expression on the countenance of simek and of the others who were listening for their intelligence was quite quick enough to perceive the drift of his argument before it was finished  but said simek earnestly i did not pray for this yet i got it  true the good spirit guided you even though you did not pray returned egede  is not this a proof of his love  if he is so good to thankless and careless children what sure ground have we for trusting that he will be good to those who love him  what our great father wants is that we should love and trust him  there was one man of the group whose lips were parted and whose eyes seemed to glitter as he listened  this was angut  much and deeply had that intelligent eskimo thought about the great spirit and the mysteries around and within himself but never till that moment did the curtain seem to rise so decidedly from before his spiritual vision  egede observed the keen gaze though he judged it wise to take no notice of it at the time but he did not fail to pray mentally that the good seed might take root  the attention of the party was called off the subject of discourse just then by a further movement of the packice  see the lanes of open water widen exclaimed okiok eagerly pointing seaward  perhaps said egede god intends to deliver us  have you prayed to be delivered asked angut quickly  yes i have  suppose continued the inquisitive eskimo that god does not deliver you but leaves you here to die  would that be answering your prayer  yes for instead of granting my request in the way i wished namely that i might be permitted to live and preach about the great spirit to your countrymen for many years he would have answered my prayer for deliverance by taking me away from all evil to be with jesus which is far better  to the surprise of the missionary a look of disappointment settled on the face of angut  what ails you he asked  from what you say returned the eskimo somewhat coldly i see that with you whatever happens is best nothing can be wrong  there is something which tells me herehe placed his hand on his breastthat that is not true  you misunderstand me friend said egede i did not say that nothing can be wrong  what i do say is that whatever god does is and must be right  but god has given to man a free will and with his free will man does wrong  it is just to save man from this wrongdoing that jesus came to earth  free will murmured the eskimo with a recurrence of the perplexed look  and well might that look recur for his untrained yet philosophical mind had been brought for the first time face to face with the great insoluble problem of the ages  yes said egede you have got hold of a thought which no man has ever yet been able to fathom  free will is a great mystery nevertheless every child knows that it is a great fact  from this point angut seemed to commune only with his own spirit for he put no more questions  at the same time the opening up of the pack rendered the less philosophical among the eskimos anxious to make some practical efforts for their deliverance  at rooneys suggestion it was arranged that the boldest of the men should take the missionarys boata very small one that could not carry above a third of the partyand examine the leads of open water until they should ascertain whether they seemed safe or practicable then return at once and if the report should be favourable begin by taking off the women and children  this plan was carried out  a favourable report was brought back the women were immediately embarked and before evening closed the whole party was landed on the mainland in safety  being too late to proceed further that day the eskimos ran up a rude shelter of stones moss and sticks the women being accommodated under the upturned boat  next day they found that the pack had continued to ease off during the night so that there was a lead of open water between it and the shore  you have been praying during the night said okiok to egede in an abrupt manner almost as if he were accusing him of taking an unfair advantage of circumstances  truly i have answered the missionary with an amused look but i did not presume to ask the great spirit to help us in this particular way i left that to his wisdom and love  i have been taught to trust him  and if you had not got an answer at all returned okiok wrinkling his brows in perplexity you would still have said that all was right  just so  if i get an answer it is well  if i get no answer it is still well for then i know that he sees delay to be best for me and i feel sure that the answer will come at last in the right way and in good time for in the book of the great spirit i am told that all things work together for good to them that love god  what exclaimed angut who had listened to the conversation with intense interest would it be good for you if i killed you  of course it would if god allowed it  thousands of men and women in time past have chosen to be killed rather than offend god by sinning  this is very strange teaching said angut glancing at his friend okiok  it is the teaching of jesus the son of god  i am only his servant said the missionary and i hope to tell you much more that will seem very strange before long but at present we must arrange what is now to be done for it is the duty of all men to take advantage of opportunities as they are presented to them  the truth of this was so obvious that the eskimos at once dropped into the region of the practical by advising that the women should all get into the boat and advance by water while the men should walk by the shore  this being agreed to the boat was launched  although not an eskimo oomiak the little craft which was made of wood and resembled a punt was propelled by oomiak paddles so that madame okiok who was appointed steerswoman felt herself quite at home when seated in her place sigokow being a powerful creature physically as well as mentally was put in charge of the bowpaddle  the other women were ranged along the sides each with a paddle except old kannoa who was allowed to sit in the bottom of the craft as a passenger and guardian of pussi and tumbler  as these last were prone to jump about under violent impulses of joyous hilarity and had an irresistible desire to lean over the sides for the purpose of dipping their hands in the sea the duty of the old woman although connected with childrens play was by no means childs play  three miles an hour being the average speed at which the boat went the walkers easily kept up with it  only once did a difficulty occur when they came to a narrow bay which although not more than a mile or so across from point to point ran so far inland that the walkers could not have gone round it without great loss of time  we must be ferried across here said egede but as it is past noon i think we had better call a halt and dine before making the traverse  that is my opinion too sir said rooney throwing down the bundle he had been carrying  as the invitation to feed seldom comes amiss to a healthy eskimo egedes proposal was at once agreed to and in a few minutes they were all busily engaged  it was a pretty spot that on which they dined  bushes just beginning to bud surrounded them brilliant sunshine drew forth delicious scents from the long long frozen earth and the reviving herbage on which they sat  it also drew forth gushing rivulets from the patches of snow and heavy drifts which here and there by their depth and solidity seemed to bid defiance to the sweet influences of spring  the iceladen sea sent gentle wavelets to the pebbly shore  a group of large willows formed a background to their lordly hall and behind them in receding and grand perspective uprose the great shoulders of greenlands mountains  on all those natural objects of interest and beauty however the travellers did not at first bestow more than a passing glance  they were too much engrossed with metal more attractive in the shape of bear blubber but when appetite began to fail conversation began to flow  at that point it occurred to pussi and tumbler that they would go and have some fun  childnature is much the same all the world over and curiously enough it bears strong resemblance to adult nature  having fed to satiety these chips of simek and okiok lifted up their eyes and beheld the surrounding shrubs  at once the idea aroselet us explore  the very same impulse that sent mungo park and livingstone to africa ross parry franklin kane and all the rest of them toward the pole led our little hero and heroine into that thicket and curiosity urged them to explore as far as possible  they did so and as a natural consequence lost themselves  but what cared they for that  with youth and health and strength they were as easy in their minds as lieutenant greely was with sextant chart and compass  as to food were they not already victualled for not a three years but a three hours expedition  and their parents were not disturbed on their account  eskimo fathers and mothers are not as a rule nervous or anxious about their offspring  in a remarkably short space of time pussi and tumbler walking hand in hand put more than a mile of bush between them and their feedingplace  oh whas dat exclaimed pussi stopping short and gazing into the thicket in front of her  we pause to remind the reader that our little ones lisped in eskimo and that in order to delineate faithfully our only resource is to translate into lisping english  its a man exclaimed tumbler  i tink hims a funny man murmured the little girl as the man approached  pussi was right  but it was not his dress so much as his gait and expression that were funny  for the stranger was obviously an eskimo being flat and fatvisaged blackandstraight haired and sealskinnily clad  the singular point about him was his walk  to all appearance it was a recently acquired power for the man frowned almost fiercely at the ground as he advanced and took each step with an amount of forethought and deliberation which to the children seemed quite unaccountable  nay after having taken a step he would seem suddenly to repent and draw back putting a foot behind him again or even to one side or the otheranywhere in short rather than in front  coming up to the children at last by this painful process he became suddenly aware of their presence and opened his eyes to an extent that could only be accounted for on the wild supposition that he had never seen a child in all his life before  having stared for a minute or so with all the intensity of the most solemn surprise he blinked like a sleepy owl his mouth expanded and his whole countenance beamed with goodwill but suddenly he changed back as if by magic to the solemnsurprise condition  this was too much for the children who simultaneously burst into a hilarious fit of laughter  the fit seemed catching for the man joined them with a loud roar of delight swaying to and fro with closed eyes as he did so  the roar brought up red rooney who had followed the childrens steps and happened to be close to them at the time of the explosion  he looked at the man for a moment and then his muttered remark drunk as a fiddler cleared up the mystery  when the man opened his eyes having finished his laugh and beheld a tall kablunet gazing sternly at him all the fire of his ancestors blazed up in his breast and came out at his eyes  drawing his knife he sprang at our seaman with the murderous weapon uplifted  rooney caught his wrist put a foot behind his leg gave him a sort of twirl and laid him flat on his back  the fall caused the knife to spin into the air and the poor eskimo found himself at the mercy of the kablunet  instead of taking the mans life rooney bade him sit up  the man did so with a solemn look not unmixed with perplexity  there is a phase of that terrible vice drunkenness which is comic and it is not of the slightest use to ignore that fact  there were probably few men who detested strong drink and grieved over its dire effects more than red rooney  he had been led at a time when total abstinence was almost unknown to hate the very name of drink and to become a total abstainer  yet he could not for the life of him resist a hearty laugh when the befuddled eskimo blinked up in his face with an imbecile smile and saidwhwhash e matter yyou ststupid ole kkkablunet  the difficulty and faulty nature of his pronunciation was such that slipshod english serves admirably to indicate his state of mind although neither english nor eskimo arabic nor hebrew will suffice to describe in adequate terms the tremendous solemnity of his gaze after the imbecile smile had passed away  you disreputable old seal said rooney where did you get the drink  words are wanting to express the dignified look of injured innocence with which the man repliediive had no ddrink  nosh a ddrop  yes truly you are a man and a brother muttered rooney as he noted this touch of nature and felt that he was in the company of kin whats your name you walrus  kkazho answered the man indignantly  what  kkazho he repeated with emphasis  i suppose you mean kajo you unnatural jellyfish  kajo did not condescend to say what he meant but continued to eye the kablunet with lofty disdain though the effect of his expression was marred by his attention being distracted by pussi and tumbler whose faces were fiery red owing to fits of suppressed laughter  get up now you old rascal said rooney  come along with me and ill show you to my friends  at first the eskimo showed a disposition to resist but when the powerful seaman lifted him up by the neck of his coat as if he had been a little dog and set him on his legs he thought better of it smiled benignly and moved on  hans egede at once recognised this fellow as one of the most troublesome of his flock  i have done my best to keep strong drink from that man he explained to rooney but as you must be aware from your long residence among them the traders will supply the poor creatures with rum and kajos naturally sanguine temperament is unable to withstand its influence over and over again he has promised mewith tears of i believe true repentance in his eyesto give it up but as surely as the traders offer it to him and prevail on him to take one drop so surely does he give way to a regular debauch  while he spoke to rooney in the danish tongue the subject of conversation stood with bowed head consciencesmitten before him for although he did not understand the language he guessed correctly that the talk was about his own misdeeds  come with me said the missionary taking the poor man by the arm leading him aside to some distance and evidently entering into serious remonstrancewhile kajo as evidently commenced energetic protestations  on returning egede said that the eskimo told him his tribe had moved along the coast to a better huntingground and were at that moment located in an old deserted village just beyond the point for which they were making on the other side of the bay  he therefore advised that they should start off at once so as to reach the camp early in the evening  kajo tells me added egede that his kayak lies hid in the bushes at no great distance so he can go with us  he is not too drunk i think to manage his light craft  but egede was wrong for even while he was speaking kajo had slipped quietly behind a bush  there after a cautious look round to see that no one observed him he drew a curious little flat earthenware bottle from some place of concealment about his dress applied it to his lips and took what rooney would have styled a long hearty pull  that draught was the turningpoint  the comic and humorous were put to flight and nothing but fierce furious savagery remained behind  many men in their cups become lachrymose others silly and some combative the fiery liquor had the latter effect on kajo  issuing from his place of retirement with a fiendish yell and glaring eyes he made an insane attack on angut  that eskimo having no desire to hurt the man merely stepped lightly out of his way and let him pass  fortunately his knife had been left on the ground where rooney first met him for he stumbled and fell upon kabelaw into whom he would certainly have plunged the weapon had it still been in his hand  jumping up he looked round with the glaring eyes of a tiger while his fingers clutched nervously at the place where he was wont to carry the lost knife  seeing his condition arbalik sprang towards him but stooping quickly kajo darted out of his way  at the same moment he snatched up a knife that had been left lying on the ground  the first effect of the last draught seemed for the time to have increased the mans powers of action for rushing round the circle he came suddenly upon poor old kannoa who chanced to be seated a little apart from the others seizing her thin hair kajo brandished the knife in front of her throat and glaring at the men gave vent to a wild laugh of triumph  it was evident that he was for the time quite mad and unaccountable for his actionsthough by no means unaccountable for taking the accursed drink that reduced him to that state of temporary insanity  red rooney aghast with horror at the impending fate of the dear old remembrancer of his grandmother sprang forward with the agility of a wild cat but his energy intensified though it was by rage could not have prevented the catastrophe if ippegoo had not come to the rescue  yes that mild youth was the instrument chosen to avert the blow  he chanced to be standing beside a mass of turf which okiok had cut from the ground for the purpose of making a dry seat for nuna  seizing this ippegoo hurled it at the head of the drunken eskimo  never before did the feeble youth make such a good shot  full on the flat face of the drunkard it went like the wad of a siegegun scattering earth and debris all roundand down went the eskimo  unable to check himself down also went rooney on the top of him  next moment the luckless kajo was secured with a piece of walrusline and flung on one side while the indignant party held a noisy consultation as to what was to be done with him    chapter twenty five  the eskimo encampmenta murder and its consequences  with hans egede red rooney and angut as chief councillors it may be easily understood that the punishment awarded to kajo was not severe he was merely condemned in the meantime to be taken to his own people as a prisoner and then let go free with a rebuke  but how are we to carry him there asked egede  he cannot walk and we must not delay  thats true said rooney and it will never do to burden the womens boat with him  it is too full already  did he not say that he had his kayak with him asked angut  he did cried okiok with the sudden animation of one who has conceived an idea  run arbalik ippegoo ermigit norrak and seek for the kayak  the youths named ran off to obey with the alacrity of welltrained children and in half an hour returned in triumph with the kayak on their shoulders  meanwhile kajo had recovered slightly and was allowed to sit up though his hands were still bound  now well try him  launch the boat boys said okiok and be ready to paddle  the young men did as they were bid and okiok unloosening kajos bonds asked him if he could manage his kayak  oofccourse i can replied the man somewhat indignantly  come then embark an do it returned okiok seizing his arm and giving it a squeeze to convince him that he was in the hands of a strong man  kajo staggered towards his little vessel and lifting it with difficulty went down to the beach  he would certainly have fallen and damaged it if okiok had not stood on one side and angut on the other to prevent a fall  when the kayak was launched he attempted to step into the little oval opening in it but with so little success that okiok losing patience lifted him in and crammed him down  then he sent him afloat with a vigorous push  feeling all right with the familiar paddle in his hands kajo tried to rouse himself bethought him of flight gave a hiccoughing cheer and went skimming away like a swordfish  after him now boys and keep alongside cried okiok  responsive to the order the boat shot after the kayak but they had barely got under weigh when kajo made a false stroke with the paddle lost his balance and disappeared  i expected that remarked okiok with a laugh  but the poor man will drown said egede anxiously he is too drunk to recover himself  this was obvious for the overturned craft seemed to quiver like a dying whale while its owner made wild but fruitless efforts to recover his proper position and it is certain that the poor man would then and there have paid the penalty of his intemperance with his life if the boat had not ranged alongside and rescued him  so then said angut to egede as they were bringing kajo ashore this is the effect of the mad waters that i have often heard of but never seen till now  yes angut you see the effect of themat least on one man but their effects vary according to the nature of those who drink  some men they make violent like kajo others become silly while not a few become heavy stupid and brutal  in my country most if not all of the murders that take place are committed under the influence of strong drink  the red indians who dwell far to the southwest of your lands call strong drink firewater  your own name mad waters is better i think  kajo was led forward at this moment looking very much dejected and greatly sobered  he made no further attempt to resist but as a precaution his hands were again tied and then he was left to dry in the sun and to his meditations while the party made the traverse of the bay  this was accomplished in three trips  as the last party was about to start okiok and kajo alone remained on the shore  you had better think twice said rooney as he was about to push off the boat  he may give you some trouble  fear not returned okiok with a grin in which there were mingled fun and contempt  i have thought twicethreefourten times and he extended the fingers of both hands  very good well keep an eye on you said rooney with a laugh  he runs no risk remarked egede taking up one of the paddles to share in the work  his plan is one which eskimos frequently adopt when one of their kayaks has been destroyed by rocks or walruses  the plan referred to consisted in making the man whose kayak has been lost lie out on what may be called the deck of a friends kayak  the wellknown little craft named the rob roy canoe bears much resemblance to the eskimo kayakthe chief difference being that the former is made of thin light wood the latter of a light framework covered with sealskin  both are long and narrow decked entirely over with the exception of a hole in the centre can hold only one person and are propelled with one double paddle having a blade at each end  the only way therefore of helping a friend in distress with such craft is to lay him out flat at full length on the deck and require him to keep perfectly still while you paddle to a place of safety  okiok intended to take the helpless drunkard across the bay in this fashion but for the sake of safety resolved to do it in an unfriendly manner  when the boat had shot away he pushed the kayak into the water until it was afloat in the forepart arranged the spears which formed its armament made fast the various lines and laid the paddle across the opening  then he went up to kajo who had been watching his movements with much curiosity not quite unmingled with discomfort  go he said pointing to the kayak and lay yourself out in front on your face  kajo looked earnestly at the speaker  there was much less of the heroic in his gaze by that time and therefore more of manly determination but okiok said go again  and kajo went  when he was laid flat on his face in front of the opening with his feet on either side and his head towards the bow okiok proceeded to tie him down there  you need not fear he said i will not move  okiok did not cease his work but he said  i will make sure that you do not move  any man with the sense of a puffin might be trusted to lie still for his own sake but i have learned this day that a man full of mad water is a foolnot to be trusted at all  having expressed himself thus and finished the lashing he got softly into his place pushed off and paddled gently over the sea  he had not advanced far when kajo feeling uncomfortable tried slightly to alter his position whereupon okiok took up a spear that lay handy and gave him a slight prick by way of reminding him of his duty  the rest of the voyage was accomplished in peace and safety  in the evening the party arrived at the temporary abode of the tribe to which kajo belonged  by that time the eskimo was thoroughly sober but the same could not be said of all his peopleof whom there were upwards of a hundred men besides women and children  it was found that a chance trader to godhaab had brought a considerable quantity of rum and the families of which we now speak had secured several kegs  all of these eskimos were well acquainted with egede and a few of them were friendly towards him but many were the reverse  there was great excitement among them at the time the party arrivedexcitement that could scarcely be accounted for either by the rum or by the unexpected arrival  egede soon found out what it was  a terrible murder had been committed the night before by one of the eskimos who was considered not only the best hunter of the band to which he belonged but one of the best husbands and fathers  his name was mangek  he was one of those who had been well disposed towards the missionary and in regard to whom much hope had been entertained  but he had been treated to rum by the traders and having conceived an ardent desire for more had managed to obtain a keg of the mad water  although kind and amiable by nature his temperament was sanguine and his nerves sensitively strung  a very little of the rum excited him to extravagant exuberance of spirit and a large dose made him temporarily insane  it was during one of these fits of insanity that mangek had on the previous night struck his wife when she was trying to soothe him  the blow would not in itself have killed her but as she fell her head struck on a stone her skull was fractured and she died in a few minutes  indifferent toindeed ignorant ofwhat he had done the eskimo sat beside the corpse all that night drinking  no one dared to go near him until he fell back helplessly drunk  then they removed the body of his wife  it was bad enough to see this hitherto respected man mad with drink but it was ten times worse to see him next day mad with horror at what he had done  for it was not merely that his wife was dead but that although he had loved that wife with all his heart and soul he had killed her with his own hand  the wretched man had rushed about the place shrieking all the morning sometimes with horror and sometimes with fury until he was physically exhausted  every one had kept carefully out of his way  when our travellers arrived he was lying in his hut groaning heavily but no one knew what state he was in for they still feared to disturb him  no such fear affected hans egede  knowing that he could point to the only remedy for sin and broken hearts he went straight into the poor mans hut  shortly afterwards the groaning ceased and the natives listened with awe to what they knew was the voice of prayer  as they could not however distinguish the words they gradually drew off and circled round the strangers who had so unexpectedly arrived  great was their surprise when they found that their comrade kajo had been brought home as a prisoner and still greater was their surprise when they found that a bottle of rum which had been stolen from one of their hunters and carried off the day before was found on the person of kajofor kajo had been like mangek a respectable man up to that date and no one believed it possible that he would condescend to steal  one of those who was himself under the influence of rum at the time looked sternly at kajo and began to abuse him as a hypocrite and deceiver  now look here cried red rooney stepping forward listen to me  having regard to his commanding look and tone the natives considered him the leader of the party and listened with respect  what right have you he continued turning sharply on the last speaker to look with contempt on kajo  you have been drinking mad water yourself  i smell it in your breath  if you were to take a little more you would be quite ready to commit murder  no i would not replied the eskimo stoutly  yes you would said the sailor still more stoutly  even my goodnatured friend okiok here would be ready to murder his wife nuna if he was full of mad water  this unexpected statement took our kindly eskimo so much by surprise that for a moment or two he could not speak  then he thundered forth  never  what kill nuna  if i was stuffed with mad water from the toes to the eyelids i could not kill nuna  at that moment an aged eskimo pressed to the front  tears were on his wrinkled cheeks as he said in a quavering voice  yes you could my son  the wife of mangek was my dear child  no man ever loved his wife better than mangek loved my child  he would have killed himself sooner than he would have killed her  but mangek did not kill her  it was the mad water that killed her  he did not know what the mad water would do when he drank it  how could he  it is the first time he has drunk it he will never drink it again  but that will not bring back my child  the old man tried to say more but his lip trembled and his voice failed  his head drooped and turning abruptly round he mingled with the crowd  it was evident that the people were deeply moved by this speech probably they had never before given the mad water much of their thoughts but now after what had been said and especially after the awful event of the previous night opinion on the subject was beginning to form  red rooney noted the fact and was quick to take advantage of the opportunity  my friends he said and the natives listened all the more eagerly that he spoke their language so well when a cruel enemy comes to your shore and begins to kill how do you act  we drive him into the sea killdestroy him shouted the men promptly  is not mad water a cruel enemy  has he not already begun his deadly work  has he not killed one of your best women and broken the heart of one of your best men  huk huk  yes that is true  then who will fight him shouted rooney  there was a chorus of i wills and many of the men running up to their huts returned some with bottles and some with kegs  foremost among them was the old father of the murdered woman  he stumbled fell and his keg rolled to rooneys feet  catching it up the sailor raised it high above his head and dashed it to splinters on the stones  with a shout of enthusiasm the eskimos followed his example with bottle and keg and in another moment quite a cataract of the vile spirit was flowing into the sea  that is well done said hans egede coming up at the moment  you know how to take the tide at the flood rooney  nay sir returned the sailor god brought about all the circumstances that raised the tide and gave me power to see and act when the tide was up  i claim to be naught but an instrument  i will not quarrel with you on that point rejoined egede nevertheless as an instrument you did it well and for that i thank god who has granted to you what i have prayed and toiled for without success for many a day  it is another illustration of prayer being answered in a different and better way from what i had asked or expected  in this strange manner was originated on the spur of the moment an effectual and comprehensive total abstinence movement  we are bound of course to recognise the fact that it began in impulse and was continued from necessityno more drink being obtainable there at that time still egede and rooney as well as the betterdisposed among the eskimos rejoiced in the event for it was an unquestionable blessing so far as it went  as the eskimos had settled down on that spot for some weeks for the purpose of huntingwhich was their only method of procuring the necessaries of lifeand as there was no pressing necessity for the missionary or his friends proceeding just then to godhaab it was resolved that they should all make a short stay at the place to assist the eskimos in their work as well as to recruit the health and strength of those who had been enfeebled by recent hardship and starvation    chapter twenty six  tells of men whose actions end in smoke and of others whose plots end in deeds of darkness  this is a world of surprises  however long we may live and however much we may learn the possibility of being surprised remains with us and our capacity for blazing astonishment is as great as when first with staggering gait we escaped from the nursery into space and stood irresolute with the world before us where to choose  these thoughts arise from the remembrance of okiok as he stood one morning openmouthed openeyed opensouled and figuratively petrified gazing at something over a ledge of rock  what that something was we must learn from okiok himself after he had cautiously retired from the scene and run breathlessly back towards the eskimo village where the first man he met was red rooney  iive seen it gasped the eskimo gripping the seamans arm convulsively  seen what  seen a manon fire and he seems not to mind it  on fire  a man  surely not  you must be mistaken  no i am quite sure returned okiok with intense earnestness  i saw him with my two eyes and smoke was coming out of him  rooney halfsuspected what the eskimo had seen but there was just enough of uncertainty to induce him to say come take me to him  is the man alone he asked as they hurried along  no ippegoo is with him staring at him  they soon reached the ledge of rock where okiok had seen the something and looking cautiously over it rooney beheld his friend kajo smoking a long clay pipe such as dutchmen are supposed to love  ippegoo was watching him in a state of ecstatic absorption  rooney drew back and indulged in a fit of stifled laughter for a minute but his companion was too much surprised even to smile  is he doing that curious thing asked okiok in a low voice which you once told me aboutsmookin tibooko  yes thats it replied rooney with a broad grin only you had better say smokin tobacco next time  smokkin tibucco repeated the eskimo well that is funny  but why does he spit it out  does he not like it  of course he likes it  at least i suppose he does by the expression of his face  there could be little doubt that rooney was right  kajo had evidently got over the preliminary stages of incapacity and repugnance long ago and had acquired the power of enjoying that mild and partial stupefactionsometimes called soothing influencewhich tobacco smoke affords  his eyes blinked happily like those of a cat in the sunshine his thickish lips protruded poutingly as they gripped the stem and the smoke was expelled slowly at each puff as if he grudged losing a single whiff of the full flavour  scarcely less interesting was the entranced gaze of ippegoo selfoblivion had been effectively achieved in that youth  a compound of feelingsinterest surprise philosophical inquiry eager expectancy and mild alarmplayed hideandseek with each other in his bosom and kept him observant and still  why asked okiok after gazing in silent admiration for a few minutes over the ledge why does he not swallow it if he likes it and keep it down  its hard to say answered rooney  perhaps hed blow up or catch fire if he were to try  it might be dangerous  see exclaimed okiok in an eager whisper he is going to let ippegoo taste it  rooney looked on with increased interest for at that moment kajo having had enough offered the pipe to his friend who accepted it with the air of a man who half expected it to bite and put the end in his mouth with diffidence  he was not successful with the first draw for instead of taking the smoke merely into his mouth he drew it straight down his throat and spent nearly five minutes thereafter in violent coughing with tears running down his cheeks  kajo spent the same period in laughing and then gravely and carefully explained how the thing should be done  ippegoo was an apt scholar  almost immediately he learned to puff and in a very short time was rolling thick white clouds from him like a turretgun in action  evidently he was proud of his rapid attainments  humph  that wont last long murmured rooney to his companion  isnt it good said kajo to ippegoo  yees  o yes  its good aat least i suppose it is replied the youth with modesty  a peculiar tinge of pallor overspread his face at that moment  whats wrong ippegoo  iifeel ffunny  never mind that said kajo  its always the way at first  when i first tried it i  he was cut short by ippegoo suddenly rising dropping the pipe clapping one hand on his breast the other on his mouth and rushing into the bushes where he disappeared like one of his own puffs of smoke  at the same moment rooney and okiok appeared on the scene laughing heartily  you rascal said rooney to kajo on recovering his gravity you have learned to drink and you have learned to smoke and not satisfied with that extent of depravity you try to teach ippegoo  you pitiful creature  are you not ashamed of yourself  kajo looked sheepish and admitted that he had some sensations of that sort but wasnt sure  tell me continued the seaman sternly before you tasted strong drink or tobacco did you want them  no replied kajo  are you in better health now that youve got them  ii feel the better for them replied kajo  i did not ask what you feel returned rooney  are you better now than you were before  thats the question  but rooney never got a satisfactory answer to that question and kajo continued to drink and smoke until happily for himself he had to quit the settlements and proceed to the lands of thickribbed ice where nothing stronger than train oil and lampsmoke were procurable  as for poor ippegoo he did not show himself to his friends during the remainder of that day  being half an idiot no one could prevail on him thereafter to touch another pipe  now while the eskimos and our friends were engaged in hunting and holding an unwonted amount both of religious and philosophical intercourse a band of desperadoes was descending the valleys of the interior of greenland with a view to plunder the eskimos of the coast  hitherto we have written about comparatively wellbehaved and genial natives but it must not be supposed that there were no villains of an outandout character among those denizens of the north  it is true there were not manyfor the sparseness of the population the superabundance of game on land and sea as well as the wealth of unoccupied huntinggrounds and the rigour of the climate rendered robbery and war quite unnecessary as well as disagreeable  still there were a few spirits of evil even there to whom a quiet life seemed an abomination and for whom the violent acquisition of other mens goods possessed a charm far transcending the practice of the peaceful industries of life  the band referred to was not remarkably strong in numbersabout thirty or so but these were sturdy and daring villains led by a chief who must have had some of the old norse blood in his veins he was so tall fair of complexion and strong  descending first on the little settlement of godhaab at night this robber band found that a dutch tradingvessel had just arrived the crew of which added to the settlers attracted from their huntinggrounds to the village formed a force which they dared not venture to attack openly  grimlek the robber chief therefore resolved to wait for a better opportunity  meanwhile passing himself and band off as hunters he purchased a few things from the traders and then proceeded along the coast intending to hunt as well as to wait till the vessel should depart  while the robbers were thus engaged they came unexpectedly on another tradingshipa dutchmanpart of the crew of which had landed for some purpose or other in their boat  on seeing the eskimos the dutchmen got quickly into their boat and pushed off but the robbers made signs of peace to them and carrying their bows arrows and spears up to the woods left them there returning to the shore as if unarmed though in reality they had retained their knives  again they made signs as if they wished to trade with the dutchmen  deceived by appearances the sailors once more drew in to the shore while they were approaching grimlek called his men round him and gave a few hasty directions  when the sailors had landed the eskimos mingled with them and began to offer sealskins for tradeeach selecting a particular man with whom to transact business  at a given signal they drew their knives from under their coats and each robber stabbed his man to the heart  the men left in the ship seeing what had occurred and that it was too late to attempt rescue instantly filled her sails and went off to sea  the villains having thus easily slain their victims carried off the booty found in the boat and hid it in the bushes to be taken away at a convenient opportunity  but this deed of darkness was not done unwitnessed  early in the morning of that day various hunting parties had dispersed in different directionssome to the hills others to the sea  among the latter was an oomiak full of women who went alongshore to fish and with whom were old kannoa nunaga and others  they went in a northerly direction rooney angut and okiok proceeded along the coast to the southward  the direction taken by these last brought them near to the spot where the dutch sailors had landed at the critical moment when the robbers were mingling with their unsuspecting victims  although only three to thirty it is certain that our heroes would have sprung to the aid of the sailors if they had suspected what was about to happen but the deed was done so promptly that there was no time for action  fortunately rooney and his companions had not shown themselves they were therefore able to draw back into the shelter of the bushes where they held a hasty council of war  we must run back to camp said rooney tell what we have seen and return with a band of men to punish the murderers  agreed said okiok but how are we to do it  the shore is open  we cannot take a step that way without being seen and chased  we might outrun them though i dont feel quite as supple as i used to but we should barely arrive before them in time to warn the camp and should then be almost unfit to fight  to this angut replied that they could go inland over the hills and so come down on the camp in rear  it might not he thought add much to the distance  this plan was quickly adopted and put in practice  but there are few things more deceptive than formation and distance in mountain lands  what seemed to the trio easy proved to be tremendously difficult and the distance they had to travel in order to avoid precipices and surmount ridges gradually increased to many miles so that it was late and twilight was deepening into night before they reached the camp  meanwhile the robbers were not idle  although ignorant of the fact that their bloody work had been observed they were not long ignorant of the near neighbourhood of the eskimo camp  early in the morning they had sent two of their swiftest young men to spy out the land ahead  these had discovered the camp entered it professing to be wandering hunters and had then returned to their friends with the news that many of the men had gone away hunting and would probably remain out all night also that an oomiak full of women had gone off to the southward to fish  the runners happening to descend to the coast on the opposite side of a ridge from rooney and his companions just missed meeting them and returned to their comrades shortly after the massacre  grimlek knew that whatever course he should pursue must be prompt and decisive  he at once divided his men into two bands one of which he sent to pursue and capture the women who had gone to fish with the other which he led in person he resolved either to storm the camp or take it by surprise as circumstances might point out  by the straight way of the shore the distance was not great  in fact the camp might have been seen from the spot where the massacre had been perpetrated but for a high promontory which concealed it  on rounding this promontory the party detailed to pursue the women glided into the bushes and disappeared  grimlek with the remaining men advanced straight and openly towards the camp  he saw however on drawing near that the number of men in it were more than a match for his small party and therefore approached with friendly demonstrations  they were hospitably received by hans egede  my friends he said you have arrived just as we are assembling to talk about the things that concern our souls the future life and the good spirit  will you and your men sit down and listen  for a few moments grimlek did not reply  then he said you are not an eskimo  no i am a kablunet replied egede i have been sent to tell the eskimos about the true god  again the robber chief was silent  then he said that he would consult with his men and retired with them a short distance to do so  nothing better could have happened he said in a low tone  the kablunet is going to talk to them about his god  all we have to do is to mingle with them  let each of you choose his man and sit down beside him  when i give the signal strike at once and let no second blow be needed  a murmur of assent was all that the band returned to this speech and grimlek returning to the missionary said that he and his men were ready to hear  in a few minutes each of the assassins was seated on the ground beside his chosen victim    chapter twenty seven  a strange meeting strangely interrupted  the meeting which had been thus strangely invaded was no ordinary prayer or missionary meeting  it had been assembled by egede for the express purpose of affording some unbelievers among the eskimos an opportunity of stating their difficulties and objections in regard to the new religion  interesting though its proceedings were as showing the similarity of the workings of the civilised and savage minds we cannot afford space to enter much into detail yet some account of the matter seems necessary in order to show what it was that induced the robber chief to delay though not to alter his fell purpose  after prayer offered by the missionary that the holy spirit might descend on and bless the discussion a hymn was sung  it had been translated into eskimo and taught to his converts by egede  then the missionary made a brief but complete statement of the leading facts of the good news of salvation to sinful man in jesus christthis not only to clear the way for what was to come but for the purpose of teaching the newcomers so as to render them somewhat intelligent listeners  then an old greyhaired man arose  i do not object to the new religion he said but i am puzzled  you tell me that god is everywhere and knows everything why then did he not go to our first mother eve and warn her of her danger when the evil one tempted her in the form of a serpent  my friend the question you ask cannot be fully answered said egede i can explain however that our first parents were put into the world to be tried or tested in that way  to have warned eve would have rendered the test useless  enough for us to know that she was told what to do  her duty was to obey  but let me ask you a question is not sinis not murderhateful  grimlek imagined that egede looked him straight in the face as he asked the question and felt uneasy but was by no means softened  yes answered the old man murdersinis hateful  yet it certainly exists continued egede you cannot help believing that  yes i must admit that  then why did god permit sin  of course the old man could not reply and the missionary pointed out that some things were incomprehensible and that that was one of them  but he continued that is no reason why we should not talk of things that are comprehensible  let us turn to these  at this point a middleaged man with a burly frame and resolute expression started up and said in an excited yet somewhat reckless manner  i dont believe a word that you say  everything exists as it was from the beginning until now and will continue the same to the end  who told you that asked egede in a prompt yet quiet manner  the man was silenced  he resumed his seat without answering  you have talked of the end my friend continued the missionary in the same quiet tone  when is the end and what will come after it  i wait for enlightenment  still the man remained dumb  he had evidently exhausted himself in one grand explosion and was unable for more  there was a disposition to quiet laughter on the part of the audience but the missionary checked this by pointing to another man in the crowd and remarking  i think friend that you have something to say  thus invited the man spoke at once and with unexpected vigour  he was a stupidlooking heavyfaced man but when roused as he then was his face lighted up amazingly  we do not understand you he said sternly  show us the god you describe then we will believe in him and obey him  you make him too high and incomprehensible  how can we know him  will he trouble himself about the like of us  some of us have prayed to him when we were faint and hungry but we got no answer  what you say of him cannot be true or if you know him better than we do why dont you pray for us and procure for us plenty of food good health and a dry house that is all we want  as for our souls they are healthy enough already you are of a different race from us  people in your country may have diseased souls  very likely they have  from the specimens we have seen of them we are quite ready to believe that  for them a doctor of souls may be necessary  your heaven and your spiritual joys may be good enough for you but they would be very dull for us  we must have seals and fishes and birds  our souls can no more live without these than our bodies  you say we shall not find any of these in your heaven well then we do not want to go there we will leave it to you and to the worthless part of our own countrymen but as for us we prefer to go to torngarsuk where we shall find more than we require of all things and enjoy them without trouble  see note  with an energetic humph or some such exclamation this selfsatisfied philosopher sat down and many of his countrymen expressed their sympathy with his views by a decided huk but others remained silent and puzzled  and well they might for in these few sentences the eskimo had opened up a number of the problems on which man both civilised and savage has been exercising his brain unsuccessfully from the days of adam and eve until now  no wonder that poor hans egede paused thoughtfullyand no doubt prayerfullyfor a few minutes ere he ventured a reply  he was about to open his lips when to his astonishment a tall strong man who had been sitting near the outside circle of the audience close to the robber chief grimlek started to his feet and in a tone that had in it more of a demand than a request asked permission to speak  it was our friend angut  before listening to his remarks however it behoves us to account for his sudden appearance  having been led as we have said far out of their way by the detour they were compelled to take red rooney and his friends did not reach the camp till some time after the meeting above described had begun  as it was growing dusk at the time they easily approached without being observedall the more that during the whole time of the meeting men and women kept coming and going according as they felt more or less interested in the proceedings  great was the surprise of the three friends on arriving to find the band of robbers sitting peacefully among the audience but still greater would have been their surprise had they known the murderous purpose these had in view  rooney however having had knowledge of men in many savage lands half guessed the true state of matters and touching his two friends on the shoulders beckoned to them to withdraw  things look peaceful he whispered when beyond the circle but there is no peace in the hearts of coldblooded murderers  what they have done they will do again  quick is the word  let us gather a dozen strong young men  they had no difficulty in doing this  from among the youths who were indifferent to the proceedings at the meeting they soon gathered twelve of the strongest  now lads said rooney after having briefly told them of the recent massacre fifteen of these murderers are seated in that meeting  you cannot fail to know them from our own people for they are all strangers  let each one here creep into the meeting with a short spear choose his man sit down beside him and be ready when the signal is given by angut or me  but do not kill  you are young and strong throw each man on his back but do not kill unless he seems likely to get the better of you  hold them down and wait for orders  no more was said  rooney felt that delay might be fatal  with the promptitude of men accustomed to be led the youths crept into the circle of listeners and seated themselves as desired  rooney and okiok selected their men like the rest  angut chanced to place himself beside grimlek  the chief cast a quick suspicious glance on him as he sat down but as angut immediately became intent on the discussion that was going on and as the robber himself had become interested in spite of himself the suspicion was allayed as quickly as roused  these quiet proceedings took place just before the heavyfaced eskimo began the speech which we have detailed  notwithstanding the serious it might be bloodywork which was presently to engage all his physical energies the spirit of angut was deeply stirred by the string of objections which the man had flung out so easily  most of the points touched on had often engaged his thoughtful mind and he feltas many reasoning men have felt before and sincehow easy it is for a fool to state a string of objections in a few minutes which it might take a learned man several hours fully to answer and refute  oppressed and as it were boiling over with this feeling angut as we have said started to his feet to the no small alarm of the guilty man at his side  but the chiefs fears were dissipated when angut spoke  foolish fellow he said turning with a blazing gaze to the heavyfaced man  you talk like a child of what you do not understand you ask to see god else you wont believe  you believe in your life dont you  yet you have never seen it  you stab a bear and let its life out  you know when the life is there  you have let it out  you know when it is gone  but you have not seen it  then why do you believe in it  you do not see a sound yet you believe in it  do not lift your stupid face i know what you would say you hear the sound therefore it exists  a deaf man does not hear the sound  does it therefore not exist  that which produces the sound is there though the deaf man neither sees nor hears nor feels nor tastes nor smells it my friend the man of god says he thinks the cause of sound is motion in the air passing from particle to particle till the last particle next my ear is moved and theni hear  is there then no motion in the air to cause sound because the deaf man does not hear  o stupidface  you say that god does not answer prayer because you have asked and have not received  what would you think of your little boy if he should say i asked a dead poisonous fish from my father the other day and he did not give it to me therefore my father never gives me what i want  would that be true  every morning you awake hungry and you wish for food then you get up and you find it  is not your wish a silent prayer  and is it not answered every day  who sends the seals and fishes and birds even when we do not ask with our lips  did these animals make themselves  stupidface you say your soul is healthy  sometimes you are angry sometimes discontented sometimes jealous sometimes greedy  is an angry discontented jealous greedy soul healthy  you know it is not  it is diseased and the disease of the soul is sin  this disease takes the bad forms i have mentioned and many other bad formsone of which is murder  angut emphasised the last word and paused but did not look at the robber beside him for he knew that the arrow would reach its mark then he resumed  the kablunet has brought to us the better knowledge of god  he tells us that gods great purpose from the beginning of time has been to cure our souldisease  we deserve punishment for our sins god sent his son and equal jesus christ to bear our sins  we need deliverance from the power of sin god sent his equalthe spirit of jesusto cure us  i believe it  i have felt that great spirit in my breast long before i saw the kablunets and have asked the great spirit to send more light he has answered my prayer  i have more light and am satisfied  again angut paused while the eskimos gazed at him in breathless interest and a strange thrillalmost of expectationpassed through the assembly while he continued in a low and solemn tone  jesus he said saves from all sin  buthe turned his eyes here full on grimlekhe does not save in sin  murderfoul and wicked murderhas been done  grimlek grew pale but did not otherwise betray himself  reference to murder was no uncommon thing among his countrymen  he did not yet feel sure that angut referred to the deed which he had so recently perpetrated  this day continued angut i saw a band of kablunet sailors  he got no further than that for grimlek attempted to spring up  the heavy hand of angut however crushed him back instantly and a spearpoint touched his throat  down with the villains shouted rooney laying the grasp of a vice on the neck of the man next to him and hurling him to the ground  in the twinkling of an eye the fifteen robbers were lying flat on their backs with fingers grasping their throats knees compressing their stomachs and spearpoints at their hearts but no blood was shed  one or two of the fiercest indeed struggled at first but without avail for the intended victim of each robber was handy and ready to lend assistance at the capture as if in righteous retribution  it was of course a startling incident to those who were not in the secret  every man sprang up and drew his knife not knowing where a foe might appear but rooneys strong voice quieted them  were all safe enough mr egede he cried as he bound grimleks hands behind him with a cord  the eskimos quickly performed the same office for their respective prisoners and then setting them up in a row proceeded to talk over the massacre and to discuss in their presence the best method of getting rid of the murderers  i propose said okiok whose naturally kind heart had been deeply stirred by the cowardly massacre which he had witnessed i propose that we should drown them  no drowning is far too good  let us spear them said kajo who had become sober by that time  that would not hurt them cried a fierce eskimo smiting his knee with his clenched fist  we must cut off their ears and noses poke out their eyes and then roast them alive  hush hush cried egede stepping forward we must do nothing of the kind  we must not act like devils  have we not been talking of the mercy of the great spirit  let us be just but let us temper justice with mercy  angut has not yet spoken let us hear what he will propose  considering the energy with which he had denounced the murders and the vigour with which he had captured grimlek anguts proposal was somewhat surprising  kablunet he said turning to the missionary have you not told me that in your book of god it is written that men should do to other men what they wish other men to do to them  truly that is so answered egede  if i were very wicked continued angut and had done many evil deeds i should like to be forgiven and set free therefore let us forgive these men and set them free  we know not with what feelings the robbers listened to the inhuman proposals that were at first made as to their fate but certain it is that after angut had spoken there was a visible improvement in the expression of their faces  considerable astonishment and dissatisfaction were expressed by the majority of the eskimos  even egede much though he delighted in the spirit which dictated it could not quite see his way to so simple and direct an application of the golden rule in the case of men who had so recently been caught redhanded in a coldblooded murder  while he was still hesitating as to his reply to this humane proposal an event occurred which rendered all their discussion unnecessary  we have said that fifteen robbers had been captured but there were sixteen who had entered the camp and joined the meeting  one of these had without particular motive seated himself on the outskirt of the circle under the shadow of a bush which shadow had grown darker as the twilight deepened  thus it came to pass that he had been overlooked and when the melee took place he quietly retreated into the brushwood  he was a brave man however although a robber and scorned to forsake his comrades in their distress  while the discussion above described was going on he crept stealthily towards the place where the captives had been ranged  this he did the more easily that they sat on the summit of a bank or mound which sloped behind them into the bushes  thus he was able to pass in a serpentine fashion behind them all without being seen and as he did so to cut the bonds of each  their knives had been removed else being desperate villains they might now have attacked their captors  as it was when the cords of all had been cut they rose up with a mingled yell of laughter and triumph and dashed into the bushes  the hunters were not slow to follow with brandished knives and spears but their chief called them back with a stentorian roar for well he knew that his men might as well try to follow up a troop of squirrels as pursue a band of reckless men in the rapidly increasing darkness and that there was nearly as much likelihood of their stabbing each other by mistake in the dark as of killing or catching their foes  when the hunters had again reassembled in front of their chief mans house they found new cause of anxiety which effectually put to flight their annoyance at having been outwitted by the robbers  this was the fact that although night was coming on the oomiak with the women had not returned    note  this is no fanciful speech  it is the substance of an actual speech made by a greenlander to the moravian brethren in 1737    chapter twenty eight  a capture flight surprise and rescue  if true love is according to the proverb more distinctly proved to be true by the extreme roughness of its course then must the truth of the love of angut and nunaga be held as proved beyond all question for its course was a very cataract from beginning to end  poor nunaga in the trusting simplicity of her nature was strong in the belief that having been found and saved by angut there was no further cause for anxiety  with an easy mind therefore she set herself to the present duty of spearing cat fish with a prong  it was fine healthy work giving strength to the muscles grace and activity to the frame at the same time that it stimulated the appetite which the catfish were soon to appease  it grows late said pussimek and will be dark before we get back to camp  never mind who cares said the independent sigokow who was fond of sport  but the men will be angry suggested the mother of ippegoo  let them be angrybooo returned the reckless kabelaw  nunaga said nuna looking eagerly over the side there goes anothera big one poke it  nunaga poked it but missed and only brought up a small flatfish speared by accident  old kannoa who also gazed into the clear depths was here observed to smile benignantly and wave one of her skinny arms while with the other she pointed downwards  the sisters kabelaw and sigokow each wielding a pronged stick responded to the signal and were gazing down into the sea with uplifted weapons when pussimek uttered an exclamation of surprise and pointed to the shore where on a bush a small piece of what resembled scarlet ribbon or a strip of cloth was seen waving in the wind  a beast exclaimed pussimek who had never before seen or heard of scarlet ribbon  saw you ever a beast so very red said the wife of okiok doubtfully  it is no beast remarked the mother of ippegoo it is only a bit of sealskin dyed red  no sealskin ever fluttered like that said the mother of arbalik sternly  it is something new and beautiful that some one has lost  we are lucky  let us go and take it  no one objecting to this the oomiak was paddled towards the land nunaga observed that the sisters kabelaw and sigokow were each eager to spring ashore before the other and snatch the prize  having a spice of mischievous fun in her she resolved to be beforehand and being active as a kitten while the sisters were only what we may style lumberingly vigorous she succeeded  before the boat quite touched the gravel she had sprung on shore and flew towards the coveted streamer  the sisters did not attempt to follow  knowing that it would be useless they sat still and the other women laughed  at the success of his little device the robberlieutenant of grimlek chuckled quietly as he crouched behind that bush  when nunaga laid her hand on the gaudy bait he sprang up grasped her round the waist and bore her off into the bushes  at the same moment the rest of the band made a rush at the oomiak  with a yell in unison the women shoved offonly just in time for the leading robber dashed into the sea nearly up to the neck and his outstretched hand was within a foot of the gunwale when he received a smart rap over the knuckles from sigokow another moment and the oomiak was beyond his reach  alas for old kannoa  she had been seated on the gunwale of the craft and the vigorous push that set the others free had toppled her over backwards into the sea  as this happened in shallow water the poor old creature had no difficulty in creeping on to the beach  the incident would have tried the nerves of most old ladies but kannoa had no nerves and in regard to being wetwell she was naturally tough and accustomed to rough it  the disappointed robber observed her of course on wading back to land but passed her with contemptuous indifference as if she had been merely an overgrown crab or lobster  but kannoa determined not to be left to die on the shore  she rose squeezed the water out of her garments and followed the robber whom she soon found in the bushes with his companions eagerly discussing their future plans  nunaga was seated on the ground with her face bowed on her knees  kannoa went and sat down beside her patted her on the shoulder and began to comfort her  we must not stay here said the leader of the band merely casting a look of indifference at the old creature  the women who have escaped will tell the men and in a very short time we shall have them howling on our track  let us wait and fight them said one of the men fiercely  it would be great glory for a small band to fight a big one no doubt returned the leader in a sarcastic tone but it would be greater glory for one man to do that aloneso you had better stay here and fight them yourself  a short laugh greeted this remark  it will be very dark tonight said another man  yes too dark for our foes to follow us but not too dark for us to advance steadily though slowly into the mountains returned the leader  when there we shall be safe  come we will start at once  but what are we to do with the old woman asked one  she cannot walk  leave her said another  no she will bring evil on us if we leave her cried the fierce man i am sure she is a witch  we must carry her with us and when we come to a convenient cliff toss her into the sea  in pursuance of this plan the fierce robber tied the old woman up in a bearskinmade a bundle of her in factand swung her on his back fortunately being rather deaf kannoa had not heard what was in store for her and as the position she occupied on the fierce mans broad back was not uncomfortable all things considered she submitted with characteristic patience  poor horrified nunaga thought it best to let her companion remain in ignorance of what was proposed and cast about in her mind the possibility of making her escape and carrying the news of her danger to the camp  if she could only get there and see angut she was sure that all would go well for angut she felt could put everything rightsomehow  in a short time the robbers were far away from the scene of their consultation and the darkness of the night as predicted became so intense that it was quite impossible to advance further over the rough ground without the risk of broken limbs if not worse  a halt was therefore called for rest food and consultation  the spot on which they stood was the top of a little mound with thick shrubs on the land side which clothed a steep almost precipitous descent  just within these shrubs as it were under the brow of the hill nunaga observed a small natural rut or hollow  the other or sea side of the mound was quite free from underwood and also very steep on the top there was a low ledge of rock on which the fierce robber laid his bundle down while the others stood round and began to discuss their circumstances  the leader who had taken charge of nunaga and held one of her hands during the journey set the girl close in front of him to prevent the possibility of her attempting to escape for he had noted her activity and strength and knew how easily she might elude him if once free in the dark woods  although these woods were as black as erebus there was light enough to enable them to distinguish the glimmer of the sea not far off and a tremendous cliff rising in solemn grandeur above it  yonder is a good place to throw your witch over remarked the leader carelessly  the fierce robber looked at the place  yes he said that might do and the way to it is open enough to be crossed even at night without much trouble  at that moment a bright idea suddenly struck nunaga  have you ever noticed reader how invariably bright ideas deal sudden blows  this one struck nunaga as the saying goes all of a heap  she happened to observe that the leader of the band was standing with his heels close against the ledge of rock already mentioned  in an instant she plunged at the robbers chest like a female thunderbolt having no room to stagger back of course the man was tripped up by the ledge and tumbling headlong over it went down the steep slope on the other side with an indignant roar  the rest of the robbers were taken by surprise and so immensely tickled with the humour of the thing that they burst into hearty laughter as they watched the frantic efforts of their chief to arrest his career  all at the same instant however seemed to recover their presence of mind for they looked round simultaneously with sudden gravityand found that nunaga was gone  with a wild shout they sprang after herdown the slope crashing through the underwood scattering right and left and in more than one instance tumbling head over heels  they were quickly joined by their now furious leader but they crashed and tumbled and searched in vain nunaga had vanished as completely and almost as mysteriously as if she had been a spirit  the explanation is simple  she had merely dropped into the rut or hollow under the brow of the hill and there she lay covered with grasses and branches listening to the growlings of indignation and astonishment expressed by the men when they reassembled on the top of the mound to bewail their bad fortune  weve got the old witch anyhow growled the fierce robber with a scowl at the bundle which was lying perfectly still  away men cried their leader and search the other side of the mound  the young witch may have doubled on us like a rabbit while we were seeking towards the hills  obedient to the command they all dispersed againthis time towards the sea  what nunagas thought was at the time we cannot tell but there is reason to believe it must have been equivalent to now or never for she leaped out of her place of concealment and made for the hills at the top of her speed  truth requires us to add that she was not much better on her legs than were the men for darkness haste and rugged ground are a trying combination  but there is this to be said for the girl being small she fell lightly being rotund she fell softly being indiarubbery she rebounded and being young she took it easily  in a very short time she felt quite safe from pursuit  then she addressed herself diligently to find out the direction of the eskimo camp being filled with desperate anxiety for her old friend kannoa  strong almost as a young greenland fawn and gifted apparently with some of that animals power to find its way through the woods she was not long of hitting the right direction and gaining the coast along which she ran at her utmost speed  on arrivingbreathless and thoroughly exhaustedshe found to her dismay that angut simek rooney and okiok had left  the news of her capture had already been brought in by the women with the oomiak and these men with as many others as could be spared had started off instantly to the rescue  but they are not long gone said nunagas mother by way of comforting her child  what matters that cried nunaga in despair dear old kannoa will be lost for they know nothing of her danger  while the poor girl spoke her brother ermigit began to prepare himself hastily for action  fear not sister he said i will run to the great cliff for i know it well  they left me to help to guard the camp but are there not enough to guard it without me  with these words the youth caught up a spear and darted out of the hut  well was it for old kannoa that night that ermigit was when roused one of the fleetest runners of his tribe  down to the shore he sprang partly tumbledand then sped along like the arctic wind which we may remark is fully as swift as more southerly breezes  the beach near the sea was mostly smooth so that the absence of light was not a serious drawback  in a remarkably short space of time the lad overtook the rescue party not far beyond the spot where the women had been surprised and nunaga captured  great was their satisfaction on hearing of the girls safe return  its a pity you didnt arrive half an hour sooner however said rooney for poor angut has gone off with a party towards the hills in a state of wild despair to carry on the search in that direction  but you look anxious boy what more have you to tell  in a few rapidlyspoken words ermigit told of kannoas danger  instant action was of course taken  one of the natives who was well acquainted with the whole land and knew the mound where the robbers had halted was despatched with a strong party to search in that direction while rooney okiok and the rest set off at a sharp run in the direction of the great cliff which they soon reached panting like racehorses  scrambling to the top they found no one there  by that time the short night of spring had passed and the faint light of the coming day enabled them to make an investigation of the ground which tended to prove that no one had been there recently  we can do nothing now but wait said red rooney as he sat on a projecting cliff wiping the perspiration from his brow  but we might send some of the young men to look round and bring us word if they see any of the robbers said simek  if we do that replied okiok they will get wind of us and clear off  then they would kill my greatmother before casting her away  thats true okiok  we must keep quiet said rooney  besides they are pretty sure to bring her to the cliff for that is a favourite mode among you of getting rid of witches  but what if they dont come here asked ippegoo  then we must hope that they have slept on the mound returned okiok and angut will be sure to find them and kill them all in their sleep  too good to hope for murmured arbalik  we must hide if we dont want to be seen suggested simek  feeling the propriety of this suggestion the whole party went into a cave which they found close at hand and sat down to wait as patiently as might be  rooney was the last to enter  before doing so he crept on hands and knees to the extreme edge of the cliff and looked down nothing was visible however only a black unfathomable abyss  but he could hear the sullen roar of ocean as the waves rushed in and out of the rocky caverns far below  drawing back with a shudder a feeling of mingled horror rage and tender pity oppressed him as he thought of kannoas poor old bones being shattered on the rocks or swallowed by the waves at the foot of the cliff while behind and through kannoa there rose up the vision of that grandmother in the old country whose image seemed to have acquired a fixed habit of beckoning him to come home with a remonstrative shake of the head and a kindly smile  they had not long to wait  they had been seated about ten minutes in the cavern when the man who had been left outside to watch came gliding in on tiptoe stepping high and with a blazing look about the eyes  they come he said in a hoarse whisper  who come you walrus whispered okiok  the man with the witch  on hearing this rooney okiok and simek went to the entrance of the cave followed by the rest who however were instructed to keep under cover till required if no more than three or four men should arrive  a few seconds later and the robber chief appeared on the flat space in front of them  he was closely followed by a squat comrade and the fierce man with the bundle on his back  as they passed the cave the bundle gave a pitiful wail  this was enough  with a silent rush like three bulldogs our heroes shot forth  rooney having forgotten his weapon used his fist instead planted his knuckles on the bridge of the leaders nose and ruined it as a bridge for evermore  the robber went down turned a complete backsomersault regained his feet and fled  okiok seized the fierce man by the throat almost before he was aware of the attack causing him to drop his bundle which rooney was just in time to catch and carry into the cave  there he set it down tenderly cut the fastenings of the skin and freed the poor old womans head  it was a beautiful sight to see the livid hue and gaze of horror change into a flush of loving benignity when kannoa observed who it was that kneeled beside her  poor old woman shouted rooney in her ear  are you much hurt  no not hurt at all only squeezed too much  but im afraid for nunaga  i think she got away but i was bundled when i last heard her voice  fear no more then for nunaga is safe said rooney but at that moment all the men rushed from the cave and he heard sounds outside which induced him to follow them and leave the old woman to look after herself  on issuing from the cave he saw that the fierce robber was the only one captured and that he was on the point of receiving summary justice for simek and okiok had hold of his arms while arbalik and ippegoo held his legs and bore him to the edge of the cliff  now then cried simek  stop stop shouted rooney  onetwoheave cried okiok  and they did heavevigorously and together so that the fierce man went out from their grasp like a huge stone from a roman catapult  there was a hideous yell and after a brief but suggestive pause an awful splash  they did not wait to ascertain whether that fierce man managed to swim ashorebut certain it is that no one answering to his description has attempted to hurl a witch from those cliffs from that day to this    chapter twenty nine  conclusion  need we enlarge on the despair of angut being turned into joy on his return when he found nunaga and kannoa safe and sound  we think not  a few days thereafter our adventurers arrived at the settlement of the kablunets and these northern eskimos soon forgot their rough experiences under the influence of the kind hospitable reception they met with from the moravian brethren  the joy of the brethren at welcoming hans egede too was very great for they had heard of his recent expedition and had begun to fear that he was lost  not the less welcome was he that he came accompanied by a band of eskimos who seemed not only willing to listen to the gospel but more than usually able to understand it  the interest of these devoted men was specially roused by angut whom they at once recognised as of greatly superior mental power to his companions  i cannot help thinking said egede in commenting on his character to one of the brethren that he must be a descendant of those norse settlers who inhabited this part of greenland long long ago who we think were massacred by the natives and the remains of whose buildings are still to be seen  it may be so returned the brother your viking countrymen were vastly superior in brainpower to the eskimos  we are glad and thankful that our father has sent angut to us for it is not improbable that he may one day become an evangelist to his brethren in the far north  but of all those who were assembled at the station at that time red rooney was the man who rejoiced most for there he found an english vessel on the eve of starting for the old country the captain of which was not only willing but glad to get such an able seaman to strengthen his crew  angut said rooney as they walked one evening by the margin of the sea it grieves me to the heart to leave you but the best of friends must part  even for your sake much though i love you i cannot remain here now that i have got the chance of returning to my dear wife and bairns and my native land  but we shall meet again replied angut earnestly  does not your great book teach that the father of all is bringing all people to himself in jesus christ  in the spiritland angut and nunaga okiok nuna simek and all the innuit friends when washed in the blood of jesus will again see the face of ridroonee and rejoice  this was the first time that angut had distinctly declared his faith and it afforded matter for profound satisfaction to rooney who grasped and warmly shook his friends hand  rightright you are angut he said i do believe that we shall meet again in the fatherland and that hope takes away much o the sadness of parting  but you have not yet told me about the wedding  have you arranged it with the brethren  yes it is fixed for the day beyond tomorrow  good an the next day we sailso my friend ill have the satisfaction of dancing at your wedding before i go  i know not as to dancing said angut with a grave smile but we are to have kickball and a feast  im game for both or any other sort o fun you like returned the seaman heartily  while they were speaking they observed a youth running towards them in great haste and in a state of violent excitement  a whale he said had stranded itself in a shallow bay not far off and he was running to let the people of the settlement know the good news  the commotion occasioned by this event is indescribable  every man and boy who could handle a kayak took to the water with harpoon and lance ippegoo arbalik okiok simek norrak and ermigit were among them in borrowed kayaks and mad as the maddest with glee  even kajo joined them  he was as drunk as the proverbial fiddler having obtained rum from the sailors and much more solemn than an owl  while these hastened to the conflict the women and children who could run or walk proceeded by land to view the battle  and it was indeed a grand fight  the unlucky monster had got thoroughly embayed and was evidently in a state of consternation for in its efforts to regain deep water it rushed hither and thither thrusting its blunt snout continually on some shoal and wriggling off again with difficulty and enormous splutter  the shouts of men shrieks of women and yells of children comingled in stupendous discord  simek the mighty hunter was first to launch his harpoon  it went deep and was well aimed  blood dyed the sea at once and the efforts of the whale to escape were redoubled  there was also danger in this attack for no one could tell each time the creature got into water deep enough to float in to what point of the shore its next rush would be  look out cried rooney in alarm for being close to arbalik in a kayak he saw that the whale was coming straight at them  it ran on a shoal when close to them doubled round in terror and whirled its great tail aloft  right over arbaliks head the fanlike mass quivered for one moment the youth did not give it a chance  over he went and shot down into the water like an eel just as the tail came down like a thunderclap on his kayak and reduced it to a jumble of its shattered elements while rooney paddled out of danger  arbalik swam ashore and landed just in time to see the whale rise out of the water lifting ippegoo in his kayak on its shoulders  the electrified youth uttered a shriek of horror in which the tone of surprise was discernible slid off kayak and all into the seaand was none the worse  by this time some dozens of harpoons had been fixed in the body of the whale and the number of bladders attached to them interfered slightly with its movements but did not render an approach to it by any means safer  at last simek losing patience made a bold rush in his kayak and drove his lance deep into the huge creatures side  the act was greeted with a cheeror something like onewhich was repeated when red rooney followed suit successfully  okiok and his two sons were not slow to repeat the process  other eskimos rushed in hovered round and acted their part so that finally the whale was killed and hauled nearly out of the water by the united exertion of the entire population of the land  then succeeded the distribution of the prize  eskimos have peculiar and not unreasonable laws on such matters  if two hunters strike a seal at the same time they divide it  the same holds in regard to wildfowl or deer  if a dead seal is found with a harpoon sticking in it the finder keeps the seal but restores the harpoon to the owner  the harpooner of a walrus claims the head and tail while any one may take away as much as he can carry of the carcass  but when a whale is captured the harpooners have no special advantage  there is such a superabundance of wealth that alleven spectatorsmay cut and come again as often and as long as they please  when therefore the whale whose capture we have described was dead hundreds of men and boys mounted at once knife in hand on the carcass and the scene of blood and confusion that ensued baffles description  wont we stuff tonight remarked kabelaw to her sister as they went home bending under a weight of blubber  ayand tomorrow replied sigokow  and some days beyond tomorrow observed old kannoa who staggered after them under a lighter load of the spoil  but it was not the eskimos alone who derived benefit from this unexpected prize  the captain of the english ship also got some barrels of oil and a large quantity of whalebone to fill up his cargo and the bright shawls and real iron knives that were given in exchange soon graced the shoulders of the native women and the belts of the men  it was indeed a time of immense jubilationfor every one was gratified more or lessfrom the chief of the moravian brethren down to tumbler and pussi who absolutely wallowed in fun and unctuous food while angut and nunaga were of course supremely happy  the wedding ceremony performed by hans egede we need hardly say was simple and the festivities which followed were not complex  the game at kickball which preceded the wedding was admittedly one of the best that had ever been played at that station partly no doubt because the captain and crew of the english ship headed by red rooney took part in it  strange to say the only man who seemed to be at all cast down on that occasion was ippegoo  he was found by his mother in the evening in a retired spot by the sea sitting on the rocks with a very disconsolate countenance  my son what is the matter  mother my heart is heavy  i cannot forget ujarak  but he treated you ill my son  sometimesnot always  often he was kindandand i loved him  i cannot help it  grieve not ippe rejoined pleasant little kunelik  do we not know now that we shall meet him again in the great fatherland  the poor youth was comforted  he dried his eyes and went home with his mother  yet he did not cease to mourn for his departed wizard friend  we will not harrow the readers feelings by describing the leavetaking of the eskimos from their friend the kablunet  after he was gone those men of the north remained a considerable time at the settlement listening to the missionaries as they revealed the love of god to man in jesus christ  what resulted from this of course we cannot tell but of this we are certainthat their labour was not in vain in the lord  when the time comes for the creator to reveal his plans to man surely it will be found that no word spoken no cup of water given by these danish and moravian christians shall lose its appropriate reward  when at last the northern men and their families stood on the seashore with their kayaks oomiaks and families ready angut stood forth and grasping hans egede by the hand said earnestly  brother farewell till we meet again  i go now to carry the good news to my kindred who dwell where the icemountains cover the land and sea    but what of the kablunet  shall we permit him to slip quietly through our fingers and disappear  nay verily  he reached england  he crossed over to ireland  there in a wellremembered cottagehome he found a blooming widow who discovered to her inexpressible joy that she was still a wife  he found six children who had grown so tremendously out of all remembrance that their faces seemed like a faint but familiar dream which had to be dreamed over again a good deal and studied much before the attainment by the seaman of a satisfactory state of mind  and last he found a little old woman with wrinkled brow and toothless gums who looked at and listened to him with benignant wonder and whose visage reminded him powerfully of another little old woman who dwelt in the land of ice and snow where he used to be known as the kablunet  this kablunetalias ridrooneenow regretfully makes his bow and exit from our little stage as red rooney the last of the crew  the end
