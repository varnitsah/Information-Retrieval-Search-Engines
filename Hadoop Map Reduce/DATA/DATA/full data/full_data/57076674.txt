57076674	lady byron vindicated by harriet beecher stowe   a history of the byron controversy from its beginning in 1816 to the present time     note by the publishers   the subject of this volume is of such painful notoriety that any apology from the publishers may seem unnecessary upon issuing the authors reply to the counter statements which her narrative in macmillans magazine has called forth  nevertheless they consider it right to state that their strong regard for the author respect for her motives and assurance of her truthfulness would even in the absence of all other considerations be sufficient to induce them to place their imprint on the titlepage  the publication has been undertaken by them at the authors request as her friends and as the publishers of her former works and from a feeling that whatever difference of opinion may be entertained respecting the authors judiciousness in publishing the true story she is entitled to defend it having been treated with grave injustice and often with much maliciousness by her critics and opponents and been charged with motives from which no person living is more free  an intense love of justice and hatred of oppression with an utter disregard of her own interests characterise mrs stowes conduct and writings as all who know her well will testify and the publishers can unhesitatingly affirm their belief that neither fear for loss of her literary fame nor hope of gain has for one moment influenced her in the course she has taken                                      london january 1870     contents   part i  chapter i

blackwoods magazine letters of lady byron to h c robinson domestic poems by lord byron     part i   chapter i  introduction   the interval since my publication of the true story of lady byrons life has been one of stormy discussion and of much invective  i have not thought it necessary to disturb my spirit and confuse my sense of right by even an attempt at reading the many abusive articles that both here and in england have followed that disclosure  friends have undertaken the task for me giving me from time to time the substance of anything really worthy of attention which came to view in the tumult  it appeared to me essential that this first excitement should in a measure spend itself before there would be a possibility of speaking to any purpose  now when all would seem to have spoken who can speak and it is to be hoped have said the utmost they can say there seems a propriety in listening calmly if that be possible to what i have to say in reply  and first why have i made this disclosure at all  to this i answer briefly because i considered it my duty to make it  i made it in defence of a beloved revered friend whose memory stood forth in the eyes of the civilised world charged with most repulsive crimes of which i certainly knew her innocent  i claim and shall prove that lady byrons reputation has been the victim of a concerted attack begun by her husband during her lifetime and coming to its climax over her grave  i claim and shall prove that it was not i who stirred up this controversy in this year 1869  i shall show who did do it and who is responsible for bringing on me that hard duty of making these disclosures which it appears to me ought to have been made by others  i claim that these facts were given to me unguarded by any promise or seal of secrecy expressed or implied that they were lodged with me as one sister rests her story with another for sympathy for counsel for defence  never did i suppose the day would come that i should be subjected to so cruel an anguish as this use of them has been to me never did i suppose thatwhen those kind hands that had shed nothing but blessings were lying in the helplessness of death when that gentle heart so sorely tried and to the last so full of love was lying cold in the tomba countryman in england could be found to cast the foulest slanders on her grave and not one in all england to raise an effective voice in her defence  i admit the feebleness of my plea in point of execution  it was written in a state of exhausted health when no labour of the kind was safe for mewhen my hand had not strength to hold the pen and i was forced to dictate to another  i have been told that i have no reason to congratulate myself on it as a literary effort  o my brothers and sisters is there then nothing in the world to think of but literary efforts  i ask any man with a heart in his bosom if he had been obliged to tell a story so cruel because his mothers grave gave no rest from slanderi ask any woman who had been forced to such a disclosure to free a dead sisters name from grossest insults whether she would have thought of making this work of bitterness a literary success  are the cries of the oppressed the gasps of the dying the last prayers of mothersare any words wrung like drops of blood from the human heart to be judged as literary efforts  my fellowcountrymen of america men of the press i have done you one act of justiceof all your bitter articles i have read not one  i shall never be troubled in the future time by the remembrance of any unkind word you have said of me for at this moment i recollect not one i had such faith in you such pride in my countrymen as men with whom above all others the cause of woman was safe and sacred that i was at first astonished and incredulous at what i heard of the course of the american press and was silent not merely from the impossibility of being heard but from grief and shame  but reflection convinces me that you were in many cases acting from a misunderstanding of facts and through misguided honourable feeling and i still feel courage therefore to ask from you a fair hearing  now as i have done you this justice will you also do me the justice to hear me seriously and candidly  what interest have you or i my brother and my sister in this short life of ours to utter anything but the truth  is not truth between man and man and between man and woman the foundation on which all things rest have you not every individual of you who must hereafter give an account yourself alone to god an interest to know the exact truth in this matter and a duty to perform as respects that truth  hear me then while i tell you the position in which i stood and what was my course in relation to it  a shameless attack on my friends memory had appeared in the blackwood of july 1869 branding lady byron as the vilest of criminals and recommending the guiccioli book to a christian public as interesting from the very fact that it was the avowed production of lord byrons mistress no efficient protest was made against this outrage in england and littells living age reprinted the blackwood article and the harpers the largest publishing house in america perhaps in the world republished the book  its statementswith those of the blackwood pall mall gazette and other english periodicalswere being propagated through all the young reading and writing world of america  i was meeting them advertised in dailies and made up into articles in magazines and thus the generation of today who had no means of judging lady byron but by these fables of her slanderers were being foully deceived  the friends who knew her personally were a small select circle in england whom death is every day reducing  they were few in number compared with the great world and were silent  i saw these foul slanders crystallising into history uncontradicted by friends who knew her personally who firm in their own knowledge of her virtues and limited in view as aristocratic circles generally are had no idea of the width of the world they were living in and the exigency of the crisis  when time passed on and no voice was raised i spoke  i gave at first a simple story for i knew instinctively that whoever put the first steel point of truth into this dark cloud of slander must wait for the storm to spend itself  i must say the storm exceeded my expectations and has raged loud and long  but now that there is a comparative stillness i shall proceed first to prove what i have just been asserting and second to add to my true story such facts and incidents as i did not think proper at first to state    chapter ii  the attack on lady byron   in proving what i asserted in the first chapter i make four points  1st  a concerted attack upon lady byrons reputation begun by lord byron in selfdefence  2nd  that he transmitted his story to friends to be continued after his death  3rd  that they did so continue it  4th  that the accusations reached their climax over lady byrons grave in blackwood of 1869 and the guiccioli book and that this reopening of the controversy was my reason for speaking  and first i shall adduce my proofs that lady byrons reputation was during the whole course of her husbands life the subject of a concentrated artfully planned attack commencing at the time of the separation and continuing during his life  by various documents carefully prepared and used publicly or secretly as suited the case he made converts of many honest men some of whom were writers and men of letters who put their talents at his service during his lifetime in exciting sympathy for him and who by his own request felt bound to continue their defence of him after he was dead  in order to consider the force and significance of the documents i shall cite we are to bring to our view just the issues lord byron had to meet both at the time of the separation and for a long time after  in byrons memoirs vol iv letter 350 under date december 10 1819 nearly four years after the separation he writes to murray in a state of great excitement on account of an article in blackwood in which his conduct towards his wife had been sternly and justly commented on and which he supposed to have been written by wilson of the noctes ambrosianae  he says in this letter i like and admire wn and he should not have indulged himself in such outrageous license      when he talks of lady byrons business he talks of what he knows nothing about and you may tell him no man can desire a public investigation of that affair more than i do 7  he shortly after wrote and sent to murray a pamphlet for publication which was printed but not generally circulated till some time afterwards  though more than three years had elapsed since the separation the current against him at this time was so strong in england that his friends thought it best at first to use this article of lord byrons discreetly with influential persons rather than to give it to the public  the writer in blackwood and the indignation of the english public of which that writer was the voice were now particularly stirred up by the appearance of the first two cantos of don juan in which the indecent caricature of lady byron was placed in vicinity with other indecencies the publication of which was justly considered an insult to a christian community  it must here be mentioned for the honour of old england that at first she did her duty quite respectably in regard to don juan  one can still read in murrays standard edition of the poems how every respectable press thundered reprobations which it would be well enough to print and circulate as tracts for our days  byron it seems had thought of returning to england but he says in the letter we have quoted that he has changed his mind and shall not go back adding i have finished the third canto of don juan but the things i have heard and read discourage all future publication  you may try the copy question but youll lose it the cry is up and the cant is up  i should have no objection to return the price of the copyright and have written to mr kinnaird on this subject  one sentence quoted by lord byron from the blackwood article will show the modern readers what the respectable world of that day were thinking and saying of him     it appears in short as if this miserable man having exhausted    every species of sensual gratificationhaving drained the cup of    sin even to its bitterest dregswere resolved to show us that he is    no longer a human being even in his frailties but a cool unconcerned    fiend laughing with detestable glee over the whole of the better and    worse elements of which human life is composed  the defence which lord byron makes in his reply to that paper is of a man cornered and fighting for his life  he speaks thus of the state of feeling at the time of his separation from his wife     i was accused of every monstrous vice by public rumour and private    rancour my name which had been a knightly or a noble one since my    fathers helped to conquer the kingdom for william the norman was    tainted  i felt that if what was whispered and muttered and murmured    was true i was unfit for england if false england was unfit for me    i withdrew but this was not enough  in other countriesin    switzerland in the shadow of the alps and by the blue depth of the    lakesi was pursued and breathed upon by the same blight  i crossed    the mountains but it was the same so i went a little farther and    settled myself by the waves of the adriatic like the stag at bay who    betakes him to the waters     if i may judge by the statements of the few friends who gathered    round me the outcry of the period to which i allude was beyond all    precedent all parallel even in those cases where political motives    have sharpened slander and doubled enmity  i was advised not to go to    the theatres lest i should be hissed nor to my duty in parliament    lest i should be insulted by the way even on the day of my departure    my most intimate friend told me afterwards that he was under the    apprehension of violence from the people who might be assembled at the    door of the carriage  now lord byrons charge against his wife was that she was directly responsible for getting up and keeping up this persecution which drove him from englandthat she did it in a deceitful treacherous manner which left him no chance of defending himself  he charged against her that taking advantage of a time when his affairs were in confusion and an execution in the house she left him suddenly with treacherous professions of kindness which were repeated by letters on the road and that soon after her arrival at her home her parents sent him word that she would never return to him and she confirmed the message that when he asked the reason why she refused to state any and that when this step gave rise to a host of slanders against him she silently encouraged and confirmed the slanders  his claim was that he was denied from that time forth even the justice of any tangible accusation against himself which he might meet and refute  he observes in the same article from which we have quoted     when one tells me that i cannot in any way justify my own    behaviour in that affair i acquiesce because no man can justify    himself until he knows of what he is accused and i have never    hadand god knows my whole desire has ever been to obtain itany    specific charge in a tangible shape submitted to me by the    adversary nor by others unless the atrocities of public rumour and    the mysterious silence of the ladys legal advisers may be deemed    such  lord byron his publishers friends and biographers thus agree in representing his wife as the secret author and abettor of that persecution which it is claimed broke up his life and was the source of all his subsequent crimes and excesses  lord byron wrote a poem in september 1816 in switzerland just after the separation in which he stated in so many words these accusations against his wife  shortly after the poets death murray published this poem together with the fare thee well and the lines to his sister under the title of domestic pieces in his standard edition of byrons poetry  it is to be remarked then that this was for some time a private document shown to confidential friends and made use of judiciously as readers or listeners to his story were able to bear it lady byron then had a strong party in england  sir samuel romilly and dr lushington were her counsel  lady byrons parents were living and the appearance in the public prints of such a piece as this would have brought down an aggravated storm of public indignation  for the general public such documents as the fare thee well were circulating in england and he frankly confessed his wifes virtues and his own sins to madame de stael and others in switzerland declaring himself in the wrong sensible of his errors and longing to cast himself at the feet of that serene perfection     which wanted one sweet weaknessto forgive  but a little later he drew for his private partisans this bitter poetical indictment against her which as we have said was used discreetly during his life and published after his death  before we proceed to lay that poem before the reader we will refresh his memory with some particulars of the tragedy of aeschylus which lord byron selected as the exact parallel and proper illustration of his wifes treatment of himself  in his letters and journals he often alludes to her as clytemnestra and the allusion has run the round of a thousand american papers lately and been read by a thousand good honest people who had no very clear idea who clytemnestra was and what she did which was like the proceedings of lady byron  according to the tragedy clytemnestra secretly hates her husband agamemnon whom she professes to love and wishes to put him out of the way that she may marry her lover aegistheus  when her husband returns from the trojan war she receives him with pretended kindness and officiously offers to serve him at the bath  inducing him to put on a garment of which she had adroitly sewed up the sleeves and neck so as to hamper the use of his arms she gives the signal to a concealed band of assassins who rush upon him and stab him  clytemnestra is represented by aeschylus as grimly triumphing in her success which leaves her free to marry an adulterous paramour     i did it too in such a cunning wise    that he could neither scape nor ward off doom    i staked around his steps an endless net    as for the fishes  in the piece entitled lines on hearing lady byron is ill lord byron charges on his wife a similar treachery and cruelty  the whole poem is in murrays english edition vol iv p 207  of it we quote the following  the reader will bear in mind that it is addressed to lady byron on a sickbed     i am too well avenged but t was my right    whateer my sins might be thou wert not sent    to be the nemesis that should requite    nor did heaven choose so near an instrument    mercy is for the merciful  if thou    hast been of such t will be accorded now    thy nights are banished from the realms of sleep    for thou art pillowed on a curse too deep    yes they may flatter thee but thou shalt feel    a hollow agony that will not heal    thou hast sown in my sorrow and must reap    the bitter harvest in a woe as real    i have had many foes but none like thee    for gainst the rest myself i could defend    and be avenged or turn them into friend    but thou in safe implacability    hast naught to dreadin thy own weakness shielded    and in my love which hath but too much yielded    and spared for thy sake some i should not spare    and thus upon the world trust in thy truth    and the wild fame of my ungoverned youth    on things that were not and on things that are    even upon such a basis thou halt built    a monument whose cement hath been guilt    the moral clytemnestra of thy lord    and hewed down with an unsuspected sword    fame peace and hope and all that better life    which but for this cold treason of thy heart    might yet have risen from the grave of strife    and found a nobler duty than to part    but of thy virtues thou didst make a vice    trafficking in them with a purpose cold    and buying others woes at any price    for present anger and for future gold    and thus once entered into crooked ways    the early truth that was thy proper praise    did not still walk beside thee but at times    and with a breast unknowing its own crimes    deceits averments incompatible    equivocations and the thoughts that dwell    in janus spirits the significant eye    that learns to lie with silence 14 the pretext    of prudence with advantages annexed    the acquiescence in all things that tend    no matter how to the desired end    all found a place in thy philosophy    the means were worthy and the end is won    i would not do to thee as thou hast done  now if this language means anything it means in plain terms that whereas in her early days lady byron was peculiarly characterised by truthfulness she has in her recent dealings with him acted the part of a liarthat she is not only a liar but that she lies for cruel means and malignant purposesthat she is a moral assassin and her treatment of her husband has been like that of the most detestable murderess and adulteress of ancient history that she has learned to lie skilfully and artfully that she equivocates says incompatible things and crosses her own tracksthat she is doublefaced and has the art to lie even by silence and that she has become wholly unscrupulous and acquiesces in anything no matter what that tends to the desired end and that end the destruction of her husband  this is a brief summary of the story that byron made it his lifes business to spread through society to propagate and make converts to during his life and which has been in substance reasserted by blackwood in a recent article this year  now the reader will please to notice that this poem is dated in september 1816 and that on the 29th of march of that same year he had thought proper to tell quite another story  at that time the deed of separation was not signed and negotiations between lady byron acting by legal counsel and himself were still pending  at that time therefore he was standing in a community who knew all he had said in former days of his wifes character who were in an aroused and excited state by the fact that so lovely and good and patient a woman had actually been forced for some unexplained cause to leave him  his policy at that time was to make large general confessions of sin and to praise and compliment her with a view of enlisting sympathy  everybody feels for a handsome sinner weeping on his knees asking pardon for his offences against his wife in the public newspapers  the celebrated fare thee well as we are told was written on the 17th of march and accidentally found its way into the newspapers at this time through the imprudence of a friend whom he allowed to take a copy these imprudent friends have all along been such a marvellous convenience to lord byron  but the question met him on all sides what is the matter  this wife you have declared the brightest sweetest most amiable of beings and against whose behaviour as a wife you actually never had nor can have a complaint to makewhy is she now all of a sudden so inflexibly set against you  this question required an answer and he answered by writing another poem which also accidentally found its way into the public prints  it is in his domestic pieces which the reader may refer to at the end of this volume and is called a sketch  there was a most excellent respectable wellbehaved englishwoman a mrs clermont 16 who had been lady byrons governess in her youth and was still in mature life revered as her confidential friend  it appears that this person had been with lady byron during a part of her married life especially the bitter hours of her lonely childbed when a young wife so much needs a sympathetic friend  this mrs clermont was the person selected by lord byron at this time to be the scapegoat to bear away the difficulties of the case into the wilderness  we are informed in moores life what a noble pride of rank lord byron possessed and how when the headmaster of a school against whom he had a pique invited him to dinner he declined saying to tell you the truth doctor if you should come to newstead i shouldnt think of inviting you to dine with me and so i dont care to dine with you here  different countries it appears have different standards as to good taste moore gives this as an amusing instance of a young lords spirit  accordingly his first attack against this lady as we americans should call her consists in gross statements concerning her having been born poor and in an inferior rank  he begins by stating that she was     born in the garret in the kitchen bred    promoted thence to deck her mistress head    nextfor some gracious service unexpressed    and from its wages only to be guessed    raised from the toilet to the table where    her wondering betters wait behind her chair    with eye unmoved and forehead unabashed    she dines from off the plate she lately washed    quick with the tale and ready with the lie    the genial confidante and general spy    who could ye gods her next employment guess    an only infants earliest governess    what had she made the pupil of her art    none knows but that high soul secured the heart    and panted for the truth it could not hear    with longing soul and undeluded ear 17  the poet here recognises as a singular trait in lady byron her peculiar love of trutha trait which must have struck everyone that had any knowledge of her through life  he goes on now to give what he certainly knew to be the real character of lady byron     foiled was perversion by that youthful mind    which flattery fooled not baseness could not blind    deceit infect not nor contagion soil    indulgence weaken or example spoil    nor mastered science tempt her to look down    on humbler talent with a pitying frown    nor genius swell nor beauty render vain    nor envy ruffle to retaliate pain  we are now informed that mrs clermont whom he afterwards says in his letters was a spy of lady byrons mother set herself to make mischief between them  he says     if early habitsthose strong links that bind     at times the loftiest to the meanest mind     have given her power too deeply to instil     the angry essence of her deadly will     if like a snake she steal within your walls     till the black slime betray her as she crawls     if like a viper to the heart she wind     and leaves the venom there she did not find     what marvel that this hag of hatred works     eternal evil latent as she lurks  the noble lord then proceeds to abuse this woman of inferior rank in the language of the upper circles  he thus describes her person and manner     skilled by a touch to deepen scandals tints     with all the kind mendacity of hints     while mingling truth with falsehood sneers with smiles     a thread of candour with a web of wiles     a plain blunt show of brieflyspoken seeming     to hide her bloodless hearts soulhardend scheming     a lip of lies a face formed to conceal     and without feeling mock at all who feel     with a vile mask the gorgon would disown     a cheek of parchment and an eye of stone     mark how the channels of her yellow blood     ooze to her skin and stagnate there to mud     cased like the centipede in saffron mail     or darker greenness of the scorpions scale     for drawn from reptiles only may we trace     congenial colours in that soul or face     look on her features and behold her mind     as in a mirror of itself defined     look on the picture deem it not oercharged     there is no trait which might not be enlarged  the poem thus ends     may the strong curse of crushed affections light    back on thy bosom with reflected blight    and make thee in thy leprosy of mind    as loathsome to thyself as to mankind    till all thy selfthoughts curdle into hate    blackas thy will for others would create    till thy hard heart be calcined into dust    and thy soul welter in its hideous crust    o may thy grave be sleepless as the bed    the widowed couch of fire that thou hast spread    then when thou fain wouldst weary heaven with prayer    look on thy earthly victimsand despair    down to the dust and as thou rottst away    even worms shall perish on thy poisonous clay    but for the love i bore and still must bear    to her thy malice from all ties would tear    thy namethy human nameto every eye    the climax of all scorn should hang on high    exalted oer thy less abhorred compeers    and festering in the infamy of years       march 16 1816  now on the 29th of march 1816 this was lord byrons story  he states that his wife had a truthfulness even from early girlhood that the most artful and unscrupulous governess could not pollutethat she always panted for truththat flattery could not fool nor baseness blind herthat though she was a genius and master of science she was yet gentle and tolerant and one whom no envy could ruffle to retaliate pain  in september of the same year she is a monster of unscrupulous deceit and vindictive cruelty  now what had happened in the five months between the dates of these poems to produce such a change of opinion  simply this  1st  the negotiation between him and his wifes lawyers had ended in his signing a deed of separation in preference to standing a suit for divorce  2nd  madame de stael moved by his tears of anguish and professions of repentance had offered to negotiate with lady byron on his behalf and had failed  the failure of this application is the only apology given by moore and murray for this poem which gentle thomas moore admits was not in quite as generous a strain as the fare thee well  but lord byron knew perfectly well when he suffered that application to be made that lady byron had been entirely convinced that her marriage relations with him could never be renewed and that duty both to man and god required her to separate from him  the allowing the negotiation was therefore an artifice to place his wife before the public in the attitude of a hardhearted inflexible woman her refusal was what he knew beforehand must inevitably be the result and merely gave him capital in the sympathy of his friends by which they should be brought to tolerate and accept the bitter accusations of this poem  we have recently heard it asserted that this lastnamed piece of poetry was the sudden offspring of a fit of illtemper and was never intended to be published at all  there were certainly excellent reasons why his friends should have advised him not to publish it at that time  but that it was read with sympathy by the circle of his intimate friends and believed by them is evident from the frequency with which allusions to it occur in his confidential letters to them 21  about three months after under date march 10 1817 he writes to moore i suppose now i shall never be able to shake off my sables in public imagination more particularly since my moral  clove down my fame again to murray in 1819 three years after he says i never hear anything of ada the little electra of mycenae  electra was the daughter of clytemnestra in the greek poem who lived to condemn her wicked mother and to call on her brother to avenge the father  there was in this mention of electra more than meets the ear many passages in lord byrons poetry show that he intended to make this daughter a future partisan against her mother and explain the awful words he is stated in lady anne barnards diary to have used when first he looked on his little girlwhat an instrument of torture i have gained in you  in a letter to lord blessington april 6 1823 he says speaking of dr parr 22a     he did me the honour once to be a patron of mine though a great    friend of the other branch of the house of atreus and the greek    teacher i believe of my moral clytemnestra  i say moral because    it is true and is so useful to the virtuous that it enables them to    do anything without the aid of an aegistheus  if lord byron wrote this poem merely in a momentary fit of spleen why were there so many persons evidently quite familiar with his allusions to it and why was it preserved in murrays hands and why published after his death  that byron was in the habit of reposing documents in the hands of murray to be used as occasion offered is evident from a part of a note written by him to murray respecting some verses so intrusted pray let not these versiculi go forth with my name except to the initiated 22b  murray in publishing this attack on his wife after lord byrons death showed that he believed in it and so believing deemed lady byron a woman whose widowed state deserved neither sympathy nor delicacy of treatment  at a time when every sentiment in the heart of the most deeply wronged woman would forbid her appearing to justify herself from such cruel slander of a dead husband an honest kindhearted worthy englishman actually thought it right and proper to give these lines to her eyes and the eyes of all the reading world  nothing can show more plainly what this poem was written for and how thoroughly it did its work  considering byron as a wronged man murray thought he was contributing his mite towards doing him justice  his editor prefaced the whole set of domestic pieces with the following statements     they all refer to the unhappy separation of which the precise causes    are still a mystery and which he declared to the last were never    disclosed to himself  he admitted that pecuniary embarrassments    disordered health and dislike to family restraints had aggravated his    naturally violent temper and driven him to excesses  he suspected    that his motherinlaw had fomented the discordwhich lady byron    deniesand that more was due to the malignant offices of a female    dependant who is the subject of the bitterly satirical sketch                                        to these general statements can only be added the still vaguer    allegations of lady byron that she conceived his conduct to be the    result of insanitythat the physician pronouncing him responsible    for his actions she could submit to them no longer and that dr    lushington her legal adviser agreed that a reconciliation was    neither proper nor possible  no weight can be attached to the    opinions of an opposing counsel upon accusations made by one party    behind the back of the other who urgently demanded and was    pertinaciously refused the least opportunity of denial or defence  he    rejected the proposal for an amicable separation but consented when    threatened with a suit in doctors commons 23  neither john murray nor any of byrons partisans seem to have pondered the admission in these last words  here as appears was a woman driven to the last despair standing with her child in her arms asking from english laws protection for herself and child against her husband  she had appealed to the first counsel in england and was acting under their direction  two of the greatest lawyers in england have pronounced that there has been such a cause of offence on his part that a return to him is neither proper nor possible and that no alternative remains to her but separation or divorce  he asks her to state her charges against him  she making answer under advice of her counsel says that if he insists on the specifications he must receive them in open court in a suit for divorce  what now ought to have been the conduct of any brave honest man who believed that his wife was taking advantage of her reputation for virtue to turn every one against him who saw that she had turned on her side even the lawyer he sought to retain on his 24 that she was an unscrupulous woman who acquiesced in every and any thing to gain her ends while he stood before the public as he says accused of every monstrous vice by public rumour or private rancour  when she under advice of her lawyers made the alternative legal separation or open investigation in court for divorce what did he do  he signed the act of separation and left england  now let any man who knows the legal mind of englandlet any lawyer who knows the character of sir samuel romilly and dr lushington ask whether they were the men to take a case into court for a woman that had no evidence but her own statements and impressions  were they men to go to trial without proofs  did they not know that there were artful hysterical women in the world and would they of all people be the men to take a womans story on her own side and advise her in the last issue to bring it into open court without legal proof of the strongest kind  now as long as sir samuel romilly lived this statement of byronsthat he was condemned unheard and had no chance of knowing whereof he was accusednever appeared in public  it however was most actively circulated in private  that byron was in the habit of intrusting to different confidants articles of various kinds to be shown to different circles as they could bear them we have already shown  we have recently come upon another instance of this kind in the late eagerness to exculpate byron a new document has turned up of which mr murray it appears had never heard when after byrons death he published in the preface to his domestic pieces the sentence he rejected the proposal for an amicable separation but consented when threatened with a suit in doctors commons  it appears that up to 1853 neither john murray senior nor the son who now fills his place had taken any notice of this newly found document which we are now informed was drawn up by lord byron in august 1817 while mr hobhouse was staying with him at la mira near venice given to mr matthew gregory lewis for circulation among friends in england found in mr lewiss papers after his death and now in the possession of mr murray  here it is     it has been intimated to me that the persons understood to be the    legal advisers of lady byron have declared their lips to be sealed    up on the cause of the separation between her and myself  if their    lips are sealed up they are not sealed up by me and the greatest    favour they can confer upon me will be to open them  from the first    hour in which i was apprised of the intentions of the noel family to    the last communication between lady byron and myself in the character    of wife and husband a period of some months i called repeatedly and    in vain for a statement of their or her charges and it was chiefly in    consequence of lady byrons claiming in a letter still existing a    promise on my part to consent to a separation if such was really    her wish that i consented at all this claim and the exasperating    and inexpiable manner in which their object was pursued which    rendered it next to an impossibility that two persons so divided could    ever be reunited induced me reluctantly then and repentantly still    to sign the deed which i shall be happymost happyto cancel and    go before any tribunal which may discuss the business in the most    public manner     mr hobhouse made this proposition on my part viz to abrogate all    prior intentionsand go into courtthe very day before the    separation was signed and it was declined by the other party as also    the publication of the correspondence during the previous discussion    those propositions i beg here to repeat and to call upon her and hers    to say their worst pledging myself to meet their    allegationswhatever they may beand only too happy to be informed    at last of their real nature     byron     august 9 1817     psi have been and am now utterly ignorant of what description    her allegations charges or whatever name they may have assumed are    and am as little aware for what purpose they have been kept    backunless it was to sanction the most infamous calumnies by    silence     byron     la mira near venice  it appears the circulation of this document must have been very private since moore not overdelicate towards lady byron did not think fit to print it since john murray neglected it and since it has come out at this late hour for the first time  if lord byron really desired lady byron and her legal counsel to understand the facts herein stated and was willing at all hazards to bring on an open examination why was this privately circulated  why not issued as a card in the london papers  is it likely that mr matthew gregory lewis and a chosen band of friends acting as a committee requested an audience with lady byron sir samuel romilly and dr lushington and formally presented this cartel of defiance  we incline to think not  we incline to think that this small serpent in company with many others of like kind crawled secretly and privately around and when it found a good chance bit an honest briton whose blood was thenceforth poisoned by an undetected falsehood  the reader now may turn to the letters that mr moore has thought fit to give us of this stay at la mira beginning with letter 286 dated july 1 1817 28a where he says i have been working up my impressions into a fourth canto of childe harold and also mr lewis is in venice  i am going up to stay a week with him there  next under date la mira venice july 10 28b he says monk lewis is here how pleasant  next under date july 20 1817 to mr murray i write to give you notice that i have completed the fourth and ultimate canto of childe harold     it is yet to be copied and polished and the notes are to come  under date of la mira august 7 1817 he records that the new canto is one hundred and thirty stanzas in length and talks about the price for it  he is now ready to launch it on the world and as now appears on august 9 1817 two days after he wrote the document above cited and put it into the hands of mr lewis as we are informed for circulation among friends in england  the reason of this may now be evident  having prepared a suitable number of those whom he calls in his notes to murray the initiated by private documents and statements he is now prepared to publish his accusations against his wife and the story of his wrongs in a great immortal poem which shall have a band of initiated interpreters shall be read through the civilised world and stand to accuse her after his death  in the fourth canto of childe harold with all his own overwhelming power of language he sets forth his cause as against the silent woman who all this time had been making no party and telling no story and whom the world would therefore conclude to be silent because she had no answer to make  i remember well the time when this poetry so resounding in its music so mournful so apparently generous filled my heart with a vague anguish of sorrow for the sufferer and of indignation at the cold insensibility that had maddened him  thousands have felt the power of this great poem which stands and must stand to all time a monument of what sacred and solemn powers god gave to this wicked man and how vilely he abused this power as a weapon to slay the innocent  it is among the ruins of ancient rome that his voice breaks forth in solemn imprecation     o time thou beautifier of the dead    adorner of the ruin comforter    and only healer when the heart hath bled    time the corrector when our judgments err    the test of truth lovesole philosopher    for all besides are sophistsfrom thy shrift    that never loses though it doth defer    time the avenger unto thee i lift    my hands and heart and eyes and claim of thee a gift                                        if thou hast ever seen me too elate    hear me not but if calmly i have borne    good and reserved my pride against the hate    which shall not whelm me let me not have worn    this iron in my soul in vain shall they not mourn    and thou who never yet of human wrong    left the unbalanced scale great nemesis    here where the ancients paid their worship long    thou who didst call the furies from the abyss    and round orestes bid them howl and hiss    for that unnatural retributionjust    had it but come from hands less nearin this    thy former realm i call thee from the dust    dost thou not hear my heart awake thou shalt and must    it is not that i may not have incurred    for my ancestral faults and mine the wound    wherewith i bleed withal and had it been conferred    with a just weapon it had flowed unbound    but now my blood shall not sink in the ground                                        but in this page a record will i seek    not in the air shall these my words disperse    though i be ashesa far hour shall wreak    the deep prophetic fulness of this verse    and pile on human heads the mountain of my curse    that curse shall be forgiveness  have i not    hear me my mother earth behold it heaven    have i not had to wrestle with my lot    have i not suffered things to be forgiven    have i not had my brain seared my heart riven    hopes sapped name blighted lifes life lied away    and only not to desperation driven    because not altogether of such clay    as rots into the soul of those whom i survey          from mighty wrongs to petty perfidy    have i not seen what human things could do    from the loud roar of foaming calumny    to the small whispers of the paltry few    and subtler venom of the reptile crew    the janus glance of whose significant eye    learning to lie with silence would seem true    and without utterance save the shrug or sigh    deal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy 31  the reader will please notice that the lines in italics are almost word for word a repetition of the lines in italics in the former poem on his wife where he speaks of a significant eye that has learned to lie in silence and were evidently meant to apply to lady byron and her small circle of confidential friends  before this in the third canto of childe harold he had claimed the sympathy of the world as a loving father deprived by a severe fate of the solace and society of his only child     my daughterwith this name my song began    my daughterwith this name my song shall end    i see thee not and hear thee not but none    can be so wrapped in thee thou art the friend    to whom the shadows of far years extend                                        to aid thy minds developments to watch    the dawn of little joys to sit and see    almost thy very growth to view thee catch    knowledge of objectswonders yet to thee    and print on thy soft cheek a parents kiss    this it should seem was not reserved for me    yet this was in my natureas it is    i know not what there is yet something like to this          yet though dull hate as duty should be taught    i know that thou wilt love me though my name    should be shut out from thee as spell still fraught    with desolation and a broken claim    though the grave close between ust were the same    i know that thou wilt love me though to drain    my blood from out thy being were an aim    and an attainmentall will be in vain  to all these charges against her sent all over the world in verses as eloquent as the english language is capable of the wife replied nothing     assailed by slander and the tongue of strife    her only answer wasa blameless life  she had a few friends a very few with whom she sought solace and sympathy  one letter from her written at this time preserved by accident is the only authentic record of how the matter stood with her  we regret to say that the publication of this document was not brought forth to clear lady byrons name from her husbands slanders but to shield him from the worst accusation against him by showing that this crime was not included in the few private confidential revelations that friendship wrung from the young wife at this period  lady anne barnard authoress of auld robin grey a friend whose age and experience made her a proper confidante sent for the brokenhearted perplexed wife and offered her a womans sympathy  to her lady byron wrote many letters under seal of confidence and lady anne says i will give you a few paragraphs transcribed from one of lady byrons own letters to me  it is sorrowful to think that in a very little time this young and amiable creature wise patient and feeling will have her character mistaken by every one who reads byrons works  to rescue her from this i preserved her letters and when she afterwards expressed a fear that anything of her writing should ever fall into hands to injure him i suppose she meant by publication i safely assured her that it never should  but here this letter shall be placed a sacred record in her favour unknown to herself     i am a very incompetent judge of the impression which the last canto    of childe harold may produce on the minds of indifferent readers     it contains the usual trace of a conscience restlessly awake though    his object has been too long to aggravate its burden as if it could    thus be oppressed into eternal stupor  i will hope as you do that    it survives for his ultimate good     it was the acuteness of his remorse impenitent in its character    which so long seemed to demand from my compassion to spare every    semblance of reproach every look of grief which might have said to    his conscience you have made me wretched     i am decidedly of opinion that he is responsible  he has wished to    be thought partially deranged or on the brink of it to perplex    observers and prevent them from tracing effects to their real causes    through all the intricacies of his conduct  i was as i told you at    one time the dupe of his acted insanity and clung to the former    delusions in regard to the motives that concerned me personally till    the whole system was laid bare     he is the absolute monarch of words and uses them as bonaparte did    lives for conquest without more regard to their intrinsic value    considering them only as ciphers which must derive all their import    from the situation in which he places them and the ends to which he    adapts them with such consummate skill     why then you will say does he not employ them to give a better    colour to his own character  because he is too good an actor to over    act or to assume a moral garb which it would be easy to strip off     in regard to his poetry egotism is the vital principle of his    imagination which it is difficult for him to kindle on any subject    with which his own character and interests are not identified but by    the introduction of fictitious incidents by change of scene or time    he has enveloped his poetical disclosures in a system impenetrable    except to a very few and his constant desire of creating a sensation    makes him not averse to be the object of wonder and curiosity even    though accompanied by some dark and vague suspicions     nothing has contributed more to the misunderstanding of his real    character than the lonely grandeur in which he shrouds it and his    affectation of being above mankind when he exists almost in their    voice  the romance of his sentiments is another feature of this mask    of state  i know no one more habitually destitute of that enthusiasm    he so beautifully expresses and to which he can work up his fancy    chiefly by contagion     i had heard he was the best of brothers the most generous of    friends and i thought such feelings only required to be warmed and    cherished into more diffusive benevolence  though these opinions are    eradicated and could never return but with the decay of my memory    you will not wonder if there are still moments when the association of    feelings which arose from them soften and sadden my thoughts     but i have not thanked you dearest lady anne for your kindness in    regard to a principal objectthat of rectifying false impressions  i    trust you understand my wishes which never were to injure lord byron    in any way for though he would not suffer me to remain his wife he    cannot prevent me from continuing his friend and it was from    considering myself as such that i silenced the accusations by which my    own conduct might have been more fully justified     it is not necessary to speak ill of his heart in general it is    sufficient that to me it was hard and impenetrable that my own must    have been broken before his could have been touched  i would rather    represent this as my misfortune than as his guilt but surely    that misfortune is not to be made my crime  such are my feelings you    will judge how to act     his allusions to me in childe harold are cruel and cold but with    such a semblance as to make me appear so and to attract all    sympathy to himself  it is said in this poem that hatred of him will    be taught as a lesson to his child  i might appeal to all who have    ever heard me speak of him and still more to my own heart to witness    that there has been no moment when i have remembered injury otherwise    than affectionately and sorrowfully     it is not my duty to give way to hopeless and wholly unrequited    affection but so long as i live my chief struggle will probably be    not to remember him too kindly  i do not seek the sympathy of the    world but i wish to be known by those whose opinion is valuable and    whose kindness is dear to me  among such my dear lady anne you will    ever be remembered by your truly affectionate     a byron  on this letter i observe lord lindsay remarks that it shows a noble but rather severe character and a recent author has remarked that it seemed to be written rather in a cold spirit of criticism  it seems to strike these gentlemen as singular that lady byron did not enjoy the poem  but there are two remarkable sentences in this letter which have escaped the critics hitherto  lord byron in this the third canto of childe harold expresses in most affecting words an enthusiasm of love for his sister  so long as he lived he was her faithful correspondent he sent her his journals and dying he left her and her children everything he had in the world  this certainly seems like an affectionate brother but in what words does lady byron speak of this affection  i had heard he was the best of brothers the most generous of friends i thought these feelings only required to be warmed and cherished into more diffusive benevolence  these opinions are eradicated and could never return but with the decay of memory  let me ask those who give this letter as a proof that at this time no idea such as i have stated was in lady byrons mind to account for these words  let them please answer these questions why had lady byron ceased to think him a good brother  why does she use so strong a word as that the opinion was eradicated torn up by the roots and could never grow again in her except by decay of memory  and yet this is a document lord lindsay vouches for as authentic and which he brings forward in defence of lord byron  again she says though he would not suffer me to remain his wife he cannot prevent me from continuing his friend  do these words not say that in some past time in some decided manner lord byron had declared to her his rejection of her as a wife  i shall yet have occasion to explain these words  again she says i silenced accusations by which my conduct might have been more fully justified  the people in england who are so very busy in searching out evidence against my true story have searched out and given to the world an important confirmation of this assertion of lady byrons  it seems that the confidential waitingmaid who went with lady byron on her wedding journey has been sought out and interrogated and as appears by description is a venerable respectable old person quite in possession of all her senses in general and of that sixth sense of propriety in particular which appears not to be a common virtue in our days  as her testimony is important we insert it just here with a description of her person in full  the ardent investigators thus speak     having gained admission we were shown into a small but neatly    furnished and scrupulously clean apartment where sat the object of    our visit  mrs mimms is a venerablelooking old lady of short    stature slight and active appearance with a singularly bright and    intelligent countenance  although midway between eighty and ninety    years of age she is in full possession of her faculties discourses    freely and cheerfully hears apparently as well as ever she did and    her sight is so good that aided by a pair of spectacles she reads    the chronicle every day with ease  some idea of her competency to    contribute valuable evidence to the subject which now so much engages    public attention on three continents may be found from her own    narrative of her personal relations with lady byron  mrs mimms was    born in the neighbourhood of seaham and knew lady byron from    childhood  during the long period of ten years she was miss    milbankes ladysmaid and in that capacity became the close    confidante of her mistress  there were circumstances which rendered    their relationship peculiarly intimate  miss milbanke had no sister    or female friend to whom she was bound by the ties of more than a    common affection and her mother whatever other excellent qualities    she may have possessed was too highspirited and too hasty in temper    to attract the sympathies of the young  some months before miss    milbanke was married to lord byron mrs mimms had quitted her service    on the occasion of her own marriage with mr mimms but she continued    to reside in the neighbourhood of seaham and remained on the most    friendly terms with her former mistress  as the courtship proceeded    miss milbanke concealed nothing from her faithful attendant and when    the weddingday was fixed she begged mrs mimms to return and fulfil    the duties of ladysmaid at least during the honeymoon  mrs mimms    at the time was nursing her first child and it was no small sacrifice    to quit her own home at such a moment but she could not refuse her    old mistresss request  accordingly she returned to seaham hall some    days before the wedding was present at the ceremony and then    preceded lord and lady byron to halnaby hall near croft in the north    riding of yorkshire one of sir ralph milbankes seats where the    newly married couple were to spend the honeymoon  mrs mimms remained    with lord and lady byron during the three weeks they spent at halnaby    hall and then accompanied them to seaham where they spent the next    six weeks  it was during the latter period that she finally quitted    lady byrons service but she remained in the most friendly    communication with her ladyship till the death of the latter and for    some time was living in the neighbourhood of lady byrons residence in    leicestershire where she had frequent opportunities of seeing her    former mistress  it may be added that lady byron was not unmindful of    the faithful services of her friend and attendant in the instructions    to her executors contained in her will  such was the position of mrs    mimms towards lady byron and we think no one will question that it    was of a nature to entitle all that mrs mimms may say on the subject    of the relations of lord and lady byron to the most respectful    consideration and credit  such is the chroniclers account of the faithful creature whom nothing but intense indignation and disgust at mrs beecher stowe would lead to speak on her mistresss affairs but mrs beecher stowe feels none the less sincere respect for her and is none the less obliged to her for having spoken  much of mrs mimmss testimony will be referred to in another place we only extract one passage to show that while lord byron spent his time in setting afloat slanders against his wife she spent hers in sealing the mouths of witnesses against him  of the period of the honeymoon mrs mimms says     the happiness of lady byron however was of brief duration even    during the short three weeks they spent at halnaby the irregularities    of lord byron occasioned her the greatest distress and she even    contemplated returning to her father  mrs mimms was her constant    companion and confidante through this painful period and she does not    believe that her ladyship concealed a thought from her  with    laudable reticence the old lady absolutely refuses to disclose the    particulars of lord byrons misconduct at this time she gave lady    byron a solemn promise not to do so                                          so serious did mrs mimms consider the conduct of lord byron that    she recommended her mistress to confide all the circumstances to her    father sir ralph milbanke a calm kind and most excellent parent    and take his advice as to her future course  at one time mrs mimms    thinks lady byron had resolved to follow her counsel and impart her    wrongs to sir ralph but on arriving at seaham hall her ladyship    strictly enjoined mrs mimms to preserve absolute silence on the    subjecta course which she followed herselfso that when six weeks    later she and lord byron left seaham for london not a word had    escaped her to disturb her parents tranquillity as to their    daughters domestic happiness  as might be expected mrs mimms bears    the warmest testimony to the noble and lovable qualities of her    departed mistress  she also declares that lady byron was by no means    of a cold temperament but that the affectionate impulses of her    nature were checked by the unkind treatment she experienced from her    husband  we have already shown that lord byron had been ever since his separation engaged in a systematic attempt to reverse the judgment of the world against himself by making converts of all his friends to a most odious view of his wifes character and inspiring them with the zeal of propagandists to spread these views through society  we have seen how he prepared partisans to interpret the fourth canto of childe harold  this plan of solemn and heroic accusation was the first public attack on his wife  next we see him commencing a scurrilous attempt to turn her to ridicule in the first canto of don juan  it is to our point now to show how carefully and cautiously this don juan campaign was planned  vol iv p138 we find letter 325 to mr murray        venice january 25 1819     you will do me the favour to print privately for private    distribution fifty copies of don juan  the list of the men to    whom i wish it presented i will send hereafter  the poem as will be remembered begins with the meanest and foulest attack on his wife that ever ribald wrote and puts it in close neighbourhood with scenes which every pure man or woman must feel to be the beastly utterances of a man who had lost all sense of decency  such a potion was too strong to be administered even in a time when great license was allowed and men were not overnice  but byron chooses fifty armourbearers of that class of men who would find indecent ribaldry about a wife a good joke and talk about the artistic merits of things which we hope would make an honest boy blush  at this time he acknowledges that his vices had brought him to a state of great exhaustion attended by such debility of the stomach that nothing remained on it and adds i was obliged to reform my way of life which was conducting me from the yellow leaf to the ground with all deliberate speed 41  but as his health is a little better he employs it in making the way to death and hell elegantly easy for other young men by breaking down the remaining scruples of a society not overscrupulous  society revolted however and fought stoutly against the nauseous dose his sister wrote to him that she heard such things said of it that she never would read it and the outcry against it on the part of all women of his acquaintance was such that for a time he was quite overborne and the countess guiccioli finally extorted a promise from him to cease writing it  nevertheless there came a time when england accepted don juanwhen wilson in the noctes ambrosianae praised it as a classic and took every opportunity to reprobate lady byrons conduct when first it appeared the blackwood came out with that indignant denunciation of which we have spoken and to which byron replied in the extracts we have already quoted  he did something more than reply  he marked out wilson as one of the strongest literary men of the day and set his initiated with their documents to work upon him  one of these documents to which he requested wilsons attention was the private autobiography written expressly to give his own story of all the facts of the marriage and separation  in the indignant letter he writes murray on the blackwood article vol iv letter 350under date december 10 1819he says     i sent home for moore and for moore only who has my journal also    my memoir written up to 1816 and i gave him leave to show it to whom    he pleased but not to publish on any account  you may read it    and you may let wilson read it if he likesnot for his public    opinion but his private for i like the man and care very little    about the magazine  and i could wish lady byron herself to read it    that she may have it in her power to mark any thing mistaken or    misstated  as it will never appear till after my extinction it would    be but fair she should see it that is to say herself willing  your    blackwood accuses me of treating women harshly but i have been    their martyr my whole life has been sacrificed to them and by them  it was a part of byrons policy to place lady byron in positions before the world where she could not speak and where her silence would be set down to her as haughty stony indifference and obstinacy  such was the pretended negotiation through madame de stael and such now this apparently fair and generous offer to let lady byron see and mark this manuscript  the little ada is now in her fifth yeara child of singular sensibility and remarkable mental powersone of those exceptional children who are so perilous a charge for a mother  her husband proposes this artful snare to herthat she shall mark what is false in a statement which is all built on a damning lie that she cannot refute over that daughters headand which would perhaps be her ruin to discuss  hence came an addition of two more documents to be used privately among friends 43 and which blackwood uses after lady byron is safely out of the world to cast ignominy on her gravethe wifes letter that of a mother standing at bay for her daughter knowing that she is dealing with a desperate powerful unscrupulous enemy        kirkby mallory march 10 1820     i received your letter of january 1 offering to my perusal a memoir    of part of your life  i decline to inspect it  i consider the    publication or circulation of such a composition at any time as    prejudicial to adas future happiness  for my own sake i have no    reason to shrink from publication but notwithstanding the injuries    which i have suffered i should lament some of the consequences        a byron     to lord byron  lord byron writing for the public as is his custom makes reply        ravenna april 3 1820     i received yesterday your answer dated march 10  my offer was an    honest one and surely could only be construed as such even by the    most malignant casuistry  i could answer you but it is too late and    it is not worth while  to the mysterious menace of the last sentence    whatever its import may beand i cannot pretend to unriddle iti    could hardly be very sensible even if i understood it as before it    can take place i shall be where nothing can touch him further        i advise you however to anticipate the period of your intention    for be assured no power of figures can avail beyond the present and    if it could i would answer with the florentine     ed io che posto son con loro in croce                             e certo    la fiera moglie piu chaltro mi nuoce 44        byron     to lady byron  two things are very evident in this correspondence lady byron intimates that if he publishes his story some consequences must follow which she shall regret  lord byron receives this as a threat and says he doesnt understand it but directly after he says before it can take place i shall be etc  the intimation is quite clear  he does understand what the consequences alluded to are  they are evidently that lady byron will speak out and tell her story  he says she cannot do this till after he is dead and then he shall not care  in allusion to her accuracy as to dates and figures he says be assured no power of figures can avail beyond the present life and then ironically advises her to anticipate the periodie to speak out while he is alive  in vol vi letter 518 which lord byron wrote to lady byron but did not send he says i burned your last note for two reasonsfirstly because it was written in a style not very agreeable and secondly because i wished to take your word without documents which are the resources of worldly and suspicious people  it would appear from this that there was a last letter of lady byron to her husband which he did not think proper to keep on hand or show to the initiated with his usual unreserve that this letter contained some kind of pledge for which he preferred to take her word without documents  each reader can imagine for himself what that pledge might have been but from the tenor of the three letters we should infer that it was a promise of silence for his lifetime on certain conditions and that the publication of the autobiography would violate those conditions and make it her duty to speak out  this celebrated autobiography forms so conspicuous a figure in the whole history that the reader must have a full idea of it as given by byron himself in vol iv  letter 344 to murray     i gave to moore who is gone to rome my life in msin seventy    eight folio sheets brought down to 1816    also a journal kept in    1814  neither are for publication during my life but when i am cold    you may do what you please  in the mean time if you like to read    them you may and show them to anybody you like  i care not      he tells him also     you will find in it a detailed account of my marriage and its    consequences as true as a party concerned can make such an account  of the extent to which this autobiography was circulated we have the following testimony of shelton mackenzie in notes to the noctes of june 1824  in the noctes odoherty says     the fact is the work had been copied for the private reading of a    great lady in florence  the note says     the great lady in florence for whose private reading byrons    autobiography was copied was the countess of westmoreland     lady    blessington had the autobiography in her possession for weeks and    confessed to having copied every line of it  moore remonstrated and    she committed her copy to the flames but did not tell him that her    sister mrs home purvis now viscountess of canterbury had also made    a copy     from the quantity of copy i have seenand others were    more in the way of falling in with it than myselfi surmise that at    least half a dozen copies were made and of these five are now in    existence  some particular parts such as the marriage and    separation were copied separately but i think there cannot be less    than five full copies yet to be found  this was written after the original autobiography was burned  we may see the zeal and enthusiasm of the byron partycopying seventy eight folio sheets as of old christians copied the gospels  how widely fully and thoroughly thus by this secret process was society saturated with byrons own versions of the story that related to himself and wife  against her there was only the complaint of an absolute silence  she put forth no statements no documents had no party sealed the lips of her counsel and even of her servants yet she could not but have known from time to time how thoroughly and strongly this web of mingled truth and lies was being meshed around her steps  from the time that byron first saw the importance of securing wilson on his side and wrote to have his partisans attend to him we may date an entire revolution in the blackwood  it became byrons warmest supporteris to this day the bitterest accuser of his wife  why was this wonderful silence  it appears by dr lushingtons statements that when lady byron did speak she had a story to tell that powerfully affected both him and romillya story supported by evidence on which they were willing to have gone to public trial  supposing now she had imitated lord byrons example and avoiding public trial had put her story into private circulation as he sent don juan to fifty confidential friends suppose she had sent a written statement of her story to fifty judges as intelligent as the two that had heard it or suppose she had confronted his autobiography with her ownwhat would have been the result  the first result might have been mrs leighs utter ruin  the world may finally forgive the man of genius anything but for a woman there is no mercy and no redemption  this ruin lady byron prevented by her utter silence and great selfcommand  mrs leigh never lost position  lady byron never so varied in her manner towards her as to excite the suspicions even of her confidential old servant  to protect mrs leigh effectually it must have been necessary to continue to exclude even her own mother from the secret as we are assured she did at first for had she told lady milbanke it is not possible that so highspirited a woman could have restrained herself from such outward expressions as would at least have awakened suspicion  there was no resource but this absolute silence  lady blessington in her last conversation with lord byron thus describes the life lady byron was leading  she speaks of her as wearing away her youth in almost monastic seclusion questioned by some appreciated by few seeking consolation alone in the discharge of her duties and avoiding all external demonstrations of a grief that her pale cheek and solitary existence alone were vouchers for 49  the main object of all this silence may be imagined if we remember that if lord byron had not diedhad he truly and deeply repented and become a thoroughly good man and returned to england to pursue a course worthy of his powers there was on record neither word nor deed from his wife to stand in his way  his place was kept in society ready for him to return to whenever he came clothed and in his right mind  he might have had the heart and confidence of his daughter unshadowed by a suspicion  he might have won the reverence of the great and good in his own lands and all lands  that hope which was the strong support the prayer of the silent wife it did not please god to fulfil  lord byron died a wornout man at thirtysix  but the bitter seeds he had sown came up after his death in a harvest of thorns over his grave and there were not wanting hands to use them as instruments of torture on the heart of his widow    chapter iii  resume of the conspiracy   we have traced the conspiracy of lord byron against his wife up to its latest device  that the readers mind may be clear on the points of the process we shall now briefly recapitulate the documents in the order of time  i  march 17 1816while negotiations for separation were pendingfare thee well and if for ever  while writing these pages we have received from england the testimony of one who has seen the original draught of that fare thee well  this original copy had evidently been subjected to the most careful and acute revision  scarcely two lines that were not interlined scarcely an adjective that was not exchanged for a better showing that the noble lord was not so far overcome by grief as to have forgotten his reputation  found its way to the public prints through the imprudence of a friend  ii  march 29 1816an attack on lady byrons old governess for having been born poor for being homely and for having unduly influenced his wife against him promising that her grave should be a fiery bed etc also praising his wifes perfect and remarkable truthfulness and discernment that made it impossible for flattery to fool or baseness blind her but ascribing all his woes to her being fooled and blinded by this same governess  found its way to the prints by the imprudence of a friend  iii  september 1816lines on hearing that lady byron is ill  calls her a clytemnestra who has secretly set assassins on her lord says she is a mean treacherous deceitful liar and has entirely departed from her early truth and become the most unscrupulous and unprincipled of women  never printed till after lord byrons death but circulated privately among the initiated  iv  aug 9 1817gives to m g lewis a paper for circulation among friends in england stating that what he most wants is public investigation which has always been denied him and daring lady byron and her counsel to come out publicly  found in m g lewiss portfolio after his death never heard of before except among the initiated  having given m g lewiss document time to work  january 1818gives the fourth canto of childe harold 51 to the public  jan 25 1819sends to murray to print for private circulation among the initiated the first canto of don juan  is nobly and severely rebuked for this insult to his wife by the blackwood august 1819  october 1819gives moore the manuscript autobiography with leave to show it to whom he pleases and print it after his death  oct 29 1819 vol iv letter 344writes to murray that he may read all this autobiography and show it to anybody he likes  dec 10 1819writes to murray on this article in blackwood against don juan and himself which he supposes written by wilson sends a complimentary message to wilson and asks him to read his autobiography sent by moore  letter 350  march 15 1820writes and dedicates to i disraeli esq a vindication of himself in reply to the blackwood on don juan containing an indignant defence of his own conduct in relation to his wife and maintaining that he never yet has had an opportunity of knowing whereof he has been accused accusing sir s romilly of taking his retainer and then going over to the adverse party etc  printed for private circulation to be found in the standard english edition of murray vol ix p57  to this condensed account of byrons strategy we must add the crowning stroke of policy which transmitted this warfare to his friends to be continued after his death  during the last visit moore made him in italy and just before byron presented to him his autobiography the following scene occurred as narrated by moore vol iv p221     the chief subject of conversation when alone was his marriage and    the load of obloquy which it had brought upon him  he was most    anxious to know the worst that had been alleged of his conduct and    as this was our first opportunity of speaking together on the subject    i did not hesitate to put his candour most searchingly to the proof    not only by enumerating the various charges i had heard brought    against him by others but by specifying such portions of these    charges as i had been inclined to think not incredible myself     to all this he listened with patience and answered with the most    unhesitating frankness laughing to scorn the tales of unmanly outrage    related of him but at the same time acknowledging that there had been    in his conduct but too much to blame and regret and stating one or    two occasions during his domestic life when he had been irritated into    letting the breath of bitter words escape him    which he now    evidently remembered with a degree of remorse and pain which might    well have entitled them to be forgotten by others     it was at the same time manifest that whatever admissions he    might be inclined to make respecting his own delinquencies the    inordinate measure of the punishment dealt out to him had sunk deeply    into his mind and with the usual effect of such injustice drove him    also to be unjust himself so much so indeed as to impute to the    quarter to which he now traced all his ill fate a feeling of fixed    hostility to himself which would not rest he thought even at his    grave but continue to persecute his memory as it was now embittering    his life  so strong was this impression upon him that during one of    our few intervals of seriousness he conjured me by our friendship    if as he both felt and hoped i should survive him not to let    unmerited censure settle upon his name  in this same account page 218 moore testifies that     lord byron disliked his countrymen but only because he knew that his    morals were held in contempt by them  the english themselves rigid    observers of family duties could not pardon him the neglect of his    nor his trampling on principles therefore neither did he like being    presented to them nor did they especially when they had wives with    them like to cultivate his acquaintance  still there was a strong    desire in all of them to see him and the women in particular who did    not dare to look at him but by stealth said in an undervoice what    a pity it is  if however any of his compatriots of exalted rank    and high reputation came forward to treat him with courtesy he showed    himself obviously flattered by it  it seemed that to the wound which    remained open in his ulcerated heart such soothing attentions were as    drops of healing balm which comforted him  when in society we are further informed by a lady quoted by mr moore he was in the habit of speaking of his wife with much respect and affection as an illustrious lady distinguished for her qualities of heart and understanding saying that all the fault of their cruel separation lay with himself  mr moore seems at times to be somewhat puzzled by these contradictory statements of his idol and speculates not a little on what could be lord byrons object in using such language in public mentally comparing it we suppose with the free handling which he gave to the same subject in his private correspondence  the innocence with which moore gives himself up to be manipulated by lord byron the naivete with which he shows all the process let us a little into the secret of the marvellous powers of charming and blinding which this great actor possessed  lord byron had the beauty the wit the genius the dramatic talent which have constituted the strength of some wonderfully fascinating women  there have been women able to lead their leashes of blinded adorers to make them swear that black was white or white black at their word to smile away their senses or weep away their reason  no matter what these sirens may say no matter what they may do though caught in a thousand transparent lies and doing a thousand deeds which would have ruined others still men madly rave after them in life and tear their hair over their graves  such an enchanter in mans shape was lord byron  he led captive moore and murray by being beautiful a genius and a lord calling them dear tom and dear murray while they were only commoners  he first insulted sir walter scott and then witched his heart out of him by ingenuous confessions and poetical compliments he took wilsons heart by flattering messages and a beautifullywritten letter he corresponded familiarly with hogg and before his death had made fast friends in one way or another of the whole noctes ambrosianae club  we thus have given the historical resume of lord byrons attacks on his wifes reputation we shall add that they were based on philosophic principles showing a deep knowledge of mankind  an analysis will show that they can be philosophically classified  1st  those which addressed the sympathetic nature of man representing her as cold methodical severe strict unforgiving  2nd  those addressed to the faculty of association connecting her with ludicrous and licentious images taking from her the usual protection of womanly delicacy and sacredness  3rd  those addressed to the moral faculties accusing her as artful treacherous untruthful malignant  all these various devices he held in his hand shuffling and dealing them as a careful gamester his pack of cards according to the exigencies of the game  he played adroitly skilfully with blinding flatteries and seductive wiles that made his victims willing dupes  nothing can more clearly show the power and perfectness of his enchantments than the masterly way in which he turned back the moral force of the whole english nation which had risen at first in its strength against him  the victory was complete    chapter iv  results after lord byrons death   at the time of lord byrons death the english public had been so skilfully manipulated by the byron propaganda that the sympathy of the whole world was with him  a tide of emotion was now aroused in england by his early deathdying in the cause of greece and liberty  there arose a general wail for him as for a lost pleiad not only in england but over the whole world a great rush of enthusiasm for his memory to which the greatest literary men of england freely gave voice  by general consent lady byron seems to have been looked upon as the only coldhearted unsympathetic person in this general mourning  from that time the literary world of england apparently regarded lady byron as a woman to whom none of the decorums nor courtesies of ordinary womanhood nor even the consideration belonging to common humanity were due  she that is a widow indeed and desolate has been regarded in all christian countries as an object made sacred by the touch of gods afflicting hand sacred in her very helplessness and the old hebrew scriptures give to the supreme father no dearer title than the widows god  but on lord byrons death men not devoid of tenderness men otherwise generous and of fine feeling acquiesced in insults to his widow with an obtuseness that seems on review quite incredible  lady byron was not only a widow but an orphan  she had no sister for confidante no father and mother to whom to go in her sorrowssorrows so much deeper and darker to her than they could be to any other human being  she had neither son nor brother to uphold and protect her  on all hands it was acknowledged that so far there was no fault to be found in her but her utter silence  her life was confessed to be pure useful charitable and yet in this time of her sorrow the writers of england issued article upon article not only devoid of delicacy but apparently injurious and insulting towards her with a blind unconsciousness which seems astonishing  one of the greatest literary powers of that time was the blackwood the reigning monarch on that literary throne was wilson the lionhearted the brave generous tender poet and with some sad exceptions the noble man  but wilson had believed the story of byron and by his very generosity and tenderness and pity was betrayed into injustice  in the noctes of november 1824 there is a conversation of the noctes club in which north says byron and i knew each other pretty well and i suppose theres no harm in adding that we appreciated each other pretty tolerably  did you ever see his letter to me  the footnote to this says this letter which was printed in byrons lifetime was not published till 1830 when it appeared in moores life of byron  it is one of the most vigorous prose compositions in the language  byron had the highest opinion of wilsons genius and noble spirit  in the first place with our present ideas of propriety and good taste we should reckon it an indecorum to make the private affairs of a pure and good woman whose circumstances under any point of view were trying and who evidently shunned publicity the subject of public discussion in magazines which were read all over the world  lady byron as they all knew had on her hands a most delicate and onerous task in bringing up an only daughter necessarily inheriting peculiarities of genius and great sensitiveness and the many mortifications and embarrassments which such intermeddling with her private matters must have given certainly should have been considered by men with any pretensions to refinement or good feeling  but the literati of england allowed her no consideration no rest no privacy  in the noctes of november 1825 there is the record of a free conversation upon lord and lady byrons affairs interlarded with exhortations to push the bottle and remarks on whiskytoddy  medwins conversations with lord byron is discussed which we are told in a note appeared a few months after the noble poets death  there is a rather bold and free discussion of lord byrons characterhis fondness for gin and water on which stimulus he wrote don juan and james hogg says pleasantly to mullion o mullion its a pity you and byron could na ha been acquaint  there would ha been brave sparring to see who could say the wildest and the dreadfullest things for he had neither fear of man or woman and would ha his joke or jeer cost what it might  and then follows a specimen of one of his jokes with an actress that in indecency certainly justifies the assertion  from the other stories which follow and the parenthesis that occurs frequently mind your glass james a little more it seems evident that the party are progressing in their peculiar kind of civilisation  it is in this same circle and paper that lady byrons private affairs come up for discussion  the discussion is thus elegantly introduced     hoggreach me the black bottle  i say christopher what after    all is your opinion o lord and leddy byrons quarrel  do you    yoursel take part with him or with her  i wad like to hear your    real opinion     northoh dear  well hogg since you will have it i think    douglas kinnard and hobhouse are bound to tell us whether there be any    truth and how much in this story about the declaration signed by    sir ralph milbanke  the note here tells us that this refers to a statement that appeared in blackwood immediately after byrons death to the effect that previous to the formal separation from his wife byron required and obtained from sir ralph milbanke lady byrons father a statement to the effect that lady byron had no charge of moral delinquency to bring against him 61  north continues     and i think lady byrons letterthe dearest duck one i meanshould    really be forthcoming if her ladyships friends wish to stand fair    before the public  at present we have nothing but loose talk of    society to go upon and certainly if the things that are said be    true there must be thorough explanation from some quarter or the    tide will continue as it has assuredly begun to flow in a direction    very opposite to what we were for years accustomed  sir they must    explain this business of the letter  you have of course heard    about the invitation it contained the warm affectionate invitation    to kirkby mallory  hogg interposes     i dinna like to be interruptin ye mr north but i must inquire is    the jug to stand still while yere going on at that rate     norththere porker  these things are part and parcel of the    chatter of every booksellers shop a fortiori of every drawingroom    in may fair  can the matter stop here  can a great mans memory be    permitted to incur damnation while these saving clauses are afloat    anywhere uncontradicted  and from this the conversation branches off into strong emphatic praise of byrons conduct in greece during the last part of his life  the silent widow is thus delicately and considerately reminded in the blackwood that she is the talk not only over the whisky jug of the noctes but in every drawingroom in london and that she must speak out and explain matters or the whole world will set against her  but she does not speak yet  the public persecution therefore proceeds medwins book being insufficient another biographer is to be selected now the person in the noctes club who was held to have the most complete information of the byron affairs and was on that account first thought of by murray to execute this very delicate task of writing a memoir which should include the most sacred domestic affairs of a noble lady and her orphan daughter was maginn  maginn the author of the pleasant joke that man never reaches the apex of civilisation till he is too drunk to pronounce the word was the first person in whose hands the autobiography memoirs and journals of lord byron were placed with this view  the following note from shelton mackenzie in the june number of the noctes 1824 says     at that time had he been so minded maginn odoherty could have got    up a popular life of byron as well as most men in england  immediately    on the account of byrons death being received in london john murray    proposed that maginn should bring out memoirs journals and letters    of lord byron and with this intent placed in his hand every line    that he murray possessed in byrons handwriting      the strong    desire of byrons family and executors that the autobiography should    be burned to which desire murray foolishly yielded made such an    hiatus in the materials that murray and maginn agreed it would not    answer to bring out the work then  eventually moore executed it  the character of the times in which this work was to be undertaken will appear from the following note of mackenzies to the noctes of august 1824 which we copy with the authors own italics     in the blackwood of july 1824 was a poetical epistle by the    renowned timothy tickler to the editor of the john bull magazine on    an article in his first number  this article    professed to be a    portion of the veritable autobiography of byron which was burned    and was called my wedding night  it appeared to relate in detail    everything that occurred in the twentyfour hours immediately    succeeding that in which byron was married  it had plenty of    coarseness and some to spare  it went into particulars such as    hitherto had been given only by faublas and it had notwithstanding    many phrases and some facts which evidently did not belong to a mere    fabricator  some years after i compared this wedding night with    what i had all assurance of having been transcribed from the actual    manuscripts of byron and was persuaded that the magazinewriter must    have had the actual statement before him or have had a perusal of it    the writer in blackwood declared his conviction that it really was    byrons own writing  the reader must remember that lord byron died april 1824 so that according to this his autobiography was made the means of this gross insult to his widow three months after his death  if some powerful cause had not paralysed all feelings of gentlemanly honour and of womanly delicacy and of common humanity towards lady byron throughout the whole british nation no editor would have dared to open a periodical with such an article or if he had he would have been overwhelmed with a storm of popular indignation which like the fire upon sodom would have made a pillar of salt of him for a warning to all future generations  blackwood reproves the john bull in a poetical epistle recognising the article as coming from byron and says to the author     but that you sir a wit and a scholar like you    should not blush to produce what he blushed not to do    take your compliment youngster this doubles almost    the sorrow that rose when his honour was lost  we may not wonder that the autobiography was burned as murray says in a recent account by a committee of byrons friends including hobhouse his sister and murray himself  now the blackwood of july 1824 thus declares its conviction that this outrage on every sentiment of human decency came from lord byron and that his honour was lost  maginn does not undertake the memoir  no memoir at all is undertaken till finally moore is selected as like demetrius of old a wellskilled gilder and maker of silver shrines though not for diana  to moore is committed the task of doing his best for this battered image in which even the worshippers recognise foul sulphurous cracks but which they none the less stand ready to worship as a genuine article that fell down from jupiter  moore was a man of no particular nicety as to moralities but in that matter seems not very much below what this record shows his average associates to be  he is so far superior to maginn that his vice is rose coloured and refined  he does not burst out with such heroic stanzas as maginns frank invitation to jeremy bentham     jeremy throw your pen aside       and come get drunk with me    and well go where bacchus sits astride       perched high on barrels three  moores vice is cautious soft seductive slippery and covered at times with a thin tremulous veil of religious sentimentalism  in regard to byron he was an unscrupulous committed partisan he was as much bewitched by him as ever man has been by woman and therefore to him at last the task of editing byrons memoirs was given  this byron whom they all knew to be obscene beyond what even their most drunken tolerance could at first endure this man whose foul license spoke out what most men conceal from mere respect to the decent instincts of humanity whose honour was lostwas submitted to this careful manipulator to be turned out a perfected idol for a world longing for an idol as the israelites longed for the calf in horeb  the image was to be invested with deceitful glories and shifting haloesadmitted faults spoken of as peculiarities of sacred originand the world given to understand that no common rule or measure could apply to such an undoubtedly divine production and so the hearts of men were to be wrung with pity for his sorrows as the yearning pain of a god and with anger at his injuries as sacrilege on the sacredness of genius till they were ready to cast themselves at his feet and adore  then he was to be set up on a pedestal like nebuchadnezzars image on the plains of dura and what time the world heard the sound of cornet sackbut and dulcimer in his enchanting verse they were to fall down and worship  for lady byron moore had simply the respect that a commoner has for a lady of rank and a good deal of the feeling that seems to underlie all english literaturethat it is no matter what becomes of the woman when the mans story is to be told  but with all his faults moore was not a cruel man and we cannot conceive such outrageous cruelty and ungentlemanly indelicacy towards an unoffending woman as he shows in these memoirs without referring them to lord byrons own influence in making him an unscrupulous committed partisan on his side  so little pity so little sympathy did he suppose lady byron to be worthy of that he laid before her in the sight of all the world selections from her husbands letters and journals in which the privacies of her courtship and married life were jested upon with a vulgar levity letters filled from the time of the act of separation with a constant succession of sarcasms stabs stings epigrams and vindictive allusions to herself bringing her into direct and insulting comparison with his various mistresses and implying their superiority over her  there too were gross attacks on her father and mother as having been the instigators of the separation and poor lady milbanke in particular is sometimes mentioned with epithets so offensive that the editor prudently covers the terms with stars as intending language too gross to be printed  the last mistress of lord byron is uniformly brought forward in terms of such respect and consideration that one would suppose that the usual moral laws that regulate english family life had been specially repealed in his favour  moore quotes with approval letters from shelley stating that lord byrons connection with la guiccioli has been of inestimable benefit to him and that he is now becoming what he should be a virtuous man  moore goes on to speak of the connection as one though somewhat reprehensible yet as having all those advantages of marriage and settled domestic ties that byrons affectionate spirit had long sighed for but never before found and in his last resume of the poets character at the end of the volume he brings the mistress into direct comparison with the wife in a single sentence the woman to whom he gave the love of his maturer years idolises his name and with a single unhappy exception scarce an instance is to be found of one brought   into relations of amity with him who did not retain a kind regard for him in life and a fondness for his memory  literature has never yet seen the instance of a person of lady byrons rank in life placed before the world in a position more humiliating to womanly dignity or wounding to womanly delicacy  the direct implication is that she has no feelings to be hurt no heart to be broken and is not worthy even of the consideration which in ordinary life is to be accorded to a widow who has received those awful tidings which generally must awaken many emotions and call for some consideration even in the most callous hearts  the woman who we are told walked the room vainly striving to control the sobs that shook her frame while she sought to draw from the servant that last message of her husband which she was never to hear was not thought worthy even of the rights of common humanity  the first volume of the memoir came out in 1830  then for the first time came one flash of lightning from the silent cloud and she who had never spoken before spoke out  the libels on the memory of her dead parents drew from her what her own wrongs never did  during all this time while her husband had been keeping her effigy dangling before the public as a mark for solemn curses and filthy lampoons and secretly circulated disclosures that spared no sacredness and violated every decorum she had not uttered a word  she had been subjected to nameless insults discussed in the assemblies of drunkards and challenged to speak for herself  like the chaste lady in comus whom the vile wizard had bound in the enchanted seat to be grinned at and chattered at by all the filthy rabble of his dehumanised rout she had remained pure lofty and undefiled and the stains of mud and mire thrown upon her had fallen from her spotless garments  now that she is dead a recent writer in the london quarterly dares give voice to an insinuation which even byron gave only a suggestion of when he called his wife clytemnestra and hints that she tried the power of youth and beauty to win to her the young solicitor lushington and a handsome young officer of high rank  at this time such insinuations had not been thought of and the only and chief allegation against lady byron had been a cruel severity of virtue  at all events when lady byron spoke the world listened with respect and believed what she said  here let us too read her statement and give it the careful attention she solicits moores life of byron vol vi p275     i have disregarded various publications in which facts within my own    knowledge have been grossly misrepresented but i am called upon to    notice some of the erroneous statements proceeding from one who claims    to be considered as lord byrons confidential and authorised friend    domestic details ought not to be intruded on the public attention if    however they are so intruded the persons affected by them have a    right to refute injurious charges  mr moore has promulgated his own    impressions of private events in which i was most nearly concerned as    if he possessed a competent knowledge of the subject  having survived    lord byron i feel increased reluctance to advert to any circumstances    connected with the period of my marriage nor is it now my intention    to disclose them further than may be indispensably requisite for the    end i have in view  selfvindication is not the motive which actuates    me to make this appeal and the spirit of accusation is unmingled with    it but when the conduct of my parents is brought forward in a    disgraceful light by the passages selected from lord byrons letters    and by the remarks of his biographer i feel bound to justify their    characters from imputations which i know to be false  the passages    from lord byrons letters to which i refer arethe aspersion on my    mothers character p648 l4 70a my child is very well and    flourishing i hear but i must see also  i feel no disposition to    resign it to the contagion of its grandmothers society  the    assertion of her dishonourable conduct in employing a spy p645 l7    etc a mrs c now a kind of housekeeper and spy of lady ns    who in her better days was a washerwoman is supposed to beby the    learnedvery much the occult cause of our domestic discrepancies    the seeming exculpation of myself in the extract p646 with the    words immediately following it her nearest relations are a    where the blank clearly implies something too offensive for    publication  these passages tend to throw suspicion on my parents    and give reason to ascribe the separation either to their direct    agency or to that of officious spies employed by them 70b  from    the following part of the narrative p642 it must also be inferred    that an undue influence was exercised by them for the accomplishment    of this purpose it was in a few weeks after the latter communication    between us lord byron and mr moore that lady byron adopted the    determination of parting from him  she had left london at the latter    end of january on a visit to her fathers house in leicestershire    and lord byron was in a short time to follow her  they had parted in    the utmost kindness she wrote him a letter full of playfulness and    affection on the road and immediately on her arrival at kirkby    mallory her father wrote to acquaint lord byron that she would return    to him no more     in my observations upon this statement i shall as far as possible    avoid touching on any matters relating personally to lord byron and    myself  the facts arei left london for kirkby mallory the    residence of my father and mother on the 15th of january 1816  lord    byron had signified to me in writing jan 6 his absolute desire that    i should leave london on the earliest day that i could conveniently    fix  it was not safe for me to undertake the fatigue of a journey    sooner than the 15th  previously to my departure it had been    strongly impressed on my mind that lord byron was under the influence    of insanity  this opinion was derived in a great measure from the    communications made to me by his nearest relatives and personal    attendant who had more opportunities than myself of observing him    during the latter part of my stay in town  it was even represented to    me that he was in danger of destroying himself  with the concurrence    of his family i had consulted dr baillie as a friend jan 8    respecting this supposed malady  on acquainting him with the state of    the case and with lord byrons desire that i should leave london dr    baillie thought that my absence might be advisable as an experiment    assuming the fact of mental derangement for dr baillie not having    had access to lord byron could not pronounce a positive opinion on    that point  he enjoined that in correspondence with lord byron i    should avoid all but light and soothing topics  under these    impressions i left london determined to follow the advice given by    dr baillie  whatever might have been the nature of lord byrons    conduct towards me from the time of my marriage yet supposing him to    be in a state of mental alienation it was not for me nor for any    person of common humanity to manifest at that moment a sense of    injury  on the day of my departure and again on my arrival at kirkby    jan 16 i wrote to lord byron in a kind and cheerful tone    according to those medical directions     the last letter was circulated and employed as a pretext for the    charge of my having been subsequently influenced to desert 72 my    husband  it has been argued that i parted from lord byron in perfect    harmony that feelings incompatible with any deep sense of injury had    dictated the letter which i addressed to him and that my sentiments    must have been changed by persuasion and interference when i was under    the roof of my parents  these assertions and inferences are wholly    destitute of foundation  when i arrived at kirkby mallory my parents    were unacquainted with the existence of any causes likely to destroy    my prospects of happiness and when i communicated to them the    opinion which had been formed concerning lord byrons state of mind    they were most anxious to promote his restoration by every means in    their power  they assured those relations who were with him in    london that they would devote their whole care and attention to the    alleviation of his malady and hoped to make the best arrangements    for his comfort if he could be induced to visit them     with these intentions my mother wrote on the 17th to lord byron    inviting him to kirkby mallory  she had always treated him with an    affectionate consideration and indulgence which extended to every    little peculiarity of his feelings  never did an irritating word    escape her lips in her whole intercourse with him  the accounts given    me after i left lord byron by the persons in constant intercourse    with him added to those doubts which had before transiently occurred    to my mind as to the reality of the alleged disease and the reports    of his medical attendant were far from establishing the existence of    anything like lunacy  under this uncertainty i deemed it right to    communicate to my parents that if i were to consider lord byrons    past conduct as that of a person of sound mind nothing could induce    me to return to him  it therefore appeared expedient both to them    and myself to consult the ablest advisers  for that object and also    to obtain still further information respecting the appearances which    seemed to indicate mental derangement my mother determined to go to    london  she was empowered by me to take legal opinions on a written    statement of mine though i had then reasons for reserving a part of    the case from the knowledge even of my father and mother  being    convinced by the result of these inquiries and by the tenor of lord    byrons proceedings that the notion of insanity was an illusion i no    longer hesitated to authorise such measures as were necessary in order    to secure me from being ever again placed in his power  conformably    with this resolution my father wrote to him on the 2nd of february to    propose an amicable separation  lord byron at first rejected this    proposal but when it was distinctly notified to him that if he    persisted in his refusal recourse must be had to legal measures he    agreed to sign a deed of separation  upon applying to dr lushington    who was intimately acquainted with all the circumstances to state in    writing what he recollected upon this subject i received from him the    following letter by which it will be manifest that my mother cannot    have been actuated by any hostile or ungenerous motives towards lord    byron     my dear lady byroni can rely upon the accuracy of my memory for    the following statement  i was originally consulted by lady noel on    your behalf whilst you were in the country  the circumstances    detailed by her were such as justified a separation but they were not    of that aggravated description as to render such a measure    indispensable  on lady noels representation i deemed a    reconciliation with lord byron practicable and felt most sincerely a    wish to aid in effecting it  there was not on lady noels part any    exaggeration of the facts nor so far as i could perceive any    determination to prevent a return to lord byron certainly none was    expressed when i spoke of a reconciliation  when you came to town in    about a fortnight or perhaps more after my first interview with lady    noel i was for the first time informed by you of facts utterly    unknown as i have no doubt to sir ralph and lady noel  on receiving    this additional information my opinion was entirely changed i    considered a reconciliation impossible  i declared my opinion and    added that if such an idea should be entertained i could not    either professionally or otherwise take any part towards effecting    it                           believe me very faithfully yours                                steph lushington     great george street jan 31 1830     i have only to observe that if the statements on which my legal    advisers the late sir samuel romilly and dr lushington formed their    opinions were false the responsibility and the odium should rest with    me only  i trust that the facts which i have here briefly    recapitulated will absolve my father and mother from all accusations    with regard to the part they took in the separation between lord byron    and myself     they neither originated instigated nor advised that separation and    they cannot be condemned for having afforded to their daughter the    assistance and protection which she claimed  there is no other near    relative to vindicate their memory from insult  i am therefore    compelled to break the silence which i had hoped always to observe    and to solicit from the readers of lord byrons life an impartial    consideration of the testimony extorted from me                                     a i noel byron     hanger hill feb 19 1830  the effect of this statement on the literary world may be best judged by the discussion of it by christopher north wilson in the succeeding may number of the noctes where the bravest and most generous of literary men that then werehimself the husband of a gentle wifethus gives sentence the conversation is between north and the shepherd     northgod forbid i should wound the feelings of lady byron of    whose character known to me but by the high estimation in which it is    held by all who have enjoyed her friendship i have always spoken with    respect     but may i without harshness or indelicacy say here    among ourselves james that by marrying byron she took upon    herself with eyes wide open and conscience clearly convinced duties    very different from those of which even in common cases the    presaging foresight shadows   the light of the first nuptial moon     shepherdshe did that sir by my troth she did that                                                          northmiss milbanke knew that he was reckoned a rake and a roue    and although his genius wiped off by impassioned eloquence in love    letters that were felt to be irresistible or hid the worst stain of    that reproach still miss milbanke must have believed it a perilous    thing to be the wife of lord byron     but still by joining her    life to his in marriage she pledged her troth and her faith and her    love under probabilities of severe disturbing perhaps fearful    trials in the future        but i think lady byron ought not to have printed that narrative    death abrogates not the rights of a husband to his wifes silence when    speech is fatal   to his character as a man  has she not flung    suspicion over his bones interred that they are the bones of    amonster     if byrons sins or crimesfor we are driven to use    terrible termswere unendurable and unforgivable as if against the    holy ghost ought the wheel the rack or the stake to have extorted    that confession from his widows breast     but there was no such    pain here james the declaration was voluntary and it was calm  self    collected and gathering up all her faculties and feelings into    unshrinking strength she denounced before all the worldand    throughout all space and all timeher husband as excommunicated by    his vices from womans bosom                                                          twas to vindicate the character of her parents that lady byron    wrotea holy purpose and devout nor do i doubt sincere  but filial    affection and reverence sacred as they are may be blamelessly nay    righteously subordinate to conjugal duties which die not with the    dead are extinguished not even by the sins of the dead were they as    foul as the graves corruption  here is what john stuart mill calls the literature of slavery for woman in length and breadth and that all women may understand the doctrine the shepherd now takes up his parable and expounds the true position of the wife  we render his scotch into english     not a few such widows do i know whom brutal profligate and savage    husbands have brought to the brink of the graveas good as bright    as innocent as and far more forgiving than lady byron  there they    sit in their obscure rarelyvisited dwellings for sympathy    instructed by suffering knows well that the deepest and most hopeless    misery is least given to complaint  then follows a pathetic picture of one such widow trembling and fainting for hunger obliged on her way to the well for a can of water her only drink to sit down on a knowe and say a prayer     yet shes decently yea tidily dressed poor creature in sair worn    widows clothes a single suit for saturday and sunday her hair    untimely gray is neatly braided under her crape cap and sometimes    when all is still and solitary in the fields and all labour has    disappeared into the house you may see her stealing by herself or    leading one wee orphan by the hand with another at her breast to the    kirkyard where the love of her youth and the husband of her prime is    buried     yet says the shepherd he was a brute a ruffian a monster  when    drunk how he raged and cursed and swore  often did she dread that    in his fits of inhuman passion he would have murdered the baby at her    breast for she had seen him dash their only little boy a child of    eight years old on the floor till the blood gushed from his ears    and then the madman threw himself down on the body and howled for the    gallows  limmers haunted his door and he theirs and it was hers to    lie not sleep in a cold forsaken bed once the bed of peace    affection and perfect happiness  often he struck her and once when    she was pregnant with that very orphan now smiling on her breast    reaching out his wee fingers to touch the flowers on his fathers    grave        but she tries to smile among the neighbours and speaks of her boys    likeness to its father nor when the conversation turns on bygone    times does she fear to let his name escape her white lips my    robert the bairns not illfavoured but he will never look like his    fatherand such sayings uttered in a calm sweet voice  nay i    remember once how her pale countenance reddened with a sudden flush of    pride when a gossiping crone alluded to their wedding and the    widows eye brightened through her tears to hear how the bridegroom    sitting that sabbath in his front seat beside his bonny bride had not    his equal for strength stature and all that is beauty in man in all    the congregation  that i say sir whether right or wrong    wasforgiveness  here is a specimen of how even generous men had been so perverted by the enchantment of lord byrons genius as to turn all the pathos and power of the strongest literature of that day against the persecuted pure woman and for the strong wicked man  these blackwood writers knew by byrons own filthy ghastly writings which had gone sorely against their own moral stomachs that he was foul to the bone  they could see in moores memoirs right before them how he had caught an innocent girls heart by sending a loveletter and offer of marriage at the end of a long friendly correspondencea letter that had been written to show to his libertine set and sent on the tossup of a copper because he cared nothing for it one way or the other  they admit that having won this poor girl he had been savage brutal drunken cruel  they had read the filthy taunts in don juan and the nameless abominations in the autobiography  they had admitted among themselves that his honour was lost but still this abused desecrated woman must reverence her brutal masters memory and not speak even to defend the grave of her own kind father and mother  that there was no lover of her youth that the marriagevow had been a hideous shameless cheat is on the face of moores account yet the blackwood does not see it nor feel it and brings up against lady byron this touching story of a poor widow who really had had a true lover oncea lover maddened imbruted lost through that very drunkenness in which the noctes club were always glorying  it is because of such transgressors as byron such supporters as moore and the noctes club that there are so many helpless cowering broken hearted abject women given over to the animal love which they share alike with the poor dogthe dog who beaten kicked starved and cuffed still lies by his drunken master with great anxious eyes of love and sorrow and with sweet brute forgiveness nestles upon his bosom as he lies in his filth in the snowy ditch to keep the warmth of life in him  great is the mystery of this fidelity in the poor loving brutemost mournful and most sacred  but oh that a noble man should have no higher ideal of the love of a highsouled heroic woman  oh that men should teach women that they owe no higher duties and are capable of no higher tenderness than this loving unquestioning animal fidelity  the dog is everloving everforgiving because god has given him no high range of moral faculties no sense of justice no consequent horror at impurity and vileness  much of the beautiful patience and forgiveness of women is made possible to them by that utter deadness to the sense of justice which the laws literature and misunderstood religion of england have sought to induce in woman as a special grace and virtue  the lesson to woman in this pathetic piece of special pleading is that man may sink himself below the brute may wallow in filth like the swine may turn his home into a hell beat and torture his children forsake the marriagebed for foul rivals yet all this does not dissolve the marriage vow on her part nor free his bounden serf from her obligation to honour his memorynay to sacrifice to it the honour due to a kind father and mother slandered in their silent graves  such was the sympathy and such the advice that the best literature of england could give to a young widow a peeress of england whose husband as they verily believed and admitted might have done worse than all this whose crimes might have been foul monstrous unforgivable as the sin against the holy ghost  if these things be done in the green tree what shall be done in the dry  if the peeress as a wife has no rights what is the state of the cotters wife  but in the same paper north again blames lady byron for not having come out with the whole story before the world at the time she separated from her husband  he says of the time when she first consulted counsel through her mother keeping back one item     how weak and worse than weak at such a juncture on which hung her    whole fate to ask legal advice on an imperfect document  give the    delicacy of a virtuous woman its due but at such a crisis when the    question was whether her conscience was to be free from the oath of    oaths delicacy should have died and nature was privileged to show    unashamedif such there werethe records of uttermost pollution     shepherdand what think ye sir that a this pollution could hae    been that sae electrified dr lushington     northbadbadbad james  nameless it is horrible named it    might leave byrons memory yet within the range of pity and    forgiveness and where they are their sister affections will not be    far though like weeping seraphs standing aloof and veiling their    wings     shepherdshe should indeed hae been silenttill the grave had    closed on her sorrows as on his sins     northeven now she should speakor some one else for her       and a few words will suffice  worse the condition of the dead mans    name cannot befar far better it mighti believe it would bewere    all the truth somehow or other declared and declared it must be not    for byrons sake only but for the sake of humanity itself and then a    mitigated sentence or eternal silence  we have another discussion of lady byrons duties in a further number of blackwood  the memoir being out it was proposed that there should be a complete annotation of byrons works gotten up and adorned for the further glorification of his memory with portraits of the various women whom he had delighted to honour  murray applied to lady byron for her portrait and was met with a cold decided negative  after reading all the particulars of byrons harem of mistresses and moores comparisons between herself and la guiccioli one might imagine reasons why a lady with proper selfrespect should object to appearing in this manner  one would suppose there might have been gentlemen who could well appreciate the motive of that refusal but it was only considered a new evidence that she was indifferent to her conjugal duties and wanting in that respect which christopher north had told her she owed a husbands memory though his crimes were foul as the rottenness of the grave  never since queen vashti refused to come at the command of a drunken husband to show herself to his drunken lords was there a clearer case of disrespect to the marital dignity on the part of a wife  it was a plain act of insubordination rebellion against law and order and how shocking in lady byron who ought to feel herself but too much flattered to be exhibited to the public as the head wife of a man of genius  means were at once adopted to subdue her contumacy of which one may read in a note to the blackwood noctes september 1832  an artist was sent down to ealing to take her picture by stealth as she sat in church two sittings were thus obtained without her knowledge  in the third one the artist placed himself boldly before her and sketched so that she could not but observe him  we shall give the rest in mackenzies own words as a remarkable specimen of the obtuseness not to say indelicacy of feeling which seemed to pervade the literary circles of england at the time     after prayers wright and his friend the artist were visited by an    ambassador from her ladyship to inquire the meaning of what she had    seen  the reply was that mr murray must have her portrait and was    compelled to take what she refused to give  the result was wright    was requested to visit her which he did taking with him not the    sketch which was very good but another in which there was a strong    touch of caricature  rather than allow that to appear as her likeness    a very natural and womanly feeling by the way she consented to sit    for the portrait to w j newton which was engraved and is here    alluded to  the artless barbarism of this note is too good to be lost but it is quite borne out by the conversation in the noctes club which it illustrates  it would appear from this conversation that these byron beauties appeared successively in pamphlet form and the picture of lady byron is thus discussed     mullioni dont know if you have seen the last brochure  it has a    charming head of lady byron who it seems sat on purpose and thats    very agreeable to hear of for it shows her ladyship has got over any    little soreness that moores life occasioned and is now willing to    contribute anything in her power to the real monument of byrons    genius     northi am delighted to hear of this tis really very noble in the    unfortunate lady  i never saw her  is the face a striking one     mullioneminently soa most calm pensive melancholy style of    native beautyand a most touching contrast to the maids of athens    annesley and all the rest of them  im sure youll have the proof    finden has sent you framed for the boudoir at the lodge     northby all means  i mean to do that for all the byron beauties  but it may be asked was there not a man in all england with delicacy enough to feel for lady byron and chivalry enough to speak a bold word for her  yes there was one  thomas campbell the poet when he read lady byrons statement believed it as did christopher north but it affected him differently  it appears he did not believe it a wifes duty to burn herself on her husbands funeralpile as did christopher north and held the singular idea that a wife had some rights as a human being as well as a husband  lady byrons own statement appeared in pamphlet form in 1830 at least such is the date at the foot of the document  thomas campbell in the new monthly magazine shortly after printed a spirited gentlemanly defence of lady byron and administered a pointed rebuke to moore for the rudeness and indelicacy he had shown in selecting from byrons letters the coarsest against herself her parents and her old governess mrs clermont and by the indecent comparisons he had instituted between lady byron and lord byrons last mistress  it is refreshing to hear at last from somebody who is not altogether on his knees at the feet of the popular idol and who has some chivalry for woman and some idea of common humanity  he says     i found my right to speak on this painful subject on its now    irrevocable publicity brought up afresh as it has been by mr moore    to be the theme of discourse to millions and if i err not much the    cause of misconception to innumerable minds  i claim to speak of lady    byron in the right of a man and of a friend to the rights of woman    and to liberty and to natural religion  i claim a right more    especially as one of the many friends of lady byron who one and    all feel aggrieved by this production  it has virtually dragged her    forward from the shade of retirement where she had hid her sorrows    and compelled her to defend the heads of her friends and her parents    from being crushed under the tombstone of byron  nay in a general    view it has forced her to defend herself though with her true sense    and her pure taste she stands above all special pleading  to plenary    explanation she ought notshe never shall be driven  mr moore is    too much a gentleman not to shudder at the thought of that but if    other byronists of a far different stamp were to force the savage    ordeal it is her enemies and not she that would have to dread the    burning ploughshares     we her friends have no wish to prolong the discussion but a few    words we must add even to her admirable statement for hers is a    cause not only dear to her friends but having become from mr moore    and her misfortunes a publiclyagitated cause it concerns morality    and the most sacred rights of the sex that she should and that too    without more special explanations be acquitted out and out and    honourably acquitted in this business of all share in the blame    which is one and indivisible  mr moore on further reflection may    see this and his return to candour will surprise us less than his    momentary deviation from its path     for the tact of mr moores conduct in this affair i have not to    answer but if indelicacy be charged upon me i scorn the charge    neither will i submit to be called lord byrons accuser because a    word against him i wish not to say beyond what is painfully wrung from    me by the necessity of owning or illustrating lady byrons    unblamableness and of repelling certain misconceptions respecting    her which are now walking the fashionable world and which have been    fostered though heaven knows where they were born most delicately    and warily by the christian godfathership of mr moore     i write not at lady byrons bidding  i have never humiliated either    her or myself by asking if i should write or what i should write    that is to say i never applied to her for information against lord    byron though i was justified as one intending to criticise mr    moore in inquiring into the truth of some of his statements  neither    will i suffer myself to be called her champion if by that word be    meant the advocate of her mere legal innocence for that i take it    nobody questions     still less is it from the sorry impulse of pity that i speak of this    noble woman for i look with wonder and even envy at the proud purity    of her sense and conscience that have carried her exquisite    sensibilities in triumph through such poignant tribulations  but i am    proud to be called her friend the humble illustrator of her cause    and the advocate of those principles which make it to me more    interesting than lord byrons  lady byron if the subject must be    discussed belongs to sentiment and morality at least as much as lord    byron nor is she to be suffered when compelled to speak to raise    her voice as in a desert with no friendly voice to respond to her    lady byron could not have outlived her sufferings if she had not wound    up her fortitude to the high point of trusting mainly for consolation    not to the opinion of the world but to her own inward peace and    having said what ought to convince the world i verily believe that    she has less care about the fashionable opinion respecting her than    any of her friends can have  but we her friends mix with the world    and we hear offensive absurdities about her which we have a right to    put down                                                          i proceed to deal more generally with mr moores book  you speak    mr moore against lord byrons censurers in a tone of indignation    which is perfectly lawful towards calumnious traducers but which will    not terrify me or any other man of courage who is no calumniator    from uttering his mind freely with regard to this part of your heros    conduct  i question your philosophy in assuming that all that is    noble in byrons poetry was inconsistent with the possibility of his    being devoted to a pure and good woman and i repudiate your morality    for canting too complacently about the lava of his imagination and    the unsettled fever of his passions being any excuses for his    planting the tic douloureux of domestic suffering in a meek womans    bosom     these are hard words mr moore but you have brought them on    yourself by your voluntary ignorance of facts known to me for you    might and ought to have known both sides of the question and if the    subject was too delicate for you to consult lady byrons confidential    friends you ought to have had nothing to do with the subject  but    you cannot have submitted your book even to lord byrons sister    otherwise she would have set you right about the imaginary spy mrs    clermont  campbell now goes on to print at his own peril he says and without time to ask leave the following note from lady byron in reply to an application he made to her when he was about to review moores book for an estimate as to the correctness of moores statements  the following is lady byrons reply     dear mr campbellin taking up my pen to point out for your private    information 86 those passages in mr moores representation of my    part of the story which were open to contradiction i find them of    still greater extent than i had supposed and to deny an assertion    here and there would virtually admit the truth of the rest  if on    the contrary i were to enter into a full exposure of the falsehood of    the views taken by mr moore i must detail various matters which    consistently with my principles and feelings i cannot under the    existing circumstances disclose  i may perhaps convince you better    of the difficulty of the case by an example it is not true that    pecuniary embarrassments were the cause of the disturbed state of lord    byrons mind or formed the chief reason for the arrangements made by    him at that time  but is it reasonable for me to expect that you or    any one else should believe this unless i show you what were the    causes in question and this i cannot do                          i am etc                                      a i noel byron  campbell then goes on to reprove moore for his injustice to mrs clermont whom lord byron had denounced as a spy but whose respectability and innocence were vouched for by lord byrons own family and then he pointedly rebukes one false statement of great indelicacy and cruelty concerning lady byrons courtship as follows     it is a further mistake on mr moores part and i can prove it to be    so if proof be necessary to represent lady byron in the course of    their courtship as one inviting her future husband to correspondence    by letters after she had at first refused him  she never proposed a    correspondence  on the contrary he sent her a message after that    first refusal stating that he meant to go abroad and to travel for    some years in the east that he should depart with a heart aching but    not angry and that he only begged a verbal assurance that she had    still some interest in his happiness  could miss milbanke as a well    bred woman refuse a courteous answer to such a message  she sent him    a verbal answer which was merely kind and becoming but which    signified no encouragement that he should renew his offer of marriage     after that message he wrote to her a most interesting letter about    himselfabout his views personal moral and religiousto which    it would have been uncharitable not to have replied  the result was    an insensibly increasing correspondence which ended in her being    devotedly attached to him  about that time i occasionally saw lord    byron and though i knew less of him than mr moore yet i suspect i    knew as much of him as miss milbanke then knew  at that time he was    so pleasing that if i had had a daughter with ample fortune and    beauty i should have trusted her in marriage with lord byron     mr moore at that period evidently understood lord byron better than    either his future bride or myself but this speaks more for moores    shrewdness than for byrons ingenuousness of character     it is more for lord byrons sake than for his widows that i resort    not to a more special examination of mr moores misconceptions  the    subject would lead me insensibly into hateful disclosures against poor    lord byron who is more unfortunate in his rash defenders than in his    reluctant accusers  happily his own candour turns our hostility from    himself against his defenders  it was only in wayward and bitter    remarks that he misrepresented lady byron  he would have defended    himself irresistibly if mr moore had left only his acknowledging    passages  but mr moore has produced a life of him which reflects    blame on lady byron so dexterously that more is meant than meets the    ear  the almost universal impression produced by his book is that    lady byron must be a precise and a wan unwarming spirit a    bluestocking of chilblained learning a piece of insensitive    goodness     who that knows lady byron will not pronounce her to be everything the    reverse  will it be believed that this person so unsuitably matched    to her moody lord has written verses that would do no discredit to    byron himself that her sensitiveness is surpassed and bounded only by    her good sense and that she is     blest with a temper whose unclouded ray    can make tomorrow cheerful as today     she brought to lord byron beauty manners fortune meekness    romantic affection and everything that ought to have made her to the    most transcendent man of geniushad he been what he should have    beenhis pride and his idol  i speak not of lady byron in the    commonplace manner of attesting character i appeal to the gifted mrs    siddons and joanna baillie to lady charlemont and to other ornaments    of their sex whether i am exaggerating in the least when i say that    in their whole lives they have seen few beings so intellectual and    welltempered as lady byron     i wish to be as ingenuous as possible in speaking of her  her    manner i have no hesitation to say is cool at the first interview    but is modestly and not insolently cool she contracted it i    believe from being exposed by her beauty and large fortune in youth    to numbers of suitors whom she could not have otherwise kept at a    distance  but this manner could have had no influence with lord    byron for it vanishes on nearer acquaintance and has no origin in    coldness  all her friends like her frankness the better for being    preceded by this reserve  this manner however though not the    slightest apology for lord byron has been inimical to lady byron in    her misfortunes  it endears her to her friends but it piques the    indifferent  most odiously unjust therefore is mr moores    assertion that she has had the advantage of lord byron in public    opinion  she is comparatively speaking unknown to the world for    though she has many friends that is a friend in everyone who knows    her yet her pride and purity and misfortunes naturally contract the    circle of her acquaintance     there is something exquisitely unjust in mr moore comparing her    chance of popularity with lord byrons the poet who can command men    of talentsputting even mr moore into the livery of his    serviceand who has suborned the favour of almost all women by the    beauty of his person and the voluptuousness of his verses  lady byron    has nothing to oppose to these fascinations but the truth and justice    of her cause     you said mr moore that lady byron was unsuitable to her lord the    word is cunningly insidious and may mean as much or as little as may    suit your convenience  but if she was unsuitable i remark that it    tells all the worse against lord byron  i have not read it in your    book for i hate to wade through it but they tell me that you have    not only warily depreciated lady byron but that you have described a    lady that would have suited him  if this be true it is the    unkindest cut of allto hold up a florid description of a woman    suitable to lord byron as if in mockery over the forlorn flower of    virtue that was drooping in the solitude of sorrow     but i trust there is no such passage in your book  surely you must    be conscious of your woman with her virtue loose about her who    would have suited lord byron to be as imaginary a being as the woman    without a head  a woman to suit lord byron  poo poo  i could paint    to you the woman that could have matched him if i had not bargained    to say as little as possible against him     if lady byron was not suitable to lord byron so much the worse for    his lordship for let me tell you mr moore that neither your    poetry nor lord byrons nor all our poetry put together ever    delineated a more interesting being than the woman whom you have so    coldly treated  this was not kicking the dead lion but wounding the    living lamb who was already bleeding and shorn even unto the quick    i know that collectively speaking the world is in lady byrons    favour but it is coldly favourable and you have not warmed its    breath  time however cures everything and even your book mr    moore may be the means of lady byrons character being better    appreciated                                    thomas campbell  here is what seems to be a gentlemanly highspirited chivalric man throwing down his glove in the lists for a pure woman  what was the consequence  campbell was crowded back thrust down overwhelmed his eyes filled with dust his mouth with ashes  there was a general confusion and outcry which reacted both on him and on lady byron  her friends were angry with him for having caused this re action upon her and he found himself at once attacked by lady byrons enemies and deserted by her friends  all the literary authorities of his day took up against him with energy  christopher north professor of moral philosophy in the edinburgh university in a fatherly talk in the noctes condemns campbell and justifies moore and heartily recommends his biography as containing nothing materially objectionable on the score either of manners or morals  thus we have it in the noctes of may 1830     mr moores biographical book i admired and i said so to my little    world in two somewhat lengthy articles which many approved and    some i am sorry to know condemned  on the point in question between moore and campbell north goes on to justify moore altogether only admitting that it would have been better had he not printed any coarse expression of byrons about the old people and finally he closes by saying     i do not think that under the circumstances mr campbell himself    had he written byrons life could have spoken with the sentiments    he then held in a better more manly and more gentlemanly spirit in    so far as regards lady byron than mr moore did and i am sorry he    has been deterred from swimming through mr moores work by the fear    of wading for the waters are clear and deep nor is there any mud    either at the bottom or round the margin  of the conduct of lady byrons socalled friends on this occasion it is more difficult to speak  there has always been in england as john stuart mill says a class of women who glory in the utter selfabnegation of the wife to the husband as the special crown of womanhood  their patron saint is the griselda of chaucer who when her husband humiliates her and treats her as a brute still accepts all with meek unquestioning uncomplaining devotion  he tears her from her children he treats her with personal abuse he repudiates hersends her out to nakedness and poverty he installs another mistress in his house and sends for the first to be her handmaid and his own and all this the meek saint accepts in the words of milton        my guide and head    what thou hast said is just and right  accordingly miss martineau tells us that when campbells defence came out coupled with a note from lady byron     the first obvious remark was that there was no real disclosure and    the whole affair had the appearance of a desire on the part of lady    byron to exculpate herself while yet no adequate information was    given  many who had regarded her with favour till then gave her up    so far as to believe that feminine weakness had prevailed at last  the saint had fallen from her pedestal she had shown a human frailty quite evidently she is not a griselda but possessed with a shocking desire to exculpate herself and her friends  is it then only to slandered men that the privilege belongs of desiring to exculpate themselves and their families and their friends from unjust censure  lord byron had made it a lifelong object to vilify and defame his wife he had used for that one particular purpose every talent that he possessed  he had left it as a last charge to moore to pursue the warfare after death which moore had done to some purpose and christopher north had informed lady byron that her private affairs were discussed not only with the whiskytoddy of the noctes club but in every drawingroom in may fair and declared that the dear duck letter and various other matters must be explained and urged somebody to speak and then when campbell does speak with all the energy of a real gentleman a general outcry and an indiscriminate melee is the result  the world with its usual injustice insisted on attributing campbells defence to lady byron  the reasons for this seemed to be first that campbell states that he did not ask lady byrons leave and that she did not authorise him to defend her and second that having asked some explanations from her he prints a note in which she declines to give any  we know not how a lady could more gently yet firmly decline to make a gentleman her confidant than in this published note of lady byron and yet to this day campbell is spoken of by the world as having been lady byrons confidant at this time  this simply shows how very trustworthy are the general assertions about lady byrons confidants  the final result of the matter so far as campbell was concerned is given in miss martineaus sketch in the following paragraph     the whole transaction was one of poor campbells freaks  he excused    himself by saying it was a mistake of his that he did not know what    he was about when he published the paper  it is the saddest of all sad things to see a man who has spoken from moral convictions in advance of his day and who has taken a stand for which he ought to honour himself thus forced down and humiliated made to doubt his own better nature and his own honourable feelings by the voice of a wicked world  campbell had no steadiness to stand by the truth he saw  his whole story is told incidentally in a note to the noctes in which it is stated that in an article in blackwood january 1825 on scotch poets the palm was given to hogg over campbell one ground being that he could drink eight and twenty tumblers of punch while campbell is hazy upon seven  there is evidence in the noctes that in due time campbell was reconciled to moore and was always suitably ashamed of having tried to be any more generous or just than the men of his generation  and so it was settled as a law to jacob and an ordinance in israel that the byron worship should proceed and that all the earth should keep silence before him  don juan that years before had been printed by stealth without murrays name on the titlepage that had been denounced as a book which no woman should read and had been given up as a desperate enterprise now came forth in triumph with banners flying and drums beating  every great periodical in england that had fired moral volleys of artillery against it in its early days now humbly marched in the glorious procession of admirers to salute this edifying work of genius  blackwood which in the beginning had been the most indignantly virtuous of the whole now grovelled and ate dust as the serpent in the very abjectness of submission  odoherty maginn declares that he would rather have written a page of don juan than a ton of childe harold 95a  timothy tickler informs christopher north that he means to tender murray as emperor of the north an interleaved copy 95b of don juan with illustrations as the only work of byrons he cares much about and christopher north professor of moral philosophy in edinburgh smiles approval  we are not after this surprised to see the assertion by a recent muchaggrieved writer in the london era that lord byron has been more than any other man of the age the teacher of the youth of england and that he has seen his works on the bookshelves of bishops palaces no less than on the tables of university undergraduates  a note to the noctes of july 1822 informs us of another instance of lord byrons triumph over english morals     the mention of this byrons going to greece reminds me by the    by of what the guiccioli said in her visit to london where she was    so lionised as having been the ladylove of byron  she was rather    fond of speaking on the subject designating herself by some venetian    pet phrase which she interpreted as meaning lovewife  what was lady byron to do in such a world  she retired to the deepest privacy and devoted herself to works of charity and the education of her only child that brilliant daughter to whose eager opening mind the whole course of current literature must bring so many trying questions in regard to the position of her father and motherquestions that the mother might not answer  that the cruel inconsiderateness of the literary world added thorns to the intricacies of the path trodden by every mother who seeks to guide restrain and educate a strong acute and precociously intelligent child must easily be seen  what remains to be said of lady byrons life shall be said in the words of miss martineau published in the atlantic monthly     her life thenceforth was one of unremitting bounty to society    administered with as much skill and prudence as benevolence  she    lived in retirement changing her abode frequently partly for the    benefit of her childs education and the promotion of her benevolent    schemes and partly from a restlessness which was one of the few signs    of injury received from the spoiling of associations with home     she felt a satisfaction which her friends rejoiced in when her    daughter married lord king at present the earl of lovelace in 1835    and when grief upon grief followed in the appearance of mortal    disease in her only child her quiet patience stood her in good stead    as before  she even found strength to appropriate the blessings of    the occasion and took comfort as did her dying daughter in the    intimate friendship which grew closer as the time of parting drew    nigh     lady lovelace died in 1852 and for her few remaining years lady    byron was devoted to her grandchildren  but nearer calls never    lessened her interest in remoter objects  her mind was of the large    and clear quality which could comprehend remote interests in their    true proportions and achieve each aim as perfectly as if it were the    only one  her agents used to say that it was impossible to mistake    her directions and thus her business was usually well done  there    was no room in her case for the ordinary doubts censures and    sneers about the misapplication of bounty     her taste did not lie in the charityball direction her funds were    not lavished in encouraging hypocrisy and improvidence among the idle    and worthless and the quality of her charity was in fact as    admirable as its quantity  her chief aim was the extension and    improvement of popular education but there was no kind of misery that    she heard of that she did not palliate to the utmost and no kind of    solace that her quick imagination and sympathy could devise that she    did not administer     in her methods she united consideration and frankness with singular    success  for one instance among a thousand a lady with whom she had    had friendly relations some time before and who became impoverished    in a quiet way by hopeless sickness preferred poverty with an easy    conscience to a competency attended by some uncertainty about the    perfect rectitude of the resource  lady byron wrote to an    intermediate person exactly what she thought of the case  whether the    judgment of the sufferer was right or mistaken was nobodys business    but her own this was the first point  next a voluntary poverty    could never be pitied by anybody that was the second  but it was    painful to others to think of the mortification to benevolent feelings    which attends poverty and there could be no objection to arresting    that pain  therefore she lady byron had lodged in a neighbouring    bank the sum of one hundred pounds to be used for benevolent    purposes and in order to preclude all outside speculation she had    made the money payable to the order of the intermediate person so    that the sufferers name need not appear at all     five and thirty years of unremitting secret bounty like this must    make up a great amount of human happiness but this was only one of a    wide variety of methods of doing good  it was the unconcealable    magnitude of her beneficence and its wise quality which made her a    second time the theme of english conversation in all honest households    within the four seas  years ago it was said far and wide that lady    byron was doing more good than anybody else in england and it was    difficult to imagine how anybody could do more     lord byron spent every shilling that the law allowed him out of her    property while he lived and left away from her every shilling that he    could deprive her of by his will yet she had eventually a large    income at her command  in the management of it she showed the same    wise consideration that marked all her practical decisions  she    resolved to spend her whole income seeing how much the world needed    help at the moment  her care was for the existing generation rather    than for a future one which would have its own friends  she usually    declined trammelling herself with annual subscriptions to charities    preferring to keep her freedom from year to year and to achieve    definite objects by liberal bounty rather than to extend partial help    over a large surface which she could not herself superintend     it was her first industrial school that awakened the admiration of    the public which had never ceased to take an interest in her while    sorely misjudging her character  we hear much nowand everybody    hears it with pleasureof the spread of education in common things    but long before miss coutts inherited her wealth long before a name    was found for such a method of training lady byron had instituted the    thing and put it in the way of making its own name     she was living at ealing in middlesex in 1834 and there she opened    one of the first industrial schools in england if not the very first    she sent out a master to switzerland to be instructed in de    fellenburghs method  she took on lease five acres of land and    spent several hundred pounds in rendering the buildings upon it fit    for the purposes of the school  a liberal education was afforded to    the children of artisans and labourers during the half of the day when    they were not employed in the field or garden  the allotments were    rented by the boys who raised and sold produce which afforded them a    considerable yearly profit if they were good workmen  those who    worked in the field earned wages their labour being paid by the hour    according to the capability of the young labourer  they kept their    accounts of expenditure and receipts and acquired good habits of    business while learning the occupation of their lives  some    mechanical trades were taught as well as the arts of agriculture     part of the wisdom of the management lay in making the pupils pay  of    one hundred pupils half were boarders  they paid little more than    half the expenses of their maintenance and the dayscholars paid    threepence per week  of course a large part of the expense was borne    by lady byron besides the payments she made for children who could    not otherwise have entered the school  the establishment flourished    steadily till 1852 when the owner of the land required it back for    building purposes  during the eighteen years that the ealing schools    were in action they did a world of good in the way of incitement and    example  the poorlaw commissioners pointed out their merits  land    owners and other wealthy persons visited them and went home and set    up similar establishments  during those years too lady byron had    herself been at work in various directions to the same purpose     a more extensive industrial scheme was instituted on her    leicestershire property and not far off she opened a girls school    and an infant school and when a season of distress came as such    seasons are apt to befall the poor leicestershire stockingweavers    lady byron fed the children for months together till they could    resume their payments  these schools were opened in 1840  the next    year she built a schoolhouse on her warwickshire property and five    years later she set up an iron schoolhouse on another leicestershire    estate     by this time her educational efforts were costing her several    hundred pounds a year in the mere maintenance of existing    establishments but this is the smallest consideration in the case    she has sent out tribes of boys and girls into life fit to do their    part there with skill and credit and comfort  perhaps it is a still    more important consideration that scores of teachers and trainers    have been led into their vocation and duly prepared for it by what    they saw and learned in her schools  as for the best and the worst of    the ealing boys the best have in a few cases been received into the    battersea training school whence they could enter on their career as    teachers to the greatest advantage and the worst found their school a    true reformatory before reformatory schools were heard of  at    bristol she bought a house for a reformatory for girls and there her    friend miss carpenter faithfully and energetically carries out her    own and lady byrons aims which were one and the same     there would be no end if i were to catalogue the schemes of which    these are a specimen  it is of more consequence to observe that her    mind was never narrowed by her own acts as the minds of benevolent    people are so apt to be  to the last her interest in great political    movements at home and abroad was as vivid as ever  she watched    every step won in philosophy every discovery in science every token    of social change and progress in every shape  her mind was as liberal    as her heart and hand  no diversity of opinion troubled her she was    respectful to every sort of individuality and indulgent to all    constitutional peculiarities  it must have puzzled those who kept up    the notion of her being straitlaced to see how indulgent she was    even to epicurean tendenciesthe remotest of all from her own     but i must stop for i do not wish my honest memorial to degenerate    into panegyric  among her latest known acts were her gifts to the    sicilian cause and her manifestations on behalf of the antislavery    cause in the united states  her kindness to william and ellen craft    must be well known there and it is also related in the newspapers    that she bequeathed a legacy to a young american to assist him under    any disadvantages he might suffer as an abolitionist     all these deeds were done under a heavy burden of ill health  before    she had passed middle life her lungs were believed to be irreparably    injured by partial ossification  she was subject to attacks so    serious that each one for many years was expected to be the last    she arranged her affairs in correspondence with her liabilities so    that the same order would have been found whether she died suddenly    or after long warning     she was to receive one more accession of outward greatness before she    departed  she became baroness wentworth in november 1856  this is    one of the facts of her history but it is the least interesting to    us as probably to her  we care more to know that her last days were    bright in honour and cheered by the attachment of old friends worthy    to pay the duty she deserved  above all it is consoling to know that    she who so long outlived her only child was blessed with the    unremitting and tender care of her granddaughter  she died on the    16th of may 1860     the portrait of lady byron as she was at the time of her marriage is    probably remembered by some of my readers  it is very engaging  her    countenance afterwards became much worn but its expression of    thoughtfulness and composure was very interesting  her handwriting    accorded well with the character of her mind  it was clear elegant    and womanly  her manners differed with circumstances  her shrinking    sensitiveness might embarrass one visitor while another would be    charmed with her easy significant and vivacious conversation  it    depended much on whom she talked with  the abiding certainty was    that she had strength for the hardest of human trials and the    composure which belongs to strength  for the rest it is enough to    point to her deeds and to the mourning of her friends round the chasm    which her departure has made in their life and in the society in    which it is spent  all that could be done in the way of personal love    and honour was done while she lived it only remains now to see that    her name and fame are permitted to shine forth at last in their proper    light  we have simply to ask the reader whether a life like this was not the best the noblest answer that a woman could make to a doubting world    chapter v  the attack on lady byrons grave   we have now brought the review of the antagonism against lady byron down to the period of her death  during all this time let the candid reader ask himself which of these two parties seems to be plotting against the other  which has been active aggressive unscrupulous which has been silent quiet unoffending  which of the two has laboured to make a party and to make that party active watchful enthusiastic  have we not proved that lady byron remained perfectly silent during lord byrons life patiently looking out from her retirement to see the waves of popular sympathy that once bore her up day by day retreating while his accusations against her were resounding in his poems over the whole earth  and after lord byrons death when all the world with one consent began to give their memorials of him and made it appear by their various recollections of conversations how incessantly he had obtruded his own version of the separation upon every listener did she manifest any similar eagerness  lady byron had seen the blackwood coming forward on the first appearance of don juan to rebuke the cowardly lampoon in words eloquent with all the unperverted vigour of an honest englishman  under the power of the great conspirator she had seen that blackwood become the very eager recipient and chief reporter of the stories against her and the blind admirer of her adversary  all this time she lost sympathy daily by being silent  the world will embrace those who court it it will patronise those who seek its favour it will make parties for those who seek to make parties but for the often accused who do not speak who make no confidants and no parties the world soon loses sympathy  when at last she spoke christopher north says she astonished the world  calm clear courageous exact as to time date and circumstance was that first testimony backed by the equally clear testimony of dr lushington  it showed that her secret had been kept even from her parents  in words precise firm and fearless she says if these statements on which dr lushington and sir samuel romilly formed their opinion were false the responsibility and the odium should rest with me only  christopher north did not pretend to disbelieve this statement  he breathed not a doubt of lady byrons word  he spoke of the crime indicated as one which might have been foul as the graves corruption unforgivable as the sin against the holy ghost  he rebuked the wife for bearing this testimony even to save the memory of her dead father and mother and in the same breath declared that she ought now to go farther and speak fully the one awful word and thena mitigated sentence or eternal silence  but lady byron took no counsel with the world nor with the literary men of her age  one knight with some small remnant of englands old chivalry set lance in rest for her she saw him beaten back unhorsed rolled in the dust and ingloriously vanquished and perceived that henceforth nothing but injury could come to any one who attempted to speak for her  she turned from the judgments of man and the fond and natural hopes of human nature to lose herself in sacred ministries to the downcast and suffering  what nobler record for woman could there be than that which miss martineau has given  particularly to be noted in lady byron was her peculiar interest in reclaiming fallen women  among her letters to mrs prof follen of cambridge was one addressed to a society of ladies who had undertaken this difficult work  it was full of heavenly wisdom and of a large and tolerant charity  fenelon truly says it is only perfection that can tolerate imperfection and the very purity of lady byrons nature made her most forbearing and most tender towards the weak and the guilty  this letter with all the rest of lady byrons was returned to the hands of her executors after her death  its publication would greatly assist the world in understanding the peculiarities of its writers character  lady byron passed to a higher life in 1860 105  after her death i looked for the publication of her memoir and letters as the event that should give her the same opportunity of being known and judged by her life and writings that had been so freely accorded to lord byron  she was in her husbands estimation a woman of genius  she was the friend of many of the first men and women of her times and corresponded with them on topics of literature morals religion and above all on the benevolent and philanthropic movements of the day whose principles she had studied with acute observation and in connection with which she had acquired a large experience  the knowledge of her necessarily diffused by such a series of letters would have created in america a comprehension of her character of itself sufficient to wither a thousand slanders  such a memoir was contemplated  lady byrons letters to mrs follen were asked for from boston and i was applied to by a person in england who i have recently learned is one of the existing trustees of lady byrons papers to furnish copies of her letters to me for the purpose of a memoir  before i had time to have copies made another letter came stating that the trustees had concluded that it was best not to publish any memoir of lady byron at all  this left the character of lady byron in our american world precisely where the slanders of her husband the literature of the noctes club and the unanimous verdict of may fair as recorded by blackwood had placed it  true lady byron had nobly and quietly lived down these slanders in england by deeds that made her name revered as a saint among all those who valued saintliness  but in france and italy and in these united states i have had abundant opportunity to know that lady byron stood judged and condemned on the testimony of her brilliant husband and that the feeling against her had a vivacity and intensity not to be overcome by mere allusions to a virtuous life in distant england  this is strikingly shown by one fact  in the american edition of moores life of byron by claxton remsen and haffelfinger philadelphia 1869 which i have been consulting lady byrons statement which is found in the appendix of murrays standard edition is entirely omitted every other paper is carefully preserved  this one incident showed how the tide of sympathy was setting in this new world  of course there is no stronger power than a virtuous life but for a virtuous life to bear testimony to the world its details must be told so that the world may know them  suppose the memoirs of clarkson and wilberforce had been suppressed after their death how soon might the coming tide have wiped out the record of their bravery and philanthropy  suppose the lives of francis xavier and henry martyn had never been written and we had lost the remembrance of what holy men could do and dare in the divine enthusiasm of christian faith  suppose we had no fenelon no book of martyrs  would there not be an outcry through all the literary and artistic world if a perfect statue were allowed to remain buried for ever because some painful individual history was connected with its burial and its recovery  but is not a noble life a greater treasure to mankind than any work of art  we have heard much mourning over the burned autobiography of lord byron and seen it treated of in a magazine as the lost chapter in history the lost chapter in history is lady byrons autobiography in her life and letters and the suppression of them is the root of this whole mischief  we do not in this intend to censure the parties who came to this decision  the descendants of lady byron revere her memory as they have every reason to do  that it was their desire to have a memoir of her published i have been informed by an individual of the highest character in england who obtained the information directly from lady byrons grandchildren  but the trustees in whose care the papers were placed drew back on examination of them and declared that as lady byrons papers could not be fully published they should regret anything that should call public attention once more to the discussion of her history  reviewing this long history of the way in which the literary world had treated lady byron we cannot wonder that her friends should have doubted whether there was left on earth any justice or sense that anything is due to woman as a human being with human rights  evidently this lesson had taken from them all faith in the moral sense of the world  rather than reawaken the discussion so unsparing so painful and so indelicate which had been carried on so many years around that loved form now sanctified by death they sacrificed the dear pleasure of the memorials and the interests of mankind who have an indefeasible right to all the help that can be got from the truth of history as to the living power of virtue and the reality of that great victory that overcometh the world  there are thousands of poor victims suffering in sadness discouragement and poverty heartbroken wives of brutal drunken husbands women enduring nameless wrongs and horrors which the delicacy of their sex forbids them to utterto whom the lovely letters lying hidden away under those seals might bring courage and hope from springs not of this world  but though the friends of lady byron perhaps from despair of their kind from weariness of the utter injustice done her wished to cherish her name in silence and to confine the story of her virtues to that circle who knew her too well to ask a proof or utter a doubt the partisans of lord byron were embarrassed with no such scruple  lord byron had artfully contrived during his life to place his wife in such an antagonistic position with regard to himself that his intimate friends were forced to believe that one of the two had deliberately and wantonly injured the other  the published statement of lady byron contradicted boldly and pointblank all the statement of her husband concerning the separation so that unless she was convicted as a false witness he certainly was  the best evidence of this is christopher norths own shocked astonished statement and the words of the noctes club  the noble life that lady byron lived after this hushed every voice and silenced even the most desperate calumny while she was in the world  in the face of lady byron as the world saw her of what use was the talk of clytemnestra and the assertion that she had been a mean deceitful conspirator against her husbands honour in life and stabbed his memory after death  but when she was in her grave when her voice and presence and good deeds no more spoke for her and a new generation was growing up that knew her not then was the time selected to revive the assault on her memory and to say over her grave what none would ever have dared to say of her while living  during these last two years i have been gradually awakening to the evidence of a new crusade against the memory of lady byron which respected no sanctitynot even that last and most awful one of death  nine years after her death when it was fully understood that no story on her side or that of her friends was to be forthcoming then her calumniators raked out from the ashes of her husbands sepulchre all his bitter charges to state them over in even stronger and more indecent forms  there seems to be reason to think that the materials supplied by lord byron for such a campaign yet exist in society  to the noctes of november 1824 there is the following note apropos to a discussion of the byron question     byrons memoirs given by him to moore were burned as everybody    knows  but before this moore had lent them to several persons  mrs    home purvis afterwards viscountess of canterbury is known to have    sat up all one night in which aided by her daughter she had a copy    made  i have the strongest reason for believing that one other person    made a copy for the description of the first twentyfour hours after    the marriage ceremonial has been in my hands  not until after the    death of lady byron and hobhouse who was the poets literary    executor can the poets autobiography see the light but i am certain    it will be published  thus speaks mackenzie in a note to a volume of the noctes published in america in 1854  lady byron died in 1860  nine years after lady byrons death when it was ascertained that her story was not to see the light when there were no means of judging her character by her own writings commenced a wellplanned set of operations to turn the public attention once more to lord byron and to represent him as an injured man whose testimony had been unjustly suppressed  it was quite possible supposing copies of the autobiography to exist that this might occasion a call from the generation of today in answer to which the suppressed work might appear  this was a rather delicate operation to commence but the instrument was not wanting  it was necessary that the subject should be first opened by some irresponsible party whom more powerful parties might as by accident recognise and patronise and on whose weakness they might build something stronger  just such an instrument was to be found in paris  the mistress of lord byron could easily be stirred up and flattered to come before the world with a book which should reopen the whole controversy and she proved a facile tool  at first the work appeared prudently in french and was called lord byron juge par les temoins de sa vie and was rather a failure  then it was translated into english and published by bentley  the book was inartistic and helplessly childishly stupid as to any literary meritsa mere mass of gossip and twaddle but after all when one remembers the taste of the thousands of circulatinglibrary readers it must not be considered the less likely to be widely read on that account  it is only once in a century that a writer of real genius has the art to tell his story so as to take both the cultivated few and the average many  de foe and john bunyan are almost the only examples  but there is a certain class of reading that sells and spreads and exerts a vast influence which the upper circles of literature despise too much ever to fairly estimate its power  however the guiccioli book did not want for patrons in the high places of literature  the blackwoodthe old classic magazine of england the defender of conservatism and aristocracy the paper of lockhart wilson hogg walter scott and a host of departed grandeurswas deputed to usher into the world this book and to recommend it and its author to the christian public of the nineteenth century  the following is the manner in which blackwood calls attention to it     one of the most beautiful of the songs of beranger is that addressed    to his lisette in which he pictures her in old age narrating to a    younger generation the loves of their youth decking his portrait with    flowers at each returning spring and reciting the verses that had    been inspired by her vanished charms     lorsque les yeux chercheront sous vos rides    les traits charmants qui mauront inspire    des doux recits les jeunes gens avides    diront quel fut cet ami tant pleure    de men amour peignez sil est possible    vardeur livresse et meme les soupcons    et bonne vieille an coin dun feu paisible    de votre ami repetez les chansons    on vous dira savaitil etre aimable    et sans rougir vous direz je laimais    dun trait mechant se montratil capable    avec orgueil vous repondrez jamais     this charming picture blackwood goes on to say has been    realised in the case of a poet greater than beranger and by a    mistress more famous than lisette  the countess guiccioli has at    length given to the world her recollections of lord byron  the book    first appeared in france under the title of lord byron juge par les    temoins de sa vie without the name of the countess  a more    unfortunate designation could hardly have been selected  the    witnesses of his life told us nothing but what had been told before    over and over again and the uniform and exaggerated tone of eulogy    which pervaded the whole book was fatal to any claim on the part of    the writer to be considered an impartial judge of the wonderfully    mixed character of byron     when however the book is regarded as the avowed production of the    countess guiccioli it derives value and interest from its very    faults  113  there is something inexpressibly touching in the    picture of the old lady calling up the phantoms of half a century ago    not faded and stricken by the hand of time but brilliant and gorgeous    as they were when byron in his manly prime of genius and beauty    first flashed upon her enraptured sight and she gave her whole soul    up to an absorbing passion the embers of which still glow in her    heart     to her there has been no change no decay  the god whom she    worshipped with all the ardour of her italian nature at seventeen is    still the pythian of the age to her at seventy  to try such a book    by the ordinary canons of criticism would be as absurd as to arraign    the authoress before a jury of british matrons or to prefer a bill of    indictment against the sultan for bigamy to a middlesex grand jury  this then is the introduction which one of the oldest and most classical periodicals of great britain gives to a very stupid book simply because it was written by lord byrons mistress  that fact we are assured lends grace even to its faults  having brought the authoress upon the stage the review now goes on to define her position and assure the christian world that     the countess guiccioli was the daughter of an impoverished noble  at    the age of sixteen she was taken from a convent and sold as third    wife to the count guiccioli who was old rich and profligate  a    fouler prostitution never profaned the name of marriage  a short time    afterwards she accidentally met lord byron  outraged and rebellious    nature vindicated itself in the deep and devoted passion with which he    inspired her  with the full assent of husband father and brother    and in compliance with the usages of italian society he was shortly    afterwards installed in the office and invested with all the    privileges of her cavalier servente  it has been asserted that the marquis de boissy the late husband of this guiccioli lady was in the habit of introducing her in fashionable circles as the marquise de boissy my wife formerly mistress to lord byron  we do not give the story as a verity yet in the review of this whole history we may be pardoned for thinking it quite possible  the mistress being thus vouched for and presented as worthy of sympathy and attention by one of the oldest and most classic organs of english literature may now proceed in her work of glorifying the popular idol and casting abuse on the grave of the dead wife  her attacks on lady byron are to be sure less skilful and adroit than those of lord byron  they want his literary polish and tact but what of that  blackwood assures us that even the faults of manner derive a peculiar grace from the fact that the narrator is lord byrons mistress and so we suppose the literary world must find grace in things like this     she has been called after his words the moral clytemnestra of her    husband  such a surname is severe but the repugnance we feel to    condemning a woman cannot prevent our listening to the voice of    justice which tells us that the comparison is still in favour of the    guilty one of antiquity for she driven to crime by fierce passion    overpowering reason at least only deprived her husband of physical    life and in committing the deed exposed herself to all its    consequences while lady byron left her husband at the very moment    that she saw him struggling amid a thousand shoals in the stormy sea    of embarrassments created by his marriage and precisely when he more    than ever required a friendly tender and indulgent hand to save him     besides she shut herself up in silence a thousand times more cruel    than clytemnestras poniard that only killed the body whereas lady    byrons silence was destined to kill the souland such a    soulleaving the door open to calumny and making it to be supposed    that her silence was magnanimity destined to cover over frightful    wrongs perhaps even depravity  in vain did he feeling his    conscience at ease implore some inquiry and examination  she    refused and the only favour she granted was to send him one fine    day two persons to see whether he were not mad     and why then had she believed him mad  because she a methodical    inflexible woman with that unbendingness which a profound moralist    calls the worship rendered to pride by a feelingless soul because she    could not understand the possibility of tastes and habits different to    those of ordinary routine or of her own starched life  not to be    hungry when she was not to sleep at night but to write while she was    sleeping and to sleep when she was up in short to gratify the    requirements of material and intellectual life at hours different to    hersall that was not merely annoying for her but it must be    madness or if not it betokened depravity that she could neither    submit to nor tolerate without perilling her own morality     such was the grand secret of the cruel silence which exposed lord    byron to the most malignant interpretations to all the calumny and    revenge of his enemies     she was perhaps the only woman in the world so strangely    organisedthe only one perhaps capable of not feeling happy and    proud at belonging to a man superior to the rest of humanity and    fatally was it decreed that this woman alone of her species should be    lord byrons wife  in a note is added     if an imaginary fear and even an unreasonable jealousy may be her    excuse just as one excuses a monomania can one equally forgive her    silence  such a silence is morally what are physically the poisons    which kill at once and defy all remedies thus insuring the culprits    safety  this silence it is which will ever be her crime for by it    she poisoned the life of her husband  the book has several chapters devoted to lord byrons peculiar virtues and under the one devoted to magnanimity and heroism his forgiving disposition receives special attention  the climax of all is stated to be that he forgave lady byron  all the world knew that since he had declared this fact in a very noisy and impassioned manner in the fourth canto of childe harold together with a statement of the wrongs which he forgave but the guiccioli thinks his virtue at this period has not been enough appreciated  in her view it rose to the sublime  she says of lady byron     an absolute moral monstrosity an anomaly in the history of types of    female hideousness had succeeded in showing itself in the light of    magnanimity  but false as was this high quality in lady byron so did    it shine out in him true and admirable  the position in which lady    byron had placed him and where she continued to keep him by her    harshness silence and strange refusals was one of those which cause    such suffering that the highest degree of selfcontrol seldom    suffices to quiet the promptings of human weakness and to cause    persons of even slight sensibility to preserve moderation  yet with    his sensibility and the knowledge of his worth how did he act what    did he say  i will not speak of his farewell of the care he took    to shield her from blame by throwing it on others by taking much too    large a share to himself  with like vivacity and earnestness does the narrator now proceed to make an incarnate angel of her subject by the simple process of denying everything that he himself ever confessedeverything that has ever been confessed in regard to him by his best friends  he has been in the world as an angel unawares from his cradle  his guardian did not properly appreciate him and is consequently mentioned as that wicked lord carlisle  thomas moore is never to be sufficiently condemned for the facts told in his biography  byrons own frank and lawless admissions of evil are set down to a peculiar inability he had for speaking the truth about himselfsometimes about his near relations all which does not in the least discourage the authoress from giving a separate chapter on lord byrons love of truth  in the matter of his relations with women she complacently repeats what sounds rather oddly as coming from her lord byrons own assurance that he never seduced a woman and also the equally convincing statement that he had told her the guiccioli that his married fidelity to his wife was perfect  she discusses moores account of the mistress in boys clothes who used to share byrons apartments in college and ride with him to races and whom he presented to ladies as his brother  she has her own view of this matter  the disguised boy was a lady of rank and fashion who sought lord byrons chambers as we are informed noble ladies everywhere both in italy and england were constantly in the habit of doing throwing themselves at his feet and imploring permission to become his handmaids  in the authoresss own words feminine overtures still continued to be made to lord byron but the fumes of incense never hid from his sight his ideal  we are told that in the case of these poor ladies generally disenchantment took place on his side without a corresponding result on the other thence many heartbreakings  nevertheless we are informed that there followed the indiscretions of these ladies none of those proceedings that the world readily forgives but which his feelings as a man of honour would have condemned  as to drunkenness and all that we are informed he was an anchorite pages are given to an account of the biscuits and sodawater that on this and that occasion were found to be the sole means of sustenance to this ethereal creature  as to the story of using his wifes money the lady gives directly in the face of his own letters and journal the same account given before by medwin and which caused such merriment when talked over in the noctes clubthat he had with her only a marriage portion of 10000 pounds and that on the separation he not only paid it back but doubled it 119  so on the authoress goes sowing right and left the most transparent absurdities and misstatements with what carlyle well calls a composed stupidity and a cheerful infinitude of ignorance  who should know if not she to be sure  had not byron told her all about it and was not his family motto crede byron  the blackwood having a dim suspicion that this confused style of attack and defence in reference to the two parties under consideration may not have great weight itself proceeds to make the book an occasion for reopening the controversy of lord byron with his wife  the rest of the review devoted to a powerful attack on lady byrons character the most fearful attack on the memory of a dead woman we have ever seen made by living man  the author proceeds like a lawyer to gather up arrange and restate in a most workmanlike manner the confused accusations of the book  anticipating the objection that such a reopening of the inquiry was a violation of the privacy due to womanhood and to the feelings of a surviving family he says that though marriage usually is a private matter which the world has no right to intermeddle with or discuss yet     lord byrons was an exceptional case  it is not too much to say    that had his marriage been a happy one the course of events of the    present century might have been materially changed that the genius    which poured itself forth in don juan and cain might have flowed    in far different channels that the ardent love of freedom which sent    him to perish at six and thirty at missolonghi might have inspired a    long career at home and that we might at this moment have been    appealing to the counsels of his experience and wisdom at an age not    exceeding that which was attained by wellington lyndhurst and    brougham     whether the world would have been a gainer or a loser by the exchange    is a question which every man must answer for himself according to    his own tastes and opinions but the possibility of such a change in    the course of events warrants us in treating what would otherwise be a    strictly private matter as one of public interest     more than half a century has elapsed the actors have departed from    the stage the curtain has fallen and whether it will ever again be    raised so as to reveal the real facts of the drama may as we have    already observed be well doubted  but the time has arrived when we    may fairly gather up the fragments of evidence clear them as far as    possible from the incrustations of passion prejudice and malice and    place them in such order as if possible to enable us to arrive at    some probable conjecture as to what the skeleton of the drama    originally was  here the writer proceeds to put together all the facts of lady byrons case just as an adverse lawyer would put them as against her and for her husband  the plea is made vigorously and ably and with an air of indignant severity as of an honest advocate who is thoroughly convinced that he is pleading the cause of a wronged man who has been ruined in name shipwrecked in life and driven to an early grave by the arts of a bad womana woman all the more horrible that her malice was disguised under the cloak of religion  having made an able statement of facts adroitly leaving out one 121 of which he could not have been ignorant had he studied the case carefully enough to know all the others he proceeds to sum up against the criminal thus     we would deal tenderly with the memory of lady byron  few women have    been juster objects of compassion  it would seem as if nature and    fortune had vied with each other which should be most lavish of her    gifts and yet that some malignant power had rendered all their bounty    of no effect  rank beauty wealth and mental powers of no common    order were hers yet they were of no avail to secure common    happiness  the spoilt child of seclusion restraint and parental    idolatry a fate alike evil for both cast her into the arms of the    spoilt child of genius passion and the world  what real or fancied    wrongs she suffered we may never know but those which she inflicted    are sufficiently apparent     it is said that there are some poisons so subtle that they will    destroy life and yet leave no trace of their action  the murderer    who uses them may escape the vengeance of the law but he is not the    less guilty  so the slanderer who makes no charge who deals in hints    and insinuations who knows melancholy facts he would not willingly    divulgethings too painful to state who forbears expresses pity    sometimes even affection for his victim shrugs his shoulders looks    with        the significant eye    which learns to lie with silence     is far more guilty than he who tells the bold falsehood which may be    met and answered and who braves the punishment which must follow upon    detection     lady byron has been called        the moral clytemnestra of her lord     the moral brinvilliers would have been a truer designation     the conclusion at which we arrive is that there is no proof whatever    that lord byron was guilty of any act that need have caused a    separation or prevented a reunion and that the imputations upon him    rest on the vaguest conjecture that whatever real or fancied wrongs    lady byron may have endured are shrouded in an impenetrable mist of    her own creationa poisonous miasma in which she enveloped the    character of her husband raised by her breath and which her breath    only could have dispersed        she dies and makes no sign  o god forgive her  as we have been obliged to review accusations on lady byron founded on old greek tragedy so now we are forced to abridge a passage from a modern conversationslexicon that we may understand what sort of comparisons are deemed in good taste in a conservative english review when speaking of ladies of rank in their graves  under the article brinvilliers we find as follows     marguerite daubrai marchioness of brinvilliersthe singular    atrocity of this woman gives her a sort of infamous claim to notice    she was born in paris in 1651 being daughter of daubrai lieutenant    civil of paris who married her to the marquis of brinvilliers    although possessed of attractions to captivate lovers she was for    some time much attached to her husband but at length became madly in    love with a gascon officer  her father imprisoned the officer in the    bastille and while there he learned the art of compounding subtle    and most mortal poisons and when he was released he taught it to    the lady who exercised it with such success that in one year her    father sister and two brothers became her victims  she professed    the utmost tenderness for her victims and nursed them assiduously  on    her father she is said to have made eight attempts before she    succeeded  she was very religious and devoted to works of charity    and visited the hospitals a great deal where it is said she tried her    poisons on the sick  people have made loud outcries lately both in america and england about violating the repose of the dead  we should like to know what they call this  is this then what they mean by respecting the dead  let any man imagine a leading review coming out with language equally brutal about his own mother or any dear and revered friend  men of america men of england what do you think of this  when lady byron was publicly branded with the names of the foulest ancient and foulest modern assassins and lord byrons mistress was publicly taken by the hand and encouraged to go on and prosper in her slanders by one of the oldest and most influential british reviews what was said and what was done in england  that is a question we should be glad to have answered  nothing was done that ever reached us across the water  and why was nothing done  is this language of a kind to be passed over in silence  was it no offence to the house of wentworth to attack the pure character of its late venerable head and to brand her in her sacred grave with the name of one of the vilest of criminals  might there not properly have been an indignant protest of family solicitors against this insult to the person and character of the baroness wentworth  if virtue went for nothing benevolence for nothing a long life of service to humanity for nothing one would at least have thought that in aristocratic countries rank might have had its rights to decent consideration and its guardians to rebuke the violation of those rights  we americans understand little of the advantages of rank but we did understand that it secured certain decorums to people both while living and when in their graves  from lady byrons whole history in life and in death it would appear that we were mistaken  what a life was hers  was ever a woman more evidently desirous of the delicate and secluded privileges of womanhood of the sacredness of individual privacy  was ever a woman so rudely dragged forth and exposed to the hardened vulgar and unfeeling gaze of mere curiosityher maiden secrets of love thrown open to be handled by roues the sanctities of her marriagechamber desecrated by leering satyrs her parents and best friends traduced and slandered till one indignant public protest was extorted from her as by the racka protest which seems yet to quiver in every word with the indignation of outraged womanly delicacy  then followed coarse blame and coarser commentblame for speaking at all and blame for not speaking more  one manly voice raised for her in honourable protest was silenced and overborne by the universal roar of ridicule and reprobation and henceforth what refuge  only this remained let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him as to a faithful creator  lady byron turned to this refuge in silence and filled up her life with a noble record of charities and humanities  so pure was she so childlike so artless so loving that those who knew her best feel to this day that a memorial of her is like the relic of a saint  and could not all this preserve her grave from insult  o england england  i speak in sorrow of heart to those who must have known loved and revered lady byron and ask them of what were you thinking when you allowed a paper of so established literary rank as the blackwood to present and earnestly recommend to our new world such a compendium of lies as the guiccioli book  is the great englishspeaking community whose waves toss from maine to california and whose literature is yet to come back in a thousand voices to you a thing to be so despised  if as the solicitors of the wentworth family observe you might be entitled to treat with silent contempt the slanders of a mistress against a wife was it safe to treat with equal contempt the indorsement and recommendation of those slanders by one of your oldest and most powerful literary authorities  no european magazine has ever had the weight and circulation in america that the blackwood has held  in the days of my youth when new england was a comparatively secluded section of the earth the wit and genius of the noctes ambrosianae were in the mouths of men and maidens even in our most quiet mountaintowns  there years ago we saw all lady byrons private affairs discussed and felt the weight of christopher norths decisions against her  shelton mackenzie in his american edition speaks of the american circulation of blackwood being greater than that in england 126  it was and is now reprinted monthly and besides that littells magazine reproduces all its striking articles and they come with the weight of long established position  from the very fact that it has long been considered the tory organ and the supporter of aristocratic orders all its admissions against the character of individuals in the privileged classes have a double force  when blackwood therefore boldly denounces a lady of high rank as a modern brinvilliers and no sensation is produced and no remonstrance follows what can people in the new world suppose but that lady byrons character was a point entirely given up that her depravity was so well established and so fully conceded that nothing was to be said and that even the defenders of aristocracy were forced to admit it  i have been blamed for speaking on this subject without consulting lady byrons friends trustees and family  more than ten years had elapsed since i had had any intercourse with england and i knew none of them how was i to know that any of them were living  i was astonished to learn for the first time by the solicitors letters that there were trustees who held in their hands all lady byrons carefully prepared proofs and documents by which this falsehood might immediately have been refuted  if they had spoken they might have saved all this confusion  even if bound by restrictions for a certain period of time they still might have called on a christian public to frown down such a cruel and indecent attack on the character of a noble lady who had been a benefactress to so many in england  they might have stated that the means of wholly refuting the slanders of the blackwood were in their hands and only delayed in coming forth from regard to the feelings of some in this generation  then might they not have announced her life and letters that the public might have the same opportunity as themselves for knowing and judging lady byron by her own writings  had this been done i had been most happy to have remained silent  i have been astonished that any one should have supposed this speaking on my part to be anything less than it isthe severest act of selfsacrifice that one friend can perform for another and the most solemn and difficult tribute to justice that a human being can be called upon to render  i have been informed that the course i have taken would be contrary to the wishes of my friend  i think otherwise  i know her strong sense of justice and her reverence for truth  nothing ever moved her to speak to the public but an attack upon the honour of the dead  in her statement she says of her parents there is no other near relative to vindicate their memory from insult i am therefore compelled to break the silence i had hoped always to have observed  if there was any near relative to vindicate lady byrons memory i had no evidence of the fact and i considered the utter silence to be strong evidence to the contrary  in all the storm of obloquy and rebuke that has raged in consequence of my speaking i have had two unspeakable sources of joy first that they could not touch her and second that they could not blind the allseeing god  it is worth being in darkness to see the stars  it has been said that i have drawn on lady byrons name greater obloquy than ever before  i deny the charge  nothing fouler has been asserted of her than the charges in the blackwood because nothing fouler could be asserted  no satyrs hoof has ever crushed this pearl deeper in the mire than the hoof of the blackwood but none of them have defiled it or trodden it so deep that god cannot find it in the day when he maketh up his jewels  i have another word as an american to say about the contempt shown to our great people in thus suffering the materials of history to be falsified to subserve the temporary purposes of family feeling in england  lord byron belongs not properly either to the byrons or the wentworths he is not one of their family jewels to be locked up in their cases  he belongs to the world for which he wrote to which he appealed and before which he dragged his reluctant delicate wife to a publicity equal with his own the world has therefore a right to judge him  we americans have been made accessories after the fact to every insult and injury that lord byron and the literary men of his day have heaped upon lady byron  we have been betrayed into injustice and a complicity with villainy  after lady byron had nobly lived down slanders in england and died full of years and honours the blackwood takes occasion to reopen the controversy by recommending a book full of slanders to a rising generation who knew nothing of the past  what was the consequence in america  my attention was first called to the result not by reading the blackwood article but by finding in a popular monthly magazine two long articlesthe one an enthusiastic recommendation of the guiccioli book and the other a lamentation over the burning of the autobiography as a lost chapter in history  both articles represented lady byron as a cold malignant mean persecuting woman who had been her husbands ruin  they were so full of falsehoods and misstatements as to astonish me  not long after a literary friend wrote to me will you can you reconcile it to your conscience to sit still and allow that mistress so to slander that wifeyou perhaps the only one knowing the real facts and able to set them forth  upon this i immediately began collecting and reading the various articles and the book and perceived that the public of this generation were in a way of having false history created uncontradicted under their own eyes  i claim for my countrymen and women our right to true history  for years the popular literature has held up publicly before our eyes the facts as to this man and this woman and called on us to praise or condemn  let us have truth when we are called on to judge  it is our right  there is no conceivable obligation on a human being greater than that of absolute justice  it is the deepest personal injury to an honourable mind to be made through misrepresentation an accomplice in injustice when a noble name is accused any person who possesses truth which might clear it and withholds that truth is guilty of a sin against human nature and the inalienable rights of justice  i claim that i have not only a right but an obligation to bring in my solemn testimony upon this subject  for years and years the silencepolicy has been tried and what has it brought forth  as neither word nor deed could be proved against lady byron her silence has been spoken of as a monstrous unnatural crime a poisonous miasma in which she enveloped the name of her husband  very well since silence is the crime i thought i would tell the world that lady byron had spoken  christopher north years ago when he condemned her for speaking said that she should speak further  she should speak or some one for her  one word would suffice  that one word has been spoken     part ii   chapter i  lady byron as i knew her   an editorial in the london times of sept 18 says     the perplexing feature in this true story is that it is impossible    to distinguish what part in it is the editresss and what lady    byrons own  we are given the impression made on mrs stowes mind by    lady byrons statements but it would have been more satisfactory if    the statement itself had been reproduced as bare as possible and been    left to make its own impression on the public  in reply to this i will say that in my article i gave a brief synopsis of the subjectmatter of lady byrons communications and i think it must be quite evident to the world that the main fact on which the story turns was one which could not possibly be misunderstood and the remembrance of which no lapse of time could ever weaken  lady byrons communications were made to me in language clear precise terrible and many of her phrases and sentences i could repeat at this day word for word  but if i had reproduced them at first as the times suggests word for word the public horror and incredulity would have been doubled  it was necessary that the brutality of the story should in some degree be veiled and softened  the publication by lord lindsay of lady anne barnards communication makes it now possible to tell fully and in lady byrons own words certain incidents that yet remain untold  to me who know the whole history the revelations in lady annes account and the story related by lady byron are like fragments of a dissected map they fit together piece by piece and form one connected whole  in confirmation of the general facts of this interview i have the testimony of a sister who accompanied me on this visit and to whom immediately after it i recounted the story  her testimony on the subject is as follows     my dear sisteri have a perfect recollection of going with you to    visit lady byron at the time spoken of in your published article  we    arrived at her house in the morning and after lunch lady byron and    yourself spent the whole time till evening alone together     after we retired to our apartment that night you related to me the    story given in your published account though with many more    particulars than you have yet thought fit to give to the public     you stated to me that lady byron was strongly impressed with the idea    that it might be her duty to publish a statement during her lifetime    and also the reasons which induced her to think so  you appeared at    that time quite disposed to think that justice required this step and    asked my opinion  we passed most of the night in conversation on the    subjecta conversation often resumed from time to time during    several weeks in which you were considering what opinion to give     i was strongly of opinion that justice required the publication of    the truth but felt exceedingly averse to its being done by lady byron    herself during her own lifetime when she personally would be subject    to the comments and misconceptions of motives which would certainly    follow such a communication                                   your sister                                         m f perkins  i am now about to complete the account of my conversation with lady byron but as the credibility of a history depends greatly on the character of its narrator and as especial pains have been taken to destroy the belief in this story by representing it to be the wanderings of a brokendown mind in a state of dotage and mental hallucination i shall preface the narrative with some account of lady byron as she was during the time of our mutual acquaintance and friendship  this account may perhaps be deemed superfluous in england where so many knew her but in america where from maine to california her character has been discussed and traduced it is of importance to give interested thousands an opportunity of learning what kind of a woman lady byron was  her character as given by lord byron in his journal after her first refusal of him is this     she is a very superior woman and very little spoiled which is    strange in an heiress a girl of twenty a peeress that is to be in    her own right an only child and a savante who has always had her    own way  she is a poetess a mathematician a metaphysician yet    withal very kind generous and gentle with very little pretension    any other head would be turned with half her acquisitions and a tenth    of her advantages  such was lady byron at twenty  i formed her acquaintance in the year 1853 during my first visit in england  i met her at a lunchparty in the house of one of her friends  the party had many notables but among them all my attention was fixed principally on lady byron  she was at this time sixtyone years of age but still had to a remarkable degree that personal attraction which is commonly considered to belong only to youth and beauty  her form was slight giving an impression of fragility her motions were both graceful and decided her eyes bright and full of interest and quick observation  her silverywhite hair seemed to lend a grace to the transparent purity of her complexion and her small hands had a pearly whiteness  i recollect she wore a plain widows cap of a transparent material and was dressed in some delicate shade of lavender which harmonised well with her complexion  when i was introduced to her i felt in a moment the words of her husband     there was awe in the homage that she drew    her spirit seemed as seated on a throne  calm selfpoised and thoughtful she seemed to me rather to resemble an interested spectator of the worlds affairs than an actor involved in its trials yet the sweetness of her smile and a certain very delicate sense of humour in her remarks made the way of acquaintance easy  her first remarks were a little playful but in a few moments we were speaking on what every one in those days was talking to me aboutthe slavery question in america  it need not be remarked that when any one subject especially occupies the public mind those known to be interested in it are compelled to listen to many weary platitudes  lady byrons remarks however caught my ear and arrested my attention by their peculiar incisive quality their originality and the evidence they gave that she was as well informed on all our matters as the best american statesman could be  i had no wearisome course to go over with her as to the difference between the general government and state governments nor explanations of the united states constitution for she had the whole before her mind with a perfect clearness  her morality upon the slavery question too impressed me as something far higher and deeper than the common sentimentalism of the day  many of her words surprised me greatly and gave me new material for thought  i found i was in company with a commanding mind and hastened to gain instruction from her on another point where my interest had been aroused i had recently been much excited by kingsleys novels alton locke and yeast on the position of religious thought in england  from these works i had gathered that under the apparent placid uniformity of the established church of england and of good society as founded on it there was moving a secret current of speculative enquiry doubt and dissent but i had met as yet with no person among my various acquaintances in england who seemed either aware of this fact or able to guide my mind respecting it  the moment i mentioned the subject to lady byron i received an answer which showed me that the whole ground was familiar to her and that she was capable of giving me full information she had studied with careful thoughtfulness all the social and religious tendencies of england during her generation  one of her remarks has often since occurred to me  speaking of the oxford movement she said the time had come when the english church could no longer remain as it was  it must either restore the past or create a future  the oxford movement attempted the former and of the future she was beginning to speak when our conversation was interrupted by the presentation of other parties  subsequently in reply to a note from her on some benevolent business i alluded to that conversation and expressed a wish that she would finish giving me her views of the religious state of england  a portion of the letter that she wrote me in reply i insert as being very characteristic in many respects     various causes have been assigned for the decaying state of the    english church which seems the more strange because the clergy have    improved morally and intellectually in the last twenty years  then    why should their influence be diminished  i think it is owing to the    diffusion of a spirit of free enquiry     doubts have arisen in the minds of many who are unhappily bound by    subscription not to doubt and in consequence they are habitually    pretending either to believe or to disbelieve  the state of denmark    cannot but be rotten when to seem is the first object of the    witnesses of truth     they may lead better lives and bring forward abler arguments but    their efforts are paralysed by that unsoundness  i see the high    churchman professing to believe in the existence of a church when the    most palpable facts must show him that no such church exists the    low churchman professing to believe in exceptional interpositions    which his philosophy secretly questions the broad churchman    professing as absolute an attachment to the established church as the    narrowest could feel while he is preaching such principles as will at    last pull it down     i ask you my friend whether there would not be more faith as well    as earnestness if all would speak out  there would be more unanimity    too because they would all agree in a certain basis  would not a    wider love supersede the creedbound charity of sects     i am aware that i have touched on a point of difference between us    and i will not regret it for i think the differences of mind are    analogous to those differences of nature which in the most    comprehensive survey are the very elements of harmony     i am not at all prone to put forth my own opinions but the tone in    which you have written to me claims an unusual degree of openness on    my part  i look upon creeds of all kinds as chainsfar worse chains    than those you would breakas the causes of much hypocrisy and    infidelity  i hold it to be a sin to make a child say i believe    lead it to utter that belief spontaneously  i also consider the    institution of an exclusive priesthood though having been of service    in some respects as retarding the progress of christianity at    present  i desire to see a lay ministry     i will not give you more of my heterodoxy at present perhaps i need    your pardon connected as you are with the church for having said so    much     there are causes of decay known to be at work in my frame which lead    me to believe i may not have time to grow wiser and i must therefore    leave it to others to correct the conclusions i have now formed from    my lifes experience  i should feel happy to discuss them personally    with you for it would be soul to soul  in that confidence i am yours    most truly                                       a i noel byron  it is not necessary to prove to the reader that this letter is not in the style of a brokendown old woman subject to mental hallucinations  it shows lady byrons habits of clear searching analysis her thoughtfulness and above all that peculiar reverence for truth and sincerity which was a leading characteristic of her moral nature 139 it also shows her views of the probable shortness of her stay on earth derived from the opinion of physicians about her disease which was a gradual ossification of the lungs  it has been asserted that pulmonary diseases while they slowly and surely sap the physical life often appear to give added vigour to the play of the moral and intellectual powers  i parted from lady byron feeling richer in that i had found one more pearl of great price on the shore of life  three years after this i visited england to obtain a copyright for the issue of my novel of dred  the hope of once more seeing lady byron was one of the brightest anticipations held out to me in this journey  i found london quite deserted but hearing that lady byron was still in town i sent to her saying in my note that in case she was not well enough to call i would visit her  her reply i give     my dear friendi will be indebted to you for our meeting as i am    barely able to leave my room  it is not a time for small    personalities if they could ever exist with you and dressed or    undressed i shall hope to see you after two oclock                               yours very truly                                       a i noel byron  i found lady byron in her sickroomthat place which she made so different from the chamber of ordinary invalids  her sickroom seemed only a telegraphic station whence her vivid mind was flashing out all over the world  by her bedside stood a table covered with books pamphlets and files of letters all arranged with exquisite order and each expressing some of her varied interests  from that sickbed she still directed with systematic care her various works of benevolence and watched with intelligent attention the course of science literature and religion and the versatility and activity of her mind the flow of brilliant and penetrating thought on all the topics of the day gave to the conversations of her retired room a peculiar charm  you forgot that she was an invalid for she rarely had a word of her own personalities and the charm of her conversation carried you invariably from herself to the subjects of which she was thinking  all the new books the literature of the hour were lighted up by her keen searching yet always kindly criticism and it was charming to get her fresh genuine clearcut modes of expression so different from the worldworn phrases of what is called good society  her opinions were always perfectly clear and positive and given with the freedom of one who has long stood in a position to judge the world and its ways from her own standpoint  but it was not merely in general literature and science that her heart lay it was following always with eager interest the progress of humanity over the whole world  this was the period of the great battle for liberty in kansas  the english papers were daily filled with the thrilling particulars of that desperate struggle and lady byron entered with heart and soul into it  her first letter to me at this time is on this subject  it was while dred was going through the press                                   cambridge terrace aug 15     my dear mrs stowemessrs chambers liked the proposal to publish    the kansas letters  the more the public know of these matters the    better prepared they will be for your book  the moment for its    publication seems well chosen  there is always in england a floating    fund of sympathy for what is above the everyday sordid cares of life    and these better feelings so nobly invested for the last two years in    florence nightingales career are just set free  to what will they    next be attached  if you can lay hold of them they may bring about a    deeper abolition than any legislative onethe abolition of the heart    heresy that mans worth comes not from god but from man     i have been obliged to give up exertion again but hope soon to be    able to call and make the acquaintance of your daughters  in case you    wish to consult h martineaus pamphlets i send more copies  do not    think of answering i have occupied too much of your time in reading                               yours affectionately                                    a i noel byron  as soon as a copy of dred was through the press i sent it to her saying that i had been reproved by some excellent people for representing too faithfully the profane language of some of the wicked characters  to this she sent the following reply     your book dear mrs stowe is of the little leaven kind and must    prove a great moral force perhaps not manifestly so much as secretly    and yet i can hardly conceive so much power without immediate and    sensible effects only there will be a strong disposition to resist on    the part of all hollowhearted professors of religion whose    heathenisms you so unsparingly expose  they have a class feeling like    others     to the young and to those who do not reflect much on what is offered    to their belief you will do great good by showing how spiritual food    is often adulterated  the bread from heaven is in the same case as    bakers bread     if there is truth in what i heard lord byron say that works of    fiction live only by the amount of truth which they contain your    story is sure of a long life  of the few critiques i have seen the    best is in the examiner  i find an obtuseness as to the spirit and    aim of the book as if you had designed to make the best novel of the    season or to keep up the reputation of one  you are reproached as    walter scott was with too much scriptural quotation not that i have    heard with phrases of an opposite character     the effects of such reading till a late hour one evening appeared to    influence me very singularly in a dream  the most horrible spectres    presented themselves and i woke in an agony of fear but a faith    still stronger arose and i became courageous from trust in god and    felt calm  did you do this  it is very insignificant among the many    things you certainly will do unknown to yourself  i know more than    ever before how to value communion with you  i have sent robertsons    sermons for you and with kind regards to your family am                               yours affectionately                                     a i noel byron  i was struck in this note with the mention of lord byron and the next time i saw her alluded to it and remarked upon the peculiar qualities of his mind as shown in some of his more serious conversations with dr kennedy  she seemed pleased to continue the subject and went on to say many things of his singular character and genius more penetrating and more appreciative than is often met with among critics  i told her that i had been from childhood powerfully influenced by him and began to tell her how much as a child i had been affected by the news of his deathgiving up all my plays and going off to a lonely hillside where i spent the afternoon thinking of him  she interrupted me before i had quite finished with a quick impulsive movement  i know all that she said i heard it all from mrs  and it was one of the things that made me wish to know you  i think you could understand him  we talked for some time of him then she with her pale face slightly flushed speaking as any other great mans widow might only of what was purest and best in his works and what were his undeniable virtues and good traits especially in early life  she told me many pleasant little speeches made by him to herself and though there was running through all this a shade of melancholy one could never have conjectured that there were under all any deeper recollections than the circumstances of an ordinary separation might bring  not many days after with the unselfishness which was so marked a trait with her she chose a day when she could be out of her room and invited our family party consisting of my husband sister and children to lunch with her  what showed itself especially in this interview was her tenderness for all young people  she had often enquired after mine asked about their characters habits and tastes and on this occasion she found an opportunity to talk with each one separately and to make them all feel at ease so that they were able to talk with her  she seemed interested to point out to them what they should see and study in london and the charm of her conversation left on their minds an impression that subsequent years have never effaced  i record this incident because it shows how little lady byron assumed the privileges or had the character of an invalid absorbed in herself and likely to brood over her own woes and wrongs  here was a family of strangers stranded in a dull season in london and there was no manner of obligation upon her to exert herself to show them attention  her state of health would have been an allsufficient reason why she should not do it and her doing it was simply a specimen of that unselfish care for others even down to the least detail of which her life was full  a little while after at her request i went with my husband and son to pass an evening at her house  there were a few persons present whom she thought i should be interested to knowa miss goldsmid daughter of baron goldsmid and lord ockham her grandson eldest son and heir of the earl of lovelace to whom she introduced my son  i had heard much of the eccentricities of this young nobleman and was exceedingly struck with his personal appearance  his bodily frame was of the order of the farnese herculesa wonderful development of physical and muscular strength  his hands were those of a blacksmith  he was broadly and squarely made with a finelyshaped head and dark eyes of surpassing brilliancy  i have seldom seen a more interesting combination than his whole appearance presented  when all were engaged in talking lady byron came and sat down by me and glancing across to lord ockham and my son who were talking together she looked at me and smiled  i immediately expressed my admiration of his fine eyes and the intellectual expression of his countenance and my wonder at the uncommon muscular development of his frame  she said that that of itself would account for many of ockhams eccentricities  he had a body that required a more vigorous animal life than his station gave scope for and this had often led him to seek it in what the world calls low society that he had been to sea as a sailor and was now working as a mechanic on the iron work of the great eastern  he had laid aside his title and went in daily with the other workmen requesting them to call him simply ockham  i said that there was something to my mind very fine about this even though it might show some want of proper balance  she said he had noble traits and that she felt assured he would yet accomplish something worthy of himself  the great difficulty with our nobility is apt to be that they do not understand the workingclasses so as to feel for them properly and ockham is now going through an experience which may yet fit him to do great good when he comes to the peerage  i am trying to influence him to do good among the workmen and to interest himself in schools for their children  i think she added i have great influence over ockhamthe greater perhaps that i never make any claim to authority  this conversation is very characteristic of lady byron as showing her benevolent analysis of character and the peculiar hopefulness she always had in regard to the future of every one brought in connection with her her moral hopefulness was something very singular and in this respect she was so different from the rest of the world that it would be difficult to make her understood  her tolerance of wrongdoing would have seemed to many quite latitudinarian and impressed them as if she had lost all just horror of what was morally wrong in transgression but it seemed her fixed habit to see faults only as diseases and immaturities and to expect them to fall away with time  she saw the germs of good in what others regarded as only evil  she expected valuable results to come from what the world looked on only as eccentricities 147 and she incessantly devoted herself to the task of guarding those whom the world condemned and guiding them to those higher results of which she often thought that even their faults were prophetic  before i quit this sketch of lady byron as i knew her i will give one more of her letters  my return from that visit in europe was met by the sudden death of the son mentioned in the foregoing account  at the time of this sorrow lady byron was too unwell to write to me  the letter given alludes to this event and speaks also of two coloured persons of remarkable talent in whose career in england she had taken a deep interest  one of them is the friend she speaks of                                    london feb 6 1859     dear mrs stowei seem to feel our friend as a bridge over which    our broken outward communication can be renewed without effort  why    broken  the words i would have uttered at one time were like drops of    blood from my heart  now i sympathise with the calmness you have    gained and can speak of your loss as i do of my own  loss and    restoration are more and more linked in my mind but to the present    live  as long as they are in gods world they are in ours  i ask no    other consolation     mrs ws recovery has astonished me and her husbands prospects    give me great satisfaction  they have achieved a benefit to their    coloured people  she had a mission which her burning soul has worked    out almost in defiance of death  but who is called without being    crucified man or woman  i know of none     i fear that h martineau was too sanguine in her persuasion that the    slave power had received a serious check from the ruin of so many of    your mammonworshippers  with the return of commercial facilities    that article of commerce will again find purchasers enough to raise    its value  not that way is the iniquity to be overthrown  a deeper    moral earthquake is needed 148  we english had ours in india and    though the cases are far from being alike yet a consciousness of what    we ought to have been and ought to be toward the natives could not    have been awakened by less than the reddened waters of the ganges  so    i fear you will have to look on a day of judgment worse than has been    painted     as to all the frauds and impositions which have been disclosed by the    failures what a want of the sense of personal responsibility they    show  it seems to be thought that association will cover a    multitude of sins as if and co could enter heaven  a firm may be    described as a partnership for lowering the standard of morals  even    ecclesiastical bodies are not free from the and co very different    from the goodly fellowship of the apostles     the better class of young gentlemen in england are seized with a    mediaeval mania to which ruskin has contributed much  the chief    reason for regretting it is that taste is made to supersede    benevolence  the money that would save thousands from perishing or    suffering must be applied to raise the gothic edifice where their last    prayer may be uttered  charity may be dead while art has glorified    her  this is worse than catholicism which cultivates heart and eye    together  the first cathedral was truth at the beginning of the    fourth century just as christianity was exchanging a heavenly for an    earthly crown  true religion may have to cast away the symbol for the    spirit before the kingdom can come     while i am speculating to little purpose perhaps you are doingwhat    might not a biography from your pen bring forth again some great half    obscured soul to act on the world  even sir philip sidney ought to be    superseded by a still nobler type     this must go immediately to be in time for the bearer of whose    meeting with you i shall think as the friend of both  may it be    happy                                 your affectionate                                         a i n b  one letter more from lady byron i givethe last i received from her                                     london may 3 1859     dear friendi have found particularly as to yourself that if i    did not answer from the first impulse all had evaporated  your    letter came by the niagara which brought fanny kemble to learn the    loss of her best friend the miss f whom you saw at my house     her death after an illness in which she was to the last a minister    of good to others is a soulloss to me also and your remarks are    most appropriate to my feelings  i have been taught however to    accept survivorship even to feel it in some cases heavens best    blessing     i have an intense interest in your new novel 149  more power in    these few numbers than in any of your former writings relating at    least to my own mind  it would amuse you to hear my granddaughter    and myself attempting to foresee the future of the lovestory being    for the moment quite persuaded that james is at sea and the minister    about to ruin himself  we think that mary will labour to be in love    with the selfdevoted man under her mothers influence and from that    hyperconscientiousness so common with good girls but we dont wish    her to succeed  then what is to become of her older lover  time will    show     the lady you desired to introduce to me will be welcomed as of you    she has been misled with respect to my having any house in yorkshire    new leeds  i am in london now to be of a little use to a not    ostensibly for i can neither go out nor give parties but i am the    confidential friend to whom she likes to bring her social gatherings    as she can see something of the world with others  age and infirmity    seem to be overlooked in what she calls the harmony between usnot    perfect agreement of opinion which i should regret with almost fifty    years of difference but the spiritunion can you say what it is     i am interrupted by a note from mrs k  she says that she cannot    write of our lost friend yet though she is less sad than she will be    mrs f may like to hear of her arrival should you be in    communication with our friend  she is the type of youth in age     i often converse with miss s a judicious friend of the ws    about what is likely to await them  she would not succeed here as    well as where she was a novelty  the character of our climate this    year has been injurious to the respiratory organs but i hope still to    serve them     i have just missed dale owen with whom i wished to have conversed on    spiritualism 150  harris is lecturing here on religion  i do not    hear him praised     people are looking for helps to believe everywhere but in lifein    music in architecture in antiquity in ceremony and upon all these    is written thou shalt not believe  at least if this be faith    happier the unbeliever  i am willing to see through that materialism    but if i am to rest there i would rend the veil                                             june 1     the day of the packets sailing  i shall hope to be visited by you    here  the best flowers sent me have been placed in your little vases    giving life to the remembrance of you though not like them to pass    away                                 ever yours                                     a i noel byron  shortly after i was in england again and had one more opportunity of resuming our personal intercourse  the first time that i called on lady byron i saw her in one of those periods of utter physical exhaustion to which she was subject on account of the constant pressure of cares beyond her strength  all who knew her will testify that in a state of health which would lead most persons to become helpless absorbents of service from others she was assuming burdens and making outlays of her vital powers in acts of love and service with a generosity that often reduced her to utter exhaustion  but none who knew or loved her ever misinterpreted the coldness of those seasons of exhaustion  we knew that it was not the spirit that was chilled but only the frail mortal tabernacle  when i called on her at this time she could not see me at first and when at last she came it was evident that she was in a state of utter prostration  her hands were like ice her face was deadly pale and she conversed with a restraint and difficulty which showed what exertion it was for her to keep up at all  i left as soon as possible with an appointment for another interview  that interview was my last on earth with her and is still beautiful in memory  it was a long still summer afternoon spent alone with her in a garden where we walked together  she was enjoying one of those bright intervals of freedom from pain and languor in which her spirits always rose so buoyant and youthful and her eye brightened and her step became elastic  one last little incident is cherished as most expressive of her  when it became time for me to leave she took me in her carriage to the station as we were almost there i missed my gloves and said i must have left them but there is not time to go back  with one of those quick impulsive motions which were so natural to her in doing a kindness she drew off her own and said take mine if they will serve you  i hesitated a moment and then the thought that i might never see her again came over me and i said oh yes thanks  that was the last earthly word of love between us  but thank god those who love worthily never meet for the last time there is always a future    chapter ii  lady byrons story as told me   i now come to the particulars of that most painful interview which has been the cause of all this controversy  my sister and myself were going from london to eversley to visit the rev c kingsley  on our way we stopped by lady byrons invitation to lunch with her at her summer residence on ham common near richmond and it was then arranged that on our return we should make her a short visit as she said she had a subject of importance on which she wished to converse with me alone  on our return from eversley we arrived at her house in the morning  it appeared to be one of lady byrons well days  she was up and dressed and moved about her house with her usual air of quiet simplicity as full of little acts of consideration for all about her as if they were the habitual invalids and she the well person  there were with her two ladies of her most intimate friends by whom she seemed to be regarded with a sort of worship  when she left the room for a moment they looked after her with a singular expression of respect and affection and expressed freely their admiration of her character and their fears that her unselfishness might be leading her to overexertion  after lunch i retired with lady byron and my sister remained with her friends  i should here remark that the chief subject of the conversation which ensued was not entirely new to me  in the interval between my first and second visits to england a lady who for many years had enjoyed lady byrons friendship and confidence had with her consent stated the case generally to me giving some of the incidents so that i was in a manner prepared for what followed  those who accuse lady byron of being a person fond of talking upon this subject and apt to make unconsidered confidences can have known very little of her of her reserve and of the apparent difficulty she had in speaking on subjects nearest her heart  her habitual calmness and composure of manner her collected dignity on all occasions are often mentioned by her husband sometimes with bitterness sometimes with admiration  he says though i accuse lady byron of an excess of selfrespect i must in candour admit that if ever a person had excuse for an extraordinary portion of it she has as in all her thoughts words and deeds she is the most decorous woman that ever existed and must appear what few i fancy could a perfectly refined gentlewoman even to her femme de chambre  this calmness and dignity were never more manifested than in this interview  in recalling the conversation at this distance of time i cannot remember all the language used  some particular words and forms of expression i do remember and those i give and in other cases i give my recollection of the substance of what was said  there was something awful to me in the intensity of repressed emotion which she showed as she proceeded  the great fact upon which all turned was stated in words that were unmistakable  he was guilty of incest with his sister  she here became so deathly pale that i feared she would faint and hastened to say my dear friend i have heard that  she asked quickly from whom and i answered from mrs  when she replied oh yes as if recollecting herself  i then asked her some questions in reply to which she said i will tell you  she then spoke of her first acquaintance with lord byron from which i gathered that she an only child brought up in retirement and living much within herself had been as deep natures often were intensely stirred by his poetry and had felt a deep interest in him personally as one that had the germs of all that is glorious and noble  when she was introduced to him and perceived his admiration of herself and at last received his offer although deeply moved she doubted her own power to be to him all that a wife should be  she declined his offer therefore but desired to retain his friendship  after this as she said a correspondence ensued mostly on moral and literary subjects and by this correspondence her interest in him was constantly increased  at last she said he sent her a very beautiful letter offering himself again  i thought she added that it was sincere and that i might now show him all i felt  i wrote just what was in my heart  afterwards she said i found in one of his journals this notice of my letter a letter from bellnever rains but it pours  there was through her habitual calm a shade of womanly indignation as she spoke these words but it was gone in a moment  i said and did he not love you then  she answered no my dear he did not love me  why then did he wish to marry you  she laid her hand on mine and said in a low voice you will see  she then told me that shortly after the declared engagement he came to her fathers house to visit her as an accepted suitor  the visit was to her full of disappointment  his appearance was so strange moody and unaccountable and his treatment of her so peculiar that she came to the conclusion that he did not love her and sought an opportunity to converse with him alone  she told him that she saw from his manner that their engagement did not give him pleasure that she should never blame him if he wished to dissolve it that his nature was exceptional and if on a nearer view of the situation he shrank from it she would release him and remain no less than ever his friend  upon this she said he fainted entirely away  she stopped a moment and then as if speaking with great effort added then i was sure he must love me  and did he not said i  what other cause could have led to this emotion  she looked at me very sadly and said fear of detection  what said i did that cause then exist  yes she said it did  and she explained that she now attributed lord byrons great agitation to fear that in some way suspicion of the crime had been aroused in her mind and that on this account she was seeking to break the engagement  she said that from that moment her sympathies were aroused for him to soothe the remorse and anguish which seemed preying on his mind and which she then regarded as the sensibility of an unusually exacting moral nature which judged itself by higher standards and condemned itself unsparingly for what most young men of his times regarded as venial faults  she had every hope for his future and all the enthusiasm of belief that so many men and women of those times and ours have had in his intrinsic nobleness  she said the gloom however seemed to be even deeper when he came to the marriage but she looked at it as the suffering of a peculiar being to whom she was called to minister  i said to her that even in the days of my childhood i had heard of something very painful that had passed as they were in the carriage immediately after marriage  she then said that it was so that almost his first words when they were alone were that she might once have saved him that if she had accepted him when he first offered she might have made him anything she pleased but that as it was she would find she had married a devil  the conversation as recorded in lady anne barnards diary seems only a continuation of the foregoing and just what might have followed upon it  i then asked how she became certain of the true cause  she said that from the outset of their married life his conduct towards her was strange and unaccountable even during the first weeks after the wedding while they were visiting her friends and outwardly on good terms  he seemed resolved to shake and combat both her religious principles and her views of the family state  he tried to undermine her faith in christianity as a rule of life by argument and by ridicule  he set before her the continental idea of the liberty of marriage it being a simple partnership of friendship and property the parties to which were allowed by one another to pursue their own separate individual tastes  he told her that as he could not be expected to confine himself to her neither should he expect or wish that she should confine herself to him that she was young and pretty and could have her lovers and he should never object and that she must allow him the same freedom  she said that she did not comprehend to what this was tending till after they came to london and his sister came to stay with them  at what precise time the idea of an improper connection between her husband and his sister was first forced upon her she did not say but she told me how it was done  she said that one night in her presence he treated his sister with a liberty which both shocked and astonished her  seeing her amazement and alarm he came up to her and said in a sneering tone i suppose you perceive you are not wanted here  go to your own room and leave us alone  we can amuse ourselves better without you  she said i went to my room trembling  i fell down on my knees and prayed to my heavenly father to have mercy on them  i thought what shall i do  i remember after this a pause in the conversation during which she seemed struggling with thoughts and emotions and for my part i was unable to utter a word or ask a question  she did not tell me what followed immediately upon this nor how soon after she spoke on the subject with either of the parties  she first began to speak of conversations afterwards held with lord byron in which he boldly avowed the connection as having existed in time past and as one that was to continue in time to come and implied that she must submit to it  she put it to his conscience as concerning his sisters soul and he said that it was no sin that it was the way the world was first peopled the scriptures taught that all the world descended from one pair and how could that be unless brothers married their sisters that if not a sin then it could not be a sin now  i immediately said why lady byron those are the very arguments given in the drama of cain  the very same was her reply  he could reason very speciously on this subject  she went on to say that when she pressed him hard with the universal sentiment of mankind as to the horror and the crime he took another turn and said that the horror and crime were the very attraction that he had worn out all ordinary forms of sin and that he longed for the stimulus of a new kind of vice  she set before him the dread of detection and then he became furious  she should never be the means of his detection he said  she should leave him that he was resolved upon but she should always bear all the blame of the separation  in the sneering tone which was common with him he said the world will believe me and it will not believe you  the world has made up its mind that by is a glorious boy and the world will go for by right or wrong  besides i shall make it my lifes object to discredit you i shall use all my powers  read caleb williams 161 and you will see that i shall do by you just as falkland did by caleb  i said that all this seemed to me like insanity  she said that she was for a time led to think that it was insanity and excused and pitied him that his treatment of her expressed such hatred and malignity that she knew not what else to think of it that he seemed resolved to drive her out of the house at all hazards and threatened her if she should remain in a way to alarm the heart of any woman yet thinking him insane she left him at last with the sorrow with which anyone might leave a dear friend whose reason was wholly overthrown and to whom in this desolation she was no longer permitted to minister  i inquired in one of the pauses of the conversation whether mrs leigh was a peculiarly beautiful or attractive woman  no my dear she was plain  was she then distinguished for genius or talent of any kind  oh no  poor woman she was weak relatively to him and wholly under his control  and what became of her i said  she afterwards repented and became a truly good woman  i think it was here she mentioned that she had frequently seen and conversed with mrs leigh in the latter part of her life and she seemed to derive comfort from the recollection  i asked was there a child  i had been told by mrs  that there was a daughter who had lived some years  she said there was one a daughter who made her friends much trouble being of a very difficult nature to manage  i had understood that at one time this daughter escaped from her friends to the continent and that lady byron assisted in efforts to recover her  of lady byrons kindness both to mrs leigh and the child i had before heard from mrs  who gave me my first information  it is also strongly impressed on my mind that lady byron in answer to some question of mine as to whether there was ever any meeting between lord byron and his sister after he left england answered that she had insisted upon it or made it a condition that mrs leigh should not go abroad to him  when the conversation as to events was over as i stood musing i said have you no evidence that he repented and alluded to the mystery of his death and the message be endeavoured to utter  she answered quickly and with great decision that whatever might have been his meaning at that hour she felt sure he had finally repented and added with great earnestness i do not believe that any child of the heavenly father is ever left to eternal sin  i said that such a hope was most delightful to my feelings but that i had always regarded the indulgence of it as a dangerous one  her look voice and manner at that moment are indelibly fixed in my mind  she looked at me so sadly so firmly and said  danger mrs stowe  what danger can come from indulging that hope like the danger that comes from not having it  i said in my turn what danger comes from not having it  the danger of losing all faith in god she said all hope for others all strength to try and save them  i once knew a lady she added who was in a state of scepticism and despair from belief in that doctrine  i think i saved her by giving her my faith  i was silent and she continued lord byron believed in eternal punishment fully for though he reasoned against christianity as it is commonly received he could not reason himself out of it and i think it made him desperate  he used to say the worst of it is i do believe had he seen god as i see him i am sure his heart would have relented  she went on to say that his sins great as they were admitted of much palliation and excuse that he was the child of singular and illmatched parents that he had an organisation originally fine but one capable equally of great good or great evil that in his childhood he had only the worst and most fatal influences that he grew up into manhood with no guide that there was everything in the classical course of the schools to develop an unhealthy growth of passion and no moral influence of any kind to restrain it that the manners of his day were corrupt that what were now considered vices in society were then spoken of as matters of course among young noblemen that drinking gaming and licentiousness everywhere abounded and that up to a certain time he was no worse than multitudes of other young men of his dayonly that the vices of his day were worse for him  the excesses of passion the disregard of physical laws in eating drinking and living wrought effects on him that they did not on less sensitively organised frames and prepared him for the evil hour when he fell into the sin which shaded his whole life  all the rest was a struggle with its consequencessinning more and more to conceal the sin of the past  but she believed he never outlived remorse that he always suffered and that this showed that god had not utterly forsaken him  remorse she said always showed moral sensibility and while that remained there was always hope  she now began to speak of her grounds for thinking it might be her duty fully to publish this story before she left the world  first she said that through the whole course of her life she had felt the eternal value of truth and seen how dreadful a thing was falsehood and how fearful it was to be an accomplice in it even by silence  lord byron had demoralised the moral sense of england and he had done it in a great degree by the sympathy excited by falsehood  this had been pleaded in extenuation of all his crimes and vices and led to a lowering of the standard of morals in the literary world  now it was proposed to print cheap editions of his works and sell them among the common people and interest them in him by the circulation of this same story  she then said in effect that she believed in retribution and suffering in the future life and that the consequences of sins here follow us there and it was strongly impressed upon her mind that lord byron must suffer in looking on the evil consequences of what he had done in this life and in seeing the further extension of that evil  it has sometimes strongly appeared to me she said that he cannot be at peace until this injustice has been righted  such is the strong feeling that i have when i think of going where he is  these things she said had led her to inquire whether it might not be her duty to make a full and clear disclosure before she left the world  of course i did not listen to this story as one who was investigating its worth  i received it as truth  and the purpose for which it was communicated was not to enable me to prove it to the world but to ask my opinion whether she should show it to the world before leaving it  the whole consultation was upon the assumption that she had at her command such proofs as could not be questioned  concerning what they were i did not minutely inquire only in answer to a general question she said that she had letters and documents in proof of her story  knowing lady byrons strength of mind her clearheadedness her accurate habits and her perfect knowledge of the matter i considered her judgment on this point decisive  i told her that i would take the subject into consideration and give my opinion in a few days  that night after my sister and myself had retired to our own apartment i related to her the whole history and we spent the night in talking of it  i was powerfully impressed with the justice and propriety of an immediate disclosure while she on the contrary represented the painful consequences that would probably come upon lady byron from taking such a step  before we parted the next day i requested lady byron to give me some memoranda of such dates and outlines of the general story as would enable me better to keep it in its connection which she did  on giving me the paper lady byron requested me to return it to her when it had ceased to be of use to me for the purpose indicated  accordingly a day or two after i enclosed it to her in a hasty note as i was then leaving london for paris and had not yet had time fully to consider the subject  on reviewing my note i can recall that then the whole history appeared to me like one of those singular cases where unnatural impulses to vice are the result of a taint of constitutional insanity  this has always seemed to me the only way of accounting for instances of utterly motiveless and abnormal wickedness and cruelty  these my first impressions were expressed in the hasty note written at the time                                  london nov 5 1856     dearest friendi return these  they have held mine eyes waking    how strange how unaccountable  have you ever subjected the facts to    the judgment of a medical man learned in nervous pathology     is it not insanity     great wits to madness nearly are allied    and thin partitions do their bounds divide     but my purpose tonight is not to write you fully what i think of    this matter  i am going to write to you from paris more at leisure  the rest of the letter was taken up in the final details of a charity in which lady byron had been engaged with me in assisting an unfortunate artist  it concludes thus     i write now in all haste en route for paris  as to america all is    not lost yet 168  farewell  i love you my dear friend as never    before with an intense feeling i cannot easily express  god bless    you                                          h b s  the next letter is as follows                                    paris dec 17 1856     dear lady byronthe kansas committee have written me a letter    desiring me to express to miss  their gratitude for the five    pounds she sent them  i am not personally acquainted with her and    must return these acknowledgments through you     i wrote you a day or two since enclosing the reply of the kansas    committee to you     on that subject on which you spoke to me the last time we were    together i have thought often and deeply     i have changed my mind somewhat  considering the peculiar    circumstances of the case i could wish that the sacred veil of    silence so bravely thrown over the past should never be withdrawn    during the time that you remain with us     i would say then leave all with some discreet friends who after    both have passed from earth shall say what was due to justice     i am led to think this by seeing how low how unjust how unworthy    the judgments of this world are and i would not that what i so much    respect love and revere should be placed within reach of its harpy    claw which pollutes what it touches     the day will yet come which will bring to light every hidden thing    there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed neither hid that    shall not be known and so justice will not fail     such my dear friend are my thoughts different from what they were    since first i heard that strange sad history  meanwhile i love you    ever whether we meet again on earth or not                                   affectionately yours                                        h b s  the following letter will here be inserted as confirming a part of lady byrons story                  to the editor of macmillans magazine     siri trust that you will hold me excused from any desire to be    troublesome or to rush into print  both these things are far from my    wish  but the publication of a book having for its object the    vindication of lord byrons character and the subsequent appearance    in your magazine of mrs stowes article in defence of lady byron    having led to so much controversy in the various newspapers of the    day i feel constrained to put in a few words among the rest     my father was intimately acquainted with lady byrons family for many    years both before and after her marriage being in fact steward to    sir ralph milbanke at seaham where the marriage took place and from    all my recollections of what he told me of the affair and he used    often to talk of it up to the time of his death eight years ago i    fully agree with mrs stowes view of the case and desire to add my    humble testimony to the truth of what she has stated     whilst byron was staying at seaham previous to his marriage he    spent most of his time pistolshooting in the plantations adjoining    the hall often making use of his glove as a mark his servant being    with him to load for him     when all was in readiness for the weddingceremony which took place    in the drawingroom of the hall byron had to be sought for in the    grounds where he was walking in his usual surly mood     after the marriage they posted to halnaby lodge in yorkshire a    distance of about forty miles to which place my father accompanied    them and he always spoke strongly of lady byrons apparent distress    during and at the end of the journey     the insulting words mentioned by mrs stowe were spoken by byron    before leaving the park at seaham after which he appeared to sit in    moody silence reading a book for the rest of the journey  at    halnaby a number of persons tenants and others were met to cheer    them on their arrival  of these he took not the slightest notice but    jumped out of the carriage and walked away leaving his bride to    alight by herself  she shook hands with my father and begged that he    would see that some refreshment was supplied to those who had thus    come to welcome them     i have in my possession several letters which i should be glad to    show to anyone interested in the matter both from lady byron and her    mother lady milbanke to my father all showing the deep and kind    interest which they took in the welfare of all connected with them    and directing the distribution of various charities etc  pensions    were allowed both to the old servants of the milbankes and to several    poor persons in the village and neighbourhood for the rest of their    lives and lady byron never ceased to take a lively interest in all    that concerned them     i desire to tender my humble thanks to mrs stowe for having come    forward in defence of one whose character has been much    misrepresented and to you sir for having published the same in your    pages                       i have the honour to be sir yours obediently                                       g h aird     daourty northamptonshire sept 29 1869    chapter iii  chronological summary of events   i have now fulfilled as conscientiously as possible the requests of those who feel that they have a right to know exactly what was said in this interview  it has been my object in doing this to place myself just where i should stand were i giving evidence under oath before a legal tribunal  in my first published account there were given some smaller details of the story of no particular value to the main purpose of it which i received not from lady byron but from her confidential friend  one of these was the account of her seeing lord byrons favourite spaniel lying at his door and the other was the scene of the parting  the first was communicated to me before i ever saw lady byron and under these circumstancesi was invited to meet her and had expressed my desire to do so because lord byron had been all my life an object of great interest to me  i inquired what sort of a person lady byron was my friend spoke of her with enthusiasm  i then said but of course she never loved lord byron or she would not have left him  the lady answered i can show you with what feelings she left him by relating this story and then followed the anecdote  subsequently she also related to me the other story of the partingscene between lord and lady byron  in regard to these two incidents my recollection is clear  it will be observed by the reader that lady byrons conversation with me was simply for consultation on one point and that point whether she herself should publish the story before her death  it was not therefore a complete history of all the events in their order but specimens of a few incidents and facts  her object was not to prove her story to me nor to put me in possession of it with a view to my proving it but simply and briefly to show me what it was that i might judge as to the probable results of its publication at that time  it therefore comprised primarily these points  1  an exact statement in so many words of the crime  2  a statement of the manner in which it was first forced on her attention by lord byrons words and actions including his admissions and defences of it  3  the admission of a period when she had ascribed his whole conduct to insanity  4  a reference to later positive evidences of guilt the existence of a child and mrs leighs subsequent repentance  and here i have a word to say in reference to the alleged inaccuracies of my true story  the dates that lady byron gave me on the memoranda did not relate either to the time of the first disclosure or the period when her doubts became certainties nor did her conversation touch either of these points and on a careful review of the latter i see clearly that it omitted dwelling upon anything which i might be supposed to have learned from her already published statement  i reenclosed that paper to her from london and have never seen it since  in writing my account which i designed to do in the most general terms i took for my guide miss martineaus published memoir of lady byron which has long stood uncontradicted before the public of which macmillans london edition is now before me  the reader is referred to page 316 which reads thus  she was born 1792 married in january 1814 returned to her fathers house in 1816 died on may 16 1860  this makes her married life two years but we need not say that the date is inaccurate as lady byron was married in 1815  supposing lady byrons married life to have covered two years i could only reconcile its continuance for that length of time to her uncertainty as to his sanity to deceptions practised on her making her doubt at one time and believe at another and his keeping her in a general state of turmoil and confusion till at last he took the step of banishing her  various other points taken from miss martineau have also been attacked as inaccuracies for example the number of executions in the house but these points though of no importance are substantially borne out by moores statements  this controversy unfortunately cannot be managed with the accuracy of a legal trial  its course hitherto has rather resembled the course of a drawingroom scandal where everyone freely throws in an assertion with or without proof  in making out my narrative however i shall use only certain authentic sources some of which have for a long time been before the public and some of which have floated up from the waves of the recent controversy  i consider as authentic sources  moores life of byron  lady byrons own account of the separation published in 1830  lady byrons statements to me in 1856  lord lindsays communication giving an extract from lady anne barnards diary and a copy of a letter from lady byron dated 1818 about three years after her marriage  mrs mimms testimony as given in a daily paper published at newcastle england  and lady byrons letters as given recently in the late london quarterly  all which documents appear to arrange themselves into a connected series  from these then let us construct the story  according to mrs mimms account which is likely to be accurate the time spent by lord and lady byron in bridalvisiting was three weeks at halnaby hall and six weeks at seaham when mrs mimms quitted their service  during this first period of three weeks lord byrons treatment of his wife as testified to by the servant was such that she advised her young mistress to return to her parents and at one time lady byron had almost resolved to do so  what the particulars of his conduct were the servant refuses to state being bound by a promise of silence to her mistress  she however testifies to a warm friendship existing between lady byron and mrs leigh in a manner which would lead us to feel that lady byron received and was received by lord byrons sister with the greatest affection  lady byron herself says to lady anne barnard i had heard that he was the best of brothers and the inference is that she at an early period of her married life felt the greatest confidence in his sister and wished to have her with them as much as possible  in lady annes account this wish to have the sister with her was increased by lady byrons distress at her husbands attempts to corrupt her principles with regard to religion and marriage  in moores life vol iii letter 217 lord byron writes from seaham to moore under date of march 8 sending a copy of his verses in lady byrons handwriting and saying we shall leave this place tomorrow and shall stop on our way to town in the interval of taking a house there at colonel leighs near newmarket where any epistle of yours will find its welcome way  i have been very comfortable here listening to that dd monologue which elderly gentlemen call conversation in which my pious fatherinlaw repeats himself every evening save one when he played upon the fiddle  however they have been vastly kind and hospitable and i like them and the place vastly and i hope they will live many happy months  bell is in health and unvaried goodhumour and behaviour but we are in all the agonies of packing and parting  nine days after this under date of march 17 lord byron says we mean to metropolize tomorrow and you will address your next to piccadilly the inference is that the days intermediate were spent at colonel leighs  the next letters and all subsequent ones for six months are dated from piccadilly  as we have shown there is every reason to believe that a warm friendship had thus arisen between mrs leigh and lady byron and that during all this time lady byron desired as much of the society of her sisterinlaw as possible  she was a married woman and a mother her husbands nearest relative and lady byron could with more propriety ask from her counsel or aid in respect to his peculiarities than she could from her own parents  if we consider the character of lady byron as given by mrs mimms that of a young person of warm but repressed feeling without sister or brother longing for human sympathy and having so far found no relief but in talking with a faithful dependantwe may easily see that the acquisition of a sister through lord byron might have been all in all to her and that the feelings which he checked and rejected for himself might have flowed out towards his sister with enthusiasm  the date of mrs leighs visit does not appear  the first domestic indication in lord byrons letters from london is the announcement of the death of lady byrons uncle lord wentworth from whom came large expectations of property  lord byron had mentioned him before in his letters as so kind to bell and himself that he could not find it in his heart to wish him in heaven if he preferred staying here in his letter of april 23 he mentions going to the play immediately after hearing this news although as he says he ought to have stayed at home in sackcloth for unc  on june 12 he writes that lady byron is more than three months advanced in her progress towards maternity and that they have been out very little as he wishes to keep her quiet  we are informed by moore that lord byron was at this time a member of the drurylane theatre committee and that in this unlucky connection one of the fatalities of the first year of trial as a husband lay  from the strain of byrons letters as given in moore it is apparent that while he thinks it best for his wife to remain at home he does not propose to share the retirement but prefers running his own separate career with such persons as thronged the greenroom of the theatre in those days  in commenting on lord byrons course we must not by any means be supposed to indicate that he was doing any more or worse than most gay young men of his time  the licence of the day as to getting drunk at dinnerparties and leading generally what would in these days be called a disorderly life was great  we should infer that none of the literary men of byrons time would have been ashamed of being drunk occasionally  the noctes ambrosianae club of blackwood is full of songs glorying in the broadest terms in outandout drunkenness and inviting to it as the highest condition of a civilised being 178a  but drunkenness upon lord byron had a peculiar and specific effect which he notices afterwards in his journal at venice the effect of all wines and spirits upon me is however strange  it settles but makes me gloomygloomy at the very moment of their effect it composes however though sullenly 178b  and again in another place he says wine and spirits make me sullen and savage to ferocity  it is well known that the effects of alcoholic excitement are various as the natures of the subjects  but by far the worst effects and the most destructive to domestic peace are those that occur in cases where spirits instead of acting on the nerves of motion and depriving the subject of power in that direction stimulate the brain so as to produce there the ferocity the steadiness the utter deadness to compassion or conscience which characterise a madman  how fearful to a sensitive young mother in the period of pregnancy might be the return of such a madman to the domestic roof  nor can we account for those scenes described in lady anne barnards letters where lord byron returned from his evening parties to try torturing experiments on his wife otherwise than by his own statement that spirits while they steadied him made him gloomy and savage to ferocity  take for example this     one night coming home from one of his lawless parties he saw me    lady b so indignantly collected and bearing all with such a    determined calmness that a rush of remorse seemed to come over him    he called himself a monster and though his sister was present threw    himself in agony at my feet  i could not no i could not forgive    him such injuries  he had lost me forever  astonished at this    return to virtue my tears i believe flowed over his face and i    said byron all is forgotten never never shall you hear of it    more     he started up and folding his arms while he looked at me burst out    into laughter  what do you mean said i  only a philosophical    experiment thats all said he  i wished to ascertain the value of    your resolutions  to ascribe such deliberate cruelty as this to the effect of drink upon lord byron is the most charitable construction that can be put upon his conduct  yet the manners of the period were such that lord byron must have often come to this condition while only doing what many of his acquaintances did freely and without fear of consequences  mr moore with his usual artlessness gives us an idea of a private supper between himself and lord byron  we give it with our own italics as a specimen of many others     having taken upon me to order the repast and knowing that lord byron    for the last two days had done nothing towards sustenance beyond    eating a few biscuits and to appease appetite chewing mastic i    desired that we should have a good supply of at least two kinds of    fish  my companion however confined himself to lobsters and of    these finished two or three to his own share interposing sometimes    a small liqueurglass of strong white brandy sometimes a tumbler of    very hot water and then pure brandy again to the amount of near half    a dozen small glasses of the latter without which alternately with    the hot water he appeared to think the lobster could not be digested    after this we had claret of which having despatched two bottles    between us at about four oclock in the morning we parted     as pope has thought his delicious lobsternights worth    commemorating these particulars of one in which lord byron was    concerned may also have some interest     among other nights of the same description which i had the happiness    of passing with him i remember once in returning home from some    assembly at rather a late hour we saw lights in the windows of his    old haunt stevenss in bond street and agreed to stop there and sup    on entering we found an old friend of his sir g w who    joined our party and the lobsters and brandy and water being put in    requisition it was as usual on such occasions broad daylight before    we separatedvol iii p83  during the latter part of lady byrons pregnancy it appears from moore that byron was night after night engaged out at dinner parties in which getting drunk was considered as of course the finale as appears from the following letters                                 letter 228                                 to mr moore                                     terrace piccadilly oct 311815     i have not been able to ascertain precisely the time of duration of    the stockmarket but i believe it is a good time for selling out and    i hope so  first because i shall see you and next because i shall    receive certain moneys on behalf of lady b the which will materially    conduce to my comfort i wanting as the duns say to make up a sum     yesterday i dined out with a largeish party where were sheridan and    colman harry harris of c g and his brother sir gilbert    heathcote ds kinnaird and others of note and notoriety  like other    parties of the kind it was first silent then talky then    argumentative then disputatious then unintelligible  then    altogethery then inarticulate and then drunk  when we had reached    the last step of this glorious ladder it was difficult to get down    again without stumbling and to crown all kinnaird and i had to    conduct sheridan down a dd corkscrew staircase which had certainly    been constructed before the discovery of fermented liquors and to    which no legs however crooked could possibly accommodate themselves    we deposited him safe at home where his man evidently used to the    business 181 waited to receive him in the hall     both he and colman were as usual very good but i carried away much    wine and the wine had previously carried away my memory so that all    was hiccough and happiness for the last hour or so and i am not    impregnated with any of the conversation  perhaps you heard of a late    answer of sheridan to the watchman who found him bereft of that    divine particle of air called reason    he the watchman found    sherry in the street fuddled and bewildered and almost insensible    who are you sirno answer  whats your namea hiccough    whats your nameanswer in a slow deliberate and impassive    tone wilberforce  is not that sherry all overand to my mind    excellent  poor fellow his very dregs are better than the first    sprightly runnings of others     my paper is full and i have a grievous headache     pslady b is in full progress  next month will bring to light    with the aid of juno lucina fer opem or rather opes for the last    are most wanted the tenth wonder of the world gil blas being the    eighth and he my sons father the ninth  here we have a picture of the whole storylady byron within a month of her confinement her money being used to settle debts her husband out at a dinnerparty going through the usual course of such parties able to keep his legs and help sheridan downstairs and going home gloomy and savage to ferocity to his wife  four days after this letter 229 we find that this dinnerparty is not an exceptional one but one of a series for he says today i dine with kinnairdwe are to have sheridan and colman again and tomorrow once more at sir gilbert heathcotes  afterward in venice he reviews the state of his health at this period in london and his account shows that his excesses in the vices of his times had wrought effects on his sensitive nervous organisation very different from what they might on the more phlegmatic constitutions of ordinary englishmen  in his journal dated venice feb 2 1821 he says     i have been considering what can be the reason why i always wake at a    certain hour in the morning and always in very bad spiritsi may    say in actual despair and despondency in all respects even of that    which pleased me over night  in about an hour or two this goes off    and i compose either to sleep again or at least to quiet  in    england five years ago i had the same kind of hypochondria but    accompanied with so violent a thirst that i have drunk as many as    fifteen bottles of sodawater in one night after going to bed and    been still thirstycalculating however some lost from the bursting    out and effervescence and overflowing of the sodawater in drawing the    corks or striking off the necks of the bottles from mere thirsty    impatience  at present i have not the thirst but the depression of    spirits is no less violentvol v p96  these extracts go to show what must have been the condition of the man whom lady byron was called to receive at the intervals when he came back from his various social excitements and pleasures  that his nerves were exacerbated by violent extremes of abstinence and reckless indulgence that he was often day after day drunk and that drunkenness made him savage and ferocioussuch are the facts clearly shown by mr moores narrative  of the natural peculiarities of lord byrons temper he thus speaks to the countess of blessington     i often think that i inherit my violence and bad temper from my poor    mother not that my father from all i could ever learn had a much    better so that it is no wonder i have such a very bad one  as long    as i can remember anything i recollect being subject to violent    paroxysms of rage so disproportioned to the cause as to surprise me    when they were over and this still continues  i cannot coolly view    any thing which excites my feelings and once the lurking devil in me    is roused i lose all command of myself  i do not recover a good fit    of rage for days after  mind i do not by this mean that the ill    humour continues as on the contrary that quickly subsides    exhausted by its own violence but it shakes me terribly and leaves    me low and nervous afterlady blessingtons conversations p142  that during this time also his irritation and ill temper were increased by the mortification of duns debts and executions is on the face of moores story  moore himself relates one incident which gives some idea of the many which may have occurred at these times in a note on p215 vol iv where he speaks of lord byrons destroying a favourite old watch that had been his companion from boyhood and gone with him to greece  in a fit of vexation and rage brought upon him by some of these humiliating embarrassments to which he was now almost daily a prey he furiously dashed this watch on the hearth and ground it to pieces with the poker among the ashes  it is no wonder that with a man of this kind to manage lady byron should have clung to the only female companionship she could dare to trust in the case and earnestly desired to retain with her the sister who seemed more than herself to have influence over him  the first letter given by the quarterly from lady byron to mrs leigh without a date evidently belongs to this period when the sisters society presented itself as a refuge in her approaching confinement  mrs leigh speaks of leaving  the young wife conscious that the house presents no attractions and that soon she herself shall be laid by cannot urge mrs leighs stay as likely to give her any pleasure but only as a comfort to herself     you will think me very foolish but i have tried two or three times    and cannot talk to you of your departure with a decent visage so let    me say one word in this way to spare my philosophy  with the    expectations which i have i never will nor can ask you to stay one    moment longer than you are inclined to do  it would be the worst    return for all i ever received from you  but in this at least i am    truth itself when i say that whatever the situation may be there    is no one whose society is dearer to me or can contribute more to my    happiness  these feelings will not change under any circumstances    and i should be grieved if you did not understand them  should you    hereafter condemn me i shall not love you less  i will say no more    judge for yourself about going or staying  i wish you to consider    yourself if you could be wise enough to do that for the first time    in your life                                        thine                                             a i b     addressed on the cover to the hon mrs leigh  this letter not being dated we have no clue but what we obtain from its own internal evidence  it certainly is not written in lady byrons usual clear and elegant style and is in this respect in striking contrast to all her letters that i have ever seen  but the notes written by a young woman under such peculiar and distressing circumstances must not be judged by the standard of calmer hours  subsequently to this letter and during that stormy irrational period when lord byrons conduct became daily more and more unaccountable may have come that startling scene in which lord byron took every pains to convince his wife of improper relations subsisting between himself and his sister  what an utter desolation this must have been to the wife tearing from her the last hold of friendship and the last refuge to which she had clung in her sorrows may easily be conceived  in this crisis it appears that the sister convinced lady byron that the whole was to be attributed to insanity  it would be a conviction gladly accepted and bringing infinite relief although still surrounding her path with fearful difficulties  that such was the case is plainly asserted by lady byron in her statement published in 1830  speaking of her separation lady byron says     the facts are i left london for kirkby mallory the residence of my    father and mother on the 15th of january 1816  lord byron had    signified to me in writing jan 6 his absolute desire that i should    leave london on the earliest day that i could conveniently fix  it    was not safe for me to encounter the fatigues of a journey sooner than    the 15th  previously to my departure it had been strongly impressed    on my mind that lord byron was under the influence of insanity     this opinion was in a great measure derived from the communications    made to me by his nearest relatives and personal attendant  now there was no nearer relative than mrs leigh and the personal attendant was fletcher  it was therefore presumably mrs leigh who convinced lady byron of her husbands insanity  lady byron says it was even represented to me that he was in danger of destroying himself  with the concurrence of his family i had consulted with dr baillie as a friend on jan 8 as to his supposed malady  now lord byrons written order for her to leave came on jan 6  it appears then that lady byron acting in concurrence with mrs leigh and others of her husbands family consulted dr baillie on jan 8 as to what she should do the symptoms presented to dr baillie being evidently insane hatred of his wife on the part of lord byron and a determination to get her out of the house  lady byron goes on     on acquainting him with the state of the case and with lord byrons    desire that i should leave london dr baillie thought my absence    might be advisable as an experiment assuming the fact of mental    derangement for dr baillie not having had access to lord byron    could not pronounce an opinion on that point  he enjoined that in    correspondence with lord byron i should avoid all but light and    soothing topics  under these impressions i left london determined    to follow the advice given me by dr baillie  whatever might have    been the nature of lord byrons treatment of me from the time of my    marriage yet supposing him to have been in a state of mental    alienation it was not for me nor for any person of common humanity    to manifest at that moment a sense of injury  it appears then that the domestic situation in byrons house at the time of his wifes expulsion was one so grave as to call for family counsel for lady byron generally accurate speaks in the plural number his nearest relatives certainly includes mrs leigh  his family includes more  that some of lord byrons own relatives were cognisant of facts at this time and that they took lady byrons side is shown by one of his own chance admissions  in vol vi p394 in a letter on bowles he says speaking of this time all my relations save one fell from me like leaves from a tree in autumn  and in medwins conversations he says even my cousin george byron who had been brought up with me and whom i loved as a brother took my wifes part  the conduct must have been marked in the extreme that led to this result  we cannot help stopping here to say that lady byrons situation at this time has been discussed in our days with a want of ordinary human feeling that is surprising  let any father and mother reading this look on their own daughter and try to make the case their own  after a few short months of married lifemonths full of patient endurance of the strangest and most unaccountable treatmentshe comes to them expelled from her husbands house an object of hatred and aversion to him and having to settle for herself the awful question whether he is a dangerous madman or a determined villain  such was this young wifes situation  with a heart at times wrung with compassion for her husband as a helpless maniac and fearful that all may end in suicide yet compelled to leave him she writes on the road the muchquoted letter beginning dear duck  this is an exaggerated and unnatural letter it is true but of precisely the character that might be expected from an inexperienced young wife when dealing with a husband supposed to be insane  the next day she addressed to augusta this letter     my dearest ait is my great comfort that you are still in    piccadilly  and again on the 23rd     dearest ai know you feel for me as i do for you and perhaps i    am better understood than i think  you have been ever since i knew    you my best comforter and will so remain unless you grow tired of    the officewhich may well be  we can see here how selfdenying and heroic appears to lady byron the conduct of the sister who patiently remains to soothe and guide and restrain the moody madman whose madness takes a form at times so repulsive to every womanly feeling  she intimates that she should not wonder should augusta grow weary of the office  lady byron continues her statement thus     when i arrived at kirkby mallory my parents were unacquainted with    the existence of any causes likely to destroy my prospects of    happiness and when i communicated to them the opinion that had been    formed concerning lord byrons state of mind they were most anxious    to promote his restoration by every means in their power  they    assured those relations that were with him in london that they would    devote their whole case and attention to the alleviation of his    malady  here we have a quotation 190a from a letter written by lady milbanke to the anxious relations who are taking counsel about lord byron in town lady byron also adds in justification of her mother from lord byrons slanders she had always treated him with an affectionate consideration and indulgence which extended to every little peculiarity of his feelings  never did an irritating word escape her lips in her whole intercourse with him  now comes a remarkable part of lady byrons statement     the accounts given me after i left lord byron by those in constant    intercourse with him 190b added to those doubts which had before    transiently occurred to my mind as to the reality of the alleged    disease and the reports of his medical attendants were far from    establishing anything like lunacy  when these doubts arose in her mind it is not natural to suppose that they should at first involve mrs leigh  she still appears to lady byron as the devoted believing sister fully convinced of her brothers insanity and endeavouring to restrain and control him  but if lord byron were sane if the purposes he had avowed to his wife were real he must have lied about his sister in the past and perhaps have the worst intentions for the future  the horrors of that state of vacillation between the conviction of insanity and the commencing conviction of something worse can scarcely be told  at all events the wifes doubts extend so far that she speaks out to her parents  under this uncertainty says the statement i deemed it right to communicate to my parents that if i were to consider lord byrons past conduct as that of a person of sound mind nothing could induce me to return to him  it therefore appeared expedient both to them and to myself to consult the ablest advisers  for that object and also to obtain still further information respecting appearances which indicated mental derangement my mother determined to go to london  she was empowered by me to take legal opinion on a written statement of mine though i then had reasons for reserving a part of the case from the knowledge even of my father and mother  it is during this time of uncertainty that the next letter to mrs leigh may be placed  it seems to be rather a fragment of a letter than a whole one perhaps it is an extract in which case it would be desirable if possible to view it in connection with the remaining text                                            jan 25 1816     my dearest augustashall i still be your sister  i must resign my    right to be so considered but i dont think that will make any    difference in the kindness i have so uniformly experienced from you  this fragment is not signed nor finished in any way but indicates that the writer is about to take a decisive step  on the 17th as we have seen lady milbanke had written inviting lord byron  subsequently she went to london to make more particular inquiries into his state  this fragment seems part of a letter from lady byron called forth in view of some evidence resulting from her mothers observations 192  lady byron now adds     being convinced by the result of these inquiries and by the tenour    of lord byrons proceedings that the notion of insanity was an    illusion i no longer hesitated to authorize such measures as were    necessary in order to secure me from ever being again placed in his    power     conformably with this resolution my father wrote to him on the 2nd    of february to request an amicable separation  the following letter to mrs leigh is dated the day after this application and is in many respects a noticeable one                                 kirkby mallory feb 3 1816     my dearest augustayou are desired by your brother to ask if my    father has acted with my concurrence in proposing a separation  he    has  it cannot be supposed that in my present distressing    situation i am capable of stating in a detailed manner the reasons    which will not only justify this measure but compel me to take it    and it never can be my wish to remember unnecessarily sic those    injuries for which however deep i feel no resentment  i will now    only recall to lord byrons mind his avowed and insurmountable    aversion to the married state and the desire and determination he has    expressed ever since its commencement to free himself from that    bondage as finding it quite insupportable though candidly    acknowledging that no effort of duty or affection has been wanting on    my part  he has too painfully convinced me that all these attempts to    contribute towards his happiness were wholly useless and most    unwelcome to him  i enclose this letter to my father wishing it to    receive his sanction                                ever yours most affectionately                                      a i byron  we observe in this letter that it is written to be shown to lady byrons father and receive his sanction and as that father was in ignorance of all the deeper causes of trouble in the case it will be seen that the letter must necessarily be a reserved one  this sufficiently accounts for the guarded character of the language when speaking of the causes of separation  one part of the letter incidentally overthrows lord byrons statement which he always repeated during his life and which is repeated for him now namely that his wife forsook him instead of being as she claims expelled by him  she recalls to lord byrons mind the desire and determination he has expressed ever since his marriage to free himself from its bondage  this is in perfect keeping with the absolute desire signified by writing that she should leave his house on the earliest day possible and she places the cause of the separation on his having too painfully convinced her that he does not want heras a wife  it appears that augusta hesitates to show this note to her brother  it is bringing on a crisis which she above all others would most wish to avoid  in the meantime lady byron receives a letter from lord byron which makes her feel it more than ever essential to make the decision final  i have reason to believe that this letter is preserved in lady byrons papers                                         feb 4 1816     i hope my dear a that you would on no account withhold from your    brother the letter which i sent yesterday in answer to yours written    by his desire particularly as one which i have received from himself    today renders it still more important that he should know the    contents of that addressed to you  i am in haste and not very well                                   yours most affectionately                                      a i byron  the last of this series of letters is less like the style of lady byron than any of them  we cannot judge whether it is a whole consecutive letter or fragments from a letter selected and united  there is a great want of that clearness and precision which usually characterised lady byrons style  it shows however that the decision is madea decision which she regrets on account of the sister who has tried so long to prevent it                                   kirkby mallory feb 14 1816     the present sufferings of all may yet be repaid in blessings  do not    despair absolutely dearest and leave me but enough of your interest    to afford you any consolation by partaking of that sorrow which i am    most unhappy to cause thus unintentionally  you will be of my opinion    hereafter and at present your bitterest reproach would be forgiven    though heaven knows you have considered me more than a thousand would    have donemore than anything but my affection for b one most dear    to you could deserve  i must not remember these feelings  farewell    god bless you from the bottom of my heart                                           a i b  we are here to consider that mrs leigh has stood to lady byron in all this long agony as her only confidante and friend that she has denied the charges her brother has made and referred them to insanity admitting insane attempts upon herself which she has been obliged to watch over and control  lady byron has come to the conclusion that augusta is mistaken as to insanity that there is a real wicked purpose and desire on the part of the brother not as yet believed in by the sister  she regards the sister as one who though deceived and blinded is still worthy of confidence and consideration and so says to her you will be of my opinion hereafter  she says you have considered me more than a thousand would have done mrs leigh is in lady byrons eyes a most abused and innocent woman who to spare her sister in her delicate situation has taken on herself the whole charge of a maniacal brother although suffering from him language and actions of the most injurious kind  that mrs leigh did not flee the house at once under such circumstances and wholly decline the management of the case seems to lady byron consideration and selfsacrifice greater than she can acknowledge  the knowledge of the whole extent of the truth came to lady byrons mind at a later period  we now take up the history from lushingtons letter to lady byron published at the close of her statement  the application to lord byron for an act of separation was positively refused at first it being an important part of his policy that all the responsibility and insistence should come from his wife and that he should appear forced into it contrary to his will  dr lushington however says to lady byron     i was originally consulted by lady noel on your behalf while you were    in the country  the circumstances detailed by her were such as    justified a separation but they were not of that aggravated    description as to render such a measure indispensable  on lady noels    representations i deemed a reconciliation with lord byron    practicable and felt most sincerely a wish to aid in effecting it    there was not on lady noels part any exaggeration of the facts    nor so far as i could perceive any determination to prevent a return    to lord byron certainly none was expressed when i spoke of a    reconciliation  in this crisis with lord byron refusing the separation with lushington expressing a wish to aid in a reconciliation and lady noel not expressing any aversion to it the whole strain of the dreadful responsibility comes upon the wife  she resolves to ask counsel of her lawyer in view of a statement of the whole case  lady byron is spoken of by lord byron letter 233 as being in town with her father on the 29th of february viz fifteen days after the date of the last letter to mrs leigh  it must have been about this time then that she laid her whole case before lushington and he gave it a thorough examination  the result was that lushington expressed in the most decided terms his conviction that reconciliation was impossible  the language be uses is very striking     when you came to town in about a fortnight or perhaps more after my    first interview with lady noel i was for the first time informed by    you of facts utterly unknown as i have no doubt to sir ralph and    lady noel  on receiving this additional information my opinion was    entirely changed  i considered a reconciliation impossible  i    declared my opinion and added that if such an idea should be    entertained i could not either professionally or otherwise take any    part towards effecting it  it does not appear in this note what effect the lawyers examination of the case had on lady byrons mind  by the expressions he uses we should infer that she may still have been hesitating as to whether a reconciliation might not be her duty  this hesitancy he does away with most decisively saying a reconciliation is impossible and supposing lady byron or her friends desirous of one he declares positively that he cannot either professionally as a lawyer or privately as a friend have anything to do with effecting it  the lawyer it appears has drawn from the facts of the case inferences deeper and stronger than those which presented themselves to the mind of the young woman and he instructs her in the most absolute terms  fourteen years after in 1830 for the first time the world was astonished by this declaration from dr lushington in language so pronounced and positive that there could be no mistake  lady byron had stood all these fourteen years slandered by her husband and misunderstood by his friends when had she so chosen this opinion of dr lushingtons could have been at once made public which fully justified her conduct  if as the blackwood of july insinuates the story told to lushington was a malignant slander meant to injure lord byron why did she suppress the judgment of her counsel at a time when all the world was on her side and this decision would have been the decisive blow against her husband why by sealing the lips of counsel and of all whom she could influence did she deprive herself finally of the very advantage for which it has been assumed she fabricated the story    chapter iv  the character of the two witnesses compared   it will be observed that in this controversy we are confronting two opposing storiesone of lord and the other of lady byron and the statements from each are in pointblank contradiction  lord byron states that his wife deserted him  lady byron states that he expelled her and reminds him in her letter to augusta leigh that the expulsion was a deliberate one and that he had purposed it from the beginning of their marriage  lord byron always stated that he was ignorant why his wife left him and was desirous of her return  lady byron states that he told her that he would force her to leave him and to leave him in such a way that the whole blame of the separation should always rest on her and not on him  to say nothing of any deeper or darker accusations on either side here in the very outworks of the story the two meet pointblank  in considering two opposing stories we always as a matter of fact take into account the character of the witnesses  if a person be literal and exact in his usual modes of speech reserved careful conscientious and in the habit of observing minutely the minor details of time place and circumstances we give weight to his testimony from these considerations  but if a person be proved to have singular and exceptional principles with regard to truth if he be universally held by society to be so in the habit of mystification that large allowances must be made for his statements if his assertions at one time contradict those made at another and if his statements also sometimes come in collision with those of his best friends so that when his language is reported difficulties follow and explanations are made necessaryall this certainly disqualifies him from being considered a trustworthy witness  all these disqualifications belong in a remarkable degree to lord byron on the oftrepeated testimony of his best friends  we shall first cite the following testimony given in an article from under the crown which is written by an early friend and ardent admirer of lord byron     byron had one preeminent faulta fault which must be considered as    deeply criminal by everyone who does not as i do believe it to have    resulted from monomania  he had a morbid love of a bad reputation    there was hardly an offence of which he would not with perfect    indifference accuse himself  an old schoolfellow who met him on the    continent told me that he would continually write paragraphs against    himself in the foreign journals and delight in their republication by    the english newspapers as in the success of a practical joke  whenever    anybody has related anything discreditable of byron assuring me that    it must be true for he heard it from himself i always felt that he    could not have spoken upon worse authority and that in all    probability the tale was a pure invention  if i could remember and    were willing to repeat the various misdoings which i have from time    to time heard him attribute to himself i could fill a volume  but i    never believed them  i very soon became aware of this strange    idiosyncrasy it puzzled me to account for it but there it was a    sort of diseased and distorted vanity  the same eccentric spirit    would induce him to report things which were false with regard to his    family which anybody else would have concealed though true  he told    me more than once that his father was insane and killed himself  i    shall never forget the manner in which he first told me this  while    washing his hands and singing a gay neapolitan air he stopped    looked round at me and said there always was madness in the    family  then after continuing his washing and his song he added    as if speaking of a matter of the slightest indifference my father    cut his throat  the contrast between the tenour of the subject and    the levity of the expression was fearfully painful it was like a    stanza of don juan  in this instance i had no doubt that the fact    was as he related it but in speaking of it only a few years since    to an old lady in whom i had perfect confidence she assured me that    it was not so  mr byron who was her cousin had been extremely    wild but was quite sane and had died very quietly in his bed  what    byrons reason could have been for thus calumniating not only himself    but the blood which was flowing in his veins who can divine  but    for some reason or other it seemed to be his determined purpose to    keep himself unknown to the great body of his fellowcreatures to    present himself to their view in moral masquerade  certainly the character of lord byron here given by his friend is not the kind to make him a trustworthy witness in any case on the contrary it seems to show either a subtle delight in falsehood for falsehoods sake or else the wary artifices of a man who having a deadly secret to conceal employs many turnings and windings to throw the world off the scent  what intriguer having a crime to cover could devise a more artful course than to send half a dozen absurd stories to the press which should after a while be traced back to himself till the public should gradually look on all it heard from him as the result of this eccentric humour  the easy trifling air with which lord byron made to this friend a false statement in regard to his father would lead naturally to the inquiry on what other subjects equally important to the good name of others he might give false testimony with equal indifference  when medwins conversations with lord byron were first published they contained a number of declarations of the noble lord affecting the honour and honesty of his friend and publisher murray  these appear to have been made in the same way as those about his father and with equal indifference  so serious were the charges that mr murrays friends felt that he ought in justice to himself to come forward and confront them with the facts as stated in byrons letters to himself and in vol x p143 of murrays standard edition accordingly these false statements are confronted with the letters of lord byron  the statements as reported are of a most material and vital nature relating to murrays financial honour and honesty and to his general truthfulness and sincerity  in reply murray opposes to them the accounts of sums paid for different works and letters from byron exactly contradicting his own statements as to murrays character  the subject as we have seen was discussed in the noctes  no doubt appears to be entertained that byron made the statements to medwin and the theory of accounting for them is that byron was bamming him  it seems never to have occurred to any of these credulous gentlemen who laughed at others for being bammed that byron might be doing the very same thing by themselves  how many of his socalled packages sent to lady byron were real packages and how many were mystifications  we find in two places at least in his memoir letters to lady byron written and shown to others which he says were never sent by him  he told lady blessington that he was in the habit of writing to her constantly  was this bamming  was he bamming also when he told the world that lady byron suddenly deserted him quite to his surprise and that he never to his dying day could find out why  lady blessington relates that in one of his conversations with her he entertained her by repeating epigrams and lampoons in which many of his friends were treated with severity  she inquired of him in case he should die and such proofs of his friendship come before the public what would be the feelings of these friends who had supposed themselves to stand so high in his good graces  she says     that said byron is precisely one of the ideas that most amuses    me  i often fancy the rage and humiliation of my quondam friends in    hearing the truth at least from me for the first time and when i am    beyond the reach of their malice     what grief continued byron    laughing could resist the charges of ugliness dulness or any of    the thousand nameless defects personal or mental that flesh is heir    to when reprisal or recantation was impossible     people are in    such daily habits of commenting on the defects of friends that they    are unconscious of the unkindness of it   now i write down as well    as speak my sentiments of those who think they have gulled me and i    only wish in case i die before them that i might return to witness    the effects my posthumous opinions of them are likely to produce in    their minds  what good fun this would be     you dont seem to    value this as you ought said byron with one of his sardonic smiles    seeing i looked as i really felt surprised at his avowed    insincerity  i feel the same pleasure in anticipating the rage and    mortification of my soidisant friends at the discovery of my real    sentiments of them that a miser may be supposed to feel while making    a will that will disappoint all the expectants that have been toadying    him for years  then how amusing it will be to compare my posthumous    with my previously given opinions the one throwing ridicule on the    other  it is asserted in a note to the noctes that byron besides his autobiography prepared a voluminous dictionary of all his friends and acquaintances in which brief notes of their persons and character were given with his opinion of them  it was not considered that the publication of this would add to the noble lords popularity and it has never appeared  in hunts life of byron there is similar testimony  speaking of byrons carelessness in exposing his friends secrets and showing or giving away their letters he says     if his five hundred confidants by a reticence as remarkable as his    laxity had not kept his secrets better than he did himself the very    devil might have been played with i dont know how many people  but    there was always this saving reflection to be made that the man who    could be guilty of such extravagances for the sake of making an    impression might be guilty of exaggeration or inventing what    astonished you and indeed though he was a speaker of the truth on    ordinary occasionsthat is to say he did not tell you he had seen a    dozen horses when he had seen only twoyet as he professed not to    value the truth when in the way of his advantage and there was    nothing he thought more to his advantage than making you stare at    him the persons who were liable to suffer from his incontinence had    all the right in the world to the benefit of this consideration    205a  with a person of such mental and moral habits as to truth the inquiry always must be where does mystification end and truth begin  if a man is careless about his fathers reputation for sanity and reports him a crazy suicide if he gaily accuses his publisher and good friend of doubledealing shuffling and dishonesty if he tells stories about mrs clermont 205b to which his sister offers a public refutationis it to be supposed that he will always tell the truth about his wife when the world is pressing him hard and every instinct of selfdefence is on the alert  and then the ingenuity that could write and publish false documents about himself that they might reappear in london papersto what other accounts might it not be turned  might it not create documents invent statements about his wife as well as himself  the document so ostentatiously given to m g lewis for circulation among friends in england was a specimen of what the noctes club would call bamming  if byron wanted a legal investigation why did he not take it in the first place instead of signing the separation  if he wanted to cancel it as he said in this document why did he not go to london and enter a suit for the restitution of conjugal rights or a suit in chancery to get possession of his daughter  that this was in his mind passages in medwins conversations show  he told lady blessington also that he might claim his daughter in chancery at any time  why did he not do it  either of these two steps would have brought on that public investigation he so longed for  can it be possible that all the friends who passed this private document from hand to hand never suspected that they were being bammed by it  but it has been universally assumed that though byron was thus remarkably given to mystification yet all his statements in regard to this story are to be accepted simply because he makes them  why must we accept them any more than his statements as to murray or his own father  so we constantly find lord byrons incidental statements coming in collision with those of others for example in his account of his marriage he tells medwin that lady byrons maid was put between his bride and himself on the same seat in the wedding journey  the ladys maid herself mrs mimms says she was sent before them to halnaby and was there to receive them when they alighted  he said of lady byrons mother she always detested me and had not the decency to conceal it in her own house  dining with her one day i broke a tooth and was in great pain which i could not help showing  it will do you good said lady noel i am glad of it  lady byron says speaking of her mother she always treated him with an affectionate consideration and indulgence which extended to every little peculiarity of his feelings  never did an irritating word escape her  lord byron states that the correspondence between him and lady byron after his refusal was first opened by her  lady byrons friends deny the statement and assert that the direct contrary is the fact  thus we see that lord byrons statements are directly opposed to those of his family in relation to his father directly against murrays accounts and his own admission to murray directly against the statement of the ladys maid as to her position in the journey directly against mrs leighs as to mrs clermont and against lady byron as to her mother  we can see also that these misstatements were so fully perceived by the men of his times that medwins conversations were simply laughed at as an amusing instance of how far a man might be made the victim of a mystification  christopher north thus sentences the book     i dont mean to call medwin a liar     the captain lies sir but    it is under a thousand mistakes  whether byron bammed him or he by    virtue of his own egregious stupidity was the sole and sufficient    bammifier of himself i know not neither greatly do i care  this    much is certain    that the book throughout is full of things that    were not and most resplendently deficient quoad the things that    were  yet it is on medwins conversations alone that many of the magazine assertions in regard to lady byron are founded  it is on that authority that lady byron is accused of breaking open her husbands writingdesk in his absence and sending the letters she found there to the husband of a lady compromised by them and likewise that lord byron is declared to have paid back his wifes tenthousandpound wedding portion and doubled it  moore makes no such statements and his remarks about lord byrons use of his wifes money are unmistakable evidence to the contrary  moore although byrons ardent partisan was too well informed to make assertions with regard to him which at that time it would have been perfectly easy to refute  all these facts go to show that lord byrons character for accuracy or veracity was not such as to entitle him to ordinary confidence as a witness especially in a case where he had the strongest motives for misstatement  and if we consider that the celebrated autobiography was the finished careful work of such a practised mystifier who can wonder that it presented a web of such intermingled truth and lies that there was no such thing as disentangling it and pointing out where falsehood ended and truth began  but in regard to lady byron what has been the universal impression of the world  it has been alleged against her that she was a precise straightforward woman so accustomed to plain literal dealings that she could not understand the various mystifications of her husband and from that cause arose her unhappiness  byron speaks in the sketch of her peculiar truthfulness and even in the clytemnestra poem when accusing her of lying he speaks of her as departing from     the early truth that was her proper praise  lady byrons careful accuracy as to dates to time place and circumstances will probably be vouched for by all the very large number of persons whom the management of her extended property and her works of benevolence brought to act as cooperators or agents with her  she was not a person in the habit of making exaggerated or illconsidered statements  her published statement of 1830 is clear exact accurate and perfectly intelligible  the dates are carefully ascertained and stated the expressions are moderate and all the assertions firm and perfectly definite  it therefore seems remarkable that the whole reasoning on this byron matter has generally been conducted by assuming all lord byrons statements to be true and requiring all lady byrons statements to be sustained by other evidence  if lord byron asserts that his wife deserted him the assertion is accepted without proof but if lady byron asserts that he ordered her to leave that requires proof  lady byron asserts that she took counsel on this order of lord byron with his family friends and physician under the idea that it originated in insanity  the blackwood asks what family friends says it doesnt know of any and asks proof  if lord byron asserts that he always longed for a public investigation of the charges against him the quarterly and blackwood quote the saying with ingenuous confidence  they are obliged to admit that he refused to stand that public test that he signed the deed of separation rather than meet it  they know also that he could have at any time instituted suits against lady byron that would have brought the whole matter into court and that he did not  why did he not  the quarterly simply intimates that such suits would have been unpleasant  why  on account of personal delicacy  the man that wrote don juan and furnished the details of his weddingnight held back from clearing his name by delicacy  it is astonishing to what extent this controversy has consisted in simply repeating lord byrons assertions over and over again and calling the result proof  now we propose a different course  as lady byron is not stated by her warm admirers to have had any monomania for speaking untruths on any subject we rank her value as a witness at a higher rate than lord byrons  she never accused her parents of madness or suicide merely to make a sensation never bammed an acquaintance by false statements concerning the commercial honour of anyone with whom she was in business relations never wrote and sent to the press as a clever jest false statements about herself and never in any other ingenious way tampered with truth  we therefore hold it to be a mere dictate of reason and common sense that in all cases where her statements conflict with her husbands hers are to be taken as the more trustworthy  the london quarterly in a late article distinctly repudiates lady byrons statements as sources of evidence and throughout quotes statements of lord byron as if they had the force of selfevident propositions  we consider such a course contrary to common sense as well as common good manners  the state of the case is just this if lord byron did not make false statements on this subject it was certainly an exception to his usual course  he certainly did make such on a great variety of other subjects by his own showing he had a peculiar pleasure in falsifying language and in misleading and betraying even his friends  but if lady byron gave false witness upon this subject it was an exception to the whole course of her life  the habits of her mind the government of her conduct her lifelong reputation all were those of a literal exact truthfulness  the accusation of her being untruthful was first brought forward by her husband in the clytemnestra poem in the autumn of 1816 but it never was publicly circulated till after his death and it was first formally made the basis of a published attack on lady byron in the july blackwood of 1869  up to that time we look in vain through current literature for any indications that the world regarded lady byron otherwise than as a cold careful prudent woman who made no assertions and had no confidants  when she spoke in 1830 it is perfectly evident that christopher north and his circle believed what she said though reproving her for saying it at all  the quarterly goes on to heap up a number of vague assertionsthat lady byron about the time of her separation made a confidant of a young officer that she told the clergyman of ham of some trials with lord ockham and that she told stories of different things at different times  all this is not proof it is mere assertion and assertion made to produce prejudice  it is like raising a whirlwind of sand to blind the eyes that are looking for landmarks  it is quite probable lady byron told different stories about lord byron at various times  no woman could have a greater variety of stories to tell and no woman ever was so persecuted and pursued and harassed both by public literature and private friendship to say something  she had plenty of causes for a separation without the fatal and final one  in her conversations with lady anne barnard for example she gives reasons enough for a separation though none of them are the chief one  it is not different stories but contradictory stories that must be relied on to disprove the credibility of a witness  the quarterly has certainly told a great number of different storiesstories which may prove as irreconcilable with each other as any attributed to lady byron but its denial of all weight to her testimony is simply begging the whole question under consideration  a man gives testimony about the causes of a railroad accident being the only eyewitness  the opposing counsel begs whatever else you do you will not admit that mans testimony  you ask why  has he ever been accused of want of veracity on other subjectsno he has stood high as a man of probity and honour for yearswhy then throw out his testimony  because he lies in this instance says the adversary his testimony does not agree with this and thatpardon me that is the very point in question say you we expect to prove that it does agree with this and that  because certain letters of lady byrons do not agree with the quarterlys theory of the facts of the separation it at once assumes that she is an untruthful witness and proposes to throw out her evidence altogether  we propose on the contrary to regard lady byrons evidence with all the attention due to the statement of a highminded conscientious person never in any other case accused of violation of truth we also propose to show it to be in strict agreement with all wellauthenticated facts and documents and we propose to treat lord byrons evidence as that of a man of great subtlety versed in mystification and delighting in it and who on many other subjects not only deceived but gloried in deception and then we propose to show that it contradicts wellestablished facts and received documents  one thing more we have to say concerning the laws of evidence in regard to documents presented in this investigation  this is not a london westend affair but a grave historical inquiry in which the whole englishspeaking world are interested to know the truth  as it is now too late to have the securities of a legal trial certainly the rules of historical evidence should be strictly observed  all important documents should be presented in an entire state with a plain and open account of their historywho had them where they were found and how preserved  there have been most excellent credible and authentic documents produced in this case and as a specimen of them we shall mention lord lindsays letter and the journal and letter it authenticates  lord lindsay at once comes forward gives his name boldly gives the history of the papers he produces shows how they came to be in his hands why never produced before and why now  we feel confidence at once  but in regard to the important series of letters presented as lady byrons this obviously proper course has not been pursued  though assumed to be of the most critical importance no such distinct history of them was given in the first instance  the want of such evidence being noticed by other papers the quarterly appears hurt that the high character of the magazine has not been a sufficient guarantee and still deals in vague statements that the letters have been freely circulated and that two noblemen of the highest character would vouch for them if necessary  in our view it is necessary  these noblemen should imitate lord lindsays examplegive a fair account of these letters under their own names and then we would add it is needful for complete satisfaction to have the letters entire and not in fragments  the quarterly gave these letters with the evident implication that they are entirely destructive to lady byrons character as a witness  now has that magazine much reason to be hurt at even an insinuation on its own character when making such deadly assaults on that of another  the individuals who bring forth documents that they suppose to be deadly to the character of a noble person always in her generation held to be eminent for virtue certainly should not murmur at being called upon to substantiate these documents in the manner usually expected in historical investigations  we have shown that these letters do not contradict but that they perfectly confirm the facts and agree with the dates in lady byrons published statements of 1830 and this is our reason for deeming them authentic  these considerations with regard to the manner of conducting the inquiry seem so obviously proper that we cannot but believe that they will command a serious attention    chapter v  the direct argument to prove the crime   we shall now proceed to state the argument against lord byron  1st there is direct evidence that lord byron was guilty of some unusual immorality  the evidence is not as the blackwood says that lushington yielded assent to the ex parte statement of a client nor as the quarterly intimates that he was affected by the charms of an attractive young woman  the first evidence of it is the fact that lushington and romilly offered to take the case into court and make there a public exhibition of the proofs on which their convictions were founded  2nd it is very strong evidence of this fact that lord byron while loudly declaring that he wished to know with what he was charged declined this open investigation and rather than meet it signed a paper which he had before refused to sign  3rd it is also strong evidence of this fact that although secretly declaring to all his intimate friends that he still wished open investigation in a court of justice and affirming his belief that his character was being ruined for want of it he never afterwards took the means to get it  instead of writing a private handbill he might have come to england and entered a suit and he did not do it  that lord byron was conscious of a great crime is further made probable by the peculiar malice he seemed to bear to his wifes legal counsel  if there had been nothing to fear in that legal investigation wherewith they threatened him why did he not only flee from it but regard with a peculiar bitterness those who advised and proposed it  to an innocent man falsely accused the certainties of law are a blessing and a refuge female charms cannot mislead in a court of justice and the atrocities of rumour are there sifted and deprived of power  a trial is not a threat to an innocent man it is an invitation an opportunity  why then did he hate sir samuel romilly so that he exulted like a fiend over his tragical death  the letter in which he pours forth this malignity was so brutal that moore was obliged by the general outcry of society to suppress it  is this the language of an innocent man who has been offered a fair trial under his countrys laws or of a guilty man to whom the very idea of public trial means public exposure  4th it is probable that the crime was the one now alleged because that was the most important crime charged against him by rumour at the period this appears by the following extract of a letter from shelley furnished by the quarterly dated bath sept 29 1816     i saw kinnaird and had a long talk with him  he informed me that    lady byron was now in perfect health that she was living with your    sister  i felt much pleasure from this intelligence  i consider the    latter part of it as affording a decisive contradiction to the only    important calumny that ever was advanced against you  on this ground    at least it will become the world hereafter to be silent  it appears evident here that the charge of improper intimacy with his sister was in the mind of shelley the only important one that had yet been made against lord byron  it is fairly inferable from lord byrons own statements that his family friends believed this charge  lady byron speaks in her statement of nearest relatives and family friends who were cognizant of lord byrons strange conduct at the time of the separation and lord byron in the letter to bowles before quoted says that every one of his relations except his sister fell from him in this crisis like leaves from a tree in autumn  there was therefore not only this report but such appearances in support of it as convinced those nearest to the scene and best apprised of the facts so that they fell from him entirely notwithstanding the strong influence of family feeling  the guiccioli book also mentions this same allegation as having arisen from peculiarities in lord byrons manner of treating his sister     this deep fraternal affection assumed at times under the influence    of his powerful genius and under exceptional circumstances an almost    too passionate expression which opened a fresh field to his enemies    219  it appears then that there was nothing in the character of lord byron and of his sister as they appeared before their generation that prevented such a report from arising on the contrary there was something in their relations that made it seem probable  and it appears that his own family friends were so affected by it that they with one accord deserted him  the quarterly presents the fact that lady byron went to visit mrs leigh at this time as triumphant proof that she did not then believe it  can the quarterly show just what lady byrons state of mind was or what her motives were in making that visit  the quarterly seems to assume that no woman without gross hypocrisy can stand by a sister proven to have been guilty  we can appeal on this subject to all women  we fearlessly ask any wife supposing your husband and sister were involved together in an infamous crime and that you were the mother of a young daughter whose life would be tainted by a knowledge of that crime what would be your wish  would you wish to proclaim it forthwith or would you wish quietly to separate from your husband and to cover the crime from the eye of man  it has been proved that lady byron did not reveal this even to her nearest relatives  it is proved that she sealed the mouths of her counsel and even of servants so effectually that they remain sealed even to this day  this is evidence that she did not wish the thing known  it is proved also that in spite of her secrecy with her parents and friends the rumour got out and was spoken of by shelley as the only important one  now let us see how this note cited by the quarterly confirms one of lady byrons own statements  she says to lady anne barnard     i trust you understand my wishes which never were to injure lord    byron in any way for though he would not suffer me to remain his    wife he cannot prevent me from continuing his friend and it was from    considering myself as such that i silenced the accusations by which my    own conduct might have been more fully justified  how did lady byron silence accusations  first by keeping silence to her nearest relatives second by shutting the mouths of servants third by imposing silence on her friendsas lady anne barnard fourth by silencing her legal counsel fifth and most entirely by treating mrs leigh before the world with unaltered kindness  in the midst of the rumours lady byron went to visit her and shelley says that the movement was effectual  can the quarterly prove that at this time mrs leigh had not confessed all and thrown herself on lady byrons mercy  it is not necessary to suppose great horror and indignation on the part of lady byron  she may have regarded her sister as the victim of a most singularly powerful tempter  lord byron as she knew had tried to corrupt her own morals and faith  he had obtained a power over some women even in the highest circles in england which had led them to forego the usual decorums of their sex and had given rise to great scandals  he was a being of wonderful personal attractions  he had not only strong poetical but also strong logical power  he was daring in speculation and vigorous in sophistical argument beautiful dazzling and possessed of magnetic power of fascination  his sister had been kind and considerate to lady byron when lord byron was brutal and cruel  she had been overcome by him as a weaker nature sometimes sinks under the force of a stronger one and lady byron may really have considered her to be more sinned against than sinning  lord byron if we look at it rightly did not corrupt mrs leigh any more than he did the whole british public  they rebelled at the immorality of his conduct and the obscenity of his writings and he resolved that they should accept both  and he made them do it  at first they execrated don juan  murray was afraid to publish it  women were determined not to read it  in 1819 dr william maginn of the noctes wrote a song against it in the following virtuous strain     be juan then unseen unknown       it must or we shall rue it    we may have virtue of our own       ah why should we undo it    the treasured faith of days long past       we still would prize oer any    and grieve to hear the ribald jeer       of scamps like don giovanni  lord byron determined to conquer the virtuous scruples of the noctes club and so we find this same dr william maginn who in 1819 wrote so valiantly in 1822 declaring that he would rather have written a page of don juan than a ton of childe harold  all english morals were in like manner formally surrendered to lord byron  moore details his adulteries in venice with unabashed particularity artists send for pictures of his principal mistresses the literary world call for biographical sketches of their points moore compares his wife and his last mistress in a neatlyturned sentence and yet the professor of morals in edinburgh university recommends the biography as pure and having no mud in it  the mistress is lionized in london and in 1869 is introduced to the world of letters by blackwood and bid without a blush to say she loved  this much being done to all england it is quite possible that a woman like lady byron standing silently aside and surveying the course of things may have thought that mrs leigh was no more seduced than all the rest of the world and have said as we feel disposed to say of that generation and of a good many in this let him that is without sin among you cast the first stone  the peculiar bitterness of remorse expressed in his works by lord byron is a further evidence that he had committed an unusual crime  we are aware that evidence cannot be drawn in this manner from an authors works merely if unsupported by any external probability  for example the subject most frequently and powerfully treated by hawthorne is the influence of a secret unconfessed crime on the soul nevertheless as hawthorne is well known to have always lived a pure and regular life nobody has ever suspected him of any greater sin than a vigorous imagination  but here is a man believed guilty of an uncommon immorality by the two best lawyers in england and threatened with an open exposure which he does not dare to meet  the crime is named in society his own relations fall away from him on account of it it is only set at rest by the heroic conduct of his wife  now this man is stated by many of his friends to have had all the appearance of a man secretly labouring under the consciousness of crime  moore speaks of this propensity in the following language     i have known him more than once as we sat together after dinner and    he was a little under the influence of wine to fall seriously into    this dark selfaccusing mood and throw out hints of his past life    with an air of gloom and mystery designed evidently to awaken    curiosity and interest  moore says that it was his own custom to dispel these appearances by ridicule to which his friend was keenly alive  and he goes on to say     it has sometimes occurred to me that the occult causes of his ladys    separation from him round which herself and her legal advisers have    thrown such formidable mystery may have been nothing more than some    imposture of this kind some dimlyhinted confession of undefined    horror which though intended by the relater to mystify and surprise    the hearer so little understood as to take in sober seriousness    225  all we have to say is that lord byrons conduct in this respect is exactly what might have been expected if he had a crime on his conscience  the energy of remorse and despair expressed in manfred were so appalling and so vividly personal that the belief was universal on the continent that the experience was wrought out of some actual crime goethe expressed this idea and had heard a murder imputed to byron as the cause  the allusion to the crime and consequences of incest is so plain in manfred that it is astonishing that any one can pretend as galt does that it had any other application  the hero speaks of the love between himself and the imaginary being whose spirit haunts him as having been the deadliest sin and one that has perhaps caused her eternal destruction     what is she now  a sufferer for my sins    a thing i dare not think upon  he speaks of her blood as haunting him and as being        my bloodthe pure warm stream    that ran in the veins of my fathers and in ours    when we were in our youth and had one heart    and loved each other as we should not love  this work was conceived in the commotion of mind immediately following his separation  the scenery of it was sketched in a journal sent to his sister at the time  in letter 377 defending the originality of the conception and showing that it did not arise from reading faust he says     it was the steinbach and the jungfrau and something else more than    faustus that made me write manfred  in letter 288 speaking of the various accounts given by critics of the origin of the story he says     the conjecturer is out and knows nothing of the matter  i had a    better origin than he could devise or divine for the soul of him  in letter 299 he says  as to the germs of manfred they may be found in the journal i sent to mrs leigh part of which you saw  it may be said plausibly that lord byron if conscious of this crime would not have expressed it in his poetry  but his nature was such that he could not help it  whatever he wrote that had any real power was generally wrought out of self and when in a tumult of emotion he could not help giving glimpses of the cause  it appears that he did know that he had been accused of incest and that shelley thought that accusation the only really important one and yet sensitive as he was to blame and reprobation he ran upon this very subject most likely to reawaken scandal  but lord byrons strategy was always of the bold kind  it was the plan of the fugitive who instead of running away stations himself so near to danger that nobody would ever think of looking for him there  he published passionate verses to his sister on this principle  he imitated the security of an innocent man in every thing but the unconscious energy of the agony which seized him when he gave vent to his nature in poetry the boldness of his strategy is evident through all his life  he began by charging his wife with the very cruelty and deception which he was himself practising  he had spread a net for her feet and he accused her of spreading a net for his  he had placed her in a position where she could not speak and then leisurely shot arrows at her and he represented her as having done the same by him  when he attacked her in don juan and strove to take from her the very protection 227of womanly sacredness by putting her name into the mouth of every ribald he did a bold thing and he knew it  he meant to do a bold thing  there was a general outcry against it and he fought it down and gained his point  by sheer boldness and perseverance he turned the public from his wife and to himself in the face of their very groans and protests  his manfred and his cain were parts of the same game  but the involuntary cry of remorse and despair pierced even through his own artifices in a manner that produced a conviction of reality  his evident fear and hatred of his wife were other symptoms of crime there was no apparent occasion for him to hate her  he admitted that she had been bright amiable good agreeable that her marriage had been a very uncomfortable one and he said to madame de stael that he did not doubt she thought him deranged  why then did he hate her for wanting to live peaceably by herself  why did he so fear her that not one year of his life passed without his concocting and circulating some public or private accusation against her  she by his own showing published none against him  it is remarkable that in all his zeal to represent himself injured he nowhere quotes a single remark from lady byron nor a story coming either directly or indirectly from her or her family  he is in a fever in venice not from what she has spoken but because she has sealed the lips of her counsel and because she and her family do not speak so that he professes himself utterly ignorant what form her allegations against him may take  he had heard from shelley that his wife silenced the most important calumny by going to make mrs leigh a visit and yet he is afraid of herso afraid that he tells moore he expects she will attack him after death and charges him to defend his grave  now if lord byron knew that his wife had a deadly secret that she could tell all this conduct is explicable it is in the ordinary course of human nature  men always distrust those who hold facts by which they can be ruined  they fear them they are antagonistic to them they cannot trust them  the feeling of falkland to caleb williams as portrayed in godwins masterly sketch is perfectly natural and it is exactly illustrative of what byron felt for his wife  he hated her for having his secret and so far as a human being could do it he tried to destroy her character before the world that she might not have the power to testify against him  if we admit this solution byrons conduct is at least that of a man who is acting as men ordinarily would act under such circumstances if we do not he is acting like a fiend  let us look at admitted facts  he married his wife without love in a gloomy melancholy morose state of mind  the servants testify to strange unaccountable treatment of her immediately after marriage such that her confidential maid advises her return to her parents  in lady byrons letter to mrs leigh she reminds lord byron that he always expressed a desire and determination to free himself from the marriage  lord byron himself admits to madame de stael that his behaviour was such that his wife must have thought him insane  now we are asked to believe that simply because under these circumstances lady byron wished to live separate from her husband he hated and feared her so that he could never let her alone afterwards that he charged her with malice slander deceit and deadly intentions against himself merely out of spite because she preferred not to live with him  this last view of the case certainly makes lord byron more unaccountably wicked than the other  the first supposition shows him to us as a man in an agony of selfpreservation the second as a fiend delighting in gratuitous deceit and cruelty  again a presumption of this crime appears in lord byrons admission in a letter to moore that he had an illegitimate child born before he left england and still living at the time  in letter 307 to mr moore under date venice feb 2 1818 byron says speaking of moores loss of a child     i know how to feel with you because i am quite wrapped up in my own    children  besides my little legitimate i have made unto myself an    illegitimate since since adas birth to say nothing of one before    and i look forward to one of these as the pillar of my old age    supposing that i ever reach as i hope i never shall that desolating    period  the illegitimate child that he had made to himself since adas birth was allegra born about nine or ten months after the separation  the other illegitimate alluded to was born before and as the reader sees was spoken of as still living  moore appears to be puzzled to know who this child can be and conjectures that it may possibly be the child referred to in an early poem written while a schoolboy of nineteen at harrow  on turning back to the note referred to we find two things first that the child there mentioned was not claimed by lord byron as his own but that he asked his mother to care for it as belonging to a schoolmate now dead second that the infant died shortly after and consequently could not be the child mentioned in this letter  now besides this fact that lord byron admitted a living illegitimate child born before ada we place this other fact that there was a child in england which was believed to be his by those who had every opportunity of knowing  on this subject we shall cite a passage from a letter recently received by us from england and written by a person who appears well informed on the subject of his letter     the fact is the incest was first committed and the child of it born    before shortly before the byron marriage  the child a daughter    must not be confounded with the natural daughter of lord byron born    about a year after his separation     the history more or less of that child of incest is known to many    for in lady byrons attempts to watch over her and rescue her from    ruin she was compelled to employ various agents at different times  this letter contains a full recognition by an intelligent person in england of a child corresponding well with lord byrons declaration of an illegitimate born before he left england  up to this point we have then the circumstantial evidence against lord byron as follows  a good and amiable woman who had married him from love determined to separate from him  two of the greatest lawyers of england confirmed her in this decision and threatened lord byron that unless he consented to this they would expose the evidence against him in a suit for divorce  he fled from this exposure and never afterwards sought public investigation  he was angry with and malicious towards the counsel who supported his wife he was angry at and afraid of a wife who did nothing to injure him and he made it a special object to defame and degrade her  he gave such evidence of remorse and fear in his writings as to lead eminent literary men to believe he had committed a great crime  the public rumour of his day specified what the crime was  his relations by his own showing joined against him  the report was silenced by his wifes efforts only lord byron subsequently declares the existence of an illegitimate child born before he left england  corresponding to this there is the history known in england of a child believed to be his in whom his wife took an interest  all these presumptions exist independently of any direct testimony from lady byron  they are to be admitted as true whether she says a word one way or the other  from this background of proof i come forward and testify to an interview with lady byron in which she gave me specific information of the facts in the case  that i report the facts just as i received them from her not altered or misremembered is shown by the testimony of my sister to whom i related them at the time  it cannot then be denied that i had this interview and that this communication was made  i therefore testify that lady byron for a proper purpose and at a proper time stated to me the following things  1  that the crime which separated her from lord byron was incest  2  that she first discovered it by improper actions towards his sister which he meant to make her understand indicated the guilty relation  3  that he admitted it reasoned on it defended it tried to make her an accomplice and failing in that hated her and expelled her  4  that he threatened her that he would make it his lifes object to destroy her character  5  that for a period she was led to regard this conduct as insanity and to consider him only as a diseased person  6  that she had subsequent proof that the facts were really as she suspected that there had been a child born of the crime whose history she knew that mrs leigh had repented  the purpose for which this was stated to me was to ask was it her duty to make the truth fully known during her lifetime  here then is a man believed guilty of an unusual crime by two lawyers the best in england who have seen the evidencea man who dares not meet legal investigation  the crime is named in society and deemed so far probable to the men of his generation as to be spoken of by shelley as the only important allegation against him  he acts through life exactly like a man struggling with remorse and afraid of detection he has all the restlessness and hatred and fear that a man has who feels that there is evidence which might destroy him  he admits an illegitimate child besides allegra  a child believed to have been his is known to many in england  added to all this his widow now advanced in years and standing on the borders of eternity being as appears by her writings and conversation of perfectly sound mind at the time testifies to me the facts before named which exactly correspond to probabilities  i publish the statement and the solicitors who hold lady byrons private papers do not deny the truth of the story  they try to cast discredit on me for speaking but they do not say that i have spoken falsely or that the story is not true  the lawyer who knew lady byrons story in 1816 does not now deny that this is the true one  several persons in england testify that at various times and for various purposes the same story has been told to them  moreover it appears from my last letter addressed to lady byron on this subject that i recommended her to leave all necessary papers in the hands of some discreet persons who after both had passed away should see that justice was done  the solicitors admit that lady byron has left sealed papers of great importance in the hands of trustees with discretionary power  i have been informed very directly that the nature of these documents was such as to lead to the suppression of lady byrons life and writings  this is all exactly as it would be if the story related by lady byron were the true one  the evidence under this point of view is so strong that a great effort has been made to throw out lady byrons testimony  this attempt has been made on two grounds  1st that she was under a mental hallucination  this theory has been most ably refuted by the very first authority in england upon the subject  he says     no person practically acquainted with the true characteristics of    insanity would affirm that had this idea of incest been an insane    hallucination lady byron could from the lengthened period which    intervened between her unhappy marriage and death have refrained from    exhibiting it not only to legal advisers and trustees assuming that    she revealed to them the fact but to others exacting no pledge of    secrecy from them as to her mental impressions  lunatics do for a    time and for some special purpose most cunningly conceal their    delusions but they have not the capacity to struggle for thirtysix    years as lady byron must have done with so frightful an    hallucination without the insane state of mind becoming obvious to    those with whom they are daily associating  neither is it consistent    with experience to suppose that if lady byron had been a monomaniac    her state of disordered understanding would have been restricted to    one hallucination  her diseased brain affecting the normal action of    thought would in all probability have manifested other symptoms    besides those referred to of aberration of intellect     during the last thirty years i have not met with a case of insanity    assuming the hypothesis of hallucination at all parallel with that    of lady byron  in my experience it is unique  i never saw a patient    with such a delusion  we refer our readers to a careful study of dr forbes winslows consideration of this subject given in part iii  anyone who has been familiar with the delicacy and acuteness of dr winslow as shown in his work on obscure diseases of the brain and nerves must feel that his positive assertion on this ground is the best possible evidence  we here gratefully acknowledge our obligations to dr winslow for the corrected proof of his valuable letter which he has done us the honour to send for this work  we shall consider that his argument in connection with what the reader may observe of lady byrons own writings closes that issue of the case completely  the other alternative is that lady byron deliberately committed false witness  this was the ground assumed by the blackwood when in july 1869 it took upon itself the responsibility of reopening the byron controversy  it is also the ground assumed by the london quarterly of today  both say in so many words that no crime was imputed to lord byron that the representations made to lushington in the beginning were false ones and that the story told to lady byrons confidential friends in later days was also false  let us examine this theory  in the first place it requires us to believe in the existence of a moral monster of whom madame brinvilliers is cited as the type  the blackwood let it be remembered opens the controversy with the statement that lady byron was a madame brinvilliers the quarterly does not shrink from the same assumption  let us consider the probability of this question  if lady byron were such a woman and wished to ruin her husbands reputation in order to save her own and being perfectly unscrupulous had circulated against him a story of unnatural crime which had no proofs how came two of the first lawyers of england to assume the responsibility of offering to present her case in open court  how came her husband if he knew himself guiltless to shrink from that public investigation which must have demonstrated his innocence  most astonishing of all when he fled from trial and the report got abroad against him in england and was believed even by his own relations why did not his wife avail herself of the moment to complete her victory  if at that moment she had publicly broken with mrs leigh she might have confirmed every rumour  did she do it and why not  according to the blackwood we have here a woman who has made up a frightful story to ruin her husbands reputation yet who takes every pains afterwards to prevent its being ruined  she fails to do the very thing she undertakes and for years after rather than injure him she loses public sympathy and by sealing the lips of her legal counsel deprives herself of the advantage of their testimony  moreover if a desire for revenge could have been excited in her it would have been provoked by the first publication of the fourth canto of childe harold when she felt that byron was attacking her before the world  yet we have lady anne barnards testimony that at this time she was so far from wishing to injure him that all her communications were guarded by cautious secrecy  at this time also she had a strong party in england to whom she could have appealed  again when don juan was first printed it excited a violent reaction against lord byron  had his wife chosen then to accuse him and display the evidence she had shown to her counsel there is little doubt that all the world would have stood with her but she did not  after his death when she spoke at last there seems little doubt from the strength of dr lushingtons language that lady byron had a very strong case and that had she been willing her counsel could have told much more than he did she might then have told her whole story and been believed  her word was believed by christopher north and accepted as proof that byron had been a great criminal  had revenge been her motive she could have spoken the one word more that north called for  the quarterly asks why she waited till everybody concerned was dead there is an obvious answer  because while there was anybody living to whom the testimony would have been utterly destructive there were the best reasons for withholding it  when all were gone from earth and she herself was in constant expectation of passing away there was a reason and a proper one why she should speak  by nature and principle truthful she had had the opportunity of silently watching the operation of a permitted lie upon a whole generation  she had been placed in a position in which it was necessary by silence to allow the spread and propagation through society of a radical falsehood  lord byrons life fame and genius had all struck their roots into this lie been nourished by it and had derived thence a poisonous power  in reading this history it will be remarked that he pleaded his personal misfortunes in his marriage as excuses for every offence against morality and that the literary world of england accepted the plea and tolerated and justified the crimes  never before in england had adultery been spoken of in so respectful a manner and an adulteress openly praised and feted and obscene language and licentious images publicly tolerated and all on the plea of a mans private misfortunes  there was therefore great force in the suggestion made to lady byron that she owed a testimony in this case to truth and justice irrespective of any personal considerations  there is no more real reason for allowing the spread of a hurtful falsehood that affects ourselves than for allowing one that affects our neighbour  this falsehood had corrupted the literature and morals of both england and america and led to the public toleration by respectable authorities of forms of vice at first indignantly rejected  the question was was this falsehood to go on corrupting literature as long as history lasted  had the world no right to true history  had she who possessed the truth no responsibility to the world  was not a final silence a confirmation of a lie with all its consequences  this testimony of lady byron so far from being thrown out altogether as the quarterly proposes has a peculiar and specific value from the great forbearance and reticence which characterised the greater part of her life  the testimony of a person who has shown in every action perfect friendliness to another comes with the more weight on that account testimony extorted by conscience from a parent against a child or a wife against a husband where all the other actions of the life prove the existence of kind feeling is held to be the strongest form of evidence  the fact that lady byron under the severest temptations and the bitterest insults and injuries withheld every word by which lord byron could be criminated so long as he and his sister were living is strong evidence that when she did speak it was not under the influence of ill will but of pure conscientious convictions and the fullest weight ought therefore to be given to her testimony  we are asked now why she ever spoke at all  the fact that her story is known to several persons in england is brought up as if it were a crime to this we answer lady byron had an undoubted moral right to have exposed the whole story in a public court in 1816 and thus cut herself loose from her husband by a divorce  for the sake of saving her husband and sister from destruction she waived this right to selfjustification and stood for years a silent sufferer under calumny and misrepresentation  she desired nothing but to retire from the whole subject to be permitted to enjoy with her child the peace and seclusion that belong to her sex  her husband made her through his life and after his death a subject of such constant discussion that she must either abandon the current literature of her day or run the risk of reading more or less about herself in almost every magazine of her time conversations with lord byron notes of interviews with lord byron journals of time spent with lord byron were constantly spread before the public  leigh hunt galt medwin trelawney lady blessington dr kennedy and thomas moore all poured forth their memorials and in all she figured prominently  all these had their tribes of reviewers and critics who also discussed her  the profound mystery of her silence seemed constantly to provoke inquiry  people could not forgive her for not speaking  her privacy retirement and silence were set down as coldness haughtiness and contempt of human sympathy  she was constantly challenged to say something as for example in the noctes of november 1825 six months after byrons death christopher north says speaking of the burning of the autobiography     i think since the memoir was burned by these people these people    are bound to put us in possession of the best evidence they still have    the power of producing in order that we may come to a just conclusion    as to a subject upon which by their act at least as much as by any    other peoples act we are compelled to consider it our duty to make    up our deliberate opiniondeliberate and decisive  woe be to those    who provoke this curiosity and will not allay it  woe be to them    say i  woe to them says the world  when lady byron published her statement which certainly seemed called for by this language christopher north blamed her for doing it and then again said that she ought to go on and tell the whole story  if she was thus adjured to speak blamed for speaking and adjured to speak further all in one breath by public prints there is reason to think that there could not have come less solicitation from private sourcesfrom friends who had access to her at all hours whom she loved by whom she was beloved and to whom her refusal to explain might seem a breach of friendship  yet there is no evidence on record that we have seen that she ever had other confidant than her legal counsel till after all the actors in the events were in their graves and the daughter for whose sake largely the secret was guarded had followed them  now does anyone claim that because a woman has sacrificed for twenty years all cravings for human sympathy and all possibility of perfectly free and unconstrained intercourse with her friends that she is obliged to go on bearing this same lonely burden to the end of her days  let anyone imagine the frightful constraint and solitude implied in this sentence  let anyone too think of its painful complications in life the roots of a falsehood are farreaching  conduct that can only be explained by criminating another must often seem unreasonable and unaccountable and the most truthful person who feels bound to keep silence regarding a radical lie of another must often be placed in positions most trying to conscientiousness  the great merit of caleb williams as a novel consists in its philosophical analysis of the utter helplessness of an innocent person who agrees to keep the secret of a guilty one  one sees there how that necessity of silence produces all the effect of falsehood on his part and deprives him of the confidence and sympathy of those with whom he would take refuge  for years this unnatural life was forced on lady byron involving her as in a network even in her dearest family relations  that when all the parties were dead lady byron should allow herself the sympathy of a circle of intimate friends is something so perfectly proper and natural that we cannot but wonder that her conduct in this respect has ever been called in question  if it was her right to have had a public expose in 1816 it was certainly her right to show to her own intimate circle the secret of her life when all the principal actors were passed from earth  the quarterly speaks as if by thus waiting she deprived lord byron of the testimony of living witnesses  but there were as many witnesses and partisans dead on her side as on his  lady milbanke and sir ralph sir samuel romilly and lady anne barnard were as much dead as hobhouse moore and others of byrons partisans  the quarterly speaks of lady byron as running round and repeating her story to people mostly below her own rank in life  to those who know the personal dignity of lady byrons manners represented and dwelt on by her husband in his conversations with lady blessington this coarse and vulgar attack only proves the poverty of a cause which can defend itself by no better weapons  lord byron speaks of his wife as highly cultivated as having a degree of selfcontrol i never saw equalled     i am certain he says that lady byrons first idea is what is due    to herself i mean that it is the undeviating rule of her conduct         now my besetting sin is a want of that selfrespect which she    has in excess      but though i accuse lady byron of an excess of    selfrespect i must in candour admit that if any person ever had    excuse for an extraordinary portion of it she has as in all her    thoughts words and actions she is the most decorous woman that ever    existed  this is the kind of woman who has lately been accused in the public prints as a babbler of secrets and a gossip in regard to her private difficulties with children grandchildren and servants  it is a fair specimen of the justice that has generally been meted out to lady byron  in 1836 she was accused of having made a confidant of campbell on the strength of having written him a note declining to give him any information or answer any questions  in july 1869 she was denounced by blackwood as a madame brinvilliers for keeping such perfect silence on the matter of her husbands character and in the last quarterly she is spoken of as a gossip running round and repeating her story to people below her in rank  while we are upon this subject we have a suggestion to make  john stuart mill says that utter selfabnegation has been preached to women as a peculiarly feminine virtue  it is true but there is a moral limit to the value of selfabnegation  it is a fair question for the moralist whether it is right and proper wholly to ignore ones personal claims to justice  the teachings of the saviour give us warrant for submitting to personal injuries but both the saviour and st paul manifested bravery in denying false accusations and asserting innocence  lady byron was falsely accused of having ruined the man of his generation and caused all his vices and crimes and all their evil effects on society  she submitted to the accusation for a certain number of years for reasons which commended themselves to her conscience but when all the personal considerations were removed and she was about passing from life it was right it was just it was strictly in accordance with the philosophical and ethical character of her mind and with her habit of considering all things in their widest relations to the good of mankind that she should give serious attention and consideration to the last duty which she might owe to abstract truth and justice in her generation  in her letter on the religious state of england we find her advocating an absolute frankness in all religious parties  she would have all openly confess those doubts which from the best of motives are usually suppressed and believed that as a result of such perfect truthfulness a wider love would prevail among christians  this shows the strength of her conviction of the power and the importance of absolute truth and shows therefore that her doubts and conscientious inquiries respecting her duty on this subject are exactly what might have been expected from a person of her character and principles  having thus shown that lady byrons testimony is the testimony of a woman of strong and sound mind that it was not given from malice nor illwill that it was given at a proper time and in a proper manner and for a purpose in accordance with the most elevated moral views and that it is coincident with all the established facts of this history and furnishes a perfect solution of every mystery of the case we think we shall carry the reader with us in saying that it is to be received as absolute truth  this conviction we arrive at while as yet we are deprived of the statement prepared by lady byron and the proof by which she expected to sustain it both which as we understand are now in the hands of her trustees      chapter vi  physiological argument   the credibility of the accusation of the unnatural crime charged to lord byron is greater than if charged to most men  he was born of parents both of whom were remarkable for perfectly ungoverned passions  there appears to be historical evidence that he was speaking literal truth when he says to medwin of his father     he would have made a bad hero for hannah more  he ran out three    fortunes and married or ran away with three women     he seemed    born for his own ruin and that of the other sex  he began by seducing    lady carmarthen and spent her four thousand pounds and not content    with one adventure of this kind afterwards eloped with miss    gordonmedwins conversations p31  lady carmarthen here spoken of was the mother of mrs leigh  miss gordon became lord byrons mother  by his own account and that of moore she was a passionate ungoverned though affectionate woman  lord byron says to medwin     i lost my father when i was only six years of age  my mother when    she was in a passion with me and i gave her cause enough used to    say o you little dog you are a byron all over you are as bad as    your fatheribid p37  by all the accounts of his childhood and early youth it is made apparent that ancestral causes had sent him into the world with a most perilous and exceptional sensitiveness of brain and nervous system which it would have required the most judicious course of education to direct safely and happily  lord byron often speaks as if he deemed himself subject to tendencies which might terminate in insanity  the idea is so often mentioned and dwelt upon in his letters journals and conversations that we cannot but ascribe it to some very peculiar experience and not to mere affectation  but in the history of his early childhood and youth we see no evidence of any original malformation of nature  we see only evidence of one of those organisations full of hope and full of peril which adverse influences might easily drive to insanity but wise physiological training and judicious moral culture might have guided to the most splendid results  but of these he had neither  he was alternately the pet and victim of his mothers tumultuous nature and equally injured both by her love and her anger  a scotch maid of religious character gave him early serious impressions of religion and thus added the element of an awakened conscience to the conflicting ones of his character  education in the proper sense of the word did not exist in england in those days  physiological considerations of the influence of the body on the soul of the power of brain and nerve over moral development had then not even entered the general thought of society  the school and college education literally taught him nothing but the ancient classics of whose power in exciting and developing the animal passions byron often speaks  the morality of the times is strikingly exemplified even in its literary criticism  for example one of byrons poems written while a schoolboy at harrow is addressed to my son  mr moore and the annotator of the standard edition of byrons poems gravely give the public their speculations on the point whether lord byron first became a father while a schoolboy at harrow and go into particulars in relation to a certain infant the claim to which lay between lord byron and another schoolfellow  it is not the nature of the event itself so much as the cool unembarrassed manner in which it is discussed that gives the impression of the state of public morals  there is no intimation of anything unusual or discreditable to the school in the event and no apparent suspicion that it will be regarded as a serious imputation on lord byrons character  modern physiological developments would lead any person versed in the study of the reciprocal influence of physical and moral laws to anticipate the most serious danger to such an organisation as lord byrons from a precocious development of the passions  alcoholic and narcotic stimulants in the case of such a person would be regarded as little less than suicidal and an early course of combined drinking and licentiousness as tending directly to establish those unsound conditions which lead towards moral insanity  yet not only lord byrons testimony but every probability from the licence of society goes to show that this was exactly what did take place  neither restrained by education nor warned by any correct physiological knowledge nor held in check by any public sentiment he drifted directly upon the fatal rock  here we give mr moore full credit for all his abatements in regard to lord byrons excesses in his early days  moore makes the point very strongly that he was not de facto even so bad as many of his associates and we agree with him  byrons physical organisation was originally as fine and sensitive as that of the most delicate woman  he possessed the faculty of moral ideality in a high degree and he had not in the earlier part of his life an attraction towards mere brutal vice his physical sensitiveness was so remarkable that he says of himself a dose of salts has the effect of a temporary inebriation like light champagne upon me  yet this exceptionally delicatelyorganised boy and youth was in a circle where not to conform to the coarse drinkingcustoms of his day was to incur censure and ridicule  that he early acquired the power of bearing large quantities of liquor is manifested by the record in his journal that on the day when he read the severe edinburgh article upon his schoolboy poems he drank three bottles of claret at a sitting  yet byron was so far superior to his times that some vague impulses to physiological prudence seem to have suggested themselves to him and been acted upon with great vigour  he never could have lived so long as he did under the exhaustive process of every kind of excess if he had not reenforced his physical nature by an assiduous care of his muscular system  he took boxinglessons and distinguished himself in all athletic exercises  he also had periods in which he seemed to try vaguely to retrieve himself from dissipation and to acquire selfmastery by what he called temperance  but ignorant and excessive in all his movements his very efforts at temperance were intemperate  from violent excesses in eating and drinking he would pass to no less unnatural periods of utter abstinence thus the very conservative power which nature has of adapting herself to any settled course was lost  the extreme sensitiveness produced by long periods of utter abstinence made the succeeding debauch more maddening and fatal  he was like a fine musical instrument whose strings were every day alternating between extreme tension and perfect laxity  we have in his journal many passages of which the following is a specimen     i have dined regularly today for the first time since sunday last    this being sabbath tooall the rest tea and dry biscuits six per    diem  i wish to god i had not dined now  it kills me with    heaviness stupor and horrible dreams and yet it was but a pint of    bucellas and fish  meat i never touch nor much vegetable diet  i    wish i were in the country to take exercise instead of being obliged    to cool by abstinence in lieu of it  i should not so much mind a    little accession of flesh my bones can well bear it  but the worst    is the devil always came with it till i starved him out and i will    not be the slave of any appetite  if i do err it shall be my heart    at least that heralds the way  o my head how it aches  the horrors    of digestion  i wonder how bonapartes dinner agrees with    himmoores life vol ii p264  from all the contemporary history and literature of the times therefore we have reason to believe that lord byron spoke the exact truth when he said to medwin     my own master at an age when i most required a guide left to the    dominion of my passions when they were the strongest with a fortune    anticipated before i came into possession of it and a constitution    impaired by early excesses i commenced my travels in 1809 with a    joyless indifference to the world and all that was before    memedwins conversations p42  utter prostration of the whole physical man from intemperate excess the deadness to temptation which comes from utter exhaustion was his condition according to himself and moore when he first left england at twentyone years of age  in considering his subsequent history we are to take into account that it was upon the brain and nervepower thus exhausted by early excess that the draughts of sudden and rapid literary composition began to be made  there was something unnatural and unhealthy in the rapidity clearness and vigour with which his various works followed each other subsequently to the first two cantos of childe harold the bride of abydos the corsair the giaour lara parisina and the siege of corinth all followed close upon each other in a space of less than three years and those the three most critical years of his life  the bride of abydos came out in the autumn of 1813 and was written in a week and the corsair was composed in thirteen days  a few months more than a year before his marriage and the brief space of his married life was the period in which all this literary labour was performed while yet he was running the wild career of intrigue and fashionable folly  he speaks of lara as being tossed off in the intervals between masquerades and balls etc  it is with the physical results of such unnatural efforts that we have now chiefly to do  every physiologist would say that the demands of such poems on a healthy brain in that given space must have been exhausting but when we consider that they were cheques drawn on a bank broken by early extravagance and that the subject was prodigally spending vital forces in every other direction at the same time one can scarcely estimate the physiological madness of such a course as lord byrons  it is evident from his journal and moores account that any amount of physical force which was for the time restored by his first foreign travel was recklessly spent in this period when he threw himself with a mad recklessness into london society in the time just preceding his marriage  the revelations made in moores memoir of this period are sad enough those to medwin are so appalling as to the state of contemporary society in england as to require at least the benefit of the doubt for which lord byrons habitual carelessness of truth gave scope  his adventures with ladies of the highest rank in england are there paraded with a freedom of detail that respect for womanhood must lead every woman to question  the only thing that is unquestionable is that lord byron made these assertions to medwin not as remorseful confessions but as relations of his bonnes fortunes and that medwin published them in the very face of the society to which they related  when lord byron says i have seen a great deal of italian society and swum in a gondola but nothing could equal the profligacy of high life in england     when i knew it he makes certainly strong assertions if we remember what mr moore reveals of the harem kept in venice  but when lord byron intimates that three married women in his own rank in life who had once held illicit relations with him made weddingvisits to his wife at one time we must hope that he drew on his active imagination as he often did in his statements in regard to women  when he relates at large his amour with lord melbournes wife and represents her as pursuing him with an insane passion to which he with difficulty responded and when he says that she tracked a rival lady to his lodgings and came into them herself disguised as a carmanone hopes that he exaggerates  and what are we to make of passages like this     there was a lady at that time double my own age the mother of    several children who were perfect angels with whom i formed a liaison    that continued without interruption for eight months  she told me she    was never in love till she was thirty and i thought myself so with    her when she was forty  i never felt a stronger passion which she    returned with equal ardour            strange as it may seem she gained as all women do an influence    over me so strong that i had great difficulty in breaking with her  unfortunately these statements though probably exaggerated are for substance borne out in the history of the times  with every possible abatement for exaggeration in these statements there remains still undoubted evidence from other sources that lord byron exercised a most peculiar and fatal power over the moral sense of the women with whom he was brought in relation and that love for him in many women became a sort of insanity depriving them of the just use of their faculties  all this makes his fatal history both possible and probable  even the article in blackwood written in 1825 for the express purpose of vindicating his character admits that his name had been coupled with those of three four or more women of rank whom it speaks of as licentious unprincipled characterless women  that such a course in connection with alternate extremes of excess and abstinence in eating and drinking and the immense draughts on the brain power of rapid and brilliant composition should have ended in that abnormal state in which cravings for unnatural vice give indications of approaching braindisease seems only too probable  this symptom of exhausted vitality becomes often a frequent type in periods of very corrupt society  the dregs of the old greek and roman civilisation were foul with it and the apostle speaks of the turning of the use of the natural into that which is against nature as the last step in abandonment  the very literature of such periods marks their want of physical and moral soundness  having lost all sense of what is simple and natural and pure the mind delights to dwell on horrible ideas which give a shuddering sense of guilt and crime  all the writings of this fatal period of lord byrons life are more or less intense histories of unrepentant guilt and remorse or of unnatural crime  a recent writer in temple bar brings to light the fact that the bride of abydos the first of the brilliant and rapid series of poems which began in the period immediately preceding his marriage was in its first composition an intense story of love between a brother and sister in a turkish harem that lord byron declared in a letter to galt that it was drawn from real life that in compliance with the prejudices of the age he altered the relationship to that of cousins before publication  this same writer goes on to show by a series of extracts from lord byrons published letters and journals that his mind about this time was in a fearfully unnatural state and suffering singular and inexplicable agonies of remorse that though he was accustomed fearlessly to confide to his friends immoralities which would be looked upon as damning there was now a secret to which he could not help alluding in his letters but which he told moore he could not tell now but some day or other when we are veterans  he speaks of his heart as eating itself out of a mysterious person whom he says god knows i love too well and the devil probably too  he wrote a song and sent it to moore addressed to a partner in some awful guilt whose very name he dares not mention because        there is grief in the sound there is guilt in the fame  he speaks of struggles of remorse of efforts at repentance and returns to guilt with a sort of horror very different from the wellpleased air with which he relates to medwin his common intrigues and adulteries  he speaks of himself generally as oppressed by a frightful unnatural gloom and horror and when occasionally happy not in a way that can or ought to last  the giaour the corsair lara parisina the siege of corinth and manfred all written or conceived about this period of his life give one picture of a desperate despairing unrepentant soul whom suffering maddens but cannot reclaim  in all these he paints only the one woman of concentrated unconsidering passion ready to sacrifice heaven and defy hell for a guilty man beloved in spite of religion or reason  in this unnatural literature the stimulus of crime is represented as intensifying love  medora gulnare the page in lara parisina and the lost sister of manfred love the more intensely because the object of the love is a criminal out lawed by god and man  the next step beyond this ismadness  the work of dr forbes winslow on obscure diseases of the brain and nerves 258 contains a passage so very descriptive of the case of lord byron that it might seem to have been written for it  the sixth chapter of his work on anomalous and masked affections of the mind contains in our view the only clue that can unravel the sad tragedy of byrons life  he says p87     these forms of unrecognised mental disorder are not always    accompanied by any wellmarked disturbance of the bodily health    requiring medical attention or any obvious departure from a normal    state of thought and conduct such as to justify legal interference    neither do these affections always incapacitate the party from    engaging in the ordinary business of life      the change may have    progressed insidiously and stealthily having slowly and almost    imperceptibly induced important molecular modifications in the    delicate vesicular neurine of the brain ultimately resulting in some    aberration of the ideas alteration of the affections or perversion    of the propensities or instincts        mental disorder of a dangerous character has been known for years to    be stealthily advancing without exciting the slightest notion of its    presence until some sad and terrible catastrophe homicide or    suicide has painfully awakened attention to its existence  persons    suffering from latent insanity often affect singularity of dress    gait conversation and phraseology  the most trifling circumstances    stimulate their excitability  they are martyrs to ungovernable    paroxysms of passion are inflamed to a state of demoniacal fury by    the most insignificant of causes and occasionally lose all sense of    delicacy of feeling sentiment refinement of manners and    conversation  such manifestations of undetected mental disorder may    be seen associated with intellectual and moral qualities of the    highest order  in another place dr winslow again adverts to this latter symptom which was strikingly marked in the case of lord byron     all delicacy and decency of thought are occasionally banished from    the mind so effectually does the principle of thought in these    attacks succumb to the animal instincts and passions         such cases will commonly be found associated with organic    predisposition to insanity or cerebral disease      modifications    of the malady are seen allied with genius  the biographies of cowper    burns byron johnson pope and haydon establish that the most    exalted intellectual conditions do not escape unscathed     in early childhood this form of mental disturbance may in many    cases be detected  to its existence is often to be traced the    motiveless crimes of the young  no one can compare this passage of dr forbes winslow with the incidents we have already cited as occurring in that fatal period before the separation of lord and lady byron and not feel that the hapless young wife was indeed struggling with those inflexible natural laws which at some stages of retribution involve in their awful sweep the guilty with the innocent  she longed to save but he was gone past redemption alcoholic stimulants and licentious excesses without doubt had produced those unseen changes in the brain of which dr forbes winslow speaks and the results were terrible in proportion to the peculiar fineness and delicacy of the organism deranged  alas the history of lady byron is the history of too many women in every rank of life who are called in agonies of perplexity and fear to watch that gradual process by which physical excesses change the organism of the brain till slow creeping moral insanity comes on  the woman who is the helpless victim of cruelties which only unnatural states of the brain could invent who is heartsick today and dreads tomorrowlooks in hopeless horror on the fatal process by which a lover and a protector changes under her eyes from day to day to a brute and a fiend  lady byrons married lifealas it is lived over in many a cottage and tenementhouse with no understanding on either side of the cause of the woeful misery  dr winslow truly says the science of these brainaffections is yet in its infancy in england  at that time it had not even begun to be madness was a fixed point and the inquiries into it had no nicety  its treatment if established had no redeeming power  insanity simply locked a man up as a dangerous being and the very suggestion of it therefore was resented as an injury  a most peculiar and affecting feature of that form of brain disease which hurries its victim as by an overpowering mania into crime is that often the moral faculties and the affections remain to a degree unimpaired and protest with all their strength against the outrage hence come conflicts and agonies of remorse proportioned to the strength of the moral nature  byron more than any other one writer may be called the poet of remorse  his passionate pictures of this feeling seem to give new power to the english language     there is a war a chaos of the mind    when all its elements convulsedcombined    lie dark and jarring with perturbed force    and gnashing with impenitent remorse    that juggling fiend who never spake before    but cries i warned thee when the deed is oer  it was this remorse that formed the only redeeming feature of the case its eloquence its agonies won from all hearts the interest that we give to a powerful nature in a state of danger and ruin and it may be hoped that this feeling which tempers the stern justice of human judgments may prove only a faint image of the wider charity of him whose thoughts are as far above ours as the heaven is above the earth    chapter vii  how could she love him   it has seemed to some wholly inconsistent that lady byron if this story were true could retain any kindly feeling for lord byron or any tenderness for his memory that the profession implied a certain hypocrisy but in this sad review we may see how the woman who once had loved him might in spite of every wrong he had heaped upon her still have looked on this awful wreck and ruin chiefly with pity  while she stood afar and refused to justify or join in the polluted idolatry which defended his vices there is evidence in her writings that her mind often went back mournfully as a mothers would to the early days when he might have been saved  one of her letters in robinsons memoirs in regard to his religious opinions shows with what intense earnestness she dwelt upon the unhappy influences of his childhood and youth and those early theologies which led him to regard himself as one of the reprobate  she says     not merely from casual expressions but from the whole tenor of lord    byrons feelings i could not but conclude that he was a believer in    the inspiration of the bible and had the gloomiest calvinistic    tenets  to that unhappy view of the relation of the creature to the    creator i have always ascribed the misery of his life     it is enough for me to know that he who thinks his transgression    beyond forgiveness    has righteousness beyond that of the self    satisfied sinner  it is impossible for me to doubt that could he    once have been assured of pardon his living faith in moral duty and    love of virtue i love the virtues that i cannot claim would have    conquered every temptation  judge then how i must hate the creed    that made him see god as an avenger and not as a father  my own    impressions were just the reverse but could have but little weight    and it was in vain to seek to turn his thoughts from that fixed idea    with which he connected his personal peculiarity as a stamp  instead    of being made happier by any apparent good he felt convinced that    every blessing would be turned into a curse to him    the worst of    it is i do believe he said  i like all connected with him was    broken against the rock of predestination  i may be pardoned for my    frequent reference to the sentiment expressed by him that i was    only sent to show him the happiness he was forbidden to enjoy  in this letter we have the heart not of the wife but of the motherthe love that searches everywhere for extenuations of the guilt it is forced to confess  that lady byron was not alone in ascribing such results to the doctrines of calvinism in certain cases appears from the language of the thirty nine articles which says     as the godly consideration of predestination and our election in    christ is full of sweet pleasant and unspeakable comfort to godly    persons and such as feel in themselves the workings of the spirit of    christ     so for curious and carnal persons lacking the spirit    of christ to have continually before their eyes the sentence of gods    predestination is a most dangerous downfall whereby the devil doth    thrust them either into desperation or into recklessness of most    unclean livingno less perilous than desperation  lord byrons life is an exact commentary on these words which passed under the revision of calvin himself  the whole tone of this letter shows not only that lady byron never lost her deep interest in her husband but that it was by this experience that all her religious ideas were modified  there is another of these letters in which she thus speaks of her husbands writings and character     the author of the article on goethe appears to me to have the mind    which could dispel the illusion about another poet without    depreciating his claims    to the truest inspiration     who has sought to distinguish between the holy and the unholy in that    spirit to prove by the very degradation of the one how high the    other was  a character is never done justice to by extenuating its    faults so i do not agree to nisi bonum  it is kinder to read the    blotted page  these letters show that lady byrons idea was that even were the whole mournful truth about lord byron fully told there was still a foundation left for pity and mercy  she seems to have remembered that if his sins were peculiar so also were his temptations and to have schooled herself for years to gather up and set in order in her memory all that yet remained precious in this great ruin  probably no english writer that ever has made the attempt could have done this more perfectly  though lady byron was not a poet par excellence yet she belonged to an order of souls fully equal to lord byron  hers was more the analytical mind of the philosopher than the creative mind of the poet and it was for that reason the one mind in our day capable of estimating him fully both with justice and mercy  no person in england had a more intense sensibility to genius in its loftier acceptation than lady byron and none more completely sympathised with what was pure and exalted in her husbands writings  there is this peculiarity in lord byron that the pure and the impure in his poetry often run side by side without mixingas one may see at geneva the muddy stream of the arve and the blue waters of the rhone flowing together unmingled  what for example can be nobler and in a higher and tenderer moral strain than his lines on the dying gladiator in childe harold  what is more like the vigour of the old hebrew scriptures than his thunderstorm in the alps  what can more perfectly express moral ideality of the highest kind than the exquisite descriptions of aurora rabypure and high in thought and language occurring as they do in a work full of the most utter vileness  lady byrons hopes for her husband fastened themselves on all the noble fragments yet remaining in that shattered temple of his mind which lay blackened and thunderriven and she looked forward to a sphere beyond this earth where infinite mercy should bring all again to symmetry and order  if the strict theologian must regret this as an undue latitude of charity let it at least be remembered that it was a charity which sprang from a christian virtue and which she extended to every human being however lost however low  in her view the mercy which took him was mercy that could restore all  in my recollections of the interview with lady byron when this whole history was presented i can remember that it was with a softened and saddened feeling that i contemplated the story as one looks on some awful inexplicable ruin  the last letter which i addressed to lady byron upon this subject will show that such was the impression of the whole interview  it was in reply to the one written on the death of my son                                       jan 30 1858     my dear friendi did long to hear from you at a time when few knew    how to speak because i knew that you had known everything that sorrow    can teachyou whose whole life has been a crucifixion a long    ordeal     but i believe that the lamb who stands for ever in the midst of the    throne as it had been slain has everywhere his followersthose    who seem sent into the world as he was to suffer for the redemption    of others and like him they must look to the joy set before    themof redeeming others     i often think that god called you to this beautiful and terrible    ministry when he suffered you to link your destiny with one so    strangely gifted and so fearfully tempted  perhaps the reward that is    to meet you when you enter within the veil where you must so soon pass    will be to see that spirit once chained and defiled set free and    purified and to know that to you it has been given by your life of    love and faith to accomplish this glorious change     i think increasingly on the subject on which you conversed with me    oncethe future state of retribution  it is evident to me that the    spirit of christianity has produced in the human spirit a tenderness    of love which wholly revolts from the old doctrine on this subject    and i observe that the more christlike anyone becomes the more    difficult it seems for them to accept it as hitherto presented  and    yet on the contrary it was christ who said fear him that is able    to destroy both soul and body in hell and the most appalling    language is that of christ himself     certain ideas once prevalent certainly must be thrown off  an    endless infliction for past sins was once the doctrine that we now    generally reject  the doctrine now generally taught is that an    eternal persistence in evil necessitates everlasting suffering since    evil induces misery by the eternal nature of things and this i fear    is inferable from the analogies of nature and confirmed by the whole    implication of the bible     what attention have you given to this subject and is there any fair    way of disposing of the current of assertion and the still deeper    undercurrent of implication on this subject without admitting one    which loosens all faith in revelation and throws us on pure    naturalism  but of one thing i always feel sure probation does not    end with this present life and the number of the saved may therefore    be infinitely greater than the worlds history leads us to suppose     i think the bible implies a great crisis a struggle an agony in    which god and christ and all the good are engaged in redeeming from    sin and we are not to suppose that the little portion that is done    for souls as they pass between the two doors of birth and death is    all     the bible is certainly silent there  the primitive church believed    in the mercies of an intermediate state and it was only the abuse of    it by romanism that drove the church into its present position which    i think is wholly indefensible and wholly irreconcilable with the    spirit of christ  for if it were the case that probation in all    cases begins and ends here gods example would surely be one that    could not be followed and he would seem to be far less persevering    than even human beings in efforts to save     nothing is plainer than that it would be wrong to give up any mind to    eternal sin till every possible thing had been done for its recovery    and that is so clearly not the case here that i can see that with    thoughtful minds this belief would cut the very roots of religious    faith in god for there is a difference between facts that we do not    understand and facts which we do understand and perceive to be    wholly irreconcilable with a certain character professed by god     if god says he is love and certain ways of explaining scripture make    him less loving and patient than man then we make scripture    contradict itself  now as no passage of scripture limits probation    to this life and as one passage in peter certainly unequivocally    asserts that christ preached to the spirits in prison while his body    lay in the grave i am clear upon this point     but it is also clear that if there be those who persist in refusing    gods love who choose to dash themselves for ever against the    inflexible laws of the universe such souls must for ever suffer     there may be souls who hate purity because it reveals their vileness    who refuse gods love and prefer eternal conflict with it  for such    there can be no peace  even in this life we see those whom the    purest selfdevoting love only inflames to madness and we have only    to suppose an eternal persistence in this to suppose eternal misery     but on this subject we can only leave all reverently in the hands of    that being whose almighty power is declared chiefly in showing    mercy    chapter viii  conclusion   in leaving this subject i have an appeal to make to the men and more especially to the women who have been my readers  in justice to lady byron it must be remembered that this publication of her story is not her act but mine  i trust you have already conceded that in so severe and peculiar a trial she had a right to be understood fully by her immediate circle of friends and to seek of them counsel in view of the moral questions to which such very exceptional circumstances must have given rise  her communication to me was not an address to the public it was a statement of the case for advice  true by leaving the whole unguarded by pledge or promise it left discretionary power with me to use it if needful  you my sisters are to judge whether the accusation laid against lady byron by the blackwood in 1869 was not of so barbarous a nature as to justify my producing the truth i held in my hands in reply  the blackwood claimed a right to reopen the subject because it was not a private but a public matter  it claimed that lord byrons unfortunate marriage might have changed not only his own destiny but that of all england  it suggested that but for this instead of wearing out his life in vice and corrupting society by impure poetry he might at this day have been leading the counsels of the state and helping the onward movements of the world  then it directly charged lady byron with meanly forsaking her husband in a time of worldly misfortune with fabricating a destructive accusation of crime against him and confirming this accusation by years of persistent silence more guilty than open assertion  it has been alleged that even admitting that lady byrons story were true it never ought to have been told  is it true then that a woman has not the same right to individual justice that a man has  if the cases were reversed would it have been thought just that lord byron should go down in history loaded with accusations of crime because he could be only vindicated by exposing the crime of his wife  it has been said that the crime charged on lady byron was comparatively unimportant and the one against lord byron was deadly  but the blackwood in opening the controversy called lady byron by the name of an unnatural female criminal whose singular atrocities alone entitle her to infamous notoriety and the crime charged upon her was sufficient to warrant the comparison  both crimes are foul unnatural horrible and there is no middle ground between the admission of the one or the other  you must either conclude that a woman all whose other works words and deeds were generous just and gentle committed this one monstrous exceptional crime without a motive and against all the analogies of her character and all the analogies of her treatment of others or you must suppose that a man known by all testimony to have been boundlessly licentious who took the very course which by every physiological law would have led to unnatural results did at last commit an unnatural crime  the question whether i did right when lady byron was thus held up as an abandoned criminal by the blackwood to interpose my knowledge of the real truth in her defence is a serious one but it is one for which i must account to god alone and in which without any contempt of the opinions of my fellowcreatures i must say that it is a small thing to be judged of mans judgment  i had in the case a responsibility very different from that of many others  i had been consulted in relation to the publication of this story by lady byron at a time when she had it in her power to have exhibited it with all its proofs and commanded an instant conviction  i have reason to think that my advice had some weight in suppressing that disclosure  i gave that advice under the impression that the byron controversy was a thing for ever passed and never likely to return  it had never occurred to me that nine years after lady byrons death a standard english periodical would declare itself free to reopen this controversy when all the generation who were her witnesses had passed from earth and that it would reopen it in the most savage form of accusation and with the indorsement and commendation of a book of the vilest slanders edited by lord byrons mistress  let the reader mark the retributions of justice  the accusations of the blackwood in 1869 were simply an intensified form of those first concocted by lord byron in his clytemnestra poem of 1816  he forged that weapon and bequeathed it to his party  the blackwood took it up gave it a sharper edge and drove it to the heart of lady byrons fame the result has been the disclosure of this history  it is then lord byron himself who by his network of wiles his ceaseless persecutions of his wife his efforts to extend his partisanship beyond the grave has brought on this tumultuous exposure  he and he alone is the cause of this revelation  and now i have one word to say to those in england who with all the facts and documents in their hands which could at once have cleared lady byrons fame allowed the barbarous assault of the blackwood to go over the civilised world without a reply  i speak to those who knowing that i am speaking the truth stand silent to those who have now the ability to produce the facts and documents by which this cause might be instantly settled and who do not produce them  i do not judge them but i remind them that a day is coming when they and i must stand side by side at the great judgmentseati to give an account for my speaking they for their silence  in that day all earthly considerations will have vanished like morning mists and truth or falsehood justice or injustice will be the only realities  in that day god who will judge the secrets of all men will judge between this man and this woman  then if never before the full truth shall be told both of the depraved and dissolute man who made it his lifes object to defame the innocent and the silent the selfdenying woman who made it her lifes object to give space for repentance to the guilty       part iii  miscellaneous documents   the true story of lady byrons life as originally published in the atlantic monthly   the reading world of america has lately been presented with a book which is said to sell rapidly and which appears to meet with universal favour  the subject of the book may be thus briefly stated the mistress of lord byron comes before the world for the sake of vindicating his fame from slanders and aspersions cast on him by his wife  the story of the mistress versus wife may be summed up as follows  lord byron the hero of the story is represented as a human being endowed with every natural charm gift and grace who by the one false step of an unsuitable marriage wrecked his whole life  a narrowminded coldhearted precisian without sufficient intellect to comprehend his genius or heart to feel for his temptations formed with him one of those mere worldly marriages common in high life and finding that she could not reduce him to the mathematical proprieties and conventional rules of her own mode of life suddenly and without warning abandoned him in the most cruel and inexplicable manner  it is alleged that she parted from him in apparent affection and good humour wrote him a playful confiding letter upon the way but after reaching her fathers house suddenly and without explanation announced to him that she would never see him again that this sudden abandonment drew down upon him a perfect storm of scandalous stories which his wife never contradicted that she never in any way or shape stated what the exact reasons for her departure had been and thus silently gave scope to all the malice of thousands of enemies  the sensitive victim was actually driven from england his home broken up and he doomed to be a lonely wanderer on foreign shores  in italy under bluer skies and among a gentler people with more tolerant modes of judgment the authoress intimates that he found peace and consolation  a lovely young italian countess falls in love with him and breaking her family ties for his sake devotes herself to him and in blissful retirement with her he finds at last that domestic life for which he was so fitted  soothed calmed and refreshed he writes don juan which the world is at this late hour informed was a poem with a high moral purpose designed to be a practical illustration of the doctrine of total depravity among young gentlemen in high life  under the elevating influence of love he rises at last to higher realms of moral excellence and resolves to devote the rest of his life to some noble and heroic purpose becomes the saviour of greece and dies untimely leaving a nation to mourn his loss  the authoress dwells with a peculiar bitterness on lady byrons entire silence during all these years as the most aggravated form of persecution and injury  she informs the world that lord byron wrote his autobiography with the purpose of giving a fair statement of the exact truth in the whole matter and that lady byron bought up the manuscript of the publisher and insisted on its being destroyed unread thus inflexibly depriving her husband of his last chance of a hearing before the tribunal of the public  as a result of this silent persistent cruelty on the part of a cold correct narrowminded woman the character of lord byron has been misunderstood and his name transmitted to afterages clouded with aspersions and accusations which it is the object of this book to remove        such is the story of lord byrons mistressa story which is going the length of this american continent and rousing up new sympathy with the poet and doing its best to bring the youth of america once more under the power of that brilliant seductive genius from which it was hoped they had escaped  already we are seeing it revamped in magazinearticles which take up the slanders of the paramour and enlarge on them and wax eloquent in denunciation of the marblehearted insensible wife  all this while it does not appear to occur to the thousands of unreflecting readers that they are listening merely to the story of lord byrons mistress and of lord byron and that even by their own showing their heaviest accusation against lady byron is that she has not spoken at all  her story has never been told  for many years after the rupture between lord byron and his wife that poets personality fate and happiness had an interest for the whole civilized world which we will venture to say was unparalleled  it is within the writers recollection how in the obscure mountaintown where she spent her early days lord byrons separation from his wife was for a season the allengrossing topic  she remembers hearing her father recount at the breakfasttable the facts as they were given in the public papers together with his own suppositions and theories of the causes  lord byrons fare thee well addressed to lady byron was set to music and sung with tears by young schoolgirls even in this distant america  madame de stael said of this appeal that she was sure it would have drawn her at once to his heart and his arms she could have forgiven everything and so said all the young ladies all over the world not only in england but in france and germany wherever byrons poetry appeared in translation  lady byrons obdurate coldheartedness in refusing even to listen to his prayers or to have any intercourse with him which might lead to reconciliation was the one point conceded on all sides  the stricter moralists defended her but gentler hearts throughout all the world regarded her as a marblehearted monster of correctness and morality a personification of the law unmitigated by the gospel  literature in its highest walks busied itself with lady byron  hogg in the character of the ettrick shepherd devotes several eloquent passages to expatiating on the conjugal fidelity of a poor highland shepherds wife who by patience and prayer and forgiveness succeeds in reclaiming her drunken husband and making a good man of him and then points his moral by contrasting with this touching picture the coldhearted pharisaical correctness of lady byron  moore in his life of lord byron when beginning the recital of the series of disgraceful amours which formed the staple of his life in venice has this passage  highly censurable in point of morality and decorum as was his course of life while under the roof of madame  it was with pain i am forced to confess venial in comparison with the strange headlong career of licence to which when weaned from that connection he so unrestrainedly and it may be added defyingly abandoned himself  of the state of his mind on leaving england i have already endeavoured to convey some idea and among the feelings that went to make up that selfcentred spirit of resistance which he then opposed to his fate was an indignant scorn for his own countrymen for the wrongs he thought they had done him  for a time the kindly sentiments which he still harboured toward lady byron and a sort of vague hope perhaps that all would yet come right again kept his mind in a mood somewhat more softened and docile as well as sufficiently under the influence of english opinions to prevent his breaking out into open rebellion against it as he unluckily did afterward  by the failure of the attempted mediation with lady byron his last link with home was severed while notwithstanding the quiet and unobtrusive life which he led at geneva there was as yet he found no cessation of the slanderous warfare against his character the same busy and misrepresenting spirit which had tracked his every step at home having with no less malicious watchfulness dogged him into exile  we should like to know what the misrepresentations and slanders must have been when this sort of thing is admitted in mr moores justification it seems to us rather wonderful how anybody unless it were a person like the countess guiccioli could misrepresent a life such as even byrons friend admits he was leading  during all these years when he was setting at defiance every principle of morality and decorum the interest of the female mind all over europe in the conversion of this brilliant prodigal son was unceasing and reflects the greatest credit upon the faith of the sex  madame de stael commenced the first effort at evangelization immediately after he left england and found her catechumen in a most edifying state of humility  he was metaphorically on his knees in penitence and confessed himself a miserable sinner in the loveliest manner possible such sweetness and humility took all hearts  his conversations with madame de stael were printed and circulated all over the world making it to appear that only the inflexibility of lady byron stood in the way of his entire conversion  lady blessington among many others took him in hand five or six years afterwards and was greatly delighted with his docility and edified by his frank and free confessions of his miserable offences  nothing now seemed wanting to bring the wanderer home to the fold but a kind word from lady byron  but when the fair countess offered to mediate the poet only shook his head in tragic despair he had so many times tried in vain lady byrons course had been from the first that of obdurate silence  any one who would wish to see a specimen of the skill of the honourable poet in mystification will do well to read a letter to lady byron which lord byron on parting from lady blessington enclosed for her to read just before he went to greece  he says  the letter which i enclose i was prevented from sending by my despair of its doing any good  i was perfectly sincere when i wrote it and am so still  but it is difficult for me to withstand the thousand provocations on that subject which both friends and foes have for seven years been throwing in the way of a man whose feelings were once quick and whose temper was never patient        to lady byron care of the hon mrs leigh london                                   pisa nov 17 1821  i have to acknowledge the receipt of adas hair which is very soft and pretty and nearly as dark already as mine was at twelve years old if i may judge from what i recollect of some in augustas possession taken at that age  but it dont curlperhaps from its being let grow  i also thank you for the inscription of the date and name and i will tell you why i believe that they are the only two or three words of your handwriting in my possession  for your letters i returned and except the two words or rather the one word household written twice in an old account book i have no other  i burnt your last note for two reasons firstly it was written in a style not very agreeable and secondly i wished to take your word without documents which are the worldly resources of suspicious people  i suppose that this note will reach you somewhere about adas birthdaythe 10th of december i believe  she will then be six so that in about twelve more i shall have some chance of meeting her perhaps sooner if i am obliged to go to england by business or otherwise  recollect however one thing either in distance or nearnessevery day which keeps us asunder should after so long a period rather soften our mutual feelings which must always have one rallying point as long as our child exists which i presume we both hope will be long after either of her parents  the time which has elapsed since the separation has been considerably more than the whole brief period of our union and the not much longer one of our prior acquaintance  we both made a bitter mistake but now it is over and irrevocably so  for at thirtythree on my part and few years less on yours though it is no very extended period of life still it is one when the habits and thought are generally so formed as to admit of no modification and as we could not agree when younger we should with difficulty do so now  i say all this because i own to you that notwithstanding everything i considered our reunion as not impossible for more than a year after the separation but then i gave up the hope entirely and for ever  but this very impossibility of reunion seems to me at least a reason why on all the few points of discussion which can arise between us we should preserve the courtesies of life and as much of its kindness as people who are never to meet may preserveperhaps more easily than nearer connections  for my own part i am violent but not malignant for only fresh provocations can awaken my resentments  to you who are colder and more concentrated i would just hint that you may sometimes mistake the depth of a cold anger for dignity and a worse feeling for duty  i assure you that i bear you now whatever i may have done no resentment whatever  remember that if you have injured me in aught this forgiveness is something and that if i have injured you it is something more still if it be true as the moralists say that the most offending are the least forgiving  whether the offence has been solely on my side or reciprocal or on yours chiefly i have ceased to reflect upon any but two things viz that you are the mother of my child and that we shall never meet again i think if you also consider the two corresponding points with reference to myself it will be better for all three                                    yours ever                                         noel byron  the artless thomas moore introduces this letter in the life with the remark  there are few i should think of my readers who will not agree with me in pronouncing that if the author of the following letter had not right on his side he had at least most of those good feelings which are found in general to accompany it  the reader is requested to take notice of the important admission that the letter was never sent to lady byron at all  it was in fact never intended for her but was a nice little dramatic performance composed simply with the view of acting on the sympathies of lady blessington and byrons numerous female admirers and the reader will agree with us we think that in this point of view it was very neatly done and deserves immortality as a work of high art  for six years he had been plunged into every kind of vice and excess pleading his shattered domestic joys and his wifes obdurate heart as the apology and the impelling cause filling the air with his shrieks and complaints concerning the slander which pursued him while he filled letters to his confidential correspondents with records of new mistresses  during all these years the silence of lady byron was unbroken though lord byron not only drew in private on the sympathies of his female admirers but employed his talents and position as an author in holding her up to contempt and ridicule before thousands of readers  we shall quote at length his side of the story which he published in the first canto of don juan that the reader may see how much reason he had for assuming the injured tone which he did in the letter to lady byron quoted above  that letter never was sent to her and the unmanly and indecent caricature of her and the indelicate exposure of the whole story on his own side which we are about to quote were the only communications that could have reached her solitude  in the following verses lady byron is represented as donna inez and lord byron as don jose but the incidents and allusions were so very pointed that nobody for a moment doubted whose history the poet was narrating     his mother was a learned lady famed       for every branch of every science known    in every christian language ever named       with virtues equalled by her wit alone    she made the cleverest people quite ashamed       and even the good with inward envy groaned    finding themselves so very much exceeded    in their own way by all the things that she did                                      save that her duty both to man and god    required this conduct which seemed very odd     she kept a journal where his faults were noted       and opened certain trunks of books and letters    all which might if occasion served be quoted       and then she had all seville for abettors    besides her good old grandmother who doted       the hearers of her case become repeaters    then advocates inquisitors and judges    some for amusement others for old grudges     and then this best and meekest woman bore       with such serenity her husbands woes    just as the spartan ladies did of yore       who saw their spouses killed and nobly chose    never to say a word about them more       calmly she heard each calumny that rose    and saw his agonies with such sublimity    that all the world exclaimed what magnanimity  this is the longest and most elaborate version of his own story that byron ever published but he busied himself with many others projecting at one time a spanish romance in which the same story is related in the same transparent manner but this he was dissuaded from printing  the booksellers however made a good speculation in publishing what they called his domestic poems that is poems bearing more or less relation to this subject  every person with whom he became acquainted with any degree of intimacy was made familiar with his side of the story  moores biography is from first to last in its representations founded upon byrons communicativeness and lady byrons silence and the world at last settled down to believing that the account so often repeated and never contradicted must be substantially a true one  the true history of lord and lady byron has long been perfectly understood in many circles in england but the facts were of a nature that could not be made public  while there was a young daughter living whose future might be prejudiced by its recital and while there were other persons on whom the disclosure of the real truth would have been crushing as an avalanche lady byrons only course was the perfect silence in which she took refuge and those sublime works of charity and mercy to which she consecrated her blighted early life  but the time is now come when the truth may be told  all the actors in the scene have disappeared from the stage of mortal existence and passed let us have faith to hope into a world where they would desire to expiate their faults by a late publication of the truth  no person in england we think would as yet take the responsibility of relating the true history which is to clear lady byrons memory but by a singular concurrence of circumstances all the facts of the case in the most undeniable and authentic form were at one time placed in the hands of the writer of this sketch with authority to make such use of them as she should judge best  had this melancholy history been allowed to sleep no public use would have been made of them but the appearance of a popular attack on the character of lady byron calls for a vindication and the true story of her married life will therefore now be related  lord byron has described in one of his letters the impression left upon his mind by a young person whom he met one evening in society and who attracted his attention by the simplicity of her dress and a certain air of singular purity and calmness with which she surveyed the scene around her  on inquiry he was told that this young person was miss milbanke an only child and one of the largest heiresses in england  lord byron was fond of idealising his experiences in poetry and the friends of lady byron had no difficulty in recognising the portrait of lady byron as she appeared at this time of her life in his exquisite description of aurora raby                                           there was    indeed a certain fair and fairy one       of the best class and better than her class    aurora raby a young star who shone       oer life too sweet an image for such glass    a lovely being scarcely formed or moulded    a rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded                                        early in years and yet more infantine       in figure she had something of sublime    in eyes which sadly shone as seraphs shine       all youth but with an aspect beyond time    radiant and grave as pitying mans decline    mournful but mournful of anothers crime    she looked as if she sat by edens door    and grieved for those who could return no more                                        she gazed upon a world she scarcely knew       as seeking not to know it silent lone    as grows a flower thus quietly she grew       and kept her heart serene within its zone    there was awe in the homage which she drew       her spirit seemed as seated on a throne    apart from the surrounding world and strong    in its own strengthmost strange in one so young  some idea of the course which their acquaintance took and of the manner in which he was piqued into thinking of her is given in a stanza or two     the dashing and proud air of adeline       imposed not upon her she saw her blaze    much as she would have seen a glowworm shine       then turned unto the stars for loftier rays    juan was something she could not divine       being no sibyl in the new worlds ways    yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor    because she did not pin her faith on feature     his fame too for he had that kind of fame       which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind    a heterogeneous mass of glorious blame       half virtues and whole vices being combined    faults which attract because they are not tame       follies tricked out so brightly that they blind    these seals upon her wax made no impression    such was her coldness or her selfpossession     aurora sat with that indifference       which piques a preux chevalieras it ought    of all offences thats the worst offence       which seems to hint you are not worth a thought                                        to his gay nothings nothing was replied       or something which was nothing as urbanity    required  aurora scarcely looked aside       nor even smiled enough for any vanity    the devil was in the girl  could it be pride       or modesty or absence or inanity                                        juan was drawn thus into some attentions       slight but select and just enough to express    to females of perspicuous comprehensions       that he would rather make them more than less    aurora at the last so history mentions       though probably much less a fact than guess    so far relaxed her thoughts from their sweet prison    as once or twice to smile if not to listen                                        but juan had a sort of winning way       a proud humility if such there be    which showed such deference to what females say       as if each charming word were a decree    his tact too tempered him from grave to gay        and taught him when to be reserved or free    he had the art of drawing people out    without their seeing what he was about     aurora who in her indifference       confounded him in common with the crowd    of flatterers though she deemed he had more sense       than whispering foplings or than witlings loud    commenced from such slight things will great commence       to feel that flattery which attracts the proud    rather by deference than compliment    and wins even by a delicate dissent     and then he had good looks that point was carried       nem con amongst the women                                           now though we know of old that looks deceive    and always have done somehow these good looks    make more impression than the best of books     aurora who looked more on books than faces       was very young although so very sage    admiring more minerva than the graces       especially upon a printed page    but virtues self with all her tightest laces       has not the natural stays of strict old age    and socrates that model of all duty    owned to a penchant though discreet for beauty  the presence of this highminded thoughtful unworldly woman is described through two cantos of the wild rattling don juan in a manner that shows how deeply the poet was capable of being affected by such an appeal to his higher nature  for instance when don juan sits silent and thoughtful amid a circle of persons who are talking scandal the poet says     tis true he saw aurora look as though       she approved his silence she perhaps mistook    its motive for that charity we owe       but seldom pay the absent                                        he gained esteem where it was worth the most       and certainly aurora had renewed    in him some feelings he had lately lost       or hardenedfeelings which perhaps ideal    are so divine that i must deem them real     the love of higher things and better days       the unbounded hope and heavenly ignorance    of what is called the world and the worlds ways       the moments when we gather from a glance    more joy than from all future pride or praise       which kindled manhood but can neer entrance    the heart in an existence of its own    of which anothers bosom is the zone     and full of sentiments sublime as billows       heaving between this world and worlds beyond    don juan when the midnight hour of pillows       arrived retired to his     in all these descriptions of a spiritual unworldly nature acting on the spiritual and unworldly part of his own nature every one who ever knew lady byron intimately must have recognised the model from which he drew and the experience from which he spoke even though nothing was further from his mind than to pay this tribute to the woman he had injured and though before these lines which showed how truly he knew her real character had come one stanza of ribald vulgar caricature designed as a slight to her     there was miss millpond smooth as summers sea       that usual paragon an only daughter    who seemed the cream of equanimity       till skimmed and then there was some milk and water    with a slight shade of blue too it might be       beneath the surface but what did it matter    loves riotous but marriage should have quiet    and being consumptive live on a milk diet  the result of byrons intimacy with miss milbanke and the enkindling of his nobler feelings was an offer of marriage which she though at the time deeply interested in him declined with many expressions of friendship and interest  in fact she already loved him but had that doubt of her power to be to him all that a wife should be which would be likely to arise in a mind so sensitively constituted and so unworldly they however continued a correspondence as friends on her part the interest continually increased on his the transient rise of better feelings was choked and overgrown by the thorns of base unworthy passions  from the height at which he might have been happy as the husband of a noble woman he fell into the depths of a secret adulterous intrigue with a blood relation so near in consanguinity that discovery must have been utter ruin and expulsion from civilised society  from henceforth this damning guilty secret became the ruling force in his life holding him with a morbid fascination yet filling him with remorse and anguish and insane dread of detection  two years after his refusal by miss milbanke his various friends seeing that for some cause he was wretched pressed marriage upon him  marriage has often been represented as the proper goal and terminus of a wild and dissipated career and it has been supposed to be the appointed mission of good women to receive wandering prodigals with all the rags and disgraces of their old life upon them and put rings on their hands and shoes on their feet and introduce them clothed and in their right minds to an honourable career in society  marriage was therefore universally recommended to lord byron by his numerous friends and wellwishers and so he determined to marry and in an hour of reckless desperation sat down and wrote proposals to two ladies  one was declined the other which was accepted was to miss milbanke  the world knows well that he had the gift of expression and will not be surprised that he wrote a very beautiful letter and that the woman who had already learned to love him fell at once into the snare  her answer was a frank outspoken avowal of her love for him giving herself to him heart and hand  the good in lord byron was not so utterly obliterated that he could receive such a letter without emotion or practise such unfairness on a loving trusting heart without pangs of remorse  he had sent the letter in mere recklessness he had not seriously expected to be accepted and the discovery of the treasure of affection which he had secured was like a vision of lost heaven to a soul in hell  but nevertheless in his letters written about the engagement there are sufficient evidences that his selflove was flattered at the preference accorded him by so superior a woman and one who had been so much sought he mentions with an air of complacency that she has employed the last two years in refusing five or six of his acquaintance that he had no idea she loved him admitting that it was an old attachment on his part  he dwells on her virtues with a sort of pride of ownership  there is a sort of childish levity about the frankness of these letters very characteristic of the man who skimmed over the deepest abysses with the lightest jests  before the world and to his intimates he was acting the part of the successful fiance conscious all the while of the deadly secret that lay cold at the bottom of his heart  when he went to visit miss milbankes parents as her accepted lover she was struck with his manner and appearance she saw him moody and gloomy evidently wrestling with dark and desperate thoughts and anything but what a happy and accepted lover should be  she sought an interview with him alone and told him that she had observed that he was not happy in the engagement and magnanimously added that if on review he found he had been mistaken in the nature of his feelings she would immediately release him and they should remain only friends  overcome with the conflict of his feelings lord byron fainted away  miss milbanke was convinced that his heart must really be deeply involved in an attachment with reference to which he showed such strength of emotion and she spoke no more of a dissolution of the engagement  there is no reason to doubt that byron was as he relates in his dream profoundly agonized and agitated when he stood before gods altar with the trusting young creature whom he was leading to a fate so awfully tragic yet it was not the memory of mary chaworth but another guiltier and more damning memory that overshadowed that hour  the moment the carriagedoors were shut upon the bridegroom and the bride the paroxysm of remorse and despairunrepentant remorse and angry despairbroke forth upon her gentle head  you might have saved me from this madam  you had all in your own power when i offered myself to you first  then you might have made me what you pleased but now you will find that you have married a devil  in miss martineaus sketches recently published is an account of the termination of this weddingjourney which brought them to one of lady byrons ancestral country seats where they were to spend the honeymoon  miss martineau says  at the altar she did not know that she was a sacrifice but before sunset of that winter day she knew it if a judgment may be formed from her face and attitude of despair when she alighted from the carriage on the afternoon of her marriageday  it was not the traces of tears which won the sympathy of the old butler who stood at the open door  the bridegroom jumped out of the carriage and walked away  the bride alighted and came up the steps alone with a countenance and frame agonized and listless with evident horror and despair  the old servant longed to offer his arm to the young lonely creature as an assurance of sympathy and protection  from this shock she certainly rallied and soon  the pecuniary difficulties of her new home were exactly what a devoted spirit like hers was fitted to encounter  her husband bore testimony after the catastrophe that a brighter being a more sympathising and agreeable companion never blessed any mans home  when he afterwards called her cold and mathematical and overpious and so forth it was when public opinion had gone against him and when he had discovered that her fidelity and mercy her silence and magnanimity might be relied on so that he was at full liberty to make his part good as far as she was concerned  silent she was even to her own parents whose feelings she magnanimously spared  she did not act rashly in leaving him though she had been most rash in marrying him  not all at once did the full knowledge of the dreadful reality into which she had entered come upon the young wife  she knew vaguely from the wild avowals of the first hours of their marriage that there was a dreadful secret of guilt that byrons soul was torn with agonies of remorse and that he had no love to give to her in return for a love which was ready to do and dare all for him  yet bravely she addressed herself to the task of soothing and pleasing and calming the man whom she had taken for better or for worse  young and gifted with a peculiar air of refined and spiritual beauty graceful in every movement possessed of exquisite taste a perfect companion to his mind in all the higher walks of literary culture and with that infinite pliability to all his varying capricious moods which true love alone can give bearing in her hand a princely fortune which with a womans uncalculating generosity was thrown at his feetthere is no wonder that she might feel for a while as if she could enter the lists with the very devil himself and fight with a womans weapons for the heart of her husband  there are indications scattered through the letters of lord byron which though brief indeed showed that his young wife was making every effort to accommodate herself to him and to give him a cheerful home  one of the poems that he sends to his publisher about this time he speaks of as being copied by her  he had always the highest regard for her literary judgments and opinions and this little incident shows that she was already associating herself in a wifely fashion with his aims as an author  the poem copied by her however has a sad meaning which she afterwards learned to understand only too well     theres not a joy the world can give like that it takes away    when the glow of early thought declines in feelings dull decay    tis not on youths smooth cheek the blush alone that fades so fast    but the tender bloom of heart is gone eer youth itself be past    then the few whose spirits float above the wreck of happiness    are driven oer the shoals of guilt or ocean of excess    the magnet of their course is gone or only points in vain    the shore to which their shivered sail shall never stretch again  only a few days before she left him for ever lord byron sent murray manuscripts in lady byrons handwriting of the siege of corinth and parisina and wrote  i am very glad that the handwriting was a favourable omen of the morale of the piece but you must not trust to that for my copyist would write out anything i desired in all the ignorance of innocence  there were lucid intervals in which lord byron felt the charm of his wifes mind and the strength of her powers  bell you could be a poet too if you only thought so he would say  there were summerhours in her stormy life the memory of which never left her when byron was as gentle and tender as he was beautiful when he seemed to be possessed by a good angel and then for a little time all the ideal possibilities of his nature stood revealed  the most dreadful men to live with are those who thus alternate between angel and devil  the buds of hope and love called out by a day or two of sunshine are frozen again and again till the tree is killed  but there came an hour of revelationan hour when in a manner which left no kind of room for doubt lady byron saw the full depth of the abyss of infamy which her marriage was expected to cover and understood that she was expected to be the cloak and the accomplice of this infamy  many women would have been utterly crushed by such a disclosure some would have fled from him immediately and exposed and denounced the crime  lady byron did neither  when all the hope of womanhood died out of her heart there arose within her stronger purer and brighter that immortal kind of love such as god feels for the sinnerthe love of which jesus spoke and which holds the one wanderer of more account than the ninety and nine that went not astray  she would neither leave her husband nor betray him nor yet would she for one moment justify his sin and hence came two years of convulsive struggle in which sometimes for a while the good angel seemed to gain ground and then the evil one returned with sevenfold vehemence  lord byron argued his case with himself and with her with all the sophistries of his powerful mind  he repudiated christianity as authority asserted the right of every human being to follow out what he called the impulses of nature  subsequently he introduced into one of his dramas the reasoning by which he justified himself in incest  in the drama of cain adah the sister and the wife of cain thus addresses him        cain walk not with this spirit    bear with what we have borne and love me i    love thee     lucifer  more than thy mother and thy sire     adah  i do  is that a sin too     lucifer                        no not yet    it one day will be in your

can circumstance make sin    of virtue  if it doth we are the slaves    of  lady byron though slight and almost infantine in her bodily presence had the soul not only of an angelic woman but of a strong reasoning man  it was the writers lot to know her at a period when she formed the personal acquaintance of many of the very first minds of england but among all with whom this experience brought her in connection there was none who impressed her so strongly as lady byron  there was an almost supernatural power of moral divination a grasp of the very highest and most comprehensive things that made her lightest opinions singularly impressive  no doubt this result was wrought out in a great degree from the anguish and conflict of these two years when with no one to help or counsel her but almighty god she wrestled and struggled with fiends of darkness for the redemption of her husbands soul  she followed him through all his sophistical reasonings with a keener reason  she besought and implored in the name of his better nature and by all the glorious things that he was capable of being and doing and she had just power enough to convulse and shake and agonise but not power enough to subdue  one of the first of living writers in the novel of romola has given in her masterly sketch of the character of tito the whole history of the conflict of a woman like lady byron with a nature like that of her husband  she has described a being full of fascinations and sweetnesses full of generosities and of goodnatured impulses a nature that could not bear to give pain or to see it in others but entirely destitute of any firm moral principle she shows how such a being merely by yielding step by step to the impulses of passion and disregarding the claims of truth and right becomes involved in a fatality of evil in which deceit crime and cruelty are a necessity forcing him to persist in the basest ingratitude to the father who has done all for him and hardhearted treachery to the highminded wife who has given herself to him wholly  there are few scenes in literature more fearfully tragic than the one between romola and tito when he finally discovers that she knows him fully and can be deceived by him no more  some such hour always must come for strong decided natures irrevocably pledgedone to the service of good and the other to the slavery of evil  the demoniac cried out what have i to do with thee jesus of nazareth  art thou come to torment me before the time  the presence of allpitying purity and love was a torture to the soul possessed by the demon of evil  these two years in which lady byron was with all her soul struggling to bring her husband back to his better self were a series of passionate convulsions  during this time such was the disordered and desperate state of his worldly affairs that there were ten executions for debt levied on their family establishment and it was lady byrons fortune each time which settled the account  toward the last she and her husband saw less and less of each other and he came more and more decidedly under evil influences and seemed to acquire a sort of hatred of her  lady byron once said significantly to a friend who spoke of some causeless dislike in another my dear i have known people to be hated for no other reason than because they impersonated conscience  the biographers of lord byron and all his apologists are careful to narrate how sweet and amiable and obliging he was to everybody who approached him and the saying of fletcher his manservant that anybody could do anything with my lord except my lady has often been quoted  the reason of all this will now be evident  my lady was the only one fully understanding the deep and dreadful secrets of his life who had the courage resolutely and persistently and inflexibly to plant herself in his way and insist upon it that if he went to destruction it should be in spite of her best efforts  he had tried his strength with her fully  the first attempt had been to make her an accomplice by sophistry by destroying her faith in christianity and confusing her sense of right and wrong to bring her into the ranks of those convenient women who regard the marriagetie only as a friendly alliance to cover licence on both sides  when her husband described to her the continental latitude the goodhumoured marriage in which complaisant couples mutually agreed to form the cloak for each others infidelities and gave her to understand that in this way alone she could have a peaceful and friendly life with him she answered him simply i am too truly your friend to do this  when lord byron found that he had to do with one who would not yield who knew him fully who could not be blinded and could not be deceived he determined to rid himself of her altogether  it was when the state of affairs between herself and her husband seemed darkest and most hopeless that the only child of this union was born lord byrons treatment of his wife during the sensitive period that preceded the birth of this child and during her confinement was marked by paroxysms of unmanly brutality for which the only possible charity on her part was the supposition of insanity  moore sheds a significant light on this period by telling us that about this time byron was often drunk day after day with sheridan  there had been insanity in the family and this was the plea which lady byrons love put in for him she regarded him as if not insane at least so nearly approaching the boundaries of insanity as to be a subject of forbearance and tender pity and she loved him with that love resembling a mothers which good wives often feel when they have lost all faith in their husbands principles and all hopes of their affections  still she was in heart and soul his best friend true to him with a truth which he himself could not shake  in the verses addressed to his daughter lord byron speaks of her as     the child of love though born in bitterness    and nurtured in convulsion  a day or two after the birth of this child lord byron came suddenly into lady byrons room and told her that her mother was dead  it was an utter falsehood but it was only one of the many nameless injuries and cruelties by which he expressed his hatred of her  a short time after her confinement she was informed by him in a note that as soon as she was able to travel she must go that he could not and would not longer have her about him and when her child was only five weeks old he carried this threat of expulsion into effect  here we will insert briefly lady byrons own account the only one she ever gave to the public of this separation  the circumstances under which this brief story was written are affecting  lord byron was dead  the whole account between him and her was closed for ever in this world  moores life had been prepared containing simply and solely lord byrons own version of their story  moore sent this version to lady byron and requested to know if she had any remarks to make upon it  in reply she sent a brief statement to himthe first and only one that had come from her during all the years of the separation and which appears to have mainly for its object the exculpation of her father and mother from the charge made by the poet of being the instigators of the separation  in this letter she says with regard to their separation  the facts are i left london for kirkby mallory the residence of my father and mother on the 15th of january 1816  lord byron had signified to me in writing jan 6 his absolute desire that i should leave london on the earliest day that i could conveniently fix  it was not safe for me to undertake the fatigue of a journey sooner than the 15th  previously to my departure it had been strongly impressed upon my mind that lord byron was under the influence of insanity  this opinion was derived in a great measure from the communications made me by his nearest relatives and personal attendant who had more opportunity than myself for observing him during the latter part of my stay in town  it was even represented to me that he was in danger of destroying himself  with the concurrence of his family i had consulted dr baillie as a friend jan 8 respecting the supposed malady  on acquainting him with the state of the case and with lord byrons desire that i should leave london dr baillie thought that my absence might be advisable as an experiment assuming the fact of mental derangement for dr baillie not having had access to lord byron could not pronounce a positive opinion on that point  he enjoined that in correspondence with lord byron i should avoid all but light and soothing topics  under these impressions i left london determined to follow the advice given by dr baillie whatever might have been the conduct of lord byron toward me from the time of my marriage yet supposing him to be in a state of mental alienation it was not for me nor for any person of common humanity to manifest at that moment a sense of injury  nothing more than this letter from lady byron is necessary to substantiate the fact that she did not leave her husband but was driven from himdriven from him that he might give himself up to the guilty infatuation that was consuming him without being tortured by her imploring face and by the silent power of her presence and her prayers  for a long time before this she had seen little of him  on the day of her departure she passed by the door of his room and stopped to caress his favourite spaniel which was lying there and she confessed to a friend the weakness of feeling a willingness even to be something as humble as that poor little creature might she only be allowed to remain and watch over him  she went into the room where he and the partner of his sins were sitting together and said byron i come to say goodbye offering at the same time her hand  lord byron put his hands behind him retreated to the mantelpiece and looking on the two that stood there with a sarcastic smile said when shall we three meet again  lady byron answered in heaven i trust and those were her last words to him on earth  now if the reader wishes to understand the real talents of lord byron for deception and dissimulation let him read with this story in his mind the fare thee well which he addressed to lady byron through the printer     fare thee well and if for ever       still for ever fare thee well    even though unforgiving never       gainst thee shall my heart rebel     would that breast were bared before thee       where thy head so oft hath lain    while that placid sleep came oer thee       thou canst never know again     though my many faults defaced me       could no other arm be found    than the one which once embraced me       to inflict a careless wound  the reaction of society against him at the time of the separation from his wife was something which he had not expected and for which it appears he was entirely unprepared  it broke up the guilty intrigue and drove him from england  he had not courage to meet or endure it  the world to be sure was very far from suspecting what the truth was but the tide was setting against him with such vehemence as to make him tremble every hour lest the whole should be known and henceforth it became a warfare of desperation to make his story good no matter at whose expense  he had tact enough to perceive at first that the assumption of the pathetic and the magnanimous and general confessions of faults accompanied with admissions of his wifes goodness would be the best policy in his case  in this mood he thus writes to moore  the fault was not in my choice unless in choosing at all for i do not believe and i must say it in the very dregs of all this bitter business that there ever was a better or even a brighter a kinder or a more amiable agreeable being than lady byron  i never had nor can have any reproach to make her while with me  where there is blame it belongs to myself  as there must be somewhere a scapegoat to bear the sin of the affair lord byron wrote a poem called a sketch in which he lays the blame of stirring up strife on a friend and former governess of lady byrons but in this sketch he introduces the following just eulogy on lady byron        foiled was perversion by that youthful mind    which flattery fooled not baseness could not blind    deceit infect not near contagion soil    indulgence weaken nor example spoil    nor mastered science tempt her to look down    on humbler talents with a pitying frown    nor genius swell nor beauty render vain    nor envy ruffle to retaliate pain    nor fortune change pride raise nor passion bow    nor virtue teach austeritytill now    serenely purest of her sex that live    but wanting one sweet weaknessto forgive    too shocked at faults her soul can never know    she deemed that all could be like her below    foe to all vice yet hardly virtues friend    for virtue pardons those she would amend  in leaving england lord byron first went to switzerland where he conceived and in part wrote out the tragedy of manfred  moore speaks of his domestic misfortunes and the sufferings which he underwent at this time as having influence in stimulating his genius so that he was enabled to write with a greater power  anybody who reads the tragedy of manfred with this story in his mind will see that it is true  the hero is represented as a gloomy misanthrope dwelling with impenitent remorse on the memory of an incestuous passion which has been the destruction of his sister for this life and the life to come but which to the very last gasp he despairingly refuses to repent of even while he sees the fiends of darkness rising to take possession of his departing soul  that byron knew his own guilt well and judged himself severely may be gathered from passages in this poem which are as powerful as human language can be made for instance this part of the incantation which moore says was written at this time     though thy slumber may be deep    yet thy spirit shall not sleep    there are shades which will not vanish    there are thoughts thou canst not banish    by a power to thee unknown    thou canst never be alone    thou art wrapt as with a shroud    thou art gathered in a cloud    and for ever shalt thou dwell    in the spirit of this spell                                                     from thy false tears i did distil    an essence which had strength to kill    from thy own heart i then did wring    the black blood in its blackest spring    from thy own smile i snatched the snake    for there it coiled as in a brake    from thy own lips i drew the charm    which gave all these their chiefest harm    in proving every poison known    i found the strongest was thine own     by thy cold breast and serpent smile    by thy unfathomed gulfs of guile    by that most seeming virtuous eye    by thy shut souls hypocrisy    by the perfection of thine art    which passed for human thine own heart    by thy delight in others pain    and by thy brotherhood of cain    i call upon thee and compel    thyself to be thy proper hell  again he represents manfred as saying to the old abbot who seeks to bring him to repentance     old man there is no power in holy men    nor charm in prayer nor purifying form    of penitence nor outward look nor fast    nor agony nor greater than all these    the innate tortures of that deep despair    which is remorse without the fear of hell    but all in all sufficient to itself    would make a hell of heaven can exorcise    from out the unbounded spirit the quick sense    of its own sins wrongs sufferance and revenge    upon itself there is no future pang    can deal that justice on the selfcondemned    he deals on his own soul  and when the abbot tells him        all this is well    for this will pass away and be succeeded    by an auspicious hope which shall look up    with calm assurance to that blessed place    which all who seek may win whatever be    their earthly errors  he answers     it is too late  then the old abbot soliloquises     this should have been a noble creature he    hath all the energy which would have made    a goodly frame of glorious elements    had they been wisely mingled as it is    it is an awful chaoslight and darkness    and mind and dust and passions and pure thoughts    mixed and contending without end or order  the world can easily see in moores biography what after this was the course of lord byrons life how he went from shame to shame and dishonour to dishonour and used the fortune which his wife brought him in the manner described in those private letters which his biographer was left to print  moore indeed says byron had made the resolution not to touch his ladys fortune but adds that it required more selfcommand than he possessed to carry out so honourable a purpose  lady byron made but one condition with him  she had him in her power and she exacted that the unhappy partner of his sins should not follow him out of england and that the ruinous intrigue should be given up  her inflexibility on this point kept up that enmity which was constantly expressing itself in some publication or other and which drew her and her private relations with him before the public  the story of what lady byron did with the portion of her fortune which was reserved to her is a record of noble and skilfully administered charities  pitiful and wise and strong there was no form of human suffering or sorrow that did not find with her refuge and help  she gave not only systematically but also impulsively  miss martineau claims for her the honour of having first invented practical schools in which the children of the poor were turned into agriculturists artizans seamstresses and good wives for poor men while she managed with admirable skill and economy permanent institutions of this sort she was always ready to relieve suffering in any form  the fugitive slaves william and ellen crafts escaping to england were fostered by her protecting care  in many cases where there was distress or anxiety from poverty among those too selfrespecting to make their sufferings known the delicate hand of lady byron ministered to the want with a consideration which spared the most refined feelings  as a mother her course was embarrassed by peculiar trials  the daughter inherited from the father not only brilliant talents but a restlessness and morbid sensibility which might be too surely traced to the storms and agitations of the period in which she was born  it was necessary to bring her up in ignorance of the true history of her mothers life and the consequence was that she could not fully understand that mother  during her early girlhood her career was a source of more anxiety than of comfort  she married a man of fashion ran a brilliant course as a gay woman of fashion and died early of a lingering and painful disease  in the silence and shaded retirement of the sickroom the daughter came wholly back to her mothers arms and heart and it was on that mothers bosom that she leaned as she went down into the dark valley  it was that mother who placed her weak and dying hand in that of her almighty saviour  to the children left by her daughter she ministered with the faithfulness of a guardian angel and it is owing to her influence that those who yet remain are among the best and noblest of mankind  the person whose relations with byron had been so disastrous also in the latter years of her life felt lady byrons loving and ennobling influences and in her last sickness and dying hours looked to her for consolation and help  there was an unfortunate child of sin born with the curse upon her over whose wayward nature lady byron watched with a mothers tenderness  she was the one who could have patience when the patience of every one else failed and though her task was a difficult one from the strange abnormal propensities to evil in the object of her cares yet lady byron never faltered and never gave over till death took the responsibility from her hands  during all this trial strange to say her belief that the good in lord byron would finally conquer was unshaken  to a friend who said to her oh how could you love him she answered briefly my dear there was the angel in him  it is in us all  it was in this angel that she had faith  it was for the deliverance of this angel from degradation and shame and sin that she unceasingly prayed  she read every work that byron wroteread it with a deeper knowledge than any human being but herself could possess  the ribaldry and the obscenity and the insults with which he strove to make her ridiculous in the world fell at her pitying feet unheeded  when he broke away from all this unworthy life to devote himself to a manly enterprise for the redemption of greece she thought that she saw the beginning of an answer to her prayers  even although one of his latest acts concerning her was to repeat to lady blessington the false accusation which made lady byron the author of all his errors she still had hopes from the one step taken in the right direction  in the midst of these hopes came the news of his sudden death  on his deathbed it is wellknown that he called his confidential english servant to him and said to him go to my sister tell hergo to lady byronyou will see herand say  here followed twenty minutes of indistinct mutterings in which the names of his wife daughter and sister frequently occurred  he then said now i have told you all  my lord replied fletcher i have not understood a word your lordship has been saying  not understand me exclaimed lord byron with a look of the utmost distress what a pity  then it is too lateall is over  he afterwards says moore tried to utter a few words of which none were intelligible except my sistermy child  when fletcher returned to london lady byron sent for him and walked the room in convulsive struggles to repress her tears and sobs while she over and over again strove to elicit something from him which should enlighten her upon what that last message had been but in vain the gates of eternity were shut in her face and not a word had passed to tell her if he had repented  for all that lady byron never doubted his salvation  ever before her during the few remaining years of her widowhood was the image of her husband purified and ennobled with the shadows of earth for ever dissipated the stains of sin for ever removed the angel in him as she expressed it made perfect according to its divine ideal  never has more divine strength of faith and love existed in woman  out of the depths of her own loving and merciful nature she gained such views of the divine love and mercy as made all hopes possible  there was no soul of whose future lady byron despairedsuch was her boundless faith in the redeeming power of love  after byrons death the life of this delicate creatureso frail in body that she seemed always hovering on the brink of the eternal world yet so strong in spirit and so unceasing in her various ministries of mercywas a miracle of mingled weakness and strength  to talk with her seemed to the writer of this sketch the nearest possible approach to talking with one of the spirits of the just made perfect  she was gentle artless approachable as a little child with ready outflowing sympathy for the cares and sorrows and interests of all who approached her with a naive and gentle playfulness that adorned without hiding the breadth and strength of her mind and above all with a clear divining moral discrimination never mistaking wrong for right in the slightest shade yet with a mercifulness that made allowance for every weakness and pitied every sin  there was so much of christ in her that to have seen her seemed to be to have drawn near to heaven  she was one of those few whom absence cannot estrange from friends whose mere presence in this world seems always a help to every generous thought a strength to every good purpose a comfort in every sorrow  living so near the confines of the spiritual world she seemed already to see into it hence the words of comfort which she addressed to a friend who had lost a son  dear friend remember as long as our loved ones are in gods world they are in ours        it has been thought by some friends who have read the proofsheets of the foregoing that the author should give more specifically her authority for these statements  the circumstances which led the writer to england at a certain time originated a friendship and correspondence with lady byron which was always regarded as one of the greatest acquisitions of that visit  on the occasion of a second visit to england in 1856 the writer received a note from lady byron indicating that she wished to have some private confidential conversation upon important subjects and inviting her for that purpose to spend a day with her at her countryseat near london  the writer went and spent a day with lady byron alone and the object of the invitation was explained to her  lady byron was in such a state of health that her physicians had warned her that she had very little time to live  she was engaged in those duties and retrospections which every thoughtful person finds necessary when coming deliberately and with open eyes to the boundaries of this mortal life  at that time there was a cheap edition of byrons works in contemplation intended to bring his writings into circulation among the masses and the pathos arising from the story of his domestic misfortunes was one great means relied on for giving it currency  under these circumstances some of lady byrons friends had proposed the question to her whether she had not a responsibility to society for the truth whether she did right to allow these writings to gain influence over the popular mind by giving a silent consent to what she knew to be utter falsehoods  lady byrons whole life had been passed in the most heroic selfabnegation and selfsacrifice and she had now to consider whether one more act of selfdenial was not required of her before leaving this world namely to declare the absolute truth no matter at what expense to her own feelings  for this reason it was her desire to recount the whole history to a person of another country and entirely out of the sphere of personal and local feelings which might be supposed to influence those in the country and station in life where the events really happened in order that she might be helped by such a persons views in making up an opinion as to her own duty  the interview had almost the solemnity of a deathbed avowal  lady byron stated the facts which have been embodied in this article and gave to the writer a paper containing a brief memorandum of the whole with the dates affixed  we have already spoken of that singular sense of the reality of the spiritual world which seemed to encompass lady byron during the last part of her life and which made her words and actions seem more like those of a blessed being detached from earth than of an ordinary mortal  all her modes of looking at things all her motives of action all her involuntary exhibitions of emotion were so high above any common level and so entirely regulated by the most unworldly causes that it would seem difficult to make the ordinary world understand exactly how the thing seemed to lie before her mind  what impressed the writer more strongly than anything else was lady byrons perfect conviction that her husband was now a redeemed spirit that he looked back with pain and shame and regret on all that was unworthy in his past life and that if he could speak or could act in the case he would desire to prevent the further circulation of base falsehoods and of seductive poetry which had been made the vehicle of morbid and unworthy passions  lady byrons experience had led her to apply the powers of her strong philosophical mind to the study of mental pathology and she had become satisfied that the solution of the painful problem which first occurred to her as a young wife was after all the true one namely that lord byron had been one of those unfortunately constituted persons in whom the balance of nature is so critically hung that it is always in danger of dipping towards insanity and that in certain periods of his life he was so far under the influence of mental disorder as not to be fully responsible for his actions  she went over with a brief and clear analysis the history of his whole life as she had thought it out during the lonely musings of her widowhood  she dwelt on the ancestral causes that gave him a nature of exceptional and dangerous susceptibility  she went through the mismanagements of his childhood the history of his schooldays the influence of the ordinary schoolcourse of classical reading on such a mind as his  she sketched boldly and clearly the internal life of the young men of the time as she with her purer eyes had looked through it and showed how habits which with less susceptible fibre and coarser strength of nature were tolerable for his companions were deadly to him unhinging his nervous system and intensifying the dangers of ancestral proclivities  lady byron expressed the feeling too that the calvinistic theology as heard in scotland had proved in his case as it often does in certain minds a subtle poison  he never could either disbelieve or become reconciled to it and the sore problems it proposes embittered his spirit against christianity  the worst of it is i do believe he would often say with violence when he had been employing all his powers of reason wit and ridicule upon these subjects  through all this sorrowful history was to be seen not the care of a slandered woman to make her story good but the pathetic anxiety of a mother who treasures every particle of hope every intimation of good in the son whom she cannot cease to love  with indescribable resignation she dwelt on those last hours those words addressed to her never to be understood till repeated in eternity  but all this she looked upon as for ever past believing that with the dropping of the earthly life these morbid impulses and influences ceased and that higher nature which he often so beautifully expressed in his poems became the triumphant one  while speaking on this subject her pale ethereal face became luminous with a heavenly radiance there was something so sublime in her belief in the victory of love over evil that faith with her seemed to have become sight  she seemed so clearly to perceive the divine ideal of the man she had loved and for whose salvation she had been called to suffer and labour and pray that all memories of his past unworthiness fell away and were lost  her love was never the doting fondness of weak women it was the appreciative and discriminating love by which a higher nature recognised godlike capabilities under all the dust and defilement of misuse and passion and she never doubted that the love which in her was so strong that no injury or insult could shake it was yet stronger in the god who made her capable of such a devotion and that in him it was accompanied by power to subdue all things to itself  the writer was so impressed and excited by the whole scene and recital that she begged for two or three days to deliberate before forming any opinion  she took the memorandum with her returned to london and gave a day or two to the consideration of the subject  the decision which she made was chiefly influenced by her reverence and affection for lady byron  she seemed so frail she had suffered so much she stood at such a height above the comprehension of the coarse and common world that the author had a feeling that it would almost be like violating a shrine to ask her to come forth from the sanctuary of a silence where she had so long abode and plead her cause  she wrote to lady byron that while this act of justice did seem to be called for and to be in some respects most desirable yet as it would involve so much that was painful to her the writer considered that lady byron would be entirely justifiable in leaving the truth to be disclosed after her death and recommended that all the facts necessary should be put in the hands of some person to be so published  years passed on  lady byron lingered four years after this interview to the wonder of her physicians and all her friends  after lady byrons death the writer looked anxiously hoping to see a memoir of the person whom she considered the most remarkable woman that england has produced in the century  no such memoir has appeared on the part of her friends and the mistress of lord byron has the ear of the public and is sowing far and wide unworthy slanders which are eagerly gathered up and read by an undiscriminating community  there may be family reasons in england which prevent lady byrons friends from speaking  but lady byron has an american name and an american existence and reverence for pure womanhood is we think a national characteristic of the american and so far as this country is concerned we feel that the public should have this refutation of the slanders of the countess guicciolis book    lord lindsays letter to the london times to the editor of the times   siri have waited in expectation of a categorical denial of the horrible charge brought by mrs beecher stowe against lord byron and his sister on the alleged authority of the late lady byron  such denial has been only indirectly given by the letter of messrs wharton and fords in your impression of yesterday  that letter is sufficient to prove that lady byron never contemplated the use made of her name and that her descendants and representatives disclaim any countenance of mrs b stowes article but it does not specifically meet mrs stowes allegation that lady byron in conversing with her thirteen years ago affirmed the charge now before us  it remains open therefore to a scandalloving world to credit the calumny through the advantage of this flaw involuntary i believe in the answer produced against it  my object in addressing you is to supply that deficiency by proving that what is now stated on lady byrons supposed authority is at variance in all respects with what she stated immediately after the separation when everything was fresh in her memory in relation to the time during which according to mrs b stowe she believed that byron and his sister were living together in guilt  i publish this evidence with reluctance but in obedience to that higher obligation of justice to the voiceless and defenceless dead which bids me break through a reserve that otherwise i should have held sacred  the lady byron of 1818 would i am certain have sanctioned my doing so had she foreseen the present unparalleled occasion and the bar that the conditions of her will present as i infer from messrs wharton and fords letter against any fuller communication calumnies such as the present sink deep and with rapidity into the public mind and are not easily eradicated  the fame of one of our greatest poets and that of the kindest and truest and most constant friend that byron ever had is at stake and it will not do to wait for revelations from the fountainhead which are not promised and possibly may never reach us  the late lady anne barnard who died in 1825 a contemporary and friend of burke windham dundas and a host of the wise and good of that generation and remembered in letters as the authoress of auld robin gray had known the late lady byron from infancy and took a warm interest in her holding lord byron in corresponding repugnance not to say prejudice in consequence of what she believed to be his harsh and cruel treatment of her young friend  i transcribe the following passages and a letter from lady byron herself written in 1818 from ricordi or private family memoirs in lady annes autograph now before me  i include the letter because although treating only in general terms of the matter and causes of the separation it affords collateral evidence bearing strictly upon the point of the credibility of the charge now in question  the separation of lord and lady byron astonished the world which believed him a reformed man as to his habits and a becalmed man as to his remorses  he had written nothing that appeared after his marriage till the famous fare thee well which had the power of compelling those to pity the writer who were not well aware that he was not the unhappy person he affected to be  lady byrons misery was whispered soon after her marriage and his ill usage but no word transpired no sign escaped from her  she gave birth shortly to a daughter and when she went as soon as she was recovered on a visit to her fathers taking her little ada with her no one knew that it was to return to her lord no more  at that period a severe fit of illness had confined me to bed for two months  i heard of lady byrons distress of the pains he took to give a harsh impression of her character to the world  i wrote to her and entreated her to come and let me see and hear her if she conceived my sympathy or counsel could be any comfort to her  she came but what a tale was unfolded by this interesting young creature who had so fondly hoped to have made a young man of genius and romance as she supposed happy  they had not been an hour in the carriage which conveyed them from the church when breaking into a malignant sneer oh what a dupe you have been to your imagination  how is it possible a woman of your sense could form the wild hope of reforming me  many are the tears you will have to shed ere that plan is accomplished  it is enough for me that you are my wife for me to hate you  if you were the wife of any other man i own you might have charms etc  i who listened was astonished  how could you go on after this said i my dear  why did you not return to your fathers  because i had not a conception he was in earnest because i reckoned it a bad jest and told him sothat my opinions of him were very different from his of himself otherwise he would not find me by his side  he laughed it over when he saw me appear hurt and i forgot what had passed till forced to remember it  i believe he was pleased with me too for a little while  i suppose it had escaped his memory that i was his wife  but she described the happiness they enjoyed to have been unequal and perturbed  her situation in a short time might have entitled her to some tenderness but she made no claim on him for any  he sometimes reproached her for the motives that had induced her to marry him all was vanity the vanity of miss milbanke carrying the point of reforming lord byron  he always knew her inducements her pride shut her eyes to his he wished to build up his character and his fortunes both were somewhat deranged she had a high name and would have a fortune worth his attentionlet her look to that for his motiveso byron byron she said how you desolate me  he would then accuse himself of being mad and throw himself on the ground in a frenzy which she believed was affected to conceal the coldness and malignity of his heartan affectation which at that time never failed to meet with the tenderest commiseration  i could find by some implications not followed up by me lest she might have condemned herself afterwards for her involuntary disclosures that he soon attempted to corrupt her principles both with respect to her own conduct and her latitude for his  she saw the precipice on which she stood and kept his sister with her as much as possible  he returned in the evenings from the haunts of vice where he made her understand he had been with manners so profligate  o the wretch said i  and had he no moments of remorse  sometimes he appeared to have them  one night coming home from one of his lawless parties he saw me so indignantly collected and bearing all with such a determined calmness that a rush of remorse seemed to come over him  he called himself a monster though his sister was present and threw himself in agony at my feet  i could notnoi could not forgive him such injuries  he had lost me for ever astonished at the return of virtue my tears i believe flowed over his face and i said byron all is forgotten never never shall you hear of it more  he started up and folding his arms while he looked at me burst into laughter  what do you mean said i  only a philosophical experiment thats all said he  i wished to ascertain the value of your resolutions  i need not say more of this prince of duplicity except that varied were his methods of rendering her wretched even to the last  when her lovely little child was born and it was laid beside its mother on the bed and he was informed he might see his daughter after gazing at it with an exulting smile this was the ejaculation that broke from him oh what an implement of torture have i acquired in you  such he rendered it by his eyes and manner keeping her in a perpetual alarm for its safety when in his presence  all this reads madder than i believe he was but she had not then made up her mind to disbelieve his pretended insanity and conceived it best to intrust her secret with the excellent dr baillie telling him all that seemed to regard the state of her husbands mind and letting his advice regulate her conduct  baillie doubted of his derangement but as he did not reckon his own opinion infallible he wished her to take precautions as if her husband were so  he recommended her going to the country but to give him no suspicion of her intentions of remaining there and for a short time to show no coldness in her letters till she could better ascertain his state  she went regretting as she told me to wear any semblance but the truth  a short time disclosed the story to the world he acted the part of a man driven to despair by her inflexible resentment and by the arts of a governess once a servant in the family who hated him  i will give you proceeds lady anne a few paragraphs transcribed from one of lady byrons own letters to me  it is sorrowful to think that in a very little time this young and amiable creature wise patient and feeling will have her character mistaken by every one who reads byrons works  to rescue her from this i preserved her letters and when she afterwards expressed a fear that any thing of her writings should ever fall into hands to injure him i suppose she meant by publication i safely assured her that it never should  but here this letter shall be placed a sacred record in her favour unknown to herself  i am a very incompetent judge of the impression which the last canto of childe harold may produce on the minds of indifferent readers  it contains the usual trace of a conscience restlessly awake though his object has been too long to aggravate its burden as if it could thus be oppressed into eternal stupor  i will hope as you do that it survives for his ultimate good  it was the acuteness of his remorse impenitent in its character which so long seemed to demand from my compassion to spare every resemblance of reproach every look of grief which might have said to his conscience you have made me wretched  i am decidedly of opinion that he is responsible  he has wished to be thought partially deranged or on the brink of it to perplex observers and prevent them from tracing effects to their real causes through all the intricacies of his conduct  i was as i told you at one time the dupe of his acted insanity and clung to the former delusions in regard to the motives that concerned me personally till the whole system was laid bare  he is the absolute monarch of words and uses them as bonaparte did lives for conquest without more regard to their intrinsic value considering them only as ciphers which must derive all their import from the situation in which he places them and the ends to which he adapts them with such consummate skill  why then you will say does he not employ them to give a better colour to his own character  because he is too good an actor to overact or to assume a moral garb which it would be easy to strip off  in regard to his poetry egotism is the vital principle of his imagination which it is difficult for him to kindle on any subject with which his own character and interests are not identified but by the introduction of fictitious incidents by change of scene or time he has enveloped his poetical disclosures in a system impenetrable except to a very few and his constant desire of creating a sensation makes him not averse to be the object of wonder and curiosity even though accompanied by some dark and vague suspicions  nothing has contributed more to the misunderstanding of his real character than the lonely grandeur in which he shrouds it and his affectation of being above mankind when he exists almost in their voice  the romance of his sentiments is another feature of this mask of state  i know no one more habitually destitute of that enthusiasm he so beautifully expresses and to which he can work up his fancy chiefly by contagion  i had heard he was the best of brothers the most generous of friends and i thought such feelings only required to be warmed and cherished into more diffusive benevolence  though these opinions are eradicated and could never return but with the decay of my memory you will not wonder if there are still moments when the association of feelings which arose from them soften and sadden my thoughts  but i have not thanked you dearest lady anne for your kindness in regard to a principal objectthat of rectifying false impressions  i trust you understand my wishes which never were to injure lord byron in any way for though he would not suffer me to remain his wife he cannot prevent me from continuing his friend and it was from considering myself as such that i silenced the accusations by which my own conduct might have been more fully justified  it is not necessary to speak ill of his heart in general it is sufficient that to me it was hard and impenetrable that my own must have been broken before his could have been touched  i would rather represent this as my misfortune than as his guilt but surely that misfortune is not to be made my crime  such are my feelings you will judge how to act  his allusions to me in childe harold are cruel and cold but with such a semblance as to make me appear so and to attract all sympathy to himself  it is said in this poem that hatred of him will be taught as a lesson to his child  i might appeal to all who have ever heard me speak of him and still more to my own heart to witness that there has been no moment when i have remembered injury otherwise than affectionately and sorrowfully  it is not my duty to give way to hopeless and wholly unrequited affection but so long as i live my chief struggle will probably be not to remember him too kindly  i do not seek the sympathy of the world but i wish to be known by those whose opinion is valuable and whose kindness is clear to me  among such my dear lady anne you will ever be remembered by your truly affectionate                                      a byron  it is the province of your readers and of the world at large to judge between the two testimonies now before themlady byrons in 1816 and 1818 and that put forward in 1869 by mrs b stowe as communicated by lady byron thirteen years ago  in the face of the evidence now given positive negative and circumstantial there can be but two alternatives in the case either mrs b stowe must have entirely misunderstood lady byron and been thus led into error and misstatement or we must conclude that under the pressure of a lifelong and secret sorrow lady byrons mind had become clouded with an hallucination in respect of the particular point in question  the reader will admire the noble but severe character displayed in lady byrons letter but those who keep in view what her first impressions were as above recorded may probably place a more lenient interpretation than hers upon some of the incidents alleged to byrons discredit  i shall conclude with some remarks upon his character written shortly after his death by a wise virtuous and charitable judge the late sir walter scott likewise in a letter to lady anne barnard  fletchers account of poor byron is extremely interesting  i had always a strong attachment to that unfortunate though most richlygifted man because i thought i saw that his virtues and he had many were his own and his eccentricities the result of an irritable temperament which sometimes approached nearly to mental disease  those who are gifted with strong nerves a regular temper and habitual selfcommand are not perhaps aware how much of what they may think virtue they owe to constitution and such are but too severe judges of men like byron whose mind like a day of alternate storm and sunshine is all dark shades and stray gleams of light instead of the twilight gray which illuminates happier though less distinguished mortals  i always thought that when a moral proposition was placed plainly before lord byron his mind yielded a pleased and willing assent to it but if there was any side view given in the way of raillery or otherwise he was willing enough to evade conviction      it augurs ill for the cause of greece that this masterspirit should have been withdrawn from their assistance just as he was obtaining a complete ascendancy over their counsels  i have seen several letters from the ionian islands all of which unite in speaking in the highest praise of the wisdom and temperance of his counsels and the ascendancy he was obtaining over the turbulent and ferocious chiefs of the insurgents  i have some verses written by him on his last birthday they breathe a spirit of affection towards his wife and a desire of dying in battle which seems like an anticipation of his approaching fate                     i remain sir your obedient servant                                             lindsay  dunecht sept 3    dr forbes winslows letter to the london times   to the editor  siryour paper of the 4th of september containing an able and deeply interesting vindication of lord byron has followed me to this place with the general details of the true story as it is termed of lady byrons separation from her husband as recorded in macmillans magazine i have no desire or intention to grapple  it is only with the hypothesis of insanity as suggested by the clever writer of the vindication to account for lady byrons sad revelations to mrs beecher stowe with which i propose to deal  i do not believe that the mooted theory of mental aberration can in this case be for a moment maintained  if lady byrons statement of facts to mrs b stowe is to be viewed as the creation of a distempered fancy a delusion or hallucination of an insane mind what part of the narrative are we to draw the boundaryline between fact and delusion sanity and insanity where are we to fix the point dappui of the lunacy  again is the alleged hallucination to be considered as strictly confined to the idea that lord byron had committed the frightful sin of incest or is the whole of the true story of her married life as reproduced with such terrible minuteness by mrs beecher stowe to be viewed as the delusion of a disordered fancy  if lady byron was the subject of an hallucination with regard to her husband i think it not unreasonable to conclude that the mental alienation existed on the day of her marriage  if this proposition be accepted the natural inference will be that the details of the conversation which lady byron represents to have occurred between herself and lord byron as soon as they entered the carriage never took place  lord byron is said to have remarked to lady byron you might have prevented this or words to this effect you will now find that you have married a devil  is this alleged conversation to be viewed as fact or fiction evidence of sanity or insanity  is the revelation which lord byron is said to have made to his wife of his incestuous passion another delusion having no foundation except in his wifes disordered imagination  are his alleged attempts to justify to lady byrons mind the morale of the plea of continental latitudethe goodhumoured marriage in which complaisant couples mutually agree to form the cloak for each others infidelitiesanother morbid perversion of her imagination  did this conversation ever take place  it will be difficult to separate one part of the true story from another and maintain that this portion indicates insanity and that portion represents sanity  if we accept the hypothesis of hallucination we are bound to view the whole of lady byrons conversations with mrs b stowe and the written statement laid before her as the wild and incoherent representations of a lunatic  on the day when lady byron parted from her husband did she enter his private room and find him with the object of his guilty passion and did he say as they parted when shall we three meet again  is this to be considered as an actual occurrence or as another form of hallucination  it is quite inconsistent with the theory of lady byrons insanity to imagine that her delusion was restricted to the idea of his having committed incest  in common fairness we are bound to view the aggregate mental phenomena which she exhibited from the day of the marriage to their final separation and her death  no person practically acquainted with the true characteristics of insanity would affirm that had this idea of incest been an insane hallucination lady byron could from the lengthened period which intervened between her unhappy marriage and death have refrained from exhibiting her mental alienation not only to her legal advisers and trustees but to others exacting no pledge of secrecy from them as to her disordered impressions lunatics do for a time and for some special purpose most cunningly conceal their delusions but they have not the capacity to struggle for thirtysix years with a frightful hallucination similar to the one lady byron is alleged to have had without the insane state of mind becoming obvious to those with whom they are daily associating  neither is it consistent with experience to suppose that if lady byron had been a monomaniac her state of disordered understanding would have been restricted to one hallucination  her diseased brain affecting the normal action of thought would in all probability have manifested other symptoms besides those referred to of aberration of intellect  during the last thirty years i have not met with a case of insanity assuming the hypothesis of hallucination at all parallel with that of lady byrons  in my experience it is unique  i never saw a patient with such a delusion  if it should be established by the statements of those who are the depositors of the secret and they are now bound in vindication of lord byrons memory to deny if they have the power of doing so this most frightful accusation that the idea of incest did unhappily cross lady byrons mind prior to her finally leaving him it no doubt arose from a most inaccurate knowledge of facts and perfectly unjustifiable data and was not in the right psychological acceptation of the phrase an insane hallucination                      sir i remain your obedient servant

my health was declining my fortune embarrassed and my mind had been shaken by many kinds of disappointment while i was yet young and might have reformed what might be wrong in my conduct and retrieved what was perplexing in my affairs  but he is in his grave andwhat a long letter i have scribbled           in order that the reader may measure the change of moral tone with regard to lord byron wrought by the constant efforts of himself and his party we give the two following extracts from blackwood  the first is blackwood in 1819 just after the publication of don juan the second is blackwood in 1825  in the composition of this work there is unquestionably a more thorough and intense infusion of genius and vice power and profligacy than in any poem which had ever before been written in the english or indeed in any other modern language  had the wickedness been less inextricably mingled with the beauty and the grace and the strength of a most inimitable and incomprehensible muse our task would have been easy don juan is by far the most admirable specimen of the mixture of ease strength gaiety and seriousness extant in the whole body of english poetry the author has devoted his powers to the worst of purposes and passions and it increases his guilt and our sorrow that he has devoted them entire  the moral strain of the whole poem is pitched in the lowest key  love honour patriotism religion are mentioned only to be scoffed at as if their sole restingplace were or ought to be in the bosoms of fools  it appears in short as if this miserable man having exhausted every species of sensual gratification having drained the cup of sin even to its bitterest dregs were resolved to show us that he is no longer a human being even in his frailties but a cool unconcerned fiend laughing with a detestable glee over the whole of the better and worse elements of which human life is composed treating wellnigh with equal derision the most pure of virtues and the most odious of vices dead alike to the beauty of the one and the deformity of the other a mere heartless despiser of that frail but noble humanity whose type was never exhibited in a shape of more deplorable degradation than in his own contemptuously distinct delineation of himself  to confess to his maker and weep over in secret agonies the wildest and most fantastic transgressions of heart and mind is the part of a conscious sinner in whom sin has not become the sole principle of life and action but to lay bare to the eye of man and of woman all the hidden convulsions of a wicked spirit and to do all this without one symptom of contrition remorse or hesitation with a calm careless ferociousness of contented and satisfied depravitythis was an insult which no man of genius had ever before dared to put upon his creator or his species  impiously railing against his god madly and meanly disloyal to his sovereign and his country and brutally outraging all the best feelings of female honour affection and confidence how small a part of chivalry is that which remains to the descendant of the byronsa gloomy visor and a deadly weapon  those who are acquainted and who is not with the main incidents in the private life of lord byron and who have not seen this production will scarcely believe that malignity should have carried him so far as to make him commence a filthy and impious poem with an elaborate satire on the character and manners of his wife from whom even by his own confession he has been separated only in consequence of his own cruel and heartless misconduct  it is in vain for lord byron to attempt in any way to justify his own behaviour in that affair and now that he has so openly and audaciously invited inquiry and reproach we do not see any good reason why he should not be plainly told so by the general voice of his countrymen  it would not be an easy matter to persuade any man who has any knowledge of the nature of woman that a female such as lord byron has himself described his wife to be would rashly or hastily or lightly separate herself from the love with which she had once been inspired for such a man as he is or was  had he not heaped insult upon insult and scorn upon scorn had he not forced the iron of his contempt into her very soul there is no woman of delicacy and virtue as he admitted lady byron to be who would not have hoped all things and suffered all things from one her love of whom must have been inwoven with so many exalting elements of delicious pride and more delicious humility  to offend the love of such a woman was wrong but it might be forgiven to desert her was unmanly but he might have returned and wiped for ever from her eyes the tears of her desertion but to injure and to desert and then to turn back and wound her widowed privacy with unhallowed strains of coldblooded mockery was brutally fiendishly inexpiably mean  for impurities there might be some possibility of pardon were they supposed to spring only from the reckless buoyancy of young blood and fiery passions for impiety there might at least be pity were it visible that the misery of the impious soul equalled its darkness but for offences such as this which cannot proceed either from the madness of sudden impulse or the bewildered agonies of doubt but which speak the wilful and determined spite of an unrepenting unsoftened smiling sarcastic joyous sinner there can be neither pity nor pardon  our knowledge that it is committed by one of the most powerful intellects our island ever has produced lends intensity a thousandfold to the bitterness of our indignation  every high thought that was ever kindled in our breasts by the muse of byron every pure and lofty feeling that ever responded from within us to the sweep of his majestic inspirations every remembered moment of admiration and enthusiasm is up in arms against him  we look back with a mixture of wrath and scorn to the delight with which we suffered ourselves to be filled by one who all the while he was furnishing us with delight must we cannot doubt it have been mocking us with a cruel mockery less cruel only because less peculiar than that with which he has now turned him from the lurkingplace of his selfish and polluted exile to pour the pitiful chalice of his contumely on the surrendered devotion of a virgin bosom and the holy hopes of the mother of his child  it is indeed a sad and a humiliating thing to know that in the same year there proceeded from the same pen two productions in all things so different as the fourth canto of childe harold and his loathsome don juan  we have mentioned one and all will admit the worst instance of the private malignity which has been embodied in so many passages of don juan and we are quite sure the loftyminded and virtuous men whom lord byron has debased himself by insulting will close the volume which contains their own injuries with no feelings save those of pity for him that has inflicted them and for her who partakes so largely in the same injuriesaugust 1819        blackwooditerum  we shall like all others who say anything about lord byron begin sans apologie with his personal character  this is the great object of attack the constant theme of open vituperation to one set and the established mark for all the petty but deadly artillery of sneers shrugs groans to another  two widely different matters however are generally we might say universally mixed up herethe personal character of the man as proved by his course of life and his personal character as revealed in or guessed from his books  nothing can be more unfair than the style in which this mixture is made use of  is there a noble sentiment a lofty thought a sublime conception in the book  ah yes is the answer  but what of that  it is only the roue byron that speaks  is a kind a generous action of the man mentioned  yes yes comments the sage but only remember the atrocities of don juan depend on it this if it be true must have been a mere freak of caprice or perhaps a bit of vile hypocrisy  salvation is thus shut out at either entrance the poet damns the man and the man the poet  nobody will suspect us of being so absurd as to suppose that it is possible for people to draw no inferences as to the character of an author from his book or to shut entirely out of view in judging of a book that which they may happen to know about the man who writes it  the cant of the day supposes such things to be practicable but they are not but what we complain of and scorn is the extent to which they are carried in the case of this particular individual as compared with others the impudence with which things are at once assumed to be facts in regard to his private history and the absolute unfairness of never arguing from his writings to him but for evil  take the man in the first place as unconnected in so far as we can thus consider him with his works and ask what after all are the bad things we know of him  was he dishonest or dishonourable had he ever done anything to forfeit or even endanger his rank as a gentleman  most assuredly no such accusations have ever been maintained against lord byron the private nobleman although something of the sort may have been insinuated against the author  but he was such a profligate in his morals that his name cannot be mentioned with anything like tolerance was he so indeed  we should like extremely to have the catechising of the individual man who says so  that he indulged in sensual vices to some extent is certain and to be regretted and condemned  but was he worse as to such matters than the enormous majority of those who join in the cry of horror upon this occasion  we most assuredly believe exactly the reverse and we rest our belief upon very plain and intelligible grounds  first we hold it impossible that the majority of mankind or that anything beyond a very small minority are or can be entitled to talk of sensual profligacy as having formed a part of the life and character of the man who dying at six and thirty bequeathed a collection of works such as byrons to the world  secondly we hold it impossible that laying the extent of his intellectual labours out of the question and looking only to the nature of the intellect which generated and delighted in generating such beautiful and noble conceptions as are to be found in almost all lord byrons workswe hold it impossible that very many men can be at once capable of comprehending these conceptions and entitled to consider sensual profligacy as having formed the principal or even a principal trait in lord byrons character  thirdly and lastly we have never been able to hear any one fact established which could prove lord byron to deserve anything like the degree or even kind of odium which has in regard to matters of this class been heaped upon his name  we have no story of base unmanly seduction or false and villainous intrigue against himnone whatever it seems to us quite clear that if he had been at all what is called in society an unprincipled sensualist there must have been many such stories authentic and authenticated  but there are none suchabsolutely none  his name has been coupled with the names of three four or more women of some rank but what kind of women  every one of them in the first place about as old as himself in years and therefore a great deal older in character every one of them utterly battered in reputation long before he came into contact with themlicentious unprincipled characterless women  what father has ever reproached him with the ruin of his daughter  what husband has denounced him as the destroyer of his peace  let us not be mistaken  we are not defending the offences of which lord byron unquestionably was guilty neither are we finding fault with those who after looking honestly within and around themselves condemn those offences no matter how severely but we are speaking of society in general as it now exists and we say that there is vile hypocrisy in the tone in which lord byron is talked of there  we say that although all offences against purity of life are miserable things and condemnable things the degrees of guilt attached to different offences of this class are as widely different as are the degrees of guilt between an assault and a murder and we confess our belief that no man of byrons station or age could have run much risk in gaining a very bad name in society had a course of life similar in so far as we know any thing of that to lord byrons been the only thing chargeable against him  the last poem he wrote was produced upon his birthday not many weeks before he died  we consider it as one of the finest and most touching effusions of his noble genius  we think he who reads it and can ever after bring himself to regard even the worst transgressions that have been charged against lord byron with any feelings but those of humble sorrow and manly pity is not deserving of the name of man  the deep and passionate struggles with the inferior elements of his nature and ours which it records the lofty thirsting after purity the heroic devotion of a soul half weary of life because unable to believe in its own powers to live up to what it so intensely felt to be and so reverentially honoured as the right the whole picture of this mighty spirit often darkened but never sunkoften erring but never ceasing to see and to worship the beauty of virtue the repentance of it the anguish the aspiration almost stifled in despairthe whole of this is such a whole that we are sure no man can read these solemn verses too often and we recommend them for repetition as the best and most conclusive of all possible answers whenever the name of byron is insulted by those who permit themselves to forget nothing either in his life or in his writings but the good1825    letters of lady byron to h c robinson   the following letters of lady byrons are reprinted from the memoirs of h c robinson  they are given that the reader may form some judgment of the strength and activity of her mind and the elevated class of subjects upon which it habitually dwelt  lady byron to h c r                                         dec 31 1853  dear mr crabb robinsoni have an inclination if i were not afraid of trespassing on your time but you can put my letter by for any leisure moment to enter upon the history of a character which i think less appreciated than it ought to be  men i observe do not understand men in certain points without a womans interpretation  those points of course relate to feelings  here is a man taken by most of those who come in his way either for dry asdust matteroffact or for a vain visionary  there are doubtless some defective or excessive characteristics which give rise to those impressions  my acquaintance was made oddly enough with him twentyseven years ago a pauper said to me of him hes the poor mans doctor  such a recommendation seemed to me a good one and i also knew that his organizing head had formed the first district society in england for mrs fry told me she could not have effected it without his aid yet he has always ignored his own share of it  i felt in him at once the curious combination of the christian and the cynicof reverence for man and contempt of men  it was then an internal war but one in which it was evident to me that the holier cause would be victorious because there was deep belief and as far as i could learn a blameless and benevolent life  he appeared only to want sunshine  it was a plant which could not be brought to perfection in darkness  he had begun life by the most painful conflict between filial duty and consciencea large provision in the church secured for him by his father but he could not sign  there was discredit as you know attached to such scruples  he was also when i first knew him under other circumstances of a nature to depress him and to make him feel that he was unjustly treated the gradual removal of these called forth his better nature in thankfulness to god  still the old misanthropic modes of expressing himself obtruded themselves at times  this passed in 48 between him and robertson  robertson said to me i want to know something about ragged schools  i replied you had better ask dr king he knows more about themi said dr king  i take care to know nothing of ragged schools lest they should make me ragged  robertson did not see through it  perhaps i had been taught to understand such suicidal speeches by my cousin lord melbourne  the example of christ imperfectly as it may be understood by him has been ever before his eyes he woke to the thought of following it and he went to rest consoled or rebuked by it  after nearly thirty years of intimacy i may without presumption form that opinion  there is something pathetic to me in seeing any one so unknown  even the other medical friends of robertson when i knew that dr king felt a womans tenderness said on one occasion to him but we know that you dr king are above all feeling  if i have made the character more consistent to you by putting in these bits of mosaic my pen will not have been ill employed nor unpleasingly to you                                     yours truly                                         a noel byron        lady byron to h c r

been most interesting to me these seemed the shadows that the stern reality  it is good however to be drawn out of scenes in which one is absorbed most unprofitably and to have ones natural interests revived by such a letter as i have to thank you for as well as its predecessor  you touch upon the very points which do interest me the most habitually  the change of form and enlargement of design in the prospective had led me to express to one of the promoters of that object my desire to contribute  the religious crisis is instant but the man for it  the next best thing if as i believe he is not to be found in england is an association of such men as are to edit the new periodical an address delivered by freeman clarke at boston last may makes me think him better fitted for a leader than any other of the religious freethinkers  i wish i could send you my one copy but you do not need it and others do  his object is the same as that of the alliance universelle only he is still more free from partialism his own word in his aspirations and practical suggestions with respect to an ultimate christian synthesis  he so far adopts comtes theory as to speak of religion itself under three successive aspects historically1  thesis 2 antithesis  3 synthesis  i made his acquaintance in england and he inspired confidence at once by his brave independence incomptis capillis and selfunconsciousness  j j taylers address of last month follows in the same pathall in favour of the irenics instead of polemics  the answer which you gave me so fully and distinctly to the questions i

question  from what you said i think you agreed with me that a latitudinarian christianity ought to be the character of the periodical but the depth of the roots should correspond with the width of the branches of that tree of knowledge  of some of those minds one might say they have no root and then the richer the foliage the more danger that the trunk will fall  grounded in christ has to me a most practical significance and value  i too have anxiety about a friend miss carpenter whose life is of public importance she more than any of the english reformers unless nash and wright has found

extinguisher  heart and familiarity with the class to be educated are all important  at home and abroad the evidence is conclusive on that point for i have for many years attended to such experiments

and is lord palmerston who has used it so long and so cleverly likely to promote that object  but whatever obstacles there may be in state affairs that general persuasion must modify other departments of action and knowledge unroasted coffee will no longer be accepted under the official sealanother reason for a new literary combination for distinct special objects a review in which every separate article should be convergent if instead of the problem to make a circle pass through three given points it were required to find the centre from which to describe a circle through any three articles in the edinburgh or westminster review who would accomplish it  much force is lost for want of this onemindedness amongst the contributors  it would not exclude variety or freedom in the unlimited discussion of means towards the ends unequivocally recognized  if st paul had edited a review he might  have admitted peter as well as luke or barnabas      ross gave us an excellent sermon yesterday on hallowing the name though far from commonplace it might have been delivered in any church  we have had fanny kemble here last week  i only heard her romeo and julietnot less instructive as her readings always are than exciting for in her glass shakspeare is a philosopher  i know her and honour her for her truthfulness amidst all trials        lady byron to h c r                                  brighton march 5 1855  i recollect only those passages of dr kennedys book which bear upon the opinions of lord byron  strange as it may seem dr kennedy is most faithful where you doubt his being so  not merely from casual expressions but from the whole tenor of lord byrons feelings i could not but conclude he was a believer in the inspiration of the bible and had the gloomiest calvinistic tenets  to that unhappy view of the relation of the creature to the creator i have always ascribed the misery of his life      it is enough for me to remember that he who thinks his transgressions beyond forgiveness and such was his own deepest feeling has righteousness beyond that of the selfsatisfied sinner or perhaps of the halfawakened  it was impossible for me to doubt that could he have been at once assured of pardon his living faith in a moral duty and love of virtue i love the virtues which i cannot claim would have conquered every temptation  judge then how i must hate the creed which made him see god as an avenger not a father my own impressions were just the reverse but could have little weight and it was in vain to seek to turn his thoughts for long from that idee fixe with which he connected his physical peculiarity as a stamp  instead of being made happier by any apparent good he felt convinced that every blessing would be turned into a curse to him  who possessed by such ideas could lead a life of love and service to god or man  they must in a measure realize themselves  the worst of it is i do believe he said  i like all connected with him was broken against the rock of predestination  i may be pardoned for referring to his frequent expression of the sentiment that i was only sent to show him the happiness he was forbidden to enjoy  you will now better understand why the deformed transformed is too painful to me for discussion  since writing the above i have read dr granvilles letter on the emperor of russia some passages of which seem applicable to the prepossession i have described  i will not mix up less serious matters with these which forty years have not made less than present still to me        lady byron to h c r                                  brighton april 8 1855      the book which has interested me most lately is that on mosaism translated by miss goldsmid and which i read as you will believe without any christian unchristian prejudice  the missionaries of the unity were always from my childhood regarded by me as in that sense the people and i believe they were true to that mission though blind intellectually in demanding the crucifixion  the present aspect of jewish opinions as shown in that book is all but christian  the author is under the error of taking as the representatives of christianity the mystics ascetics and quietists and therefore he does not know how near he is to the true spirit of the gospel  if you should happen to see miss goldsmid pray tell her what a great service i think she has rendered to us soidisant christians in translating a book which must make us sensible of the little we have done and the much we have to do to justify our preference of the later to the earlier dispensation           lady byron to h c r                                 brighton april 11 1855  you appear to have more definite information respecting the review than i have obtained     it was also said that the review would in fact be the prospective amplifiednot satisfactory to me because i have always thought that periodical too unitarian in the sense of separating itself from other christian churches if not by a high wall at least by a wiregauze fence  now separation is to me the greek text  the revelation through nature never separates it is the revelation through the book which separates  whewell and brewster would have been one had they not i think equally dimmed their lamps of science when reading their bibles  as long as we think a truth better for being shut up in a text we are not of the wideworld religion which is to include all in one fold for that text will not be accepted by the followers of other books or students of the same and separation will ensue  the christian scripture should be dear to us not as the charter of a few but of mankind and to fashion it into cages is to deny its ultimate objects  these thoughts hot like the roll at breakfast where your letter was so welcome an addition    three domestic poems by lord byron   fare thee well     fare thee well and if for ever    still for ever fare thee well    even though unforgiving never    gainst thee shall my heart rebel     would that breast were bared before thee    where thy head so oft hath lain    while that placid sleep came oer thee    which thou neer canst know again     would that breast by thee

even its praises must offend thee    founded on anothers woe     though my many faults defaced me    could no other arm be found    than the one which once embraced me    to inflict a cureless wound     yet oh yet thyself deceive not    love may sink by slow decay    but by sudden wrench believe not    hearts can thus be torn away     still thine own its life retaineth    still must mine though bleeding beat    and the undying thought which paineth    isthat we no more may meet     these are words of deeper sorrow    than the wail above the dead    both shall live but every morrow    wake us from a widowed bed     and when thou wouldst solace gather    when our childs first accents flow    wilt thou teach her to say father    though his care she must forego     when her little hand shall press thee    when her lip to thine is pressed    think of him whose prayer shall bless thee    think of him thy love had blessed     should her lineaments resemble    those thou never more mayst see    then thy heart will softly tremble    with a pulse yet true to me     all my faults perchance thou knowest    all my madness none can know    all my hopes whereer thou goest    wither yet with thee they go     every feeling hath been shaken    pride which not a world could bow    bows to thee by thee forsaken    even my soul forsakes me now     but tis done all words are idle    words from me are vainer still    but the thoughts we cannot bridle    force their way without the will     fare thee wellthus disunited    torn from every nearer tie    seared in heart and lone and blighted    more than this i scarce can die  a sketch     born in the garret in the kitchen bred    promoted thence to deck her mistress head    nextfor some gracious service unexpressd    and from its wages only

this monster when their mistress left off trade    this female dogstar of her little sky    where all beneath her influence droop or die     o wretch without a tear without a thought    save joy above the ruin thou hast wrought    the time shall come nor long remote when thou    shalt feel far more than thou inflictest now    feel for thy vile selfloving self in vain    and turn thee howling in unpitied pain    may the strong curse of crushed affections light    back on thy bosom with reflected blight    and make thee in thy leprosy of mind    as loathsome to thyself as to mankind    till all thy selfthoughts curdle into hate    black as thy will for others would create    till thy hard heart be calcined into dust    and thy soul welter in its hideous crust    oh may thy grave be sleepless as the bed    the widowed couch of fire that thou hast spread    then when thou fain wouldst weary heaven with prayer    look on thine earthly victims and despair    down to the dust and as thou rottst away    even worms shall perish on thy poisonous clay    but for the love i bore and still must bear    to her thy malice from all ties would tear    thy name thy human name to every eye    the climax of all scorn should hang on high    exalted oer thy less abhorred compeers    and festering in the infamy of years    lines on hearing that lady byron was ill     and thou wert sad yet i was not with thee       and thou wert sick and yet i was not near    methought that joy and health alone could be    where i was not and pain and sorrow here    and is it thus  it is as i foretold    and shall be more so for the mind recoils    upon itself and the wrecked heart lies cold    while heaviness collects the shattered spoils    it is not in the storm nor in the strife    we feel benumbed and wish to be no more    but in the aftersilence on the shore    when all is lost except a little life    i am too well avenged  but twas my right    whateer my sins might be thou wert not sent    to be the nemesis who should requite    nor did heaven choose so near an instrument    mercy is for the mercifulif thou    hast been of such twill be accorded now    thy nights are banished from the realms of sleep    yes they may flatter thee but thou shalt feel    a hollow agony which will not heal    for thou art pillowed on a curse too deep    thou hast sown in my sorrow and must reap    the bitter harvest in a woe as real    i have had many foes but none like thee    for gainst the rest myself i could defend    and be avenged or turn them into friend    but thou in safe implacability    hadst nought to dread in thy own weakness shielded    and in my love which hath but too much yielded    and spared for thy sake some i should not spare    and thus upon the worldtrust in thy truth    and the wild fame of my ungoverned youth    on things that were not and on things that are    even upon such a basis hast thou built    a monument whose cement hath been guilt    the moral clytemnestra of thy lord    and hewed down with an unsuspected sword    fame peace and hope and all the better life    which but for this cold treason of thy heart    might still have risen from out the grave of strife    and found a nobler duty than to part    but of thy virtues didst thou make a vice    trafficking with them in a purpose cold    for present anger and for future gold    and buying others grief at any price    and thus once entered into crooked ways    the early truth which was thy proper praise    did not still walk beside thee but at times    and with a breast unknowing

stupidity was the sole and sufficient bammifier of himself i know not  a note says that murray had been much shocked by byrons misstatements to medwin as to moneymatters with him  the note goes on to say medwin could not have invented them for they were mixed up with acknowledged facts and the presumption is that byron mystified his gallant acquaintance  he was fond of such tricks  121 this one fact is that lord byron might have had an open examination in court if he had only persisted in refusing the deed of separation  126 in the history of blackwoods magazine prefaced to the american edition of 1854 mackenzie says of the noctes papers great as was their popularity in england it was peculiarly in america that their high merit and undoubted originality received the heartiest recognition and appreciation  nor is this wonderful when it is considered that for one reader of blackwoods magazine in the old country there cannot be less than fifty in the new  139 the reader is

godwins is a remarkably powerful story  it is related in the first person by the supposed hero caleb williams  he represents himself as private secretary to a gentleman of high family named falkland  caleb accidentally discovers that his patron has in a moment of passion committed a murder  falkland confesses the crime to caleb and tells him that henceforth he shall always suspect him and keep watch over him  caleb finds this watchfulness insupportable and tries to escape but without success  he writes a touching letter to his patron imploring him to let him go and promising never to betray him the scene where falkland refuses this is the most highly wrought in the book  he says to him do not imagine that i am afraid of you i wear an armour against which all your weapons are impotent  i have dug a pit for you and whichever way you move backward or forward to the right or the left it is ready to swallow you  be still  if once you fall call as loud as you will no man on earth shall

as having absolutely reached its apex until he was drunk  he also records it as a further joke of the club that a mans having reached this apex was to be tested by his inability to pronounce the word civilisation which he says after ten oclock at night ought to be abridged to civilation by syncope or vigorously speaking by hiccup  178b vol v pp61 75  181  these italics are ours  190a this little incident shows the characteristic carefulness and accuracy of lady byrons habits  this statement was written fourteen years after the events spoken of but lady byron carefully quotes a passage from her mothers letter written at that time  this shows that a copy of lady milbankes letter had been preserved and makes it appear probable that copies of the whole correspondence of that period were also kept  great light could be thrown on the whole transaction could these documents be consulted  190b here again lady byrons sealed papers might furnish light  the letters addressed to her at this time by those in constant intercourse with lord byron are doubtless preserved and would show her ground of action  192 probably lady milbankes letters are among the sealed papers and would more fully explain the situation  205a hunts byron p77 philadelphia 1828  205b from the temple bar article october 1869  mrs leigh lord byrons sister had other thoughts of mrs clermont and wrote to her offering
