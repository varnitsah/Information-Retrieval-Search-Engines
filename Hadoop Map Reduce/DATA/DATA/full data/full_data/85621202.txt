v nuns at luncheon     mortal coils     i the gioconda smile    i   miss spence will be down directly sir  thank you said mr hutton without turning round janet spences parlourmaid was so uglyugly on purpose it always seemed to him malignantly criminally uglythat he could not bear to look at her more than was necessary the door closed left to himself mr hutton got up and began to wander round the room looking with meditative eyes at the familiar objects it contained  photographs of greek statuary photographs of the roman forum coloured prints of italian masterpieces all very safe and well known poor dear janet what a prigwhat an intellectual snob her real taste was illustrated in that watercolour by the pavement artist the one she had paid half a crown for and thirtyfive shillings for the frame how often his had heard her tell the story how often expatiate on the beauties of that skilful imitation of an oleograph a real artist in the streets and you could hear the capital a in artist as she spoke the words she made you feel that part of his glory had entered into janet spence when she tendered him that halfcrown for the copy of the oleograph she was implying a compliment to her own taste and penetration a genuine old master for half a crown poor dear janet  mr hutton came to a pause in front of a small oblong mirror stooping a little to get a full view of his face he passed a white wellmanicured finger over his moustache it was as curly as freshly auburn as it had been twenty years ago his hair still retained its colour and there was no sign of baldness yetonly a certain elevation of the brow shakespearean thought mr hutton with a smile as he surveyed the smooth and polished expanse of his forehead  others abide our question thou art free footsteps in the sea  majesty  shakespeare thou shouldst be living at this hour no that was milton wasnt it milton the lady of christs there was no lady about him he was what the women would call a manly man that was why they liked himfor the curly auburn moustache and the discreet redolence of tobacco mr hutton smiled again he enjoyed making fun of himself lady of christs no no he was the christ of ladies very pretty very pretty the christ of ladies mr hutton wished there were somebody he could tell the joke to poor dear janet wouldnt appreciate it alas  he straightened himself up patted his hair and resumed his peregrination damn the roman forum he hated those dreary photographs  suddenly he became aware that janet spence was in the room standing near the door mr hutton started as though he had been taken in some felonious act to make these silent and spectral appearances was one of janet spences peculiar talents perhaps she had been there all the time had seen him looking at himself in the mirror impossible but still it was disquieting  oh you gave me such a surprise said mr hutton recovering his smile and advancing with outstretched hand to meet her  miss spence was smiling too her gioconda smile he had once called it in a moment of halfironical flattery miss spence had taken the compliment seriously and had always tried to live up to the leonardo standard she smiled on his silence while mr hutton shook hands that was part of the gioconda business  i hope youre well said mr hutton you look it  what a queer face she had that small mouth pursed forward by the gioconda expression into a little snout with a round hole in the middle as though for whistlingit was like a penholder seen from the front above the mouth a wellshaped nose finely aquiline eyes large lustrous and dark with the largeness lustre and darkness that seems to invite sties and an occasional bloodshot suffusion they were fine eyes but unchangingly grave the penholder might do its gioconda trick but the eyes never altered in their earnestness above them a pair of boldly arched heavily pencilled black eyebrows lent a surprising air of power as of a roman matron to the upper portion of the face her hair was dark and equally roman agrippina from the brows upward  i thought id just look in on my way home mr hutton went on ah its good to be back herehe indicated with a wave of his hand the flowers in the vases the sunshine and greenery beyond the windows its good to be back in the country after a stuffy day of business in town  miss spence who had sat down pointed to a chair at her side  no really i cant sit down mr hutton protested i must get back to see how poor emily is she was rather seedy this morning he sat down nevertheless its these wretched liver chills shes always getting them women he broke off and coughed so as to hide the fact that he had uttered he was about to say that women with weak digestions ought not to marry but the remark was too cruel and he didnt really believe it janet spence moreover was a believer in eternal flames and spiritual attachments she hopes to be well enough he added to see you at luncheon tomorrow can you come do he smiled persuasively its my invitation too you know  she dropped her eyes and mr hutton almost thought that he detected a certain reddening of the cheek it was a tribute he stroked his moustache  i should like to come if you think emilys really well enough to have a visitor  of course youll do her good youll do us both good in married life three is often better company than two  oh youre cynical  mr hutton always had a desire to say bowwowwow whenever that last word was spoken it irritated him more than any other word in the language but instead of barking he made haste to protest  no no im only speaking a melancholy truth reality doesnt always come up to the ideal you know but that doesnt make me believe any the less in the ideal indeed i believe in it passionately the ideal of a matrimony between two people in perfect accord i think its realisable im sure it is  he paused significantly and looked at her with an arch expression a virgin of thirtysix but still unwithered she had her charms and there was something really rather enigmatic about her miss spence made no reply but continued to smile there were times when mr hutton got rather bored with the gioconda he stood up  i must really be going now farewell mysterious gioconda the smile grew intenser focused itself as it were in a narrower snout mr hutton made a cinquecento gesture and kissed her extended hand it was the first time he had done such a thing the action seemed not to be resented i look forward to tomorrow  do you  for answer mr hutton once more kissed her hand then turned to go miss spence accompanied him to the porch  wheres your car she asked  i left it at the gate of the drive  ill come and see you off  no no mr hutton was playful but determined you must do no such thing i simply forbid you  but i should like to come miss spence protested throwing a rapid gioconda at him  mr hutton held up his hand no he repeated and then with a gesture that was almost the blowing of a kiss he started to run down the drive lightly on his toes with long bounding strides like a boys he was proud of that run it was quite marvellously youthful still he was glad the drive was no longer at the last bend before passing out of sight of the house he halted and turned round miss spence was still standing on the steps smiling her smile he waved his hand and this time quite definitely and overtly wafted a kiss in her direction then breaking once more into his magnificent canter he rounded the last dark promontory of trees once out of sight of the house he let his high paces decline to a trot and finally to a walk he took out his handkerchief and began wiping his neck inside his collar what fools what fools had there ever been such an ass as poor dear janet spence never unless it was himself decidedly he was the more malignant fool since he at least was aware of his folly and still persisted in it why did he persist ah the problem that was himself the problem that was other people  he had reached the gate a large prosperouslooking motor was standing at the side of the road  home mnab the chauffeur touched his cap and stop at the crossroads on the way as usual mr hutton added as he opened the door of the car well he said speaking into the obscurity that lurked within  oh teddy bear what an age youve been it was a fresh and childish voice that spoke the words there was the faintest hint of cockney impurity about the vowel sounds  mr hutton bent his large form and darted into the car with the agility of an animal regaining its burrow  have i he said as he shut the door the machine began to move you must have missed me a lot if you found the time so long he sat back in the low seat a cherishing warmth enveloped him  teddy bear and with a sigh of contentment a charming little head declined on to mr huttons shoulder ravished he looked down sideways at the round babyish face  do you know doris you look like the pictures of louise de kerouaille he passed his fingers through a mass of curly hair  whos louise de kerawhateveritis doris spoke from remote distances  she was alas fuit we shall all be was one of these days meanwhile  mr hutton covered the babyish face with kisses the car rushed smoothly along mcnabs back through the front window was stonily impassive the back of a statue  your hands doris whispered oh you mustnt touch me they give me electric shocks  mr hutton adored her for the virgin imbecility of the words how late in ones existence one makes the discovery of ones body  the electricity isnt in me its in you he kissed her again whispering her name several times doris doris doris the scientific appellation of the seamouse he was thinking as he kissed the throat she offered him white and extended like the throat of a victim awaiting the sacrificial knife the seamouse was a sausage with iridescent fur very peculiar or was doris the sea cucumber which turns itself inside out in moments of alarm he would really have to go to naples again just to see the aquarium these sea creatures were fabulous unbelievably fantastic  oh teddy bear more zoology but he was only a land animal his poor little jokes teddy bear im so happy  so am i said mr hutton was it true  but i wish i knew if it were right tell me teddy bear is it right or wrong  ah my dear thats just what ive been wondering for the last thirty years  be serious teddy bear i want to know if this is right if its right that i should be here with you and that we should love one another and that it should give me electric shocks when you touch me  right well its certainly good that you should have electric shocks rather than sexual repressions read freud repressions are the devil  oh you dont help me why arent you ever serious if only you knew how miserable i am sometimes thinking its not right perhaps you know there is a hell and all that i don t know what to do sometimes i think i ought to stop loving you  but could you asked mr hutton confident in the powers of his seduction and his moustache  no teddy bear you know i couldnt but i could run away i could hide from you i could lock myself up and force myself not to come to you  silly little thing he tightened his embrace  oh dear i hope it isnt wrong and there are times when i dont care if it is  mr hutton was touched he had a certain protective affection for this little creature he laid his cheek against her hair and so interlaced they sat in silence while the car swaying and pitching a little as it hastened along seemed to draw in the white road and the dusty hedges towards it devouringly  goodbye goodbye  the car moved on gathered speed vanished round a curve and doris was left standing by the signpost at the crossroads still dizzy and weak with the languor born of those kisses and the electrical touch of those gentle hands she had to take a deep breath to draw herself up deliberately before she was strong enough to start her homeward walk she had half a mile in which to invent the necessary lies  alone mr hutton suddenly found himself the prey of an appalling boredom     ii   mrs hutton was lying on the sofa in her boudoir playing patience in spite of the warmth of the july evening a wood fire was burning on the hearth a black pomeranian extenuated by the heat and the fatigues of digestion slept before the blaze  phew isnt it rather hot in here mr hutton asked as he entered the room  you know i have to keep warm dear the voice seemed breaking on the verge of tears i get so shivery  i hope youre better this evening  not much im afraid  the conversation stagnated mr hutton stood leaning his back against the mantelpiece he looked down at the pomeranian lying at his feet and with the toe of his right boot he rolled the little dog over and rubbed its whiteflecked chest and belly the creature lay in an inert ecstasy mrs hutton continued to play patience arrived at an impasse she altered the position of one card took back another and went on playing her patiences always came out  dr libbard thinks i ought to go to llandrindod wells this summer  wellgo my deargo most certainly  mr hutton was thinking of the events of the afternoon how they had driven doris and he up to the hanging wood had left the car to wait for them under the shade of the trees and walked together out into the windless sunshine of the chalk down  im to drink the waters for my liver and he thinks i ought to have massage and electric treatment too  hat in hand doris had stalked four blue butterflies that were dancing together round a scabious flower with a motion that was like the flickering of blue fire the blue fire burst and scattered into whirling sparks she had given chase laughing and shouting like a child  im sure it will do you good my dear  i was wondering if youd come with me dear  but you know im going to scotland at the end of the month  mrs hutton looked up at him entreatingly its the journey she said the thought of it is such a nightmare i dont know if i can manage it and you know i cant sleep in hotels and then theres the luggage and all the worries i cant go alone  but you wont be alone youll have your maid with you he spoke impatiently the sick woman was usurping the place of the healthy one he was being dragged back from the memory of the sunlit down and the quick laughing girl back to this unhealthy overheated room and its complaining occupant  i dont think i shall be able to go  but you must my dear if the doctor tells you to and besides a change will do you good  i dont think so  but libbard thinks so and he knows what hes talking about  no i cant face it im too weak i cant go alone mrs hutton pulled a handkerchief out of her black silk bag and put it to her eyes  nonsense my dear you must make the effort  i had rather be left in peace to die here she was crying in earnest now  o lord now do be reasonable listen now please mrs hutton only sobbed more violently oh what is one to do he shrugged his shoulders and walked out of the room  mr hutton was aware that he had not behaved with proper patience but he could not help it very early in his manhood he had discovered that not only did he not feel sympathy for the poor the weak the diseased and deformed he actually hated them once as an undergraduate he spent three days at a mission in the east end he had returned filled with a profound and ineradicable disgust instead of pitying he loathed the unfortunate it was not he knew a very comely emotion and he had been ashamed of it at first in the end he had decided that it was temperamental inevitable and had felt no further qualms emily had been healthy and beautiful when he married her he had loved her then but nowwas it his fault that she was like this  mr hutton dined alone food and drink left him more benevolent than he had been before dinner to make amends for his show of exasperation he went up to his wifes room and offered to read to her she was touched gratefully accepted the offer and mr hutton who was particularly proud of his accent suggested a little light reading in french  french i am so fond of french mrs hutton spoke of the language of racine as though it were a dish of green peas  mr hutton ran down to the library and returned with a yellow volume he began reading the effort of pronouncing perfectly absorbed his whole attention but how good his accent was the fact of its goodness seemed to improve the quality of the novel he was reading  at the end of fifteen pages an unmistakable sound aroused him he looked up mrs hutton had gone to sleep he sat still for a little while looking with a dispassionate curiosity at the sleeping face once it had been beautiful once long ago the sight of it the recollection of it had moved him with an emotion profounder perhaps than any he had felt before or since now it was lined and cadaverous the skin was stretched tightly over the cheekbones across the bridge of the sharp birdlike nose the closed eyes were set in profound bonerimmed sockets the lamplight striking on the face from the side emphasised with light and shade its cavities and projections it was the face of a dead christ by morales       le squelette était invisible      au temps heureux de lart païen  he shivered a little and tiptoed out of the room  on the following day mrs hutton came down to luncheon she had had some unpleasant palpitations during the night but she was feeling better now besides she wanted to do honour to her guest miss spence listened to her complaints about llandrindod wells and was loud in sympathy lavish with advice whatever she said was always said with intensity she leaned forward aimed so to speak like a gun and fired her words bang the charge in her soul was ignited the words whizzed forth at the narrow barrel of her mouth she was a machinegun riddling her hostess with sympathy mr hutton had undergone similar bombardments mostly of a literary or philosophic characterbombardments of maeterlinck of mrs besant of bergson of william james today the missiles were medical she talked about insomnia she expatiated on the virtues of harmless drugs and beneficent specialists under the bombardment mrs hutton opened out like a flower in the sun  mr hutton looked on in silence the spectacle of janet spence evoked in him an unfailing curiosity he was not romantic enough to imagine that every face masked an interior physiognomy of beauty or strangeness that every womans small talk was like a vapour hanging over mysterious gulfs his wife for example and doris they were nothing more than what they seemed to be but with janet spence it was somehow different here one could be sure that there was some kind of a queer face behind the gioconda smile and the roman eyebrows the only question was what exactly was there mr hutton could never quite make out  but perhaps you wont have to go to llandrindod after all miss spence was saying if you get well quickly dr libbard will let you off  i only hope so indeed i do really feel rather better today  mr hutton felt ashamed how much was it his own lack of sympathy that prevented her from feeling well every day but he comforted himself by reflecting that it was only a case of feeling not of being better sympathy does not mend a diseased liver or a weak heart  my dear i wouldnt eat those red currants if i were you he said suddenly solicitous you know that libbard has banned everything with skins and pips  but i am so fond of them mrs hutton protested and i feel so well today  dont be a tyrant said miss spence looking first at him and then at his wife let the poor invalid have what she fancies it will do her good she laid her hand on mrs huttons arm and patted it affectionately two or three times  thank you my dear mrs hutton helped herself to the stewed currants  well dont blame me if they make you ill again  do i ever blame you dear  you have nothing to blame me for mr hutton answered playfully i am the perfect husband  they sat in the garden after luncheon from the island of shade under the old cypress tree they looked out across a flat expanse of lawn in which the parterres of flowers shone with a metallic brilliance  mr hutton took a deep breath of the warm and fragrant air its good to be alive he said  just to be alive his wife echoed stretching one pale knotjointed hand into the sunlight  a maid brought the coffee the silver pots and the little blue cups were set on a folding table near the group of chairs  oh my medicine exclaimed mrs hutton run in and fetch it clara will you the white bottle on the sideboard  ill go said mr hutton ive got to go and fetch a cigar in any case  he ran in towards the house on the threshold he turned round for an instant the maid was walking back across the lawn his wife was sitting up in her deckchair engaged in opening her white parasol miss spence was bending over the table pouring out the coffee he passed into the cool obscurity of the house  do you like sugar in your coffee miss spence inquired  yes please give me rather a lot ill drink it after my medicine to take the taste away  mrs hutton leaned back in her chair lowering the sunshade over her eyes so as to shut out from her vision the burning sky  behind her miss spence was making a delicate clinking among the coffeecups  ive given you three large spoonfuls that ought to take the taste away and here comes the medicine  mr hutton had reappeared carrying a wineglass half full of a pale liquid  it smells delicious he said as he handed it to his wife  thats only the flavouring she drank it off at a gulp shuddered and made a grimace ugh its so nasty give me my coffee  miss spence gave her the cup she sipped at it youve made it like syrup but its very nice after that atrocious medicine  at halfpast three mrs hutton complained that she did not feel as well as she had done and went indoors to lie down her husband would have said something about the red currants but checked himself the triumph of an i told you so was too cheaply won instead he was sympathetic and gave her his arm to the house  a rest will do you good he said by the way i shant be back till after dinner  but why where are you going  i promised to go to johnsons this evening we have to discuss the war memorial you know  oh i wish you werent going mrs hutton was almost in tears cant you stay i dont like being alone in the house  but my dear i promised weeks ago it was a bother having to lie like this and now i must get back and look after miss spence  he kissed her on the forehead and went out again into the garden miss spence received him aimed and intense  your wife is dreadfully ill she fired off at him  i thought she cheered up so much when you came  that was purely nervous purely nervous i was watching her closely with a heart in that condition and her digestion wreckedyes wreckedanything might happen  libbard doesnt take so gloomy a view of poor emilys health mr hutton held open the gate that led from the garden into the drive miss spences car was standing by the front door  libbard is only a country doctor you ought to see a specialist  he could not refrain from laughing you have a macabre passion for specialists  miss spence held up her hand in protest i am serious i think poor emily is in a very bad state anything might happen at any moment  he handed her into the car and shut the door the chauffeur started the engine and climbed into his place ready to drive off  shall i tell him to start he had no desire to continue the conversation  miss spence leaned forward and shot a gioconda in his direction remember i expect you to come and see me again soon  mechanically he grinned made a polite noise and as the car moved forward waved his hand he was happy to be alone  a few minutes afterwards mr hutton himself drove away doris was waiting at the crossroads they dined together twenty miles from home at a roadside hotel it was one of those bad expensive meals which are only cooked in country hotels frequented by motorists it revolted mr hutton but doris enjoyed it she always enjoyed things mr hutton ordered a not very good brand of champagne he was wishing he had spent the evening in his library  when they started homewards doris was a little tipsy and extremely affectionate it was very dark inside the car but looking forward past the motionless form of mnab they could see a bright and narrow universe of forms and colours scooped out of the night by the electric headlamps  it was after eleven when mr hutton reached home dr libbard met him in the hall he was a small man with delicate hands and wellformed features that were almost feminine his brown eyes were large and melancholy he used to waste a great deal of time sitting at the bedside of his patients looking sadness through those eyes and talking in a sad low voice about nothing in particular his person exhaled a pleasing odour decidedly antiseptic but at the same time suave and discreetly delicious  libbard said mr hutton in surprise you here is my wife ill  we tried to fetch you earlier the soft melancholy voice replied it was thought you were at mr johnsons but they had no news of you there  no i was detained i had a breakdown mr hutton answered irritably it was tiresome to be caught out in a lie  your wife wanted to see you urgently  well i can go now mr hutton moved towards the stairs  dr libbard laid a hand on his arm i am afraid its too late  too late he began fumbling with his watch it wouldnt come out of the pocket  mrs hutton passed away half an hour ago  the voice remained even in its softness the melancholy of the eyes did not deepen dr libbard spoke of death as he would speak of a local cricket match all things were equally vain and equally deplorable  mr hutton found himself thinking of janet spences words at any momentat any moment she had been extraordinarily right  what happened he asked what was the cause  dr libbard explained it was heart failure brought on by a violent attack of nausea caused in its turn by the eating of something of an irritant nature red currants mr hutton suggested very likely it had been too much for the heart there was chronic valvular disease something had collapsed under the strain it was all over she could not have suffered much     iii   its a pity they should have chosen the day of the eton and harrow match for the funeral old general grego was saying as he stood his top hat in his hand under the shadow of the lych gate wiping his face with his handkerchief  mr hutton overheard the remark and with difficulty restrained a desire to inflict grievous bodily pain on the general he would have liked to hit the old brute in the middle of his big red face monstrous great mulberry spotted with meal was there no respect for the dead did nobody care in theory he didnt much care let the dead bury their dead but here at the graveside he had found himself actually sobbing poor emily they had been pretty happy once now she was lying at the bottom of a sevenfoot hole and here was grego complaining that he couldnt go to the eton and harrow match  mr hutton looked round at the groups of black figures that were drifting slowly out of the churchyard towards the fleet of cabs and motors assembled in the road outside against the brilliant background of the july grass and flowers and foliage they had a horribly alien and unnatural appearance it pleased him to think that all these people would soon be dead too  that evening mr hutton sat up late in his library reading the life of milton there was no particular reason why he should have chosen milton it was the book that first came to hand that was all it was after midnight when he had finished he got up from his armchair unbolted the french windows and stepped out on to the little paved terrace the night was quiet and clear mr hutton looked at the stars and at the holes between them dropped his eyes to the dim lawns and hueless flowers of the garden and let them wander over the farther landscape black and grey under the moon  he began to think with a kind of confused violence there were the stars there was milton a man can be somehow the peer of stars and night greatness nobility but is there seriously a difference between the noble and the ignoble milton the stars death and himselfhimself the soul the body the higher and the lower nature perhaps there was something in it after all milton had a god on his side and righteousness what had he nothing nothing whatever there were only doriss little breasts what was the point of it all milton the stars death and emily in her grave doris and himselfalways himself  oh he was a futile and disgusting being everything convinced him of it it was a solemn moment he spoke aloud i will i will the sound of his own voice in the darkness was appalling it seemed to him that he had sworn that infernal oath which binds even the gods i will i will there had been new years days and solemn anniversaries in the past when he had felt the same contritions and recorded similar resolutions they had all thinned away these resolutions like smoke into nothingness but this was a greater moment and he had pronounced a more fearful oath in the future it was to be different yes he would live by reason he would be industrious he would curb his appetites he would devote his life to some good purpose it was resolved and it would be so  in practice he saw himself spending his mornings in agricultural pursuits riding round with the bailiff seeing that his land was farmed in the best modern waysilos and artificial manures and continuous cropping and all that the remainder of the day should be devoted to serious study there was that book he had been intending to write for so longthe effect of diseases on civilisation  mr hutton went to bed humble and contrite but with a sense that grace had entered into him he slept for seven and a half hours and woke to find the sun brilliantly shining the emotions of the evening before had been transformed by a good nights rest into his customary cheerfulness it was not until a good many seconds after his return to conscious life that he remembered his resolution his stygian oath milton and death seemed somehow different in the sunlight as for the stars they were not there but the resolutions were good even in the daytime he could see that he had his horse saddled after breakfast and rode round the farm with the bailiff after luncheon he read thucydides on the plague at athens in the evening he made a few notes on malaria in southern italy while he was undressing he remembered that there was a good anecdote in skeltons jestbook about the sweating sickness he would have made a note of it if only he could have found a pencil  on the sixth morning of his new life mr hutton found among his correspondence an envelope addressed in that peculiarly vulgar handwriting which he knew to be doriss he opened it and began to read she didnt know what to say words were so inadequate his wife dying like that and so suddenlyit was too terrible mr hutton sighed but his interest revived somewhat as he read on       death is so frightening i never think of it when i can help it      but when something like this happens or when i am feeling ill or      depressed then i cant help remembering it is there so close and      i think about all the wicked things i have done and about you and      me and i wonder what will happen and i am so frightened i am so      lonely teddy bear and so unhappy and i dont know what to do i      cant get rid of the idea of dying i am so wretched and helpless      without you i didnt mean to write to you i meant to wait till      you were out of mourning and could come and see me again but i was      so lonely and miserable teddy bear i had to write i couldnt      help it forgive me i want you so much i have nobody in the world      but you you are so good and gentle and understanding there is      nobody like you i shall never forget how good and kind you have      been to me and you are so clever and know so much i can t      understand how you ever came to pay any attention to me i am so      dull and stupid much less like me and love me because you do love      me a little dont you teddy bear  mr hutton was touched with shame and remorse to be thanked like this worshipped for having seduced the girlit was too much it had just been a piece of imbecile wantonness imbecile idiotic there was no other way to describe it for when all was said he had derived very little pleasure from it taking all things together he had probably been more bored than amused once upon a time he had believed himself to be a hedonist but to be a hedonist implies a certain process of reasoning a deliberate choice of known pleasures a rejection of known pains this had been done without reason against it for he knew beforehandso well so wellthat there was no interest or pleasure to be derived from these wretched affairs and yet each time the vague itch came upon him he succumbed involving himself once more in the old stupidity there had been maggie his wifes maid and edith the girl on the farm and mrs pringle and the waitress in london and othersthere seemed to be dozens of them it had all been so stale and boring he knew it would be he always knew and yet and yet experience doesnt teach  poor little doris he would write to her kindly comfortingly but he wouldnt see her again a servant came to tell him that his horse was saddled and waiting he mounted and rode off that morning the old bailiff was more irritating than usual                                       five days later doris and mr hutton ware sitting together on the pier at southend doris in white muslin with pink garnishings radiated happiness mr hutton legs outstretched and chair tilted had pushed the panama back from his forehead and was trying to feel like a tripper that night when doris was asleep breathing and warm by his side he recaptured in this moment of darkness and physical fatigue the rather cosmic emotion which had possessed him that evening not a fortnight ago when he had made his great resolution and so his solemn oath had already gone the way of so many other resolutions unreason had triumphed at the first itch of desire he had given way he was hopeless hopeless  for a long time he lay with closed eyes ruminating his humiliation the girl stirred in her sleep mr hutton turned over and looked in her direction enough faint light crept in between the halfdrawn curtains to show her bare arm and shoulder her neck and the dark tangle of hair on the pillow she was beautiful desirable why did he lie there moaning over his sins what did it matter if he were hopeless then so be it he would make the best of his hopelessness a glorious sense of irresponsibility suddenly filled him he was free magnificently free in a kind of exaltation he drew the girl towards him she woke bewildered almost frightened under his rough kisses  the storm of his desire subsided into a kind of serene merriment the whole atmosphere seemed to be quivering with enormous silent laughter  could anyone love you as much as i do teddy bear the question came faintly from distant worlds of love  i think i know somebody who does mr hutton replied the submarine laughter was swelling rising ready to break the surface of silence and resound  who tell me what do you mean the voice had come very close charged with suspicion anguish indignation it belonged to this immediate world  aah  who  youll never guess mr hutton kept up the joke until it began to grow tedious and then pronounced the name janet spence  doris was incredulous miss spence of the manor that old woman it was too ridiculous mr hutton laughed too  but its quite true he said she adores me oh the vast joke he would go and see her as soon as he returnedsee and conquer i believe she wants to marry me he added  but you wouldnt  you dont intend  the air was fairly crepitating with humour mr hutton laughed aloud i intend to marry you he said it seemed to him the best joke he had ever made in his life  when mr hutton left southend he was once more a married man it was agreed that for the time being the fact should be kept secret in the autumn they would go abroad together and the world should be informed meanwhile he was to go back to his own house and doris to hers  the day after his return he walked over in the afternoon to see miss spence she received him with the old gioconda  i was expecting you to come  i couldnt keep away mr hutton gallantly replied  they sat in the summerhouse it was a pleasant placea little old stucco temple bowered among dense bushes of evergreen miss spence had left her mark on it by hanging up over the seat a blueandwhite della robbia plaque  i am thinking of going to italy this autumn said mr hutton he felt like a gingerbeer bottle ready to pop with bubbling humorous excitement  italy miss spence closed her eyes ecstatically i feel drawn there too  why not let yourself be drawn  i dont know one somehow hasnt the energy and initiative to set out alone  alone ah sound of guitars and throaty singing yes travelling alone isnt much fun  miss spence lay back in her chair without speaking her eyes were still closed mr hutton stroked his moustache the silence prolonged itself for what seemed a very long time  pressed to stay to dinner mr hutton did not refuse the fun had hardly started the table was laid in the loggia through its arches they looked out on to the sloping garden to the valley below and the farther hills light ebbed away the heat and silence were oppressive a huge cloud was mounting up the sky and there were distant breathings of thunder the thunder drew nearer a wind began to blow and the first drops of rain fell the table was cleared miss spence and mr hutton sat on in the growing darkness  miss spence broke a long silence by saying meditatively  i think everyone has a right to a certain amount of happiness dont you  most certainly but what was she leading up to nobody makes generalisations about life unless they mean to talk about themselves happiness he looked back on his own life and saw a cheerful placid existence disturbed by no great griefs or discomforts or alarms he had always had money and freedom he had been able to do very much as he wanted yes he supposed he had been happyhappier than most men and now he was not merely happy he had discovered in irresponsibility the secret of gaiety he was about to say something about his happiness when miss spence went on speaking  people like you and me have a right to be happy some time in our lives  me said mr hutton surprised  poor henry fate hasnt treated either of us very well  oh well it might have treated me worse  you re being cheerful thats brave of you but dont think i cant see behind the mask  miss spence spoke louder and louder as the rain came down more and more heavily periodically the thunder cut across her utterances she talked on shouting against the noise  i have understood you so well and for so long  a flash revealed her aimed and intent leaning towards him her eyes were two profound and menacing gunbarrels the darkness reengulfed her  you were a lonely soul seeking a companion soul i could sympathise with you in your solitude your marriage   the thunder cut short the sentence miss spences voice became audible once more with the words   could offer no companionship to a man of your stamp you needed a soul mate  a soul matehe a soul mate it was incredibly fantastic georgette leblanc the exsoul mate of maurice maeterlinck he had seen that in the paper a few days ago so it was thus that janet spence had painted him in her imaginationa soulmater and for doris he was a picture of goodness and the cleverest man in the world and actually really he was whatwho knows  my heart went out to you i could understand i was lonely too miss spence laid her hand on his knee you were so patient another flash she was still aimed dangerously you never complained but i could guessi could guess  how wonderful of you so he was an âme incomprise  only a womans intuition  the thunder crashed and rumbled died away and only the sound of the ram was left the thunder was his laughter magnified externalised flash and crash there it was again right on top of them  dont you feel that you have within you something that is akin to this storm he could imagine her leaning forward as she uttered the words passion makes one the equal of the elements  what was his gambit now why obviously he should have said yes and ventured on some unequivocal gesture but mr hutton suddenly took fright the ginger beer in him had gone flat the woman was seriousterribly serious he was appalled  passion no he desperately answered i am without passion  but his remark was either unheard or unheeded for miss spence went on with a growing exaltation speaking so rapidly however and in such a burningly intimate whisper that mr hutton found it very difficult to distinguish what she was saying she was telling him as far as he could make out the story of her life the lightning was less frequent now and there were long intervals of darkness but at each flash he saw her still aiming towards him still yearning forward with a terrifying intensity darkness the rain and then flash her face was there close at hand a pale mask greenish white the large eyes the narrow barrel of the mouth the heavy eyebrows agrippina or wasnt it ratheryes wasnt it rather george robey  he began devising absurd plans for escaping he might suddenly jump up pretending he had seen a burglarstop thief stop thiefand dash off into the night in pursuit or should he say that he felt faint a heart attack or that he had seen a ghostemilys ghostin the garden absorbed in his childish plotting he had ceased to pay any attention to miss spences words the spasmodic clutching of her hand recalled his thoughts  i honoured you for that henry she was saying  honoured him for what  marriage is a sacred tie and your respect for it even when the marriage was as it was in your case an unhappy one made me respect you and admire you andshall i dare say the word  oh the burglar the ghost in the garden but it was too late   yes love you henry all the more but were free now henry  free there was a movement in the dark and she was kneeling on the floor by his chair  oh henry henry i have been unhappy too  her arms embraced him and by the shaking of her body he could feel that she was sobbing she might have been a suppliant crying for mercy  you mustnt janet he protested those tears were terrible terrible not now not now you must be calm you must go to bed he patted her shoulder then got up disengaging himself from her embrace he left her still crouching on the floor beside the chair on which he had been sitting  groping his way into the hall and without waiting to look for his hat he went out of the house taking infinite pains to close the front door noiselessly behind him the clouds had blown over and the moon was shining from a clear sky there were puddles all along the road and a noise of running water rose from the gutters and ditches mr hutton splashed along not caring if he got wet  how heartrendingly she had sobbed with the emotions of pity and remorse that the recollection evoked in him there was a certain resentment why couldnt she have played the game that he was playing the heartless amusing game yes but he had known all the time that she wouldnt she couldnt play that game he had known and persisted  what had she said about passion and the elements something absurdly stale but true true there she was a cloud black bosomed and charged with thunder and he like some absurd little benjamin franklin had sent up a kite into the heart of the menace now he was complaining that his toy had drawn the lightning  she was probably still kneeling by that chair in the loggia crying  but why hadnt he been able to keep up the game why had his irresponsibility deserted him leaving him suddenly sober in a cold world there were no answers to any of his questions one idea burned steady and luminous in his mindthe idea of flight he must get away at once     iv   what are you thinking about teddy bear  nothing  there was a silence mr hutton remained motionless his elbows on the parapet of the terrace his chin in his hands looking down over florence he had taken a villa on one of the hilltops to the south of the city from a little raised terrace at the end of the garden one looked down a long fertile valley on to the town and beyond it to the bleak mass of monte morello and eastward of it to the peopled hill of fiesole dotted with white houses everything was clear and luminous in the september sunshine  are you worried about anything  no thank you  tell me teddy bear  but my dear theres nothing to tell mr hutton turned round smiled and patted the girls hand i think youd better go in and have your siesta its too hot for you here  very well teddy bear are you coming too  when ive finished my cigar  all right but do hurry up and finish it teddy bear slowly reluctantly she descended the steps of the terrace and walked towards the house  mr hutton continued his contemplation of florence he had need to be alone it was good sometimes to escape from doris and the restless solicitude of her passion he had never known the pains of loving hopelessly but he was experiencing now the pains of being loved these last weeks had been a period of growing discomfort doris was always with him like an obsession like a guilty conscience yes it was good to be alone  he pulled an envelope out of his pocket and opened it not without reluctance he hated letters they always contained something unpleasantnowadays since his second marriage this was from his sister he began skimming through the insulting hometruths of which it was composed the words indecent haste social suicide scarcely cold in her grave person of the lower classes all occurred they were inevitable now in any communication from a wellmeaning and rightthinking relative impatient he was about to tear the stupid letter to pieces when his eye fell on a sentence at the bottom of the third page his heart beat with uncomfortable violence as he read it it was too monstrous janet spence was going about telling everyone that he had poisoned his wife in order to marry doris what damnable malice ordinarily a man of the suavest temper mr hutton found himself trembling with rage he took the childish satisfaction of calling nameshe cursed the woman  then suddenly he saw the ridiculous side of the situation the notion that he should have murdered anyone in order to marry doris if they only knew how miserably bored he was poor dear janet she had tried to be malicious she had only succeeded in being stupid  a sound of footsteps aroused him he looked round in the garden below the little terrace the servant girl of the house was picking fruit a neapolitan strayed somehow as far north as florence she was a specimen of the classical typea little debased her profile might have been taken from a sicilian coin of a bad period her features carved floridly in the grand tradition expressed an almost perfect stupidity her mouth was the most beautiful thing about her the calligraphic hand of nature had richly curved it into an expression of mulish bad temper under her hideous black clothes mr hutton divined a powerful body firm and massive he had looked at her before with a vague interest and curiosity today the curiosity defined and focused itself into a desire an idyll of theocritus here was the woman he alas was not precisely like a goatherd on the volcanic hills he called to her  armida  the smile with which she answered him was so provocative attested so easy a virtue that mr hutton took fright he was on the brink once moreon the brink he must draw back oh quickly quickly before it was too late the girl continued to look up at him  ha chiamito she asked at last  stupidity or reason oh there was no choice now it was imbecility every time  scendo he called back to her twelve steps led from the garden to the terrace mr hutton counted them down down down down he saw a vision of himself descending from one circle of the inferno to the nextfrom a darkness full of wind and hail to an abyss of stinking mud     v   for a good many days the hutton case had a place on the front page of every newspaper there had been no more popular murder trial since george smith had temporarily eclipsed the european war by drowning in a warm bath his seventh bride the public imagination was stirred by this tale of a murder brought to light months after the date of the crime here it was felt was one of those incidents in human life so notable because they are so rare which do definitely justify the ways of god to man a wicked man had been moved by an illicit passion to kill his wife for months he had lived in sin and fancied securityonly to be dashed at last more horribly into the pit he had prepared for himself murder will out and here was a case of it the readers of the newspapers were in a position to follow every movement of the hand of god there had been vague but persistent rumours in the neighbourhood the police had taken action at last then came the exhumation order the postmortem examination the inquest the evidence of the experts the verdict of the coroners jury the trial the condemnation for once providence had done its duty obviously grossly didactically as in a melodrama the newspapers were right in making of the case the staple intellectual food of a whole season  mr huttons first emotion when he was summoned from italy to give evidence at the inquest was one of indignation it was a monstrous a scandalous thing that the police should take such idle malicious gossip seriously when the inquest was over he would bring an action for malicious prosecution against the chief constable he would sue the spence woman for slander  the inquest was opened the astonishing evidence unrolled itself the experts had examined the body and had found traces of arsenic they were of opinion that the late mrs hutton had died of arsenic poisoning  arsenic poisoning emily had died of arsenic poisoning after that mr hutton learned with surprise that there was enough arsenicated insecticide in his greenhouses to poison an army  it was now quite suddenly that he saw it there was a case against him fascinated he watched it growing growing like some monstrous tropical plant it was enveloping him surrounding him he was lost in a tangled forest  when was the poison administered the experts agreed that it must have been swallowed eight or nine hours before death about lunchtime yes about lunchtime clara the parlourmaid was called mrs hutton she remembered had asked her to go and fetch her medicine mr hutton had volunteered to go instead he had gone alone miss spenceah the memory of the storm the white aimed face the horror of it allmiss spence confirmed claras statement and added that mr hutton had come back with the medicine already poured out in a wineglass not in the bottle  mr huttons indignation evaporated he was dismayed frightened it was all too fantastic to be taken seriously and yet this nightmare was a fact it was actually happening  mnab had seen them kissing often he had taken them for a drive on the day of mrs huttons death he could see them reflected in the windscreen sometimes out of the tail of his eye  the inquest was adjourned that evening doris went to bed with a headache when he went to her room after dinner mr hutton found her crying  whats the matter he sat down on the edge of her bed and began to stroke her hair for a long time she did not answer and he went on stroking her hair mechanically almost unconsciously sometimes even he bent down and kissed her bare shoulder he had his own affairs however to think about what had happened how was it that the stupid gossip had actually come true emily had died of arsenic poisoning it was absurd impossible the order of things had been broken and he was at the mercy of an irresponsibility what had happened what was going to happen he was interrupted in the midst of his thoughts  its my faultits my fault doris suddenly sobbed out i shouldnt have loved you i oughtnt to have let you love me why was i ever born  mr hutton didnt say anything but looked down in silence at the abject figure of misery lying on the bed  if they do anything to you i shall kill myself  she sat up held him for a moment at arms length and looked at him with a kind of violence as though she were never to see him again  i love you i love you i love you she drew him inert and passive towards her clasped him pressed herself against him i didnt know you loved me as much as that teddy bear but why did you do itwhy did you do it  mr hutton undid her clasping arms and got up his face became very red you seem to take it for granted that i murdered my wife he said its really too grotesque what do you all take me for a cinema hero he had begun to lose his temper all the exasperation all the fear and bewilderment of the day was transformed into a violent anger against her its all such damned stupidity havent you any conception of a civilised mans mentality do i look the sort of man whod go about slaughtering people i suppose you imagined i was so insanely in love with you that i could commit any folly when will you women understand that one isnt insanely in love all one asks for is a quiet life which you wont allow one to have i dont know what the devil ever induced me to marry you it was all a damned stupid practical joke and now you go about saying im a murderer i wont stand it  mr hutton stamped towards the door he had said horrible things he knewodious things that he ought speedily to unsay but he wouldnt he closed the door behind him  teddy bear he turned the handle the latch clicked into place teddy bear the voice that came to him through the closed door was agonised should he go back he ought to go back he touched the handle then withdrew his fingers and quickly walked away when he was halfway down the stairs he halted she might try to do something sillythrow herself out of the window or god knows what he listened attentively there was no sound but he pictured her very clearly tiptoeing across the room lifting the sash as high as it would go leaning out into the cold night air it was raining a little under the window lay the paved terrace how far below twentyfive or thirty feet once when he was walking along piccadilly a dog had jumped out of a thirdstorey window of the ritz he had seen it fall he had heard it strike the pavement should he go back he was damned if he would he hated her  he sat for a long time in the library what had happened what was happening he turned the question over and over in his mind and could find no answer suppose the nightmare dreamed itself out to its horrible conclusion death was waiting for him his eyes filled with tears he wanted so passionately to live just to be alive poor emily had wished it too he remembered just to be alive there were still so many places in this astonishing world unvisited so many queer delightful people still unknown so many lovely women never so much as seen the huge white oxen would still be dragging their wains along the tuscan roads the cypresses would still go up straight as pillars to the blue heaven but he would not be there to see them and the sweet southern winestear of christ and blood of judasothers would drink them not he others would walk down the obscure and narrow lanes between the bookshelves in the london library sniffing the dusty perfume of good literature peering at strange titles discovering unknown names exploring the fringes of vast domains of knowledge he would be lying in a hole in the ground and why why confusedly he felt that some extraordinary kind of justice was being done in the past he had been wanton and imbecile and irresponsible now fate was playing as wantonly as irresponsibly with him it was tit for tat and god existed after all  he felt that he would like to pray forty years ago he used to kneel by his bed every evening the nightly formula of his childhood came to him almost unsought from some long unopened chamber of the memory god bless father and mother tom and cissie and the baby mademoiselle and nurse and everyone that i love and make me a good boy amen they were all dead now all except cissie  his mind seemed to soften and dissolve a great calm descended upon his spirit he went upstairs to ask doriss forgiveness he found her lying on the couch at the foot of the bed on the floor beside her stood a blue bottle of liniment marked not to be taken she seemed to have drunk about half of it  you didnt love me was all she said when she opened her eyes to find him bending over her  dr libbard arrived in time to prevent any very serious consequences you mustnt do this again he said while mr hutton was out of the room  whats to prevent me she asked defiantly  dr libbard looked at her with his large sad eyes theres nothing to prevent you he said only yourself and your baby isnt it rather bad luck on your baby not allowing it to come into the world because you want to go out of it  doris was silent for a time all right she whispered i wont  mr hutton sat by her bedside for the rest of the night he felt himself now to be indeed a murderer for a time he persuaded himself that he loved this pitiable child dozing in his chair he woke up stiff and cold to find himself drained dry as it were of every emotion he had become nothing but a tired and suffering carcase at six oclock he undressed and went to bed for a couple of hours sleep in the course of the same afternoon the coroners jury brought in a verdict of wilful murder and mr hutton was committed for trial     vi   miss spence was not at all well she had found her public appearances in the witnessbox very trying and when it was all over she had something that was very nearly a breakdown she slept badly and suffered from nervous indigestion dr libbard used to call every other day she talked to him a great dealmostly about the hutton case her moral indignation was always on the boil wasnt it appalling to think that one had had a murderer in ones house wasnt it extraordinary that one could have been for so long mistaken about the mans character but she had had an inkling from the first and then the girl he had gone off withso low class so little better than a prostitute the news that the second mrs hutton was expecting a baby the posthumous child of a condemned and executed criminalrevolted her the thing was shocking an obscenity dr libbard answered her gently and vaguely and prescribed bromide  one morning he interrupted her in the midst of her customary tirade by the way he said in his soft melancholy voice i suppose it was really you who poisoned mrs hutton  miss spence stared at him for two or three seconds with enormous eyes and then quietly said yes after that she started to cry  in the coffee i suppose  she seemed to nod assent dr libbard took out his fountainpen and in his neat meticulous calligraphy wrote out a prescription for a sleeping draught     ii permutations among the nightingales    a play   it is night on the terrace outside the hotel cimarosa part of the garden façade of the hotel is seen at the back of the stagea bare white wall with three french windows giving on to balconies about ten feet from the ground and below them leading from the terrace to the lounge a double door of glass open now through which a yellow radiance streams out into the night on the paved terrace stand two or three green iron tables and chairs to the left a mass of dark foliage ilex and cypress in the shadow of which more tables and chairs are set at the back to the left a strip of sky is visible between the corner of the hotel and the dark trees blue and starry for it is a marvellous june evening behind the trees the ground slopes steeply down and down to an old city in the valley below of whose invisible presence you are made aware by the sound of many bells wafted up from a score of slender towers in a sweet and melancholy discord that seems to mourn the passing of each successive hour when the curtain rises the terrace is almost deserted the hotel dinner is not yet over a single guest count alberto tiretta is discovered sitting in a position of histrionic despair at one of the little green tables a waiter stands respectfully sympathetic at his side alberto is a little man with large lustrous eyes and a black moustache about twentyfive years of age he has the pathetic charm of an italian streetboy with an organalmost as pretty and sentimental as murillos little beggars    alberto making a florid gesture with his right hand and with his left covering his eyes whereupon waiter he is reciting a tale of woes she slammed the door in my face he brings down his gesticulating right hand with a crash on to the table  waiter in your face signore impossible  alberto impossible but a fact some more brandy please i am a little weary the waiter uncorks the bottle he has been holding under his arm and fills albertos glass  waiter that will be one lira twentyfive signore  alberto throwing down a note keep the change  waiter bowing thank you signore but if i were the signore i should beat her he holds up the cognac bottle and by way of illustration slaps its black polished flanks  alberto beat her but i tell you i am in love with her  waiter all the more reason then signore it will be not only a stern disciplinary duty but a pleasure as well oh i assure you signore a pleasure  alberto enough enough you sully the melancholy beauty of my thoughts my feelings at this moment are of an unheardof delicacy and purity respect them i beg you some more brandy please  waiter pouring out the brandy delicacy purity ah believe me signore  that will be one lira twentyfive  alberto throwing down another note with the same superbly aristocratic gesture keep the change  waiter thank you signore but as i was saying signore delicacy purity you think i do not understand such sentiments alas signore beneath the humblest shirtfront there beats a heart and if the signores sentiments are too much for him i have a niece eighteen years old and what eyes what forms  alberto stop stop respect my feelings waiter as well as the ears of the young lady he points towards the glass doors remember she is an american the waiter bows and goes into the hotel    sidney dolphin and miss amy toomis  come out together on to the terrace miss amy supports a wellshaped head on one of the most graceful necks that ever issued from minneapolis the eyes are dark limpid ingenuous the mouth expresses sensibility she is twentytwo and the heiress of those illgotten toomis millions sidney dolphin has a romantic aristocratic appearance the tailoring of 1830 would suit him balzac would have described his face as plein de poésie in effect he does happen to be a poet his two volumes of verse zeotrope and trembling ears have been recognised by intelligent critics as remarkable how far they are poetry nobody least of all dolphin himself is certain they may be merely the ingenious products of a very cultured and elaborate brain mere curiosities who knows his age is twentyseven they sit down at one of the little iron tables alberto they do not see the shadow of the trees conceals him for his part he is too much absorbed in savouring his own despair to pay any attention to the newcomers there is a long uncomfortable silence dolphin assumes the thinkers maskthe bent brow the frown the finger to the forehead amy regards this romantic gargoyle with some astonishment pleased with her interest in him dolphin racks his brains to think of some way of exploiting this curiosity to his own advantage but he is too shy to play any of the gambits which his ingenuity suggests amy makes a social effort and speaks in chanting middle western tones amy its been a wonderful day hasnt it  dolphin starting as though roused from profoundest thought yes yes it has  amy you dont often get it as fine as this in england i guess  dolphin not often  amy nor do we over at home  dolphin so i should suppose silence a spasm of anguish crosses dolphins face then he reassumes the old thinkers mask amy looks at him for a little longer then unable to suppress her growing curiosity she says with a sudden burst of childish confidence  amy it must be wonderful to be able to think as hard as you do mr dolphin or are you sad about something  dolphin looks up smiles and blushes a spell has been broken the finger at the temple miss toomis is not the barrel of a revolver  amy that means youre not specially sad about anything just thinking  dolphin just thinking  amy what about  dolphin oh just life you knowlife and letters  amy letters do you mean love letters  dolphin no no letters in the sense of literature letters as opposed to life  amy disappointed oh literature they used to teach us literature at school but i could never understand emerson what do you think about literature for  dolphin it interests me you know i read it i even try to write it  amy very much excited what are you a writer a poet mr dolphin  dolphin alas it is only too true i am  amy but what do you write  dolphin verse and prose miss toomis just verse and prose  amy with enthusiasm isnt that interesting ive never met a poet before you know  dolphin fortunate being why before i left england i attended a luncheon of the poetry union at which no less than a hundred and eightynine poets were present the sight of them made me decide to go to italy  amy will you show me your books  dolphin certainly not miss toomis that would ruin our friendship i am insufferable in my writings in them i give vent to all the horrible thoughts and impulses which i am too timid to express or put into practice in real life take me as you find me here a decent specimen of a man shy but able to talk intelligently when the layers of ice are broken aimless ineffective but on the whole quite a good sort  amy but i know that man already mr dolphin i want to know the poet tell me what the poet is like  dolphin he is older miss toomis than the rocks on which he sits he is villainous he is  but there i really must stop it was you who set me going though did you do it on purpose  amy do what on purpose  dolphin make me talk about myself if you want to get people to like you you must always lead the conversation on to the subject of their characters nothing pleases them so much theyll talk with enthusiasm for hours and go away saying that youre the most charming cleverest person theyve ever met but of course you knew that already you re machiavellian  amy machiavellian youre the first person thats ever said that i always thought i was very simple and straightforward people say about me that ah now im talking about myself that was unscrupulous of you but you shouldnt have told me about the trick if you wanted it to succeed  dolphin yes it was silly of me if i hadnt youd have gone on talking about yourself and thought me the nicest man in the world  amy i want to hear about your poetry are you writing any now  dolphin i have composed the first line of a magnificent epic but i cant get any further  amy how does it go  dolphin like this he clears his throat casbeen has been and moghreb is no more ah the transience of all sublunary things but inspiration has stopped short there  amy what exactly does it mean  dolphin ah there you re asking too much miss toomis waiter some coffee for two  waiter who is standing in the door of the lounge si signore will the lady and gentleman take it here or in the gardens perhaps  dolphin a good suggestion why shouldnt the lady and gentleman take it in the garden  amy why not  dolphin by the fountain then waiter we can talk about ourselves there to the tune of falling waters  amy and you shall recite your poetry mr dolphin i just love poetry do you know mrs wilcoxs poems of passion they go out to the left a nightingale utters two or three phrases of song and from far down the bells of the city jangle the threequarters and die slowly away into the silence out of which they rose and came together  lucrezia grattarol has come out of the hotel just in time to overhear miss toomiss last remark just in time to see her walk slowly away with a hand on sidney dolphins arm lucrezia has a fine thoroughbred appearance an aquiline nose a finely curved sensual mouth a superb white brow a quivering nostril she is the last of a family whose name is as illustrious in venetian annals as that of foscarini tiepolo or tron she stamps a preposterously highheeled foot and tosses her head  lucrezia passion passion indeed an american she starts to run after the retreating couple when alberto who has been sitting with his head between his hands looks up and catches sight of the newcomer  alberto lucrezia  lucrezia starts for in the shade beneath the trees she had not seen him oh you gave me such a fright alberto im in a hurry now later on if you  alberto in a desperate voice that breaks into a sob lucrezia you must come and talk to me you must

with a sudden access of energy and passion the disgustingness of it you mean she pushes him from her his head wobbles once as though it were inanimate before he straightens into life the maternal instinct ugh its been the undoing of too many women you men come with your sentimental babyishness and exploit it for your own lusts be a man bertino be a woman i mean if you can  alberto looking up at her with eyes full of doglike dumb reproach lucrezia you too is there nobody who cares for me this is the unkindest cut of all i may as well die he relapses into tears  lucrezia who has started to

martial stamp  lucrezia to the waiter who is passing across the stage with a coffeepot and cups on a tray have you seen the signorina toomis giuseppe  waiter the signorina is down in the garden so is

and theres the nightingale beginning to sing in earnest good heavens what may not already have happened she runs out after the waiter  two persons emerge from the hotel the vicomte de barbazange and the baroness koch de worms paul de barbazange is a young mantwentysix perhaps of exquisite grace five foot ten well built dark hair sleek as marble the most refined aristocratic features and a monocle simone de worms is forty a ripe semitic beauty five years more and the bursting point of overripeness will have been reached but now thanks to massage powerful corsets skin foods and powder she is still a beautya beauty of the type italians admire cushioned steatopygous paul who has a faultless taste in bricàbrac and women and is by instinct and upbringing an ardent antisemite finds her infinitely repulsive the baronne enters with a loud shrill giggle she gives paul a slap with her green feather fan    simone oh you naughty boy quelle histoire mon dieu how dare you tell me such a story  paul for you baronne i would risk anything even your displeasure  simone charming boy but stories of that kind and you look so innocent too do you know any more like it  paul suddenly grave not of that description but i will tell you a story of another kind a true story a tragic story  simone did i ever tell you how i saw a woman run over by a train cut to pieces literally to pieces so disagreeable ill tell you later but now what about your story  paul oh its nothing nothing  simone but you promised to tell it me  paul its only a commonplace anecdote a young man poor but noble with a name and a position to keep up a few youthful follies a mountain of debts and no way out except the revolver this is all dull and obvious enough but now follows the interesting part of the story he is about to take that way out when he meets the woman of his dreams the goddess the angel the ideal he loves and he must die without a word he turns his face away from the baronne as though his emotion were too much for him which indeed it is  simone vicomtepaulthis young man is you  paul solemnly he is  simone and the woman  paul oh i cant i maynt tell you  simone the woman tell me paul  paul turning towards her and falling on his knees the woman simone is you ah but i had no right to say it  simone quivering with emotion my paul she clasps his head to her bosom a grimace of disgust contorts pauls classical features he endures simones caresses with a stoical patience but what is this about a revolver that is only a joke paul isnt it say it isnt true  paul alas simone too true he taps his coat pocket there it lies tomorrow i have a hundred and seventy thousand francs to pay or be dishonoured i cannot pay the sum a barbazange does not survive dishonour my ancestors were crusaders preux chevaliers to a man their code is mine dishonour for me is worse than death  simone mon dieu paul how noble you are she lays her hands on his shoulder leans back and surveys him at arms length a look of pride and anxious happiness on her face  paul dropping his eyes modestly not at all i was born noble and noblesse oblige as we say in our family farewell simone i love youand i must die my last thought will be of you he kisses her hand rises to his feet and makes as though to go  simone clutching him by the arm no paul no you must not shall not do anything rash a hundred and seventy thousand francs did you say it is paltry is there no one who could lend or give you the money  paul not a soul farewell simone  simone stay paul i hardly dare to ask it of youyou with such lofty ideas of honourbut would you  from me  paul take money from a woman ah simone tempt me no more i might do an ignoble act  simone but from me paul from me i am not in your eyes a woman like any other woman am i  paul it is true that my ancestors the crusaders the preux chevaliers might in all honour receive gifts from the ladies of their choicechargers swords armour or tenderer mementoes such as gloves or garters but moneyno who ever heard of their taking money  simone but what would be the use of my giving you swords and horses you could never use them consider my knight my noble sir paul in these days the contests of chivalry have assumed a different form the weapons and the armour have changed your sword must be of gold and paper your breastplate of hard cash your charger of giltedged securities i offer you the shining panoply of the modern crusader will you accept it  paul you are eloquent simone you could win over the devil himself with that angelic voice of yours but it cannot be money is always money the code is clear i cannot accept your offer here is the way out he takes an automatic pistol out of his pocket thank you simone and goodbye how wonderful is the love of a pure woman  simone paul paul give that to me she snatches the pistol from his hand if anything were to happen to you paul i should kill myself with this you must live you must consent to accept the money you mustnt let your honour make a martyr of you  paul brushing a tear from his eyes no i cant give me that pistol i beg you  simone for my sake paul  paul oh you make it impossible for me to act as the voices of dead ancestors tell me i should for your sake then simone i consent to live for your sake i dare to accept the gift you offer  simone kissing his hand in an outburst of gratitude thank you thank you paul how happy i am  paul i too light of my life  simone my months allowance arrived today i have the cheque here she takes it out of her corsage two hundred thousand francs its signed already you can get it cashed as soon as the hanks open tomorrow  paul moved by an outburst of genuine emotion kisses indiscriminately the cheque the baronne his own hands my angel you have saved me how can i thank you how can i love you enough ah mon petit bouton de rose  simone oh naughty naughty not now my paul you must wait till some other time  paul i burn with impatience  simone quelle fougue listen then in an hours time paul chéri in my boudoir i shall be alone  paul an hour it is an eternity  simone playfully an hour i wont relent till then my paul she blows a kiss and runs out the scenery trembles at her passage  paul looks at the cheque then pulls out a large silk handkerchief and wipes his neck inside his collar dolphin drifts in from the left he is smoking a cigarette but he does not seem to be enjoying it  paul alone  dolphin alas  paul brooding on the universe as usual i envy you your philosophic detachment personally i find that the world is very much too much with us and the devil too he looks at the cheque in his hand and above all the flesh my god the flesh he wipes his neck again  dolphin my philosophic detachment but its only a mask to hide the ineffectual longings i have to achieve contact with the world  paul but surely nothing is easier one just makes a movement and impinges on ones fellowbeings  dolphin not with a temperament like mine imagine a shyness more powerful than curiosity or desire a paralysis of all the faculties you are a man of the world you were born with a forehead of brass to affront every social emergency ah if you knew what a torture it is to find yourself in the presence of someone a woman perhapssomeone in whom you take an interest that is not merely philosophic to find oneself in the presence of such a person and to be incapable yes physically incapable of saying a word to express your interest in her or your desire to possess her intimacy ah i notice i have slipped into the feminine inevitably for of course the person is always a she  paul of course of course that goes without saying but whats the trouble women are so simple to deal with  dolphin i know perfectly simply if ones in the right state of mind i have found that out myself for moments come alas how rarelywhen i am filled with a spirit of confidence possessed by some angel or devil of power ah then i feel myself to be superb i carry all before me in those brief moments the whole secret of the world is revealed to me i perceive that the supreme quality in the human soul is effrontery genius in the man of action is simply the apotheosis of charlatanism alexander the great napoleon mr gladstone lloyd georgewhat are they just ordinary human beings projected through the magic lantern of a prodigious effrontery and so magnified to a thousand times larger than life look at me i am far more intelligent than any of these fabulous figures my sensibility is more refined than theirs i am morally superior to any of them and yet by my lack of charlatanism i am made less than nothing my qualities are projected through the wrong end of a telescope and the world perceives me far smaller than i really am but the worldwho cares about the world the only people who matter are the women  paul very true my dear dolphin the women he looks at the cheque and mops himself once more with his mauve silk handkerchief  dolphin tonight was one of my moments of triumph i felt myself suddenly free of all my inhibitions  paul i hope you profited by the auspicious occasion  dolphin i did i was making headway i hadbut i dont know why i should bore you with my confidences curious that one should be dumb before intimates and open ones mind to an all but stranger i must apologise  paul but i am all attention and sympathy my dear dolphin and i take it a little hardly that you should regard me as a stranger he lays a hand on dolphins shoulder  dolphin thank you barbazange thank you well if you consent to be the receptacle of my woes i shall go on pouring them out miss toomis but tell me frankly what you think of her  paul well  dolphin a little too ingenuous a little silly even eh  paul now you say so she certainly isnt very intellectually stimulating  dolphin precisely but  oh those chinablue eyes that ingenuousness that pathetic and enchanting silliness she touches lost chords in ones heart i love the chromatic fantasia of bach i am transported by beethovens hundredandeleventh sonata but the fact doesnt prevent my being moved to tears by the last luscious waltz played by the hotel orchestra in the best constructed brains there are always spongy surfaces that are sensitive to picture postcards and little nelly and the end of a perfect day miss toomis has found out my achilless heel she is boring ridiculous absurd to a degree but oh how moving how adorable  paul youre done for my poor dolphin sunkspurlos  dolphin and i was getting on so well was revelling in my newfound confidence and knowing its transience was exploiting it for all i was worth i had covered an enormous amount of ground and then hey presto at a blow all my labour was undone actuated by what malice i dont know la lucrezia swoops down like a vulture and without a byyourleave or excuse of any kind carries off miss toomis from under my very eyes what a woman she terrifies me i am always running away from her  paul which means i suppose that she is always pursuing you  dolphin she has ruined my evening and it may me all my chances of success my precious hour of selfconfidence will be wasted though i hope youll not take offence at the wordwasted on you  paul it will return  dolphin but whenbut when till it does i shall be impotent and in agony  paul i know the agony of waiting i myself was engaged to a rumanian princess in 1916 but owing to the sad collapse in the rumanian rate of exchange i have had to postpone our union indefinitely it is painful but believe me it can be borne he looks at the cheque and then at his watch there are other things which are much worse believe me dolphin it can be borne  dolphin i suppose it can for when all is said there are damned few of us who really take things much to heart julie de lespinasses are happily not common i am even subnormal at twenty i believed myself passionate one does at that age but now when i come to consider myself candidly i find that i am really one of those who never deeply felt nor strongly willed everything is profoundly indifferent to me i sometimes try to depress myself with the thought that the world is a cesspool that men are pathetic degenerates from the ape whose laboriously manufactured ideals are pure nonsense and find no rhyme in reality that the whole of life is a bad joke which takes a long time coming to an end but it really doesnt upset me i dont care a curse its deplorable one ought to care the best people do care still i must say i should like to get possession of miss toomis confound that grattarol woman what on earth did she want to rush me like that for do you suppose   paul i expect we shall find out now paul jerks his head towards the left lucrezia and amy are seen entering from the garden lucrezia holds her companions arm and marches with a firm step towards the two men amy suffers herself to be drugged along  lucrezia vicomte miss toomis wants you to tell her all about correggio  amy rather scared oh reallyi  lucrezia and sternlyand michelangelo she is so much interested in art  amy but pleasedont trouble  paul bowing gracefully i shall be delighted and in return i hope miss toomis will tell me all about longfellow  amy brightening oh yes dont you just love evangeline  paul i do and with your help miss toomis i hope i shall learn to love her better  lucrezia to dolphin who has been looking from amy to the vicomte and back again at amy with eyes that betray a certain disquietude you really must come and look at the moon rising over the hills mr dolphin one sees it best from the lower terrace shall we go  dolphin starts and shrinks but its rather cold isnt it i meani think i ought to go and write a letter  lucrezia oh you can do that tomorrow  dolphin but really  lucrezia youve no idea how lovely the moon looks  dolphin but i must  lucrezia lays her hand on his sleeve and tows hint after her crying as she goes the moon the moon paul and amy regard their exit in silence  paul he doesnt look as though he much wanted to go and see the moon  amy perhaps he guesses whats in store for him  paul surprised what you dont mean to say you realised all the time  amy realised what  paul about la belle lucrezia  amy i dont know what you mean all i know is that she means to give mr dolphin a good talking to hes so mercenary it made me quite indignant when she told me about him such a schemer too you know in america we have very definite ideas about honour  paul here too miss toomis  amy not mr dolphin oh dear it made me so sad more sad than angry i can never be grateful enough to signorina grattarol  paul but im still at a loss to know exactly what youre talking about  amy and i am quite bewildered myself would you have believed it of him i thought him such a nice man  paul what has he done  amy its all for my money miss grattarol told me she knows he was just asking me to marry him and i believe i would have said yes but she came in just in the nick of time it seems he only wanted to marry me because im so rich he doesnt care for me at all miss grattarol knows what hes like its awful isnt it oh dear i wouldnt have thought it of him  paul but you must forgive him miss toomis money is a great temptation perhaps if you gave him another chance  amy impossible  paul poor dolphin hes such a nice young fellow  amy i thought so too but hes false  paul dont be too hard on him money probably means too much to him its the fault of his upbringing no one who has not lived among the traditions of our ancient aristocracy can be expected to have that contempt almost that hatred of wealth which is the sign of true nobility if he had been brought up as i was in an old machicolated castle on the loire surrounded by ancestral ghosts imbued with the spirit of the crusaders and preux chevaliers who had inhabited the place in the past if he had learnt to know what noblesse oblige really means believe me miss toomis he could never have done such a thing  amy i should just think he couldnt monsieur de barbazange  paul you have no idea miss toomis how difficult it is for a man of truly noble feelings to get over the fact of your great wealth when i heard that you were the possessor of a hundred million dollars  amy oh im afraid its more than that its two hundred million  paul  of two hundred million dollars then  it only makes it worse i was very melancholy miss toomis for those two hundred million dollars were a barrier which a descendant of crusaders and preux chevaliers could not overleap honour miss toomis honour forbade ah if only that accursed money had not stood in the way when i first saw you oh how i was moved by that vision of beauty and innocencei wanted nothing better than to stand gazing on you for ever but then i heard about those millions dolphin was lucky to have felt no restraints but enough enough he checks a rising tide of emotion give poor dolphin another chance miss toomis at bottom he is a good fellow and he may learn in time to esteem you for your own sake and to forget the dazzling millions  amy never i can only marry a man who is entirely disinterested  paul but cant you see no disinterested man could ever bring himself to ask you how could he prove his disinterestedness no one would believe the purity of his intentions  amy much moved it is for me to judge i know a disinterested man when i see him even in america we can understand honour  paul with a sob in his voice goodbye miss toomis  amy but no i dont want it to be goodbye  paul it must be never shall it be said of a barbazange that he hunted a woman for her money  amy but what does it matter what the world says if i say the opposite  paul you say the opposite thank you thank you but no goodbye  amy stop oh youre forcing me to do a most unwomanly thing youre making me ask you to marry me youre the only disinterested man ive ever met or to judge from what ive seen of the world im ever likely to meet havent you kept away from me in spite of your feelings havent you even tried to make me listen to another mana man not worthy to black your boots oh its so wonderful so noble its like something in a picture play paul i offer myself to you will you take me in spite of my millions  paul falling on his knees and kissing the hem of amys skirt my angel youre right what does it matter what the world says as long as you believe in me amy amie bienaimée ah its too good too too good to be true he rises to his feet and embraces her with an unfeigned enthusiasm  amy paul paul and so this is love isnt it wonderful  paul looking round anxiously you mustnt tell anyone about our engagement my amy they might say unpleasant things in the hotel you know  amy of course i wont talk about it well keep our happiness to ourselves wont we  paul entirely to ourselves and tomorrow well go to paris and arrange about being married  amy yes yes well take the eight oclock train  paul not the eight o clock my darling i have to go to the bank tomorrow to do a little business we must wait till the twelve thirty  amy very well then the twelvethirty oh how happy i am  paul so am i my sweetheart more than i can tell you the sound of a window being opened is heard they look up and see the baroness dressed in a peignoir of the tenderest blue emerging on to the right hand of the three balconies  amy oh my soul i think id better go in goodnight my paul she runs in  simone has that horrid little american girl gone she peers down then reassured she blows a kiss to paul my romeo  paul i come juliet  simone theres a kiss for you  paul throwing kisses with both hands and theres one for you and another and another two hundred million kisses my angel  simone giggling what a lot  paul it is you re quite right two hundred million i come my juliet he darts into the hotel pausing when just inside the door and out of sight of the baroness to mop himself once again with his enormous handkerchief the operation over he advances with a resolute step the baroness stands for a moment on the balcony then seeing dolphin and lucrezia coming in from the left she retires closing the window and drawing the curtains behind her dolphin comes striding in lucrezia follows a little behind looking anxiously up at him  lucrezia please please  dolphin no i won t listen to anything more he walks with an agitated step up and down the stage lucrezia stands with one hand resting on the back of a chair and the other pressed on her heart do you mean to say you deliberately went and told her that i was only after her money oh its too bad too bad its infamous and i hadnt the faintest notion that she had any money besides i dont want money i have quite enough of my own its infamous infamous  lucrezia i know it was a horrible thing to do but i couldnt help it how could i stand by and see you being carried off by that silly little creature  dolphin but i cared for her  lucrezia but not as i cared for you ive got red blood in my veins shes got nothing but milk and water you couldnt have been happy with her i can give you love of a kind she could never dream of what does she know of passion  dolphin nothing i am thankful to say i dont want passion cant you understand that i dont possess it myself and dont like it in others i am a man of sentimental affections with a touch of quiet sensuality i dont want passion i tell you its too violent it frightens me i couldnt possibly live with you youd utterly shatter my peace of mind in a day oh how i wish youd go away  lucrezia but sidney sidney cant you understand what it is to be madly in love with somebody you cant be so cruel  dolphin you didnt think much of my wellbeing when you interfered between miss toomis and me did you youve probably ruined my whole life thats all i really dont see why you should expect me to have any pity for you  lucrezia very well then i shall kill myself she bursts into tears  dolphin oh but i assure you one doesnt kill oneself for things like that he approaches her and pats her on the shoulder come come dont worry about it  lucrezia throws her arms round his neck oh sidney sidney  dolphin freeing himself with surprising energy and promptitude from her embrace no no none of that i beg another moment and we shall be losing our heads personally i think i shall go to bed now i should advise you to do the same miss grattarol youre overwrought we might all be better for a small dose of bromide he goes in  lucrezia looking up and stretching forth her hands sidney dolphin does not look round and disappears through the glass door into the hotel lucrezia covers her face with her hands and sits for a little sobbing silently the nightingale sings on midnight sounds with an infinite melancholy from all the twenty campaniles of the city in the valley from far away comes the spasmodic throbbing of a guitar and the singing of an italian voice highpitched passionate throaty the seconds pass lucrezia rises to her feet and walks slowly into the hotel on the threshold she encounters the vicomte coming out  paul you signorina lucrezia ive escaped for a breath of fresh cool air mightnt we take a turn together lucrezia shakes her head ah well then goodnight youll be glad to hear that miss toomis knows all about correggio now  he inhales a deep breath of air then looking at his dinnerjacket he begins brushing at it with his hand a lamentable figure creeps in from the left it is alberto if he had a tail it would be trailing on the ground between his legs  paul hullo alberto what is it been losing at cards  alberto worse than that  paul creditors foreclosing  alberto much worse  paul father ruined by imprudent speculations  alberto no no no its nothing to do with money  paul oh well then it cant be anything very serious its women i suppose  alberto my mistress refuses to see me i have been beating on her door for hours in vain  paul i wish we all had your luck bertino mine opens her door only too promptly the difficulty is to get out again does yours use such an awful lot of this evilsmelling powder im simply covered with it ugh he brushes his coat again  alberto cant you be serious paul  paul of course i can  about a serious matter but you cant expect me to pull a long face about your mistress can you now do look at things in their right proportions  alberto its no use talking to you youre heartless soulless  paul what you mean my dear alberto is that im relatively speaking bodiless physical passion never goes to my head im always compos mentis you arent thats all  alberto oh you disgust me i think i shall hang myself tonight  paul do it will give us something to talk about at lunch tomorrow  alberto monster he goes into the hotel paul strolls out towards the garden whistling an air from mozart as he goes the window on the left opens and lucrezia steps on to her balcony uncoiled her red hair falls almost to her waist her nightdress is always half slipping off one shoulder or the other like those loosebodied restoration gowns that reveal the tightblown charms of knellers beauties her feet are bare she is a marvellously romantic figure as she stands there leaning on the balustrade and with eyes more sombre than night gazing into the darkness the nightingales the bells the guitar and passionate voice strike up great stars palpitate in the sky the moon has swum imperceptibly to the height of heaven in the garden below flowers are yielding their souls into the air censers invisible it is too much too much large tears roll down lucrezias cheeks and fall with a splash to the ground suddenly but with the noiselessness of a cat alberto appears childishlooking in pink pajamas on the middle of the three balconies he sees lucrezia but she is much too deeply absorbed in thought to have noticed his coming alberto plants his elbows on the rail of the balcony covers his face and begins to sob at first inaudibly then in a gradual quickening crescendo at the seventh sob lucrezia starts and becomes aware of his presence  lucrezia alberto i didnt know have you been there long alberto makes no articulate reply but his sobs keep on growing louder alberto are you unhappy answer me  alberto with difficulty after a pause yes  lucrezia didnt she let you in  alberto no his sobs become convulsive  lucrezia poor boy  alberto lifting up a blubbered face to the moonlight i am so unhappy  lucrezia you cant be more unhappy than i am  alberto oh yes i am its impossible to be unhappier than me  lucrezia but i am more unhappy  alberto you re not oh how can you be so cruel lucrezia he covers his face once more  lucrezia but i only said i was unhappy alberto  alberto yes i know that showed you werent thinking of me nobody loves me i shall hang myself tonight with the cord of my dressinggown  lucrezia no no alberto you mustnt do anything rash  alberto i shall your cruelty has been the last straw  lucrezia im sorry bertino mio but if you only knew how miserable i was feeling i didnt mean to be unsympathetic poor boy im so sorry there dont cry poor darling  alberto oh i knew you wouldnt desert me lucrezia youve always been a mother to me he stretches out his hand and seizes hers which has gone halfway to meet him but the balconies are too far apart to allow him to kiss it he makes an effort and fails he is too short in the body will you let me come onto your balcony lucrezia i want to tell you how grateful i am  lucrezia but you can do that from your own balcony  alberto please please lucrezia you mustnt be cruel to me again i cant bear it  lucrezia well then just for a moment but for no more bertino climbs from one balcony to the other one is a little reminded of the trousered monkeys on the barrel organs arrived he kneels down and kisses lucrezias hand  alberto youve saved me youve given given me a fresh desire to live and a fresh faith in life how can i thank you enough lucrezia darling  lucrezia patting his head there there we are just two unhappy creatures we must try and comfort one another  alberto what a brute i am i never thought of your unhappiness i am so selfish what is it lucrezia  lucrezia i cant tell you bertino but its very painful  alberto poor child poor child his kisses which started at the hand have mounted by this time some way up the arm changing perceptibly in character as they rise at the shoulder they have a warmth which could not have been inferred from the respectful salutes which barely touched the fingers poor darling youve given me consolation now you must let me comfort your unhappiness  lucrezia with an effort i think you ought to go back now bertino  alberto in a minute my darling there there poor lucrezia he puts an arm round her kisses her hair and neck lucrezia leans her bowed head against his chest the sound of footsteps is heard they both look up with scared wideopen eyes  lucrezia we mustnt be seen here bertino what would people think  alberto ill go back  lucrezia theres no time you must come into my room quickly  they slip through the french window but not quickly enough to have escaped the notice of paul returning from his midnight stroll the vicomte stands for a moment looking up at the empty balcony he laughs softly to himself and throwing his cigarette away passes through the glass door into the house all is now silent save for the nightingales and the distant bells the curtain comes down for a moment to indicate the passage of several hours it rises again with the sun lucrezias window opens and she appears on the balcony she stands a moment with one foot over the threshold of the long window in a listening pose then her eyes fall on the better half of a pair of pink pyjamas lying crumpled on the floor like a body bereft of its soul with her bare foot she turns it over a little shudder plucks at her nerves and she shakes her head as though by this symbolic act to shake off something clinging and contaminating then she steps out into the full glory of the early sun stretching out her arms to the radiance she bows her face into her hands crying out loud to herself lucrezia oh why why why the last of these whys is caught by the waiter who has crept forth in shirtsleeves and listslippers duster in hand to clean the tables he looks up at her admiringly passes his tongue over his lips then with a sigh turns to dust the tables    curtain     iii the tillotson banquet    i   young spode was not a snob he was too intelligent for that too fundamentally decent not a snob but all the same he could not help feeling very well pleased at the thought that he was dining alone and intimately with lord badgery it was a definite event in his life a step forward he felt towards that final success social material and literary which he had come to london with the fixed intention of making the conquest and capture of badgery was an almost essential strategical move in the campaign  edmund fortyseventh baron badgery was a lineal descendant of that edmund surnamed le blayreau who landed on english soil in the train of william the conqueror ennobled by william rufus the badgerys had been one of the very few baronial families to survive the wars of the roses and all the other changes and chances of english history they were a sensible and philoprogenitive race no badgery had ever fought in any war no badgery had ever engaged in any kind of politics they had been content to live and quietly to propagate their species in a huge machicolated norman castle surrounded by a triple moat only sallying forth to cultivate their property and to collect their rents in the eighteenth century when life had become relatively secure the badgerys began to venture forth into civilised society from boorish squires they blossomed into grands seigneurs patrons of the arts virtuosi their property was large they were rich and with the growth of industrialism their riches also grew villages on their estate turned into manufacturing towns unsuspected coal was discovered beneath the surface of their barren moorlands by the middle of the nineteenth century the badgerys were among the richest of english noble families the fortyseventh baron disposed of an income of at least two hundred thousand pounds a year following the great badgery tradition he had refused to have anything to do with politics or war he occupied himself by collecting pictures he took an interest in theatrical productions he was the friend and patron of men of letters of painters and musician a personage in a word of considerable consequence in that particular world in which young spode had elected to make his success  spode had only recently left the university simon gollamy the editor of the worlds review the best of all possible worlds had got to know himhe was always on the look out for youthful talenthad seen possibilities in the young man and appointed him art critic of his paper gollamy liked to have young and teachable people about him the possession of disciples flattered his vanity and he found it easier moreover to run his paper with docile collaborators than with men grown obstinate and casehardened with age spode had not done badly at his new job at any rate his articles had been intelligent enough to arouse the interest of lord badgery it was ultimately to them that he owed the honour of sitting to night in the diningroom of badgery house  fortified by several varieties of wine and a glass of aged brandy spode felt more confident and at ease than he had done the whole evening badgery was rather a disquieting host he had an alarming habit of changing the subject of any conversation that had lasted for more than two minutes spode had found it for example horribly mortifying when his host cutting across what was he prided himself a particularly subtle and illuminating disquisition on baroque art had turned a wandering eye about the room and asked him abruptly whether he liked parrots he had flushed and glanced suspiciously towards him fancying that the man was trying to be offensive but no badgerys white fleshy hanoverian face wore an expression of perfect good faith there was no malice in his small greenish eyes he evidently did genuinely want to know if spode liked parrots the young man swallowed his irritation and replied that he did badgery then told a good story about parrots spode was on the point of capping it with a better story when his host began to talk about beethoven and so the game went on spode cut his conversation to suit his hosts requirements in the course of ten minutes he had made a more or less witty epigram on benvenuto cellini queen victoria sport god stephen phillips and moorish architecture lord badgery thought him the most charming young man and so intelligent  if youve quite finished your coffee he said rising to his feet as he spoke well go and look at the pictures  spode jumped up with alacrity and only then realised that he had drunk just ever so little too much he would have to be careful talk deliberately plant his feet consciously one after the other  this house is quite cluttered up with pictures lord badgery complained i had a whole wagonload taken away to the country last week but there are still far too many my ancestors would have their portraits painted by romney such a shocking artist dont you think why couldnt they have chosen gainsborough or even reynolds ive had all the romneys hung in the servants hall now its such a comfort to know that one can never possibly see them again i suppose you know all about the ancient hittites  well the young man replied with befitting modesty  look at that then he indicated a large stone head which stood in a case near the diningroom door its not greek or egyptian or persian or anything else so if it isnt ancient hittite i dont know what it is and that reminds me of that story about lord george sanger the circus king and without giving spode time to examine the hittite relic he led the way up the huge staircase pausing every now and then in his anecdote to point out some new object of curiosity or beauty  i suppose you know deburaus pantomimes spode rapped out as soon as the story was over he was in an itch to let out his information about deburau badgery had given him a perfect opening with his ridiculous sanger what a perfect man isnt he he used to  this is my main gallery said lord badgery throwing open one leaf of a tall folding door i must apologise for it it looks like a rollerskating rink he fumbled with the electric switches and there was suddenly lightlight that revealed an enormous gallery duly receding into distance according to all the laws of perspective i dare say youve heard of my poor father lord badgery continued a little insane you know sort of mechanical genius with a screw loose he used to have a toy railway in this room no end of fun he had crawling about the floor after his trains and all the pictures were stacked in the cellars i cant tell you what they were like when i found them mushrooms growing out of the botticellis now im rather proud of this poussin he painted it for scarron  exquisite spode exclaimed making with his hand a gesture as though he were modelling a pure form in the air how splendid the onrush of those trees and leaning figures is and the way they re caught up as it were and stemmed by that single godlike form opposing them with his contrary movement and the draperies  but lord badgery had moved on and was standing in front of a little fifteenthcentury virgin of carved wood  school of rheims he explained  they did the gallery at high speed badgery never permitted his guest to halt for more than forty seconds before any work of art spode would have liked to spend a few moments of recollection and tranquillity in front of some of these lovely things but it was not permitted  the gallery done they passed into a little room leading out of it at the sight of what the lights revealed spode gasped  its like something out of balzac he exclaimed un de ces salons dorés où se déploie un luxe insolent you know  my nineteenthcentury chamber badgery explained the best thing of its kind i flatter myself outside the state apartments at windsor  spode tiptoed round the room peering with astonishment at all the objects in glass in gilded bronze in china in leathers in embroidered and painted silk in beads in wax objects of the most fantastic shapes and colours all the queer products of a decadent tradition with which the room was crowded there were paintings on the wallsa martin a wilkie an early landseer several ettys a big haydon a slight pretty watercolour of a girl by wainewright the pupil of blake and arsenic poisoner a score of others but the picture which arrested spodes attention was a medium sized canvas representing troilus riding into troy among the flowers and plaudits of an admiring crowd and oblivious you could see from his expression of everything but the eyes of cressida who looked down at him from a window with pandarus smiling over her shoulder  what an absurd and enchanting picture spode exclaimed  ah youve spotted my troilus lord badgery was pleased  what bright harmonious colours like ettys only stronger not so obviously pretty and theres an energy about it that reminds one of haydon only haydon could never have done anything so impeccable in taste who is it by spode turned to his host inquiringly  you were right in detecting haydon lord badgery answered its by his pupil tillotson i wish i could get hold of more of his work but nobody seems to know anything about him and he seems to have done so little  this time it was the younger man who interrupted  tillotson tillotson he put his hand to his forehead a frown incongruously distorted his round floridly curved face no  yes i have it he looked up triumphantly with serene and childish brows tillotson walter tillotsonthe mans still alive  badgery smiled this picture was painted in 1846 you know  well thats all right say he was born in 1820 painted his masterpiece when he was twentysix and its 1913 now thats to say hes only ninetythree not as old as titian yet  but hes not been heard of since 1860 lord badgery protested  precisely your mention of his name reminded me of the discovery i made the other day when i was looking through the obituary notices in the archives of the worlds reviewone has to bring them up to date every year or so for fear of being caught napping if one of these t old birds chooses to shuffle off suddenly well there among themi remember my astonishment at the timethere i found walter tillotsons biography pretty full to 1860 and then a blank except for a pencil note in the early nineteen hundreds to the effect that he had returned from the east the obituary has never been used or added to i draw the obvious conclusion the old chap isnt dead yet hes just been overlooked somehow  but this is extraordinary lord badgery exclaimed you must find him spodeyou must find him ill commission him to paint frescoes round this room its just what ive always vainly longed for a real nineteenthcentury artist to decorate this place for me oh we must find him at onceat once  lord badgery strode up and down in a state of great excitement  i can see how this room could be made quite perfect he went on wed clear away all these cases and have the whole of that wall filled by a heroic fresco of hector and andromache or distraining for rent or fanny kemble as belvidera in venice preserved anything like that provided its in the grand manner of the thirties and forties and here id have a landscape with lovely receding perspectives or else something architectural and grand in the style of belshazzars feast then well have this adam fireplace taken down and replaced by something maurogothic and on these walls ill have mirrors or no let me see  he sank into meditative silence from which he finally roused himself to shout  the old man the old man spode we must find this astonishing old creature and dont breathe a word to anybody tillotson shall be our secret oh its too perfect its incredible think of the frescoes  lord badgerys face had become positively animated he had talked of a single subject for nearly a quarter of an hour     ii   three weeks later lord badgery was aroused from his usual afterluncheon somnolence by the arrival of a telegram the message was a short one foundspode a look of pleasure and intelligence made human lord badgerys clayey face of surfeit no answer he said the footman padded away on noiseless feet  lord badgery closed his eyes and began to contemplate found what a room he would have there would be nothing like it in the world the frescoes the fireplace the mirrors the ceiling and a small shrivelled old man clambering about the scaffolding agile and quick like one of those whiskered little monkeys at the zoo painting away painting away fanny kemble as belvidera hector and andromache or why not the duke of clarence in the butt the duke of malmsey the butt of clarence  lord badgery was asleep  spode did not lag long behind his telegram he was at badgery house by six oclock his lordship was in the nineteenthcentury chamber engaged in clearing away with his own hands the bricàbrac spode found him looking hot and out of breath  ah there you are said lord badgery you see me already preparing for the great mans coming now you must tell me all about him  hes older even than i thought said spode hes ninetyseven this year born in 1816 incredible isnt it there im beginning at the wrong end  begin where you like said badgery genially  i wont tell you all the incidents of the hunt youve no idea what a job i had to run him to earth it was like a sherlock holmes story immensely elaborate too elaborate i shall write a book about it some day at any rate i found him at last  where  in a sort of respectable slum in holloway older and poorer and lonelier than you could have believed possible i found out how it was he came to be forgotten how he came to drop out of life in the way he did he took it into his head somewhere about the sixties to go to palestine to get local colour for his religious picturesscapegoats and things you know well he went to jerusalem and then on to mount lebanon and on and on and then somewhere in the middle of asia minor he got stuck he got stuck for about forty years  but what did he do all that time  oh he painted and started a mission and converted three turks and taught the local pashas the rudiments of english latin and perspective and god knows what else then in about 1904 it seems to have occurred to him that he was getting rather old and had been away from home for rather a long time so he made his way back to england only to find that everyone he had known was dead that the dealers had never heard of him and wouldnt buy his pictures that he was simply a ridiculous old figure of fun so he got a job as a drawingmaster in a girls school in holloway and there hes been ever since growing older and older and feebler and feebler and blinder and deafer and generally more gaga until finally the school has given him the sack he had about ten pounds in the world when i found him he lives in a kind of black hole in a basement full of beetles when his ten pounds are spent i suppose hell just quietly die there  badgery held up a white hand no more no more i find literature quite depressing enough i insist that life at least shall be a little gayer did you tell him i wanted him to paint my room  but he cant paint hes too blind and palsied  cant paint badgery exclaimed in horror then whats the good of the old creature  well if you put it like that spode began  i shall never have my frescoes ring the bell will you  spode rang  what right has tillotson to go on existing if he cant paint went on lord badgery petulantly after all that was his only justification for occupying a place in the sun  he doesnt have much sun in his basement  the footman appeared at the door  get someone to put all these things back in their places lord badgery commanded indicating with a wave of the hand the ravaged cases the confusion of glass and china with which he had littered the floor the pictures unhooked well go to the library spode its more comfortable there  he led the way through the long gallery and down the stairs  im sorry old tillotson has been such a disappointment said spode sympathetically  let us talk about something else he ceases to interest me  but dont you think we ought to do something about him hes only got ten pounds between him and the workhouse and if youd seen the blackbeetles in his basement  enough enough ill do everything you think fitting  i thought we might get up a subscription amongst lovers of the arts  there arent any said badgery  no but there are plenty of people who will subscribe out of snobbism  not unless you give them something for their money  thats true i hadnt thought of that spode was silent for a moment we might have a dinner in his honour the great tillotson banquet doyen of the british art a link with the past cant you see it in the papers id make a stunt of it in the worlds review that ought to bring in the snobs  and well invite a lot of artists and criticsall the ones who cant stand one another it will be fun to see them squabbling badgery laughed then his face darkened once again still he added itll be a very poor second best to my frescoes youll stay to dinner of course  well since you suggest it thanks very much     iii   the tillotson banquet was fixed to take place about three weeks later spode who had charge of the arrangements proved himself an excellent organiser he secured the big banquetingroom at the café bomba and was successful in bullying and cajoling the manager into giving fifty persons dinner at twelve shillings a head including wine he sent out invitations and collected subscriptions he wrote an article on tillotson in the worlds reviewone of those charming witty articles couched in the tone of amused patronage and contempt with which one speaks of the great men of 1840 nor did he neglect tillotson himself he used to go to holloway almost every day to listen to the old mans endless stories about asia minor and the great exhibition of 51 and benjamin robert haydon he was sincerely sorry for this relic of another age  mr tillotsons room was about ten feet below the level of the soil of south holloway a little grey light percolated through the area bars forced a difficult passage through panes opaque with dirt and spent itself like a drop of milk that falls into an inkpot among the inveterate shadows of the dungeon the place was haunted by the spur smell of damp plaster and of woodwork that has begun to moulder secretly at the heart a little miscellaneous furniture including a bed a washstand and chest of drawers a table and one or two chairs lurked in the obscure corners of the den or ventured furtively out into the open hither spode now came almost every day bringing the old man news of the progress of the banquet scheme every day he found mr tillotson sitting in the same place under the window bathing as it were in his tiny puddle of light the oldest man that ever wore grey hairs spode reflected as he looked at him only there were very few hairs left on that bald unpolished head at the sound of the visitors knock mr tillotson would turn in his chair stare in the direction of the door with blinking uncertain eyes he was always full of apologies for being so slow in recognising who was there  no discourtesy meant he would say after asking its not as if i had forgotten who you were only its so dark and my sight isnt what it was  after that he never failed to give a little laugh and pointing out of the window at the area railings would say  ah this is the plate for somebody with good sight its the place for looking at ankles its the grand stand  it was the day before the great event spode came as usual and mr tillotson punctually made his little joke about the ankles and spode as punctually laughed  well mr tillotson he said after the reverberation of the joke had died away tomorrow you make your reentry into the world of art and fashion youll find some changes  ive always had such extraordinary luck said mr tillotson and spode could see by his expression that he genuinely believed it that he had forgotten the black hole and the blackbeetles and the almost exhausted ten pounds that stood between him and the workhouse what an amazing piece of good fortune for instance that you should have found me just when you did now this dinner will bring me back to my place in the world i shall have money and in a little whilewho knowsi shall be able to see well enough to paint again i believe my eyes are getting better you know ah the future is very rosy  mr tillotson looked up his face puckered into a smile and nodded his head in affirmation of his words  you believe in the life to come said spode and immediately flushed for shame at the cruelty of the words  but mr tillotson was in far too cheerful a mood to have caught their significance  life to come he repeated no i dont believe in any of that stuff not since 1859 the origin of species changed my views you know no life to come for me thank you you dont remember the excitement of course you re very young mr spode  well im not so old as i was spode replied you know how middleaged one is as a schoolboy and undergraduate now im old enough to know im young  spode was about to develop this little paradox further but he noticed that mr tillotson had not been listening he made a note of the gambit for use in companies that were more appreciative of the subtleties  you were talking about the origin of species he said  was i said mr tillotson waking from reverie  about its effect on your faith mr tillotson  to be sure yes it shattered my faith but i remember a fine thing by the poet laureate something about there being more faith in honest doubt believe me than in all the  all the  i forget exactly what but you see the train of thought oh it was a bad time for religion i am glad my master haydon never lived to see it he was a man of fervour i remember him pacing up and down his studio in lisson grove singing and shouting and praying all at once it used almost to frighten me oh but he was a wonderful man a great man take him for all in all we shall not look upon his like again as usual the bard is right but it was all very long ago before your time mr spode  well im not as old as i was said spode in the hope of having his paradox appreciated this time but mr tillotson went on without noticing the interruption  its a very very long time and yet when i look back on it it all seems but a day or two ago strange that each day should seem so long and that many days added together should be less than an hour how clearly i can see old haydon pacing up and down much more clearly indeed than i see you mr spode the eyes of memory don t grow dim but my sight is improving i assure you its improving daily i shall soon be able to see those ankles he laughed like a cracked bellone of those little old bells spode fancied that ring with much rattling of wires in the faroff servants quarters of ancient houses and very soon mr tillotson went on i shall be painting again ah mr spode my luck is extraordinary i believe in it i trust in it and after all what is luck simply another name for providence in spite of the origin of species and the rest of it how right the laureate was when he said that there was more faith in honest doubt believe me than in all the  er the  er  well you know i regard you mr spode as the emissary of providence your coming marked a turningpoint in my life and the beginning for me of happier days do you know one of the first things i shall do when my fortunes are restored will be to buy a hedgehog  a hedgehog mr tillotson  for the blackbeetles theres nothing like a hedgehog for beetles it will eat blackbeetles till its sick till it dies of surfeit that reminds me of the time when i told my poor great master haydonin joke of coursethat he ought to send in a cartoon of king john dying of a surfeit of lampreys for the frescoes in the new houses of parliament as i told him its a most notable event in the annals of british libertythe providential and exemplary removal of a tyrant  mr tillotson laughed againthe little bell in the deserted house a ghostly hand pulling the cord in the drawingroom and phantom footmen responding to the thin flawed note  i remember he laughed laughed like a bull in his old grand manner but oh it was a terrible blow when they rejected his design a terrible blow it was the first and fundamental cause of his suicide  mr tillotson paused there was a long silence spode felt strangely moved he hardly knew why in the presence of this man so frail so ancient in body three parts dead in the spirit so full of life and hopeful patience he felt ashamed what was the use of his own youth and cleverness he saw himself suddenly as a boy with a rattle scaring birds rattling his noisy cleverness waving his arms in ceaseless and futile activity never resting in his efforts to scare away the birds that were always trying to settle in his mind and what birds widewinged and beautiful all those serene thoughts and faiths and emotions that only visit minds that have humbled themselves to quiet those gracious visitants he was for ever using all his energies to drive away but this old man with his hedgehogs and his honest doubts and all the rest of ithis mind was like a field made beautiful by the free coming and going the unafraid alightings of a multitude of white brightwinged creatures he felt ashamed but then was it possible to alter ones life wasnt it a little absurd to risk a conversion spode shrugged his shoulders  ill get you a hedgehog at once he said theyre sure to have some at whiteleys  before he left that evening spode made an alarming discovery mr tillotson did not possess a dresssuit it was hopeless to think of getting one made at this short notice and besides what an unnecessary expense  we shall have to borrow a suit mr tillotson i ought to have thought of that before  dear me dear me mr tillotson was a little chagrined by this unlucky discovery borrow a suit  spode hurried away for counsel to badgery house lord badgery surprisingly rose to the occasion ask boreham to come and see me he told the footman who answered his ring  boreham was one of those immemorial butlers who linger on generation after generation in the houses of the great he was over eighty now bent dried up shrivelled with age  all old men are about the same size said lord badgery it was a comforting theory ah here he is have you got a spare suit of evening clothes boreham  i have an old suit my lord that i stopped wearing in let me see was it nineteen seven or eight  thats the very thing i should be most grateful boreham if you could lend it to me for mr spode here for a day  the old man went out and soon reappeared carrying over his arm a very old black suit he held up the coat and trousers for inspection in the light of day they were deplorable  youve no idea sir said boreham deprecatingly to spode youve no idea how easy things get stained with grease and gravy and what not however careful you are sirhowever careful  i should imagine so spode was sympathetic  however careful sir  but in artificial light theyll look all right  perfectly all right lord badgery repeated thank you boreham you shall have them back on thursday  you re welcome my lord im sure and the old man bowed and disappeared  on the afternoon of the great day spode carried up to holloway a parcel containing borehams retired eveningsuit and all the necessary appurtenances in the way of shirts and collars owing to the darkness and his own feeble sight mr tillotson was happily unaware of the defects in the suit he was in a state of extreme nervous agitation it was with some difficulty that spode could prevent him although it was only three oclock from starting his toilet on the spot  take it easy mr tillotson take it easy we neednt start till halfpast seven you know  spode left an hour later and as soon as he was safely out of the room mr tillotson began to prepare himself for the banquet he lighted the gas and a couple of candles and blinking myopically at the image that fronted him in the tiny lookingglass that stood on his chest of drawers he set to work with all the ardour of a young girl preparing for her first ball at six oclock when the last touches had been given he was not unsatisfied  he marched up and down his cellar humming to himself the gay song which had been so popular in his middle years       oh oh anna maria jones      queen of the tambourine the cymbals and the bones  spode arrived an hour later in lord badgerys second rollsroyce opening the door of the old mans dungeon he stood for a moment wideeyed with astonishment on the threshold mr tillotson was standing by the empty grate one elbow resting on the mantelpiece one leg crossed over the other in a jaunty and gentlemanly attitude the effect of the candlelight shining on his face was to deepen every line and wrinkle with intense black shadow he looked immeasurably old it was a noble and pathetic head on the other hand borehams outworn eveningsuit was simply buffoonish the coat was too long in the sleeves and the tail the trousers bagged in elephantine creases about his ankles some of the greasespots were visible even in candlelight the white tie over which mr tillotson had taken infinite pains and which he believed in his purblindness to be perfect was fantastically lopsided he had buttoned up his waistcoat in such a fashion that one button was widowed of its hole and one hole of its button across his shirt front lay the broad green ribbon of some unknown order  queen of the tambourine the cymbals and the bones mr tillotson concluded in a gnatlike voice before welcoming his visitor  well spode here you are im dressed already you see the suit i flatter myself fits very well almost as though it had been made for me i am all gratitude to the gentleman who was kind enough to lend it to me i shall take the greatest care of it its a dangerous thing to lend clothes for loan oft loseth both itself and friend the bard is always right  just one thing said spode a touch to your waistcoat he unbuttoned the dissipated garment and did it up again more symmetrically  mr tillotson was a little piqued at being found so absurdly in the wrong  thanks thanks he said protestingly trying to edge away from his valet its all right you know i can do it myself foolish oversight i flatter myself the suit fits very well  and perhaps the tie might spode began tentatively but the old man would not hear of it  no no the ties all right i can tie a tie mr spode the ties all right leave it as it is i beg  i like your order  mr tillotson looked down complacently at his shirt front ah youve noticed my order its a long time since i wore that it was given me by the grand porte you know for services rendered in the russoturkish war its the order of chastity the second class they only give the first class to crowned heads you knowbrowned heads and ambassadors and only pashas of the highest rank get the second mines the second they only give the first class to crowned heads  of course of course said spode  do you think i look all right mr spode mr tillotson asked a little anxiously  splendid mr tillotsonsplendid the orders magnificent  the old mans face brightened once more i flatter myself he said that this borrowed suit fits me very well but i dont like borrowing clothes for loan oft loseth both itself and friend you know and the bard is always right  ugh theres one of those horrible beetles spode exclaimed  mr tillotson bent down and stared at the floor i see it he said and stamped on a small piece of coal which crunched to powder under his foot i shall certainly buy a hedgehog  it was time for them to start a crowd of little boys and girls had collected round lord badgerys enormous car the chauffeur who felt that honour and dignity were at stake pretended not to notice the children but sat gazing like a statue into eternity at the sight of spode and mr tillotson emerging from the house a yell of mingled awe and derision went up it subsided to an astonished silence as they climbed into the car bombas spode directed the rollsroyce gave a faintly stertorous sigh and began to move the children yelled again and ran along beside the car waving their arms in a frenzy of excitement it was then that mr tillotson with an incomparably noble gesture leaned forward and tossed among the seething crowd of urchins his three last coppers     iv   in bombas big room the company was assembling the long giltedged mirrors reflected a singular collection of people middleaged academicians shot suspicious glances at youths whom they suspected only too correctly of being iconoclasts organisers of postimpressionist exhibitions rival art critics brought suddenly face to face quivered with restrained hatred mrs nobes mrs cayman and mrs mandragore those indefatigable hunters of artistic big game came on one another all unawares in this wellstored menagerie where each had expected to hunt alone and were filled with rage through this crowd of mutually repellent vanities lord badgery moved with a suavity that seemed unconscious of all the feuds and hatreds he was enjoying himself immensely behind the heavy waxen mask of his face ambushed behind the hanoverian nose the little lustreless pigs eyes the pale thick lips there lurked a small devil of happy malice that rocked with laughter  so nice of you to have come mrs mandragore to do honour to englands artistic past and im so glad to see youve brought dear mrs cayman and is that mrs nobes too so it is i hadnt noticed her before how delightful i knew we could depend on your love of art  and he hurried away to seize the opportunity of introducing that eminent sculptor sir herbert herne to the bright young critic who had called him in the public prints a monumental mason  a moment later the maître dhôtel came to the door of the gilded saloon and announced loudly and impressively mr walter tillotson guided from behind by young spode mr tillotson came into the room slowly and hesitatingly in the glare of the lights his eyelids beat heavily painfully like the wings of an imprisoned moth over his filmy eyes once inside the door he halted and drew himself up with a conscious assumption of dignity lord badgery hurried forward and seized his hand  welcome mr tillotsonwelcome in the name of english art  mr tillotson inclined his head in silence he was too full of emotion to be able to reply  i should like to introduce you to a few of your younger colleagues who have assembled here to do you honour  lord badgery presented everyone in the room to the old painter who bowed shook hands made little noises in his throat but still found himself unable to speak mrs nobes mrs cayman and mrs mandragore all said charming things  dinner was served the party took their places lord badgery sat at the head of the table with mr tillotson on his right hand and sir herbert herne on his left confronted with bombas succulent cooking and bombas wines mr tillotson ate and drank a good deal he had the appetite of one who has lived on greens and potatoes for ten years among the blackbeetles after the second glass of wine he began to talk suddenly and in a flood as though a sluice had been pulled up  in asia minor he began it is the custom when one goes to dinner to hiccough as a sign of appreciative fullness eructavit cor meum as the psalmist has it he was an oriental himself  spode had arranged to sit next to mrs cayman he had designs upon her she was an impossible woman of course but rich and useful he wanted to bamboozle her into buying some of his young friends pictures  in a cellar mrs cayman was saying with blackbeetles oh how dreadful poor old man and hes ninetyseven didnt you say isnt that shocking i only hope the subscription will be a large one of course one wishes one could have given more oneself but then you know one has so many expenses and things are so difficult now  i know i know said spode with feeling  its all because of labour mrs cayman explained of course i should simply love to have him in to dinner sometimes but then i feel hes really too old too farouche and gâteux it would not be doing a kindness to him would it and so you are working with mr gollamy now what a charming man so talented such conversation  eructavit cor meum said mr tillotson for the third time lord badgery tried to head him off the subject of turkish etiquette but in vain  by halfpast nine a kinder vinolent atmosphere had put to sleep the hatreds and suspicions of before dinner sir herbert herne had discovered that the young cubist sitting next him was not insane and actually knew a surprising amount about the old masters for their part these young men had realised that their elders were not at all malignant they were just very stupid and pathetic it was only in the bosoms of mrs nobes mrs cayman and mrs mandragore that hatred still reigned undiminished being ladies and oldfashioned they had drunk almost no wine  the moment for speechmaking arrived lord badgery rose to his feet said what was expected of him and called upon sir herbert to propose the toast of the evening sir herbert coughed smiled and began in the course of a speech that lasted twenty minutes he told anecdotes of mr gladstone lord leighton sir almo tadema and the late bishop of bombay he made three puns he quoted shakespeare and whittier he was playful he was eloquent he was grave at the end of his harangue sir herbert handed to mr tillotson a silk purse containing fiftyeight pounds ten shillings the total amount of the subscription the old mans health was drunk with acclamation  mr tillotson rose with difficulty to his feet the dry snakelike skin of his face was flushed his tie was more crooked than ever the green ribbon of the order of chastity of the second class had somehow climbed tip his crumpled and maculate shirt front  my lords ladies and gentlemen he began in a choking voice and then broke down completely it was a very painful and pathetic spectacle a feeling of intense discomfort afflicted the minds of all who looked upon that trembling relic of a man as he stood there weeping and stammering it was as though a breath of the wind of death had blown suddenly through the room lifting the vapours of wine and tobaccosmoke quenching the laughter and the candle flames eyes floated uneasily not knowing where to look lord badgery with great presence of mind offered the old man a glass of wine mr tillotson began to recover the guests heard him murmur a few disconnected words  this great honour  overwhelmed with kindness  this magnificent banquet  not used to it  in asia minor  eructuvit cor meum  at this point lord badgery plucked sharply at one of his long coat tails mr tillotson paused took another sip of wine and then went on with a newly won coherence and energy  the life of the artist is a hard one his work is unlike other mens work which may be done mechanically by rote and almost as it were in sleep it demands from him a constant expense of spirit he gives continually of his best life and in return he receives much joy it is true much fame it may bebut of material blessings very few it is eighty years since first i devoted my life to the service of art eighty years and almost every one of those years has brought me fresh and painful proof of what i have been saying the artists life is a hard one  this unexpected deviation into sense increased the general feeling of discomfort it became necessary to take the old man seriously to regard him as a human being up till then he had been no more than an object of curiosity a mummy in an absurd suit of eveningclothes with a green ribbon across the shirt front people could not help wishing that they had subscribed a little more fiftyeight pounds ten it wasnt enormous but happily for the peace of mind of the company mr tillotson paused again took another sip of wine and began to live up to his proper character by talking absurdly  when i consider the life of that great man benjamin robert haydon one of the greatest men england has ever produced the audience heaved a sigh of relief this was all as it should be there was a burst of loud bravoing and clapping mr tillotson turned his dim eyes round the room and smiled gratefully at the misty figures he beheld that great man benjamin robert haydon he continued whom i am proud to call my master and who it rejoices my heart to see still lives in your memory and esteem that great man one of the greatest that england has ever produced led a life so deplorable that i cannot think of it without a tear  and with infinite repetitions and divagations mr tillotson related the history of br haydon his imprisonments for debt his battle with the academy his triumphs his failures his despair his suicide halfpast ten struck mr tillotson was declaiming against the stupid and prejudiced judges who had rejected haydons designs for the decoration of the new houses of parliament in favour of the paltriest german scribblings  that great man one of the greatest england has ever produced that great benjamin robert haydon whom i am proud to call my master and who it rejoices me to see still lives on in your memory and esteemat that affront his great heart burst it was the unkindest cut of all he who had worked all his life for the recognition of the artist by the state he who had petitioned every prime minister including the duke of wellington for thirty years begging them to employ artists to decorate public buildings he to whom the scheme for decorating the houses of parliament was undeniably due mr tillotson lost a grip on his syntax and began a new sentence it was the unkindest cut of all it was the last straw the artists life is a hard one  at eleven mr tillotson was talking about the preraphaelites at a quarter past he had begun to tell the story of br haydon all over again at twentyfive minutes to twelve he collapsed quite speechless into his chair most of the guests had already gone away the few who remained made haste to depart lord badgery led the old man to the door and packed him into the second rollsroyce the tillotson banquet was over it had been a pleasant evening but a little too long  spode walked back to his rooms in bloomsbury whistling as he went the arc lamps of oxford street reflected in the polished surface of the road canals of dark bronze he would have to bring that into an article some time the cayman woman had been very successfully nobbled voi che sapete he whistledsomewhat out of tune but he could not hear that  when mr tillotsons landlady came in to call him on the following morning she found the old man lying fully dressed on his bed he looked very ill and very very old borehams dresssuit was in a terrible state and the green ribbon of the order of chastity was ruined mr tillotson lay very still but he was not asleep hearing the sound of footsteps he opened his eyes a little and faintly groaned his landlady looked down at him menacingly  disgusting she said disgusting i call it at your age  mr tillotson groaned again making a great effort he drew out of his trouser pocket a large silk purse opened it and extracted a sovereign  the artists life is a hard one mrs green he said handing her the coin would you mind sending for the doctor i dont feel very well and oh what shall i do about these clothes what shall i say to the gentleman who was kind enough to lend them to me loan oft loseth both itself and friend the bard is always right     iv green tunnels   in the italian gardens of the thirteenth century mr buzzacott interrupted himself to take another helping of the risotto which was being offered him excellent risotto this he observed nobody who was not born in milan can make it properly so they say  so they say mr topes repeated in his sad apologetic voice and helped himself in his turn  personally said mrs topes with decision i find all italian cooking abominable i dont like the oilespecially hot no thank you she recoiled from the proffered dish  after the first mouthful mr buzzacott put down his fork in the italian gardens of the thirteenth century he began again making with his long pale hand a curved and flowery gesture that ended with a clutch at his beard a frequent and most felicitous use was made of green tunnels  green tunnels barbara woke up suddenly from her tranced silence green tunnels  yes my dear said her father green tunnels arched alleys covered with vines or other creeping plants their length was often very considerable  but barbara had once more ceased to pay attention to what he was saying green tunnelsthe word had floated down to her through profound depths of reverie across great spaces of abstraction startling her like the sound of a strangevoiced bell green tunnelswhat a wonderful idea she would not listen to her father explaining the phrase into dullness he made everything dull an inverted alchemist turning gold into lead she pictured caverns in a great aquarium long vistas between rocks and scarcely swaying weeds and pale discoloured corals endless dim green corridors with huge lazy fishes loitering aimlessly along them greenfaced monsters with goggling eyes and mouths that slowly opened and shut green tunnels  i have seen them illustrated in illuminated manuscripts of the period mr buzzacott went on once more he clutched his pointed brown beardclutched and combed it with his long fingers  mr topes looked up the glasses of his round owlish spectacles flashed as he moved his head i know what you mean he said  i have a very good mind to have one planted in my garden here  it will take a long time to grow said mr topes in this sand so close to the sea you will only be able to plant vines and they come up very slowly very slowly indeed he shook his head and the points of light danced wildly in his spectacles his voice drooped hopelessly his grey moustache drooped his whole person drooped then suddenly he pulled himself up a shy apologetic smile appeared on his face he wriggled uncomfortably then with a final rapid shake of the head he gave vent to a quotation       but at my back i always hear      times winged chariot hurrying near  he spoke deliberately and his voice trembled a little he always found it painfully difficult to say something choice and out of the ordinary and yet what a wealth of remembered phrase what apt new coinages were always surging through his mind  they dont grow so slowly as all that said mr buzzacott confidently he was only just over fifty and looked a handsome thirtyfive he gave himself at least another forty years indeed he had not yet begun to contemplate the possibility of ever concluding  miss barbara will enjoy it perhapsyour green tunnel mr topes sighed and looked across the table at his hosts daughter  barbara was sitting with her elbows on the table her chin in her hands staring in front of her the sound of her own name reached her faintly she turned her head in mr topess direction and found herself confronted by the glitter of his round convex spectacles at the end of the green tunnelshe stared at the shining circleshung the eyes of a goggling fish they approached floating closer and closer along the dim submarine corridor  confronted by this fixed regard mr topes looked away what thoughtful eyes he couldnt remember ever to have seen eyes so full of thought there were certain madonnas of montagna he reflected very like hen mild little blonde madonnas with slightly snub noses and very very young but he was old it would be many years in spite of buzzacott before the vines grew up into a green tunnel he took a sip of wine then mechanically sucked his drooping grey moustache  arthur  at the sound of his wifes voice mr topes started raised his napkin to his mouth mrs topes did not permit the sucking of moustaches it was only in moments of absentmindedness that he ever offended now  the marchese prampolini is coming here to take coffee said mr buzzacott suddenly i almost forgot to tell you  one of these italian marquises i suppose said mrs topes who was no snob except in england she raised her chin with a little jerk  mr buzzacott executed an upward curve of the hand in her direction i assure you mrs topes he belongs to a very old and distinguished family they are genoese in origin you remember their palace barbara built by alessi  barbara looked up oh yes she said vaguely alessi i know alessi aleppowhere a malignant and a turbaned turk and a turbaned that had always seemed to her very funny  several of his ancestors mr buzzacott went on distinguished themselves as viceroys of corsica they did good work in the suppression of rebellion strange isnt ithe turned parenthetically to mr topesthe way in which sympathy is always on the side of rebels what a fuss people made of corsica that ridiculous book of gregorovius for example and the irish and the poles and all the rest of them it always seems to me very superfluous and absurd  isnt it perhaps a little natural mr topes began timorously and tentatively but his host went on without listening  the present marquis he said is the head of the local fascisti they have done no end of good work in this district in the way of preserving law and order and keeping the lower classes in their place  ah the fascisti mrs topes repeated approvingly one would like to see something of the kind in england what with all these strikes  he has asked me for a subscription to the funds of the organisation i shall give him one of course  of course mrs topes nodded my nephew the one who was a major during the war volunteered in the last coal strike he was sorry i know that it didnt come to a fight aunt annie he said to me when i saw him last if there had been a fight we should have knocked them out completelycompletely  in aleppo the fascisti malignant and turbaned were fighting under the palm trees werent they palm trees those tufted green plumes  what no ice today niente gelato inquired mr buzzacott as the maid put down the compote of peaches on the table  concetta apologised the icemaking machine in the village had broken down there would be no ice till tomorrow  too bad said mr buzzacott troppo male concetta  under the palm trees barbara saw them they pranced about fighting they were mounted on big dogs and in the trees were enormous manycoloured birds  goodness me the childs asleep mrs topes was proffering the dish of peaches how much longer am i to hold this in front of your nose barbara  barbara felt herself blushing im so sorry she mumbled and took the dish clumsily  daydreaming its a bad habit  its one we all succumb to sometimes put in mr topes deprecatingly with a little nervous tremble of the head  you may my dear said his wife i do not  mr topes lowered his eyes to his plate and went on eating  the marchese should be here at any moment now said mr buzzacott looking at his watch i hope he wont be late i find i suffer so much from any postponement of my siesta this italian heat he added with growing plaintiveness one cant be too careful  ah but when i was with my father in india began mrs topes in a tone of superiority he was an indian civilian you know  aleppo indiaalways the palm trees cavalcades of big dogs and tigers too  concetta ushered in the marquis delighted pleased to meet speak english yés yéss pocchino mrs topes and mr topes the distinguished antiquarian ah of course know his name very well my daughter charmed often seen the signorina bathing admired the way she dives beautifulthe hand made a long caressing gesture these athletic english signorine the teeth flashed astonishingly white in the brown face the dark eyes glittered she felt herself blushing again looked away smiled foolishly the marquis had already turned back to mr buzzacott  so you have decided to settle in our carrarese  well not settled exactly mr buzzacott wouldnt go so far as to say settled a villine for the summer months the winter in rome one was forced to live abroad taxation in england soon they were all talking barbara looked at them beside the marquis they all seemed half dead his face flashed as he talked he seemed to be boiling with life her father was limp and pale like something long buried from the light and mr topes was all dry and shrivelled and mrs topes looked more than ever like something worked by clockwork they were talking about socialism and fascisti and all that barbara did not listen to what they were saying but she looked at them absorbed  goodbye goodbye the animated face with its flash of a smile was turned like a lamp from one to another now it was turned on her perhaps one evening she would come with her father and the signora topes he and his sister gave little dances sometimes only the gramophone of course but that was better than nothing and the signorina must dance divinelyanother flashhe could see that he pressed her hand again goodbye  it was time for the siesta  dont forget to pull down the mosquito netting my dear mr buzzacott exhorted there is always a danger of anophylines  all right father she moved towards the door without turning round to answer him he was always terribly tiresome about mosquito nets once they had driven through the campagna in a hired cab completely enclosed in an improvised tent of netting the monuments along the appian way had loomed up mistily as through bridal veils and how everyone had laughed but her father of course hadnt so much as noticed it he never noticed anything  is it at berlin that charming little madonna of montagnas mr topes abruptly asked the one with the donor kneeling in the lefthand corner as if about to kiss the foot of the child his spectacles flashed in mr buzzacotts direction  why do you ask  i dont know i was just thinking of it  i think you must mean the one in the mond collection  ah yes very probably in the mond  barbara opened the door and walked into the twilight of her shuttered room it was hot even here for another three hours it would hardly be possible to stir and that old idiot mrs topes always made a fuss if one came in to lunch with bare legs and ones afterbathing tunic in india we always made a point of being properly and adequately dressed an englishwoman must keep up her position with natives and to all intents and purposes italians are natives and so she always had to put on shoes and stockings and a regular frock just at the hottest hour of the day what an old ass that woman was she slipped off her clothes as fast as she could that was a little better  standing in front of the long mirror in the wardrobe door she came to the humiliating conclusion that she looked like a piece of badly toasted bread brown face brown neck and shoulders brown arms brown legs from the knee downwards but all the rest of her was white silly effeminate townish white if only one could run about with no clothes on till one was like those little coppery children who rolled and tumbled in the burning sand now she was just underdone halfbaked and wholly ridiculous for a long time she looked at her pale image she saw herself running bronzed all over along the sand or through a field of flowers narcissus and wild tulips or in soft grass under grey olive trees she turned round with a sudden start there in the shadows behind her no of course there was nothing  it was that awful picture in a magazine she had looked at so many years ago when she was a child there was a lady sitting at her dressingtable doing her hair in front of the glass and a huge hairy black monkey creeping up behind her she always got the creeps when she looked at herself in a mirror it was very silly but still she turned away from the mirror crossed the room and without lowering the mosquito curtains lay down on her bed the flies buzzed about her settled incessantly on her face she shook her head flapped at them angrily with her hands there would be peace if she let down the netting but she thought of the appian way seen mistily through the bridal veil and preferred to suffer the flies in the end she had to surrender the brutes were too much for her but at any rate it wasnt the fear of anophylines that made her lower the netting  undisturbed now and motionless she lay stretched stiffly out under the transparent bell of gauze a specimen under a glass case the fancy possessed her mind she saw a huge museum with thousands of glass cases full of fossils and butterflies and stuffed birds and mediæval spoons and armour and florentine jewellery and mummies and carved ivory and illuminated manuscripts but in one of the cases was a human being shut up there alive  all of a sudden she became horribly miserable boring boring boring she whispered formulating the words aloud would it never stop being boring the tears came into her eyes how awful everything was and perhaps it would go on being as bad as this all her life seventeen from seventy was fifty three fifty three years of it and if she lived to a hundred there would be more than eighty  the thought depressed her all the evening even her bath after tea did her no good swimming far out far out she lay there floating on the warm water sometimes she looked at the sky sometimes she turned her head towards the shore framed in their pinewoods the villas looked as small and smug as the advertisement of a seaside resort but behind them across the level plain were the mountains sharp bare peaks of limestone green woodland slopes and greygreen expanses of terraced olive treesthey seemed marvellously close and clear in this evening light and beautiful beautiful beyond words but that somehow only made things worse and shelley had lived a few miles farther up the coast there behind the headland guarding the gulf of spezia shelley had been drowned in this milkwarm sea that made it worse too  the sun was getting very low and red over the sea she swam slowly in on the beach mrs topes waited disapprovingly she had known somebody a strong man who had caught cramp from staying in too long he sank like a stone like a stone the queer people mrs topes had known and the funny things they did the odd things that happened to them  dinner that evening was duller than ever barbara went early to bed all night long the same old irritating cicada scraped and scraped among the pine trees monotonous and regular as clockwork zip zip zip zip zip boring boring was the animal never bored by its own noise it seemed odd that it shouldnt be but when she came to think of it nobody ever did get bored with their own noise mrs topes for example she never seemed to get bored zip zip zip zip zip the cicada went on without pause  concetta knocked at the door at halfpast seven the morning was as bright and cloudless as all the mornings were barbara jumped up looked from one window at the mountains from the other at the sea all seemed to be well with them all was well with her too this morning seated at the mirror she did not so much as think of the big monkey in the far obscure corner of the room a bathing dress and a bathgown sandals a handkerchief round her head and she was ready sleep had left no recollection of last nights mortal boredom she ran downstairs  good morning mr topes  mr topes was walking in the garden among the vines he turned round took off his hat smiled a greeting  good morning miss barbara he paused then with an embarrassed wriggle of introduction he went on a queer little falter came into his voice a real chaucerian morning miss barbara a mayday morningonly it happens to be september nature is fresh and bright and there is at least one specimen in this dream gardenhe wriggled more uncomfortably than ever and there was a tremulous glitter in his round spectacle lenses of the poets yonge fresshe folkes he bowed in her direction smiled deprecatingly and was silent the remark it seemed to him now that he had finished speaking was somehow not as good as he had thought it would be  barbara laughed chaucer they used to make us read the canterbury tales at school but they always bored me are you going to bathe  not before breakfast mr topes shook his head one is getting a little too old for that  is one why did the silly old man always say one when he meant i she couldnt help laughing at him well i must hurry or else i shall be late for breakfast again and you know how i catch it  she ran out through the gate in the garden wall across the beach to the striped redandwhite bathing cabin that stood before the house fifty yards away she saw the marchese prampolini still dripping from the sea running up towards his bathing hut catching sight of her he flashed a smile in her direction gave a military salute barbara waved her hand then thought that the gesture had been too familiarbut at this hour of the morning it was difficult not to have bad jolly mannersand added the corrective of a stiff bow after all she had only met him yesterday soon she was swimming out to sea and ugh what a lot of horrible huge jellyfish there were  mr topes had followed her slowly through the gate and across the sand he watched her running down from the cabin slender as a boy with long bounding strides he watched her go jumping with great splashes through the deepening water then throw herself forward and begin to swim he watched her till she was no more than a small dark dot far out  emerging from his cabin the marquis met him walking slowly along the beach his head bent down and his lips slightly moving as though he were repeating something a prayer or a poem to himself  good morning signore the marquis shook him by the hand with a more than english cordiality  good morning replied mr topes allowing his hand to be shaken he resented this interruption of his thoughts  she swims very well miss buzzacott  very assented mr topes and smiled to himself to think what beautiful poetical things he might have said if he had chosen  well so so said the marquis too colloquial by half he shook hands again and the two men went their respective ways  barbara was still a hundred yards from the shore when she heard the crescendo and dying boom of the gong floating out from the villa damn shed be late again she quickened her stroke and came splashing out through the shallows flushed and breathless  shed be ten minutes late she calculated it would take her at least that to do her hair and dress mrs topes would be on the warpath again though what business that old woman had to lecture her as she did goodness only knew she always succeeded in making herself horribly offensive and unpleasant  the beach was quite deserted as she trotted panting across it empty to right and left as far as she could see if only she had a horse to go galloping at the waters edge miles and miles right away down to bocca darno shed go swim the rivershe saw herself crouching on the horses back as he swam with legs tucked up on the saddle trying not to get her feet wetand gallop on again goodness only knew where  in front of the cabin she suddenly halted there in the ruffled sand she had seen a writing big letters faintly legible sprawled across her path  o clara dellÉbeuse  she pieced the dim letters together they hadnt been there when she started out to bathe who she looked round the beach was quite empty and what was the meaning o clara dellébeuse she took her bathgown from the cabin slipped on her sandals and ran back towards the house as fast as she could she felt most horribly frightened  it was a sultry headachey sort of morning with a hot sirocco that stirred the bunting on the flagstaffs by midday the thunderclouds had covered half the sky the sun still blazed on the sea but over the mountains all was black and indigo the storm broke noisily overhead just as they were drinking their afterluncheon coffee  arthur said mrs topes painfully calm shut the shutters please  she was not frightened no but she preferred not to see the lightning when the room was darkened she began to talk suavely and incessantly  lying back in her deep armchair barbara was thinking of clara dellébeuse what did it mean and who was clara dellébeuse and why had he written it there for her to see hefor there could be no doubt who had written it the flash of teeth and eyes the military salute she knew she oughtnt to have waved to him he had written it there while she was swimming out written it and then run away she rather liked thatjust an extraordinary word on the sand like the footprint in robinson crusoe  personally mrs topes was saying i prefer harrods  the thunder crashed and rattled it was rather exhilarating barbara thought one felt at any rate that something was happening for a change she remembered the little room halfway up the stairs at lady thingumys house with the bookshelves and the green curtains and the orange shade on the light and that awful young man like a white slug who had tried to kiss her there at the dance last year but that was differentnot at all serious and the young man had been so horribly ugly she saw the marquis running up the beach quick and alert copper coloured all over with black hair he was certainly very handsome but as for being in love well  what did that exactly mean perhaps when she knew him better even now she fancied she detected something o clara dellébeuse what an extraordinary thing it was  with his long fingers mr buzzacott combed his beard this winter he was thinking he would put another thousand into italian money when the exchange was favourable in the spring it always seemed to drop back again one could clear three hundred pounds on ones capital if the exchange went down to seventy the income on three hundred was fifteen pounds a year and fifteen pounds was now fifteen hundred lire and fifteen hundred lire when you came to think of it was really sixty pounds that was to say that one would make an addition of more than one pound a week to ones income by this simple little speculation he became aware that mrs topes had asked him a question  yes yes perfectly he said  mrs topes talked on she was keeping up her morale was she right in believing that the thunder sounded a little less alarmingly loud and near  mr topes sat polishing his spectacles with a white silk handkerchief vague and myopic between their puckered lids his eyes seemed lost homeless unhappy he was thinking about beauty there were certain relations between the eyelids and the temples between the breast and the shoulder there were certain successions of sounds but what about them ah that was the problemthat was the problem and there was youth there was innocence but it was all very obscure and there were so many phrases so many remembered pictures and melodies he seemed to get himself entangled among them and he was after all so old and so ineffective he put on his spectacles again and definition came into the foggy world beyond his eyes the shuttered room was very dark he could distinguish the renaissance profile of mr buzzacott bearded and delicately featured in her deep armchair barbara appeared faintly white in an attitude relaxed and brooding and mrs topes was nothing more than a voice in the darkness she had got on to the marriage of the prince of wales who would they eventually find for him  clara dellébeuse clara dellébeuse she saw herself so clearly as the marchesa they would have a house in rome a palace she saw herself in the palazzo spadait had such a lovely vaulted passage leading from the courtyard to the gardens at the back marchesa prampolini palazzo spada romaa great big visitingcard beautifully engraved and she would go riding every day in the pincio mi porta il mio cavallo she would say to the footman who answered the bell porta would that be quite correct hardly shed have to take some proper italian lessons to talk to the servants one must never be ridiculous before servants voglio il mio cavallo haughtily one would say it sitting at ones writingtable in a ridinghabit without turning round it would be a green ridinghabit with a black tricorne hat braided with silver  prendero la mia collazzione al letto was that right for breakfast in bed because she would have breakfast in bed always and when she got up there would be lovely looking glasses with three panels where one could see oneself sideface she saw herself leaning forward powdering her nose carefully scientifically with the monkey creeping up behind ooh horrible ho paura di questa scimmia questo scimmione  she would come back to lunch after her ride perhaps prampolini would be there she had rather left him out of the picture so far dov è il marchese nella sala di pranza signora i began without you i was so hungry pasta asciutta where have you been my love riding my dove she supposed theyd get into the habit of saying that sort of thing everyone seemed to and you i have been out with the fascisti  oh these fascisti would life be worth living when he was always going out with pistols and bombs and things they would bring him back one day on a stretcher she saw it pale pale with blood on him il signore è ferito nel petto gruvamente e morto  how could she bear it it was too awful too too terrible her breath came in a kind of sob she shuddered as though she had been hurt e morto e morto the tears came into her eyes  she was roused suddenly by a dazzling light the storm had receded far enough into the distance to permit of mrs topess opening the shutters  its quite stopped raining  to be disturbed in ones intimate sorrow and selfabandonment at a deathbed by a strangers intrusion an alien voice barbara turned her face away from the light and surreptitiously wiped her eyes they might see and ask her why she had been crying she hated mrs topes for opening the shutters at the inrush of the light something beautiful had flown an emotion had vanished irrecoverably it was a sacrilege  mr buzzacott looked at his watch too late i fear for a siesta now he said suppose we ring for an early tea  an endless succession of meals said mr topes with a tremolo and a sigh thats what life seems to bereal life  i have been calculatingmr buzzacott turned his pale green eyes towards his guestthat i may be able to afford that pretty little cinque cassone after all it would be a bit of a squeeze he played with his beard but still  after tea barbara and mr topes went for a walk along the beach she didnt much want to go but mrs topes thought it would be good for her so she had to the storm had passed and the sky over the sea was clear but the waves were still breaking with an incessant clamour on the outer shallows driving wide sheets of water high up the beach twenty or thirty yards above the line where on a day of calm the ripples ordinarily expired smooth shining expanses of water advanced and receded like steel surfaces moved out and back by a huge machine through the rainwashed air the mountains appeared with an incredible clarity above them hung huge masses of cloud  clouds over carrara said mr topes deprecating his remark with a little shake of the head and a movement of the shoulders i like to fancy sometimes that the spirits of the great sculptors lodge among these marble hills and that it is their unseen hands that carve the clouds into these enormous splendid shapes i imagine their ghostshis voice trembledfeeling about among superhuman conceptions planning huge groups and friezes and monumental figures with blowing draperies planning conceiving but never quite achieving look theres something of michelangelo in that white cloud with the dark shadows underneath it mr topes pointed and barbara nodded and said yes yes though she wasnt quite sure which cloud he meant its like night on the medici tomb all the power and passion are brooding inside it pent up and there in that sweeping gesticulating piece of vapouryou see the one i meantheres a bernini all the passions on the surface expressed the gestures caught at its most violent and that sleek smug white fellow over there thats a delicious absurd canova mr topes chuckled  why do you always talk about art said barbara you bring these dead people into everything what do i know about canova or whoever it is they were none of them alive she thought of that dark face bright as a lamp with life he at least wasnt dead she wondered whether the letters were still there in the sand before the cabin no of course not the rain and the wind would have blotted them out  mr topes was silent he walked with slightly bent knees and his eyes were fixed on the ground he wore a speckled blackandwhite straw hat he always thought of art that was what was wrong with him like an old tree he was built up of dead wood with only a few fibres of life to keep him from rotting away they walked on for a long time in silence  heres the river said mr topes at last  a few steps more and they were on the bank of a wide stream that came down slowly through the plain to the sea just inland from the beach it was fringed with pine trees beyond the trees one could see the plain and beyond the plain were the mountains in this calm light after the storm everything looked strange the colours seemed deeper and more intense than at ordinary times and though all was so clear there was a mysterious air of remoteness about the whole scene there was no sound except the continuous breathing of the sea they stood for a little while looking then turned back  far away along the beach two figures were slowly approaching white flannel trousers a pink skirt  nature mr topes enunciated with a shake of the head one always comes back to nature at a moment such as this in surroundings like these one realises it one lives nowmore quietly perhaps but more profoundly deep watery deep waters  the figures drew closer wasnt it the marquis and who was with him barbara strained her eyes to see  most of ones life mr topes went on is one prolonged effort to prevent oneself thinking your father and i we collect pictures and read about the dead other people achieve the same results by drinking or breeding rabbits or doing amateur carpentry anything rather than think calmly about the important things  mr topes was silent he looked about him at the sea at the mountains at the great clouds at his companion a frail montagna madonna with the sea and the westering sun the mountains and the storm all eternity as a background and he was sixty with all a life immensely long and yet timelessly short behind him an empty life he thought of death and the miracles of beauty behind his round glittering spectacles he felt inclined to weep  the approaching couple were quite near now  what a funny old walrus said the lady  walrus your natural history is quite wrong the marquis laughed hes much too dry to be a walrus i should suggest some sort of an old cat  well whatever he is im sorry for that poor little girl think of having nobody better to go about with  pretty isnt she  yes but too young of course  i like the innocence  innocence cher ami these english girls oh la la they may look innocent but believe me  sh sh theyll hear you  pooh they dont understand italian  the marquis raised his hand the old walrus he whispered then addressed himself loudly and jovially to the newcomers  good evening signorina good evening mr topes after a storm the air is always the purest dont you find eh  barbara nodded leaving mr topes to answer it wasnt his sister it was the russian woman the one of whom mrs topes used to say that it was a disgrace she should be allowed to stay at the hotel she had turned away dissociating herself from the conversation barbara looked at the line of her averted face mr topes was saying something about the pastoral symphony purple face powder in the daylight it looked hideous  well au revoir  the flash of the marquiss smile was directed at them the russian woman turned back from the sea slightly bowed smiled languidly her heavy white eyelids were almost closed she seemed the prey of an enormous ennui  they jar a little said mr topes when they were out of earshotthey jar on the time on the place on the emotion they havent the innocence for this  thishe wriggled and tremoloed out the just the all too precious wordthis prelapsarian landscape  he looked sideways at barbara and wondered what she was so thoughtfully frowning over oh lovely and delicate young creature what could he adequately say of death and beauty and tenderness tenderness  all this he went on desperately and waved his hand to indicate the sky the sea the mountains this scene is like something remembered clear and utterly calm remembered across great gulfs of intervening time  but that was not really what he wanted to say  you see what i mean he asked dubiously she made no reply how could she see this scene is so clear and pure and remote you need the corresponding emotion those people were out of harmony they werent clear and pure enough he seemed to be getting more muddled than ever its an emotion of the young and of the old you could feel it i could feel it those people couldnt he was feeling his way through obscurities where would he finally arrive certain poems express it you know francis jammes i have thought so much of his work lately art instead of life as usual but then im made that way i cant help thinking of jammes those delicate exquisite things he wrote about clara dellébeuse  clara dellébeuse she stopped and stared at him  you know the lines mr topes smiled delightedly this makes me think you make me think of them faime dans les temps clara dellébeuse but my dear barbara what is the matter  she had started crying for no reason whatever     v nuns at luncheon   what have i been doing since you saw me last miss penny repeated my question in her loud emphatic voice well when did you see me last  it must have been june i computed  was that after id been proposed to by the russian general  yes i remember hearing about the russian general  miss penny threw back her head and laughed her long earrings swung and rattled corpses hanging in chains an agreeably literary simile and her laughter was like brass but that had been said before  that was an uproarous incident its sad you should have heard of it i love my russian general story vos yeux me rendent fou she laughed again  vos yeuxshe had eyes like a hares flush with her head and very bright with a superficial and expressionless brightness what a formidable woman i felt sorry for the russian general  sans coeur et sans entrallies she went on quoting the poor devils words such a delightful motto dont you think like sans peur et sans reproche but let me think what have i been doing since then thoughtfully she bit into the crust of her bread with long sharp white teeth  two mixed grills i said parenthetically to the waiter  but of course exclaimed miss penny suddenly i havent seen you since my german trip all sorts of adventures my appendicitis my nun  your nun  my marvellous nun i must tell you all about her  do miss pennys anecdotes were always curious i looked forward to an entertaining luncheon  you knew id been in germany this autumn  well i didnt as a matter of fact but still  i was just wandering round miss penny described a circle in the air with her gaudily jewelled hand she always twinkled with massive and improbable jewellery  wandering round living on three pounds a week partly amusing myself partly collecting material for a few little articles what it feels like to be a conquered nationsobstuff for the liberal press you knowand how the hun is trying to wriggle out of the indemnity for the other fellows one has to make the best of all possible worlds dont you find but we mustnt talk shop well i was wandering round and very pleasant i found it berlin dresden leipzig then down to munich and all over the place one fine day i got to grauburg you know grauburg its one of those picturebook german towns with a castle on a hill hanging beergardens a gothic church an old university a river a pretty bridge and forests all round charming but i hadnt much opportunity to appreciate the beauties of the place the day after i arrived therebangi went down with appendicitisscreaming i may add  but how appalling  they whisked me off to hospital and cut me open before you could say knife excellent surgeon highly efficient sisters of charity to nurse mei couldnt have been in better hands but it was a bore being tied there by the leg for four weeksa great bore still the thing had its compensations there was my nun for example ah heres the food thank heaven  the mixed grill proved to be excellent miss pennys description of the pun came to me in scraps and snatches a round pink pretty face in a winged coif blue eyes and regular features teeth altogether too perfectfalse in fact but the general effect extremely pleasing a youthful teutonic twenty eight  she wasnt my nurse miss penny explained but i used to see her quite often when she came in to have a look at the tolle engländerin her name was sister agatha during the war they told me she had converted any number of wounded soldiers to the true faithwhich wasnt surprising considering how pretty she was  did she try and convert you i asked  she wasnt such a fool miss penny laughed and rattled the miniature gallows of her ears  i amused myself for a moment with the thought of miss pennys conversionmiss penny confronting a vast assembly of fathers of the church rattling her earrings at their discourses on the trinity laughing her appalling laugh at the doctrine of the immaculate conception meeting the stern look of the grand inquisitor with a flash of her bright emotionless hares eyes what was the secret of the womans formidableness  but i was missing the story what had happened ah yes the gist of it was that sister agatha had appeared one morning after two or three days absence dressed not as a nun but in the overalls of a hospital charwoman with a handkerchief instead of a winged coif on her shaven head  dead said miss penny she looked as though she were dead a walking corpse thats what she was it was a shocking sight i shouldnt have thought it possible for anyone to change so much in so short a time she walked painfully as though she had been ill for months and she had great burnt rings round her eyes and deep lines in her face and the general expression of unhappinessthat was something quite appalling  she leaned out into the gangway between the two rows of tables and caught the passing waiter by the end of one his coattails the little italian looked round with an expression of surprise that deepened into terror on his face  half a pint of guinness ordered miss penny and after this bring me some jam roll  no jam roll today madam  damn said miss penny bring me what you like then  she let go of the waiters tail and resumed her narrative  where was i yes i remember she came into my room i was telling you with a bucket of water and a brush dressed like a charwoman naturally i was rather surprised what on earth are you doing sister agatha i asked no answer she just shook her head and began to scrub the floor when shed finished she left the room without so much as looking at me again whats happened to sister agatha i asked my nurse when she next came in cant saywont say i said no answer it took nearly a week to find out what really had happened nobody dared tell me it was strengst verboten as they used to say in the good old days but i wormed it out in the long run my nurse the doctor the charwomeni got something out of all of them i always get what i want in the end miss penny laughed like a horse  im sure you do i said politely  much obliged acknowledged miss penny but to proceed my information came to me in fragmentary whispers sister agatha ran away with a mandear meone of the patientsyou dont say soa criminal out of the jailthe plot thickenshe ran away from herit seems to grow thinner againthey brought her back here shes been disgraced theres been a funeral service for her in the chapelcoffin and all she had to be present at ither own funeral she isnt a nun any more she has to do charwomans work now the roughest in the hospital shes not allowed to speak to anybody and nobodys allowed to speak to her shes regarded as dead miss penny paused to signal to the harassed little italian my small guinness she called out  coming coming and the foreign voice cried guinness down the lift and from below another voice echoed guinness  i filled in the details bit by bit there was our hero to begin with i had to bring him into the picture which was rather difficult as i had never seen him but i got a photograph of him the police circulated one when he got away i dont suppose they ever caught him miss penny opened her bag here it is she said i always carry it about with me its become a superstition for years i remember i used to carry a little bit of heather tied up with string beautiful isnt it theres a sort of renaissance look about it dont you think he was halfitalian you know  italian ah that explained it i had been wondering how bavaria could have produced this thinfaced creature with the big dark eyes the finely modelled nose and chin and the fleshy lips so royally and sensually curved  hes certainly very superb i said handing back the picture  miss penny put it carefully away in her bag isnt he she said quite marvellous but his character and his mind were even better i see him as one of those innocent childlike monsters of iniquity who are simply unaware of the existence of right and wrong and he had geniusthe real italian genius for engineering for dominating and exploiting nature a true son of the roman aqueduct builders he was and a brother of the electrical engineers only kunothat was his namedidnt work in water he worked in women he knew how to harness the natural energy of passion he made devotion drive his mills the commercial exploitation of lovepower that was his specialty i sometimes wonder miss penny added in a different tone whether i shall ever be exploited when i get a little more middleaged and celibate by one of these young engineers of the passions it would be humiliating particularly as ive done so little exploiting from my side  she frowned and was silent for a moment no decidedly miss penny was not beautiful you could not even honestly say that she had charm or was attractive that high scotch colouring those hares eyes the voice the terrifying laugh and the size of her the general formidableness of the woman no no no  you said he had been in prison i said the silence with all its implications was becoming embarrassing  miss penny sighed looked up and nodded he was fool enough she said to leave the straight and certain road of female exploitation for the dangerous courses of burglary we all have our occasional accesses of folly they gave him a heavy sentence but he succeeded in getting pneumonia i think it was a week after entering jail he was transferred to the hospital sister agatha with her known talent for saving souls was given him as his particular attendant but it was he im afraid who did the converting  miss penny finished off the last mouthful of the ginger pudding which the waiter had brought in lieu of jam roll  i suppose you dont smoke cheroots i said as i opened my cigarcase  well as a matter of fact i do miss penny replied she looked sharply round the restaurant i must just see if there are any of those horrible little gossip paragraphers here today one doesnt want to figure in the social and personal column tomorrow morning a fact which is not so generally known as it ought to be is that miss penny the wellknown woman journalist always ends her luncheon with a sixinch burma cheroot i saw her yesterday in a restaurantnot a hundred miles from carmelite streetsmoking like a house on fire you know the touch but the coast seems to be clear thank goodness  she took a cheroot from the case lit it at my proffered match and went on talking  yes it was young kuno who did the converting sister agatha was converted back into the worldly melpomene fugger she had been before she became the bride of holiness  melpomene fugger  that was her name i had her history from my old doctor he had seen all grauburg living and dying and propagating for generations melpomene fugger why he had brought little melpel into the world little melpchen her father was professor fugger the great professor fugger the berümter geolog oh yes of course i know the name so well he was the man who wrote the standard work on lemuriayou know the hypothetical continent where the lemurs come from i showed due respect liberalminded he was a disciple of herder a worldburgher as they beautifully call it over there anglophile too and always ate porridge for breakfastup till august 1914 then the radiant morning of the fifth he renounced it for ever solemnly and with tears in his eyes the national food of a people who had betrayed culture and civilisationhow could he go on eating it it would stick in his throat in future he would have a lightly boiled egg he sounded i thought altogether charming and his daughter melpomeneshe sounded charming too and such thick yellow pigtails when she was young her mother was dead and a sister of the great professors ruled the house with an iron rod aunt bertha was her name well melpomene grew up very plump and appetising when she was seventeen something very odious and disagreeable happened to her even the doctor didnt know exactly what it was but he wouldnt have been surprised if it had had something to do with the then professor of latin an old friend of the familys who combined it seems great erudition with a horrid fondness for very young ladies  miss penny knocked half an inch of cigar ash into her empty glass  if i wrote short stories she went on reflectively but its too much bother i should make this anecdote into a sort of potted life history beginning with a scene immediately after this disagreeable event in melpomenes life i see the scene so clearly poor little melpel is leaning over the bastions of grauburg castle weeping into the june night and the mulberry trees in the garden thirty feet below she is besieged by the memory of what happened this dreadful afternoon professor engelmann her fathers old friend with the magnificent red assyrian beard too awfultoo awful but then as i was saying short stones are really too much bother or perhaps im too stupid to write them i bequeath it to you you know how to tick these things off  youre generous  not at all said miss penny my terms are ten per cent commission on the american sale incidentally there wont be an american sale poor melpchens history is not for the chaste public of those states but let me hear what you propose to do with melpomene now youve got her on the castle bastions  thats simple i said i know all about german university towns and castles on hills i shall make her look into the june night as you suggest into the violet night with its points of golden flame there will be the black silhouette of the castle with its sharp roofs and hooded turrets behind her from the hanging beergardens in the town below the voices of the students singing in perfect fourpart harmony will float up through the darkblue spaces röslein röslein röslein rot and das ringlein sprang in zweithe heartrendingly sweet old songs will make her cry all the more her tears will patter like rain among the leaves of the mulberry trees in the garden below does that seem to you adequate  very nice said miss penny but how are you going to bring the sex problem and all of its horrors into the landscape  well let me think i called to memory those distant foreign summers when i was completing my education i know i shall suddenly bring a swarm of moving candles and chinese lanterns under the mulberry trees you imagine the rich lights and shadows the jewelbright leafage the faces and moving limbs of men and women seen for an instant and gone again they are students and girls of the town come out to dance this windless blue june night under the mulberry trees and now they begin thumping round and round in a ring to the music of their own singing       wir können spielen      viovioviolin      wir können spielen      violin  now the rhythm changes quickens       und wir können tanzen bumstarara      bumstarara bumstarara      und wir können tanzen bumstarara      bumstarararara  the dance becomes a rush an elephantine prancing on the dry lawn under the mulberry trees and from the bastion melpomene looks down and perceives suddenly and apocalyptically that everything in the world is sex sex sex men and women male and femalealways the same and all in the light of the horror of the afternoon disgusting thats how i should do it miss penny  and very nice too but i wish you could find a place to bring in my conversation with the doctor i shall never forget the way he cleared his throat and coughed before embarking on the delicate subject you may know ahem gracious miss he beganyou may know that religious phenomena are often ahem closely connected with sexual causes i replied that i had heard rumours which might justify me in believing this to be true among roman catholics but that in the church of england and i for one was a practitioner of anglicanismusit was very different that might be said the doctor he had had no opportunity in the course of his long medical career of personally studying anglicanismus but he could vouch for the fact that among his patients here in grauburg mysticismus was very often mixed up with the geschlechtsleben melpomene was a case in point after that hateful afternoon she had become extremely religious the professor of latin had diverted her emotions out of their normal channels she rebelled against the placid agnosticismus of her father and at night in secret when aunt berthas dragon eyes were closed she would read such forbidden books as the life of st theresa the little flowers of st francis the imitation of christ and the horribly enthralling book of martyrs aunt bertha confiscated these works whenever she came upon them she considered them more pernicious than the novels of marcel prévost the character of a good potential housewife might be completely undermined by reading of this kind it was rather a relief for melpomene when aunt bertha shuffled off in the summer of 1911 this mortal coil she was one of those indispensables of whom one makes the discovery when they are gone that one can get on quite as well without them poor aunt bertha  one can imagine melpomene trying to believe she was sorry and horribly ashamed to find that she was really in secret almost glad the suggestion seemed to me ingenious but miss penny accepted it as obvious  precisely she said and the emotion would only further confirm and give new force to the tendencies which her aunts death left her free to indulge as much as she liked remorse contritionthey would lead to the idea of doing penance and for one who was now wallowing in the martyrology penance was the mortification of the flesh she used to kneel for hours at night in the cold she ate too little and when her teeth ached which they often didfor she had a set the doctor told me which had given trouble from the very firstshe would not go and see the dentist but lay awake at night savouring to the full her excruciations and feeling triumphantly that they must in some strange way be pleasing to the mysterious powers she went on like that for two or three years till she was poisoned through and through in the end she went down with gastric ulcer it was three months before she came out of hospital well for the first time in a long space of years and with a brand new set of imperishable teeth all gold and ivory and in mind too she was changedfor the better i suppose the nuns who nursed her had made her see that in mortifying herself she had acted supererogatively and through spiritual pride instead of doing right she had sinned the only road to salvation they told her lay in discipline in the orderliness of established religion in obedience to authority secretly so as not to distress her poor father whose agnosticismus was extremely dogmatic for all its unobtrusiveness melpomene became a roman catholic she was twentytwo only a few months later came the war and professor fuggers eternal renunciation of porridge he did not long survive the making of that patriotic gesture in the autumn of 1914 he caught a fatal influenza melpomene was alone in the world in the spring of 1915 there was a new and very conscientious sister of charity at work among the wounded in the hospital of grauburg here explained miss penny jabbing the air with her forefinger you put a line of asterisks or dots to signify a six years gulf in the narrative and you begin again right in the middle of a dialogue between sister agatha and the newly convalescent kuno  whats their dialogue to be about i asked  oh thats easy enough said miss penny almost anything would do what about this for example you explain that the fever has just abated for the first time for days the young man is fully conscious he feels himself to be well reborn as it were in a new worlda world so bright and novel and jolly that he cant help laughing at the sight of it he looks about him the flies on the ceiling strike him as being extremely comic how do they manage to walk upside down they have suckers on their feet says sister agatha and wonders if her natural history is quite sound suckers on their feetha ha what an uproarious notion suckers on their feetthats good thats damned good you can say charming pathetic positively tender things about the irrelevant mirth of convalescents the more so in this particular case where the mirth is expressed by a young man who is to be taken back to jail as soon as he can stand firmly on his legs ha ha laugh on unhappy boy it is the quacking of the fates the parcæ the norns  miss penny gave an exaggerated imitation of her own brassy laughter at the sound of it the few lunchers who still lingered at the other tables looked up startled  you can write pages about destiny and its ironic quacking its tremendously impressive and theres money in every line  you may be sure i shall  good then i can get on with my story the days pass and the first hilarity of convalescence fades away the young man remembers and grows sullen his strength comes back to him and with it a sense of despair his mind broods incessantly on the hateful future as for the consolations of religion he wont listen to them sister agatha perseveresoh with what anxious solicitudein the attempt to make him understand and believe and be comforted it is all so tremendously important and in this case somehow more important than in any other and now you see the geschlechtsleben working yeastily and obscurely and once again the quacking of the norns is audible by the way said miss penny changing her tone and leaning confidentially across the table i wish youd tell me something tell me do you reallyhonestly i meando you seriously believe in literature  believe in literature  i was thinking miss penny explained of ironic fate and the quacking of the norns and all that  m yes  and then theres this psychology and introspection business and construction and good narrative and word pictures and le mot juste and verbal magic and striking metaphors  i remembered that i had compared miss pennys tinkling earrings to skeletons hanging in chains  and then finally and to begin withalpha and omegatheres ourselves two professionals gloating with an absolute lack of sympathy over a seduced nun and speculating on the best method of turning her misfortunes into cash its all very curious isnt itwhen one begins to think about it dispassionately  very curious i agreed but then so is everything else if you look at it like that  no no said miss penny nothings so curious as our business but i shall never get to the end of my story if i get started on first principles  miss penny continued her narrative i was still thinking of literature do you believe in it seriously ah luckily the question was quite meaningless the story came to me rather vaguely but it seemed that the young man was getting better in a few more days the doctor had said he would be wellwell enough to go back to jail no no the question was meaningless i would think about it no more i concentrated my attention again  sister agatha i heard miss penny saying prayed exhorted indoctrinated whenever she had half a minute to spare from her other duties she would come running into the young mans room i wonder if you fully realise the importance of prayer she would ask and before he had time to answer she would give him a breathless account of the uses and virtues of regular and patient supplication or else it was may i tell you about st theresa or st stephen the first martyryou know about him dont you kuno simply wouldnt listen at first it seemed so fantastically irrelevant such an absurd interruption to his thoughts his serious despairing thoughts about the future prison was real imminent and this woman buzzed about him with her ridiculous fairytales then suddenly one day he began to listen he showed signs of contrition and conversion sister agatha announced her triumph to the other nuns and there was rejoicing over the one lost sheep melpomene had never felt so happy in her life and kuno looking at her radiant face must have wondered how he could have been such a fool as not to see from the first what was now so obvious the woman had lost her head about him and he had only four days nowfour days in which to tap the tumultuous love power to canalise it to set it working for his escape why hadnt he started a week ago he could have made certain of it then but now there was no knowing four days was a horribly short time  how did he do it i asked for miss penny had paused  thats for you to say she replied and shook her earrings at me i dont know nobody knows i imagine except the two parties concerned and perhaps sister agathas confessor but one can reconstruct the crime as they say how would you have done it youre a man you ought to be familiar with the processes of amorous engineering  you flatter me i answered do you seriously suppose i extended my arms miss penny laughed like a horse no but seriously its a problem the case is a very special one the person a nun the place a hospital the opportunities few there could be no favourable circumstancesno moonlight no distant music and any form of direct attack would be sure to fail that audacious confidence which is your amorists best weapon would be useless here  obviously said miss penny but there are surely other methods there is the approach through pity and the maternal instincts and theres the approach through higher things through the soul kuno must have worked on those lines dont you think one can imagine him letting himself be converted praying with her and at the same time appealing for her sympathy and even threateningwith a great air of seriousnessto kill himself rather than go back to jail you can write that up easily and convincingly enough but its the sort of thing that bores me so frightfully to do thats why i can never bring myself to write fiction what is the point of it all and the way you literary men think yourselves so importantparticularly if you write tragedies its all very queer very queer indeed  i made no comment miss penny changed her tone and went on with the narrative  well she said whatever the means employed the engineering process was perfectly successful love was made to find out a way on the afternoon before kuno was to go back to prison two sisters of charity walked out of the hospital gates crossed the square in front of it glided down the narrow streets towards the river boarded a tram at the bridge and did not descend till the car had reached its terminus in the farther suburbs they began to walk briskly along the high road out into the country look said one of them when they were clear of the houses and with the gesture of a conjurer produced from nowhere a red leather purse where did it come from asked the other opening her eyes memories of elisha and the ravens of the widows cruse of the loaves and fishes must have floated through the radiant fog in poor melpomenes mind the old lady i was sitting next to in the tram left her bag open nothing could have been simpler kuno you dont mean to say you stole it kuno swore horribly he had opened the purse only sixty marks whod have thought that an old camel all dressed up in silk and furs would only have sixty marks in her purse and i must have a thousand at least to get away its easy to reconstruct the rest of the conversation down to the inevitable for gods sake shut up with which kuno put an end to melpomenes dismayed moralising they trudge on in silence kuno thinks desperately only sixty marks he can do nothing with that if only he had something to sell a piece of jewellery some gold or silver anything anything he knows such a good place for selling things is he to be caught again for lack of a few marks melpomene is also thinking evil must often be done that good may follow after all had not she herself stolen sister mary of the purifications clothes when she was asleep after night duty had not she run away from the convent broken her vows and yet how convinced she was that she was doing rightly the mysterious powers emphatically approved she felt sure of it and now there was the red purse but what was a red purse in comparison with a saved souland after all what was she doing hut saving kunos soul miss penny who had adapted the voice and gestures of a debater asking rhetorical questions brought her hand with a slap on to the table lord what a bore this sort of stuff is she exclaimed lets get to the end of this dingy anecdote as quickly as possible by this time you must imagine the shades of night were falling fastthe chill november twilight and so on but i leave the natural descriptions to you kuno gets into the ditch at the roadside and takes off his robes one imagines that he would feel himself safer in trousers more capable of acting with decision in a crisis they tramp on for miles late in the evening they leave the high road and strike up through the fields towards the forest at the fringe of the wood they find one of those wheeled huts where the shepherds sleep in the lambing season  the real maison du berger  precisely said miss penny and she began to recite       si ton coeur gémissant du poids de notre vie      se traine et se débat comme un aigle blessé  how does it go on i used to adore it all so much when i was a girl       le seuil est perfumé lalcôve est large et sombre      et là parmi les fleurs nous trouverons dans  lombre      pour nos cheveux unis un lit silencieux  i could go on like this indefinitely  do i said  no no no no im determined to finish this wretched story kuno broke the padlock of the door they entered what happened in that little hut miss penny leaned forward at me her large hares eyes glittered the long earrings swung and faintly tinkled imagine the emotions of a virgin of thirty and a nun at that in the terrifying presence of desire imagine the easy familiar brutalities of the young man oh theres pages to be made out of thisthe absolutely impenetrable darkness the smell of straw the voices the strangled crying the movements and one likes to fancy that the emotions pulsing about in that confined space made palpable vibrations like a deep sound that shakes the air why its readymade literature this scene in the morning miss penny went on after a pause two woodcutters on their way to work noticed that the door of the hut was ajar they approached the hut cautiously their axes raised and ready for a blow if there should be need of it peeping in they saw a woman in a black dress lying face downward in the straw dead no she moved she moaned whats the matter a blubbered face smeared with streaks of tearclotted grey dust is lifted towards them whats the matterhes gone what a queer indistinct utterance the woodcutters regard one another what does she say shes a foreigner perhaps whats the matter they repeat once more the woman bursts out violently crying gone gone hes gone she sobs out in her vague inarticulate way oh gone thats what she says whos gonehes left mewhatleft mewhat the devil speak a little more distinctlyi cant she wails hes taken my teethyour whatmy teethand the shrill voice breaks into a scream and she falls back sobbing into the straw the woodcutters look significantly at one another they nod one of them applies a thick yellownailed forefinger to his forehead  miss penny looked at her watch good heavens she said its nearly halfpast three i must fly dont forget about the funeral service she added as she put on her coat the tapers the black coffin in the middle of the aisle the nuns in their whitewinged coifs the gloomy chanting and the poor cowering creature without any teeth her face all caved in like an old womans wondering whether she wasnt really and in fact deadwondering whether she wasnt already in hell goodbye
