when santiago fell a sailor boy with dewey off for hawaii etc   grosset  dunlap publishers new york  copyright 1901 by the mershon company     illustration defending the fort     preface   boys of the fort is a complete story in itself but forms the fifth volume of a line of works issued under the general title of flag of freedom series  in penning this tale i had it in mind to acquaint my young readers with the ins and outs of military life at one of our western forts of today showing what both officers and privates are called upon to do and what troubles the indians and the bad men of that locality are still in the habit of making the field is one about which little has been written although abounding in interest and one which is worthy the attention of all who have the proper development of our country at heart  to some certain scenes in this book may appear overdrawn yet such is far from being the case in this wild territory there are those who have lived all their lives beyond the pale of civilization men who grow up dwarfed and crooked in mind and who resent every effort made to better their condition  the young captain is a fine specimen of the wideawake american army officer yet he is no more brave and dashing than are thousands of others officers and privates who serve under our flag of freedom he is trained to do his duty and he simply does it regardless of possible consequences  once more i take this opportunity to thank my young friends for the kindness with which they have received my former stories and i earnestly hope this present tale merits equal

  how many miles have we still to ride benson  about fifty joe but the last half is pretty much uphill lad  can we make the fort by tomorrow night  well we can try answered the old scout who sat astride of a coalblack horse and rode slightly in advance of his two youthful companions it will depend somewhat on what the weather does  why do you think it is going to rain put in darry germain im sure it looks clear enough  aint no telling what the weather will do in this valley answered sam benson it may stay clear for a week but to me the signs dont exactly pint that way and he shook his head gravely  a little rain wouldnt hurt said joe moore a couple of miles back the road was fearfully dusty  the trouble is when it rains out here it rains answered the old scout the clouds come atumbling over yonder mountains and inside of half an hour youd fancy the water was going to drown out everything  then if it rains well have to put up somewhere said darry germain  aint no cabin on this trail short of hank leesons place twenty miles this side of the fort if we can get that far i reckon we can make the fort  then where will we stop tonight asked darry with interest  at the star hotelif the sky is clear said sam benson with a laugh at what he considered his little joke  you mean in the open under the stars cried the boy and as the old scout nodded he went on that will be nice ive been wanting to camp out in regular trapper style ever since we left riverton  so have i put in joe moore but i dont know as i care to camp out and get soaked  if it rains well find some kind of shelter answered benson but come let us make the most of the daylight while it lasts and he urged his steed forward and the two boys did the same  the three were pursuing their way along a gap in the rocky mountains where the socalled valley was broken up by tiny watercourses walls of rock and dense patches of forest and underbrush it was midsummer and the hot air was filled with the scent of green growing things deep in the forest the songbirds sang gayly and the wild animals had full play to come and go as they pleased for to get at them in those vast fastnesses was next to impossible  the party of three had left the town of riverton four days before they were bound for fort carsonso named after kit carson the celebrated scout and indian fighterand sam benson carried messages of importance to colonel fairfield the commandant at the fort  joe moore and darry germain were cousins and both were boys of sixteen well built and well trained in outdoor athletic sports joe came from chicago and darry from st louis and each had graduated from his local high school but a few weeks before  it was while darry was spending a brief vacation with his cousin joe that a plan for visiting the fort was formed joes older brother william was a west point graduate and a captain at the fort and he wrote on stating that he had received permission to have joe visit him and darry could come too if he desired colonel fairfield was an old friend of both families and promised to treat the lads well should they make the trip  hurrah just the thing joe had cried of course youll go darry we couldnt have a grander outing  ill go if father and mother will let me had been darrys answer and he had at once written home concerning the affair two weeks later the boys were off the parents of each cautioning them to be careful and wishing them the best of luck  the journey westward as far as the miningtown of riverton had occurred without special incident they had been told to hire a guide at this point and while looking for a man had fallen in with sam benson benson knew captain william moore well and he at once promised to take the boys along with him and do the best he could by them  youll want good hosses benson had said and had aided them in selecting their animals and in getting together the necessary outfit the start was made one fine morning in august and all three of the party were in the best of spirits  the four days in the mountains had opened the eyes of both lads the traveling had been rather hard yet they had enjoyed every minute of the journey they had stopped once to do some fishing and benson had brought down a small mountain deer at night they had put up at the cabins of hunters and trappers and before retiring had listened to thrilling tales of adventures with wild beasts and with the indians  but now joe was anxious to get to the fort and see his brother from whom he had been separated for nearly two years darry was also anxious to reach the outpost to meet not only his cousin william but likewise colonel fairfield who was an old friend not easily forgotten once at the fort the two boys felt that a vacation full of fun and pleasure would follow never once did they dream of the perils which awaited them in that wild region which was not as civilized as it was to become a handful of years later  it seems to me it is growing hotter remarked darry after riding a quarter of a mile in silence  it is growing hotter answered the old scout and that makes me more certain than ever that a storms at hand  well have to take what comes said joe but i did hope wed reach the fort by tomorrow  on they went around a bend of the trail and over some rough rocks where the horses had to step with care for fear of slipping into a gully on the left then they reached a patch of timber and plunged beneath the lowdrooping trees here it was both dark and cool and darry breathed a long sigh of relief  how delicious he murmured its almost like going into a cave benson there must be lots of caves in these mountains he went on reflectively  there are answered the old scout ive been in a score or more  i should like to explore a big cave came from joe it would be a novelty to me  you may get the chance lad said benson and get it soon  what do you mean are we going to ride by a cave  there are a dozen or more ahead and we may have to seek one of em for shelter do you hear that  benson threw back his head to listen and the two boys did likewise from a great distance came the rumble of thunder echoing and reechoing throughout the mountains to the westward the sun was hidden by a dense mass of black clouds which grew more ominous each instant  the storm is coming sure enough muttered joe what do you propose  well ride on a bit lad it wont hit us right away come  the horses were urged forward at an increased speed and soon they passed the patch of timber and came out to where a thick fringe of brush skirted a long high cliff the sky was now dark on every side and the wind was rising with a dull humming sound  well catch it in a few minutes cried benson and hardly had he spoken when the big drops came splashing down hitting the broad leaves in the underbrush with resounding smacks  the old scout continued to lead and presently he turned to the left where the cliff parted here was an opening lined on either side with rocks and dirt and a short distance further was the entrance to a cave of unknown depths  well stop here said the old scout leaping to the ground followed by the boys this aint the best place in the world but its better than the open in such a blow as is coming  he was right about the blowalready the wind was rising and hardly had the three led their horses into the cave the entrance to which was over a dozen feet high when there came a crashing through the timber left behind which sent many a frail limb and sapling to the ground and carried the leaves and twigs in all directions  im glad we didnt stay in the woods cried darry wed be in danger of falling trees  and lightning too added joe oh my look at that he continued as a blinding flash lit up the heavens that must have struck somewhere  well go back a little said old benson the lightning is just as bad here as it is in the woods wait till i get a torch  pine was plentiful in that locality and soon he had a knot which was full of pitch and which burned well when a match was applied to it with the torch in hand he led the way further into the cave and the boys followed with their animals     chapter ii  caves in the mountain   the two boys had expected to find the large cave damp and unwholesome and they were surprised when they learned how dry the flooring and the sides were and how pure the air was there was no breeze in the place but a gentle draught kept the air stirring of course the atmosphere was much cooler than it had been outside  hardly had the travelers gained the center of the first chamber of the cave when the storm outside burst in all its fury the lightning and thunder were almost incessant and the rain came down in broad sheets which completely obliterated the landscape  its little short of a flood said darry after having gone to the mouth of the cave to investigate the water is already two or three inches deep on the trail  well such a downpour cant last long returned joe its only a shower or a cloudburst  no its a regular rain and its good for all night answered the old scout  all night  yes lad and well be lucky if it dont last through the morning too it dont rain very often out here you see but when it does it tries to make up for lost time  then well have to camp right here wont we  to be sure even if it did let up you wouldnt want to camp in the wet timber  then we might as well start up a fire came from darry in something of a disappointed tone i was hoping wed be able to camp under the stars just once before we got to the fort  perhaps youll get a chance to go out after youre at the fort said the old scout by way of comfort yes well start a fire if we can find any dry wood  the horses were tied up between some rocks and then the three searched around at the entrance to the cave was a mass of brush and tree limbs which previous storms had sent in that direction and from this they gathered enough for a goodsized fire it did not take long for the brush to blaze up sending the sparks to the roof of the cave and throwing fantastic shadows all about them  i declare the fire makes the cave look quite homelike was joes comment as he threw himself down on a flat rock with his blanket under him staying here wont be so humdrum as i anticipated  im going to explore the cave now i am here returned darry who knows but what i might locate a gold mine  you be careful of where you go cautioned old benson these caves are full of pitfalls and now you two boys are with me i dont want anything to happen to you if something did happen neither captain moore nor colonel fairfield would forgive me  to be sure well be careful benson answered darry thered be no fun in getting hurteven if we did locate a gold mine  you wont find any gold mine here this ground was prospected years agobefore even the fort was located i came out here once myself with a miner named hooker brown hooker was dead certain there was gold here but although we stayed here about two weeks nosing around we never got even a smell of the yellow metal  well well have a look around anyway said joe but we must get good torches first  pine knots were procured and lit and with another caution from the scout to be careful they set off leaving benson to care for the horses and prepare such an evening meal as their stores afforded luckily the scout had brought down half a dozen goodsized birds and these he now prepared to broil in true hunter style  the front chamber of the cave was somewhat semicircular and behind this were several other irregular apartments running down to a passageway which wound in and out between jagged rocks almost impossible to climb or explore in any manner at a distance could be heard the trickling of water but where this came from or where it went to nobody in the cave could imagine  the boys advanced from one opening to another with care one with his torch held high that they might see ahead and the other with the light close to the ground to warn them of a possible pitfall  a regiment of soldiers could quarter in here observed darry as they pushed on what a defense it would make  an enemy could fire right into the entrance and besides supposing the enemy started to smoke you out i can smell the smoke from the campfire away back here  at last the two boys reached the passageway back of the rear chamber and here came to a halt the dropping water could be plainly heard and joe flashed his torch in several directions in the hope of catching sight of the stream  im going to climb the rocks he said after a pause perhaps there is another opening behind them  remember what benson said and be careful cautioned his cousin there is no use in taking a risk for nothing  yes ill be careful answered joe and crawled forward with care darry held his torch as high up as possible to light the way  the youth had advanced a distance of fifty feet when he came to a turn in the passageway here the side walls were not over two yards apart while the roof could be touched with ease  thinking the walking better at this point joe struck out once more the flare from his torch showed him something of a chamber ahead and the water sounded closer than ever  but hardly had the lad taken a dozen steps when the smooth rock upon which he was advancing tilted up sending him headlong as he went down the torch was knocked from his hand then he slid forward into the darkness  help he managed to cry help  whats up came from darry but the words were drowned out in the crashing of one stone against another in the meantime joe had fallen he knew not whither he landed on some soft ground turned over and slid along and then took a second drop a stone fell beside him and pinned his jacket to the ground  for the moment the lad was too dazed and bewildered to do anything but try to get back his breath then as it gradually dawned upon him that he was not hurt in the least he endeavored to arise  fast he muttered and tore his jacket away from under the rock then he turned about trying to locate his torch but that was missing and all was dark around him  im in a pickle now he thought i wish i had taken old bensons advice and remained around the campfire but who would have imagined that big rock would play a fellow such a trick how in the world am i to get back again  from a great distance he could hear darry shouting to him he tried to answer his cousin but whether or not his voice was heard he could not tell  with his hands before him he moved around and scarcely had he taken a dozen steps when he slid down a rocky incline here there was water and he shivered thinking he might be dropping into an underground stream from which there would be no escape but when a pool was gained it proved to be but several inches deep  as joe stood in the pool there came a sudden rumble of thunder to his ears he listened and by the sounds became convinced that an opening into the outer air could not be a great way off then came an unexpected flash of reflected light on the rocks by his side  hurrah that light came from outside he cried im not buried alive after all but i may be a good way from daylight yet  he had some matches in his box and lighting one of these he discovered a passageway below him running off to his left further on he picked up a bit of dry wood and lit this it made rather a poor torch but proved better than nothing  now to get out and then to find my way back to where i left old benson was his mental resolve  with extreme caution he stole forward to where the lightning revealed a distant opening he did not leave one foothold until he was sure of the next for he had no desire to experiment with another moving rock  the thunder now reached his ears plainly and the lightning at times made the front of the cave as bright as day  its quite another place was his thought that dangerous passage connects the two  suddenly as joe was advancing he heard a clatter of horses hoofs and into the cave ahead rode three roughlooking men all armed with rifles and pistols and each carrying small saddlebags across his steed  at first joe thought to call out to the newcomers but he checked himself for their appearance was decidedly against them  ill try to find out something about them first he muttered perhaps they belong to that gang of bad men benson was telling us about yesterday and then as the three came to a halt in the center of the outer cave and dismounted he crept closer in the shadow of some sharp rocks to overhear what they might have to say     chapter iii  an important conversation   who ever saw such a downpour before growled one of the three men as he switched the water from his soft felt hat im wet to the skin  im no better off replied one of the others i think we were fools to leave macklins place gilroy  just what i think fetter said the third man we could have waited as well as not  yes we could have waited potts answered matt gilroy but to tell the truth i dont want to trust macklin too far he might play us foul  he wouldnt dare to do that returned gus fetter  why notif he thought he would get a reward came from nat potts the youngest of the trio one thing is certain macklin is crazy to make money  i know a thing or two of macklins pastthats why went on gus fetter if he got us into trouble i wouldnt keep silent about him and he knows it  macklin is slippery no two ways about it said matt gilroy as he took off his jacket and wrung the water out i am not inclined to trust him and that is all there is to it  did he ever belong to the old gang questioned nat potts some say he did and some say he didnt  he was a hangeron thats all came from matt gilroy he was always afraid to take the chances of being shot but was on hand when the spoils were divided they used him as a messenger and a spy but i dont believe he ever really helped to hold up a coach  humph then its a wonder the old crowd had anything to do with him  oh they had to have messengers and spies and they never gave macklin more than was coming to him you can bet on that i understand that when the riverton coach was held up six years ago and the gang got twentytwo thousand dollars they gave macklin five hundred and he was glad to get that  that was a big haul cried nat potts enthusiastically i wish i had been in it  the gang was followed for two daysby the soldiers under colonel fairfield went on matt gilroy as he threw himself on the rocks leaving his companions to start up a fire they had a hot time of it over to bear pass i can tell you two men were shot and one of them dan hickey my old chum died from his wounds they say colonel fairfield himself fired the shot that took poor hickey in the head and if thats sowell ive got an account to square with the colonel thats all  you can square that after weve had our little interview with the quartermaster returned gus fetter with a hard laugh  thats rightwell be sure to have the soldiers after us put in nat potts theyll be doubly mad when they learn that the holdup resulted in the emptying of the box with their wages  it will be a good haul if it goes through boys the quartermaster will be carrying not less than twelve thousand dollars of the governments money besides his other stuff returned matt gilroy  here the conversation came to a temporary end for nat potts had produced a black flask from which each of the men took a deep draught then potts and fetter started in to build a roaring fire at which all might dry their clothing leaving gilroy the leader of the crowd to do as he pleased  joe had listened to the talk with mingled interest and horror it did not take him long to realize the truththat these men were thoroughly bad and that they had been mixed up in road robberies of the past and were contemplating another robbery some time in the future  they mean to rob the quartermaster of the fort when he is bringing in the soldiers wages from rockspur he thought and that leader is going to shoot down the colonel if he can who would imagine men could be so bad and that leader seems to be educated too  joe would have been very much surprised had he known the truth which was that matt gilroy often called the shadow was a collegebred man having passed through one of the leading institutes of learning of the pacific coast but following this college career gilroy had forged checks and committed a burglary in company with an old chum named hickey and then the two had left sacramento between two days hickey had immediately joined the knights of the road and been shot down as previously mentioned gilroy had drifted first to the mississippi and then to denver and had not gone into the mountains until later now he was at the head of a desperate gang numbering ten or a dozen who had already committed several holdups of importance  soon the fire was burning brightly and the three men took off part of their wearing apparel that the articles might dry they had brought some food with them and as they sat eating and drinking they continued to discuss their plans nat potts who was not over nineteen or twenty was evidently something of a new member and asked many questions regarding the organization and as he took in what was told him so did joe listening with all ears as the saying goes  they must be as bad a crowd as can be found anywhere thought the youth i wonder what they would do with me if they found out i had been listening to their talk perhaps theyd kill me on the spot and he gave a shiver  the thunder and lightning had gradually abated but with the coming of night the rain continued as steadily as ever fortunately for the desperadoes however the rocks sloped away from the entrance to the cave so that no water came inside while the fire made everybody quite comfortable  hardly knowing what to do joe continued behind the rocks taking care to remain in the shadow more than once he was afraid one or another of the men would start to investigate the surroundings and that he would be discovered  i wish they would go to sleep he said to himself then i might get a chance to slip past them and their horses  with great impatience he watched the men finish up their supper get out their pipes and fall to smoking in the meantime the horses had been led to the opposite side of the cave and fastened to the rocks  as joe waited for a chance to get away he wondered what darry and old benson were doing more than likely they were looking for him but were they in that other cave at the narrow passageway or did the old scout know of this second cave and the secret entrance to it  if benson leads the way around to here there may be trouble he mused it would be better if i could get out and head him off but if i do get out how shall i turn to find the trail we were pursuing in this darkness a fellow couldnt see his hand before his face  at last fetter threw himself down on a blanket to rest leaving gilroy and potts still conversing earnestly by the fire the two desperadoes talked in a low tone so that joe now caught but little of what was said  the backs of both men were turned toward the side of the cave where joe was in hiding and plucking up courage the youth started forward on tiptoe bent upon getting out of the cave before the men should make some move which would expose him  step by step he advanced until he reached a point where he was within a dozen feet of gilroy and almost as close to potts he hardly dared to breathe and his heart thumped madly beneath his jacket but the men continued to smoke and talk unconscious of his proximity  at the entrance to the cave the rocks were somewhat rough and the mist had made them slippery joe was crawling forward rapidly when one foot slipped and he pitched headlong making considerable noise  what was that cried matt gilroy and leaped to his feet he had been gazing into the fire and for the moment could make out little in the darkness  i dont know returned nat potts something moving around out there i think and the younger man reached for his pistol which still remained in his belt  as rapidly as he could joe sprang to his feet a good bit of his wind had been knocked out of him but he felt that he must not delay and he ran for the outer air gasping for breath  hi stop roared matt gilroy catching sight of him at last stop i tell you  a boy ejaculated nat potts he must have been hiding in here  if he was he overheard too much growled gilroy come we must catch him by all means and he ran after joe with potts following     chapter iv  lost in the forest   i must get away from them  this was the one thought which surged through joe moores brain as he dashed from the cave in the mountain he felt that if he was captured it would go hard with him did the desperadoes learn that he had overheard their conversation they might make his very life pay the forfeit  forward he pitched into the rain and the inky darkness not knowing in what direction and just then caring but little his one idea was to put distance between himself and his pursuers  stop he heard the men call and heard the clicking of a pistol hammer then he reached some brushwood and crouching low continued to move on no shot came for the reason that the desperadoes could not locate him with certainty  at length joe reached a clump of trees had he not had his hands before him he might have run into them head first he glided around them and then continued onward down a slope leading into a broad belt of timber still with his hands before him he advanced through the undergrowth and between the stately trees for a distance of several hundred feet  he was now exhausted with running and with fighting the entangling vines and had to halt to catch his breath as he came to a stop he listened attentively to learn if the men were following but the downpour of rain drowned out every other sound  soaked to the skin hatless and still short of breath he went on once more feeling that he was not yet far enough from the cave for safety he tried to steer a course in the direction of the cave where he had left darry and the old scout but whether he was successful or not he could not tell  a hundred yards further and joe came to another slope covered with prairie grass down this he rolled in the darkness to bring up in more brush below then he climbed out of the hollow at the opposite side and reaching a large fallen tree sat down to rest and think over his situation the tree lay partly under one with widespreading branches so the boy was somewhat sheltered from the storm  it must be confessed that joes heart sank within him as he reviewed the situation where he was he could not tell nor could he form any definite plan for rejoining his cousin and old benson more than this he was afraid that the desperadoes might come up at any minute and pounce upon him  but as the minutes slipped by and he neither saw nor heard anything of those in pursuit he grew easier evidently they had given up the chase  i hope they have was what he thought i never want to get so close to them again they are a hard crowd if ever there was one if i can get to the fort and tell colonel fairfield of what ive heard ill be doing a good thing  an hour went by slowly and then joe looked around to find some means of making himself comfortable for the balance of the night knowing it would be useless to pursue his course through the forest in the darkness  this is camping out with a vengeance he muttered grimly darry ought to be along i guess hed soon get enough of it ill be lucky if i dont fall in with some savage animal  the thought of wild beasts gave him another shiver and he concluded to climb into a nearby tree which was lowdrooping and had a spot where several branches made a sort of platform he was soon up in a comparatively dry place and here he fell asleep being too tired to hold his eyes open longer  when joe awoke the storm had cleared away and the sun was struggling through the scattering clouds the forest still dripped with the rain and with this dripping were mingled the songs of the birds and the hum of insects  stiff from the wet he climbed slowly to the ground and looked around on every side were the tall trees and the dense undergrowth shutting off the distant view of everything but a towering mountain to the westward this was the mountain he and the others had been ascending when the storm had overtaken them  i suppose i may as well head in that direction he mused if i can strike the trail that will be something but ill have to keep my eyes open or i may fall into the hands of that gilroy gang  he was hungry but there were no means at hand with which to satisfy the cravings of his stomach and so he had to move forward without eating  getting into the forest had been difficult but getting out was even more of a task the underbrush at certain points was positively impassable and he had to make long detours which took time and tired him greatly at noon he was still in the forest and the mountain seemed as far off as ever  i am lost that is all there is to it he burst out with a groan i am lost and perhaps ill never get out  the sun shone down directly on his head and even though still wet he was glad enough to seek the shelter the stately trees afforded here and there he saw some berries of various hues but they were strange to him and he did not dare touch them for fear of being poisoned  toward the middle of the afternoon he reached a tiny brook flowing between the rocks and here he again rested he reached the conclusion that the brook came down from the mountain side and by following it up he must sooner or later run across the lost trail  ill follow it anyway he told himself and hungry and footsore set out along the watercourse  here the walking was somewhat better for he had no brushwood and vines to tear aside the brook was clear and he often saw trout and other fish darting hither and thither this gave him an idea and picking some berries he had seen he dropped them in at once some of the fish darted forward and swallowed the berries  hurrah a good bait he cried and quickly made himself a line out of threads from his clothing to this he attached a pin bent into shape with infinite care then he baited with the berries and dropped the line in over a rock near a cottonwood  hardly had his bait touched the water when a goodsized fish seized it and in a twinkling he had his catch landed his heart gave a bound for here was the material for at least one square meal  ill cook it right away he told himself after feeling to see if he had any matches his hunger was beginning to make him desperate and he did not much care even if the desperadoes did see his campfire  with some trouble he got together a few sticks of wood and some moss which the sunshine had dried out and soon he had a respectable blaze between two rocks with his jackknife he cleaned the fish as best he could and then broiled it on a green twig when done the meat was slightly burnt on one side and underdone on the other but to the halffamished lad nothing had ever tasted sweeter and he continued to eat until the whole fish was gone  now i feel like myself he muttered after washing down the repast with a drink from the brook on a pinch that meal ought to last me until tomorrow noon and surely i ought to find my way back to the others by that time  with renewed energy he continued his tramp along the brook often wading in the water when the brushwood on either side was extra thick he kept his eyes and ears on the alert but no human being came into sight and presently a great feeling of loneliness swept over him  im alone he whispered to himself alone i must say i dont like it much and he hurried on faster than ever  the sun was shining over the distant mountain when he reached a bend in the brook and came out upon a rocky trail which crossed the watercourse at a right angle as he looked at the trail he was tempted to shout with joy  the place we crossed yesterday morning he exclaimed there is the very spot where we got a drink and watered the horses now i ought not to have such a hard time finding the cave  he got down and examined the trail closely hoping to discover some hoofmarks but the heavy rain had washed everything clean nevertheless he felt certain that he was right and hurried along as fast as his tired limbs permitted  leaving the brook the trail wound in and out along a series of rocks and then through some heavy brushwood and along the edge of a jagged cliff the cliff was overgrown with heavy vines which hung down and brushed joes head as he passed  i cant be more than three or four miles from the cave thought the boy and if i hurry  he stopped short and then gave a cry of terror and with good reason he had seen the vines ahead suddenly part and now there came to view the shaggy head of a black bear as soon as the beast caught sight of the boy he leaped to the trail and advanced upon him     chapter v  the big black bear   joe had never before met a black bear in the open air but he had seen several in menageries and studied them at a safe distance and he realized that he was in a perilous position the bear looked both untamed and fierce and as if nothing would suit him better than to hug the lad to death and eat him up afterward  joe did not stand upon the order of his going but went instantly running as fast as his tired limbs would permit after him came the bear and it was astonishing what good time the beast could make considering his size and his general appearance of clumsiness looking over his shoulder the lad soon saw that the beast was slowly but surely lessening the distance between them  shoo he yelled and waved his arm threateningly but the bear did not mind in the least he trotted on until less than two rods separated boy and beast then joe reached some underbrush and rocks with a lowhanging tree in their midst and without stopping to think twice he climbed into the tree and to one of the upper branches  hardly had he reached what he thought might prove a temporary place of safety when he realized his mistake the bear came up the tree after himslowly it is true but still upand this caused joes hair to fairly stand upon end  im a gone one now he groaned and then espied another tree growing not far away a limb could just be reached and as the bear almost gained the boys foot joe swung himself from the first tree into the second  as the lad gained a safe spot on the tree limb the bear coming to a halt on the branch opposite set up a growl of rage and disappointment for a minute he surveyed the situation then came out on the branch slowly testing it inch by inch as it bent down he retreated letting out a second growl louder than the other  joe was wondering if he could drop to the ground and escape in that manner when he saw the bear descend and come quickly toward the tree he was on he watched the beast closely and waited until it was close to him then he made a leap back into the tree from which he had originally come  again the bear came out as far as possible on a limb and again he let out a growl of rage and disappointment in one way the situation was comical and joe might have laughed had he not felt so serious  we can keep this up a long time i reckon thought the boy and as long as you dont try to leap after me ill be safe  finding he could not reach the boy by coming up one tree or the other the black bear descended slowly to the ground then he walked around both trees several times and at last came to a halt between the two here he sank down as if to rest but nevertheless kept one eye open and fixed upon joe  hes going on guard he means to keep me treed muttered the boy and again his heart sank he remembered a story he had once read in which a bear had starved a man to death and eaten him afterward would mr bruin do so in this case  he wished he had a pistol or a huntingknife or even a fairsized stone but he had nothing except a thin club which he had cut for himself with his jackknife this he kept in hand and also kept the knife open and where he could get at it readily if needed  half an hour went bya time that to joe seemed a whole dayand still the black bear remained between the two trees dozing with one eye and watching with the other  the sight of the beast taking it so easy was maddening under the circumstances and at last the youth cut another club and hurled it down on top of the bear at once the beast flew up with a roar and standing on his hind legs snapped his teeth at joe then he flew up the tree once more faster than ever before  as the bear came up joe went higher than before having seen another friendly limb over his head he was sorely tempted to reach for the beast with his club but thought best not to run too much of a risk  as before the youth swung to the next tree and again the bear gave a growl and went down then being near the top of the tree the lad took a good look around  in a moment a sight caught his eye which caused his heart to jump with delight there on the trail were darry and old benson riding along slowly  hi hi this way he shouted with all the strength of his lungs this way darry this way benson  he saw his cousin and the guide bring their steeds to a halt and gaze around in wonder to them the voice appeared to come out of the very air itself  its joes voice exclaimed darry but i must say i dont see him  both gazed around and at last the scout caught sight of the boys handkerchief fluttering among the tree branches  there he is he exclaimed but whats he doing up there  this way went on joe and as they turned in the direction he added look out for the bear  a bear came from darry he must be treed  i reckon youve struck it muttered benson and hastily unslung his rifle at which darry did the same follow me but be on your guard went on the old scout  he advanced with caution his horse lifting his ears sharply as the neighborhood of the trees was gained presently the animal came to a sudden halt at the same moment benson caught sight of the bear  so thats where ye are muttered the old scout  the bear raised himself on his hind legs and let out a growl at the newcomers hardly had the sound arose upon the air when bensons rifle cracked and a bullet hit the beast in the breast down went the animal on all fours but did not tumble further instead he made a swift bound for the scouts horse  crack it was now darrys rifle that spoke up and the bear was hit again this time in the right front knee he dropped but quickly arose shaking the wounded leg in the air and uttering a tremendous roar of pain and rage  illustration now darrys rifle spoke up and the bear was hit again  neither horse would now stand still and both danced around so lively that each rider had all he could do to keep his saddle but even while his steed pranced in this fashion old benson managed to draw his pistol and two additional shots rang out both hitting the bear in the side the roars of the beast were now incessant and the horses threatened to bolt in spite of all the riders could do to stop them  come cried the old scout and turned from the scene thinking he meant to go off to reload darry followed but when at a safe distance benson sprang to the ground and tied his horse to a tree  id rather finish him afoot explained the old hunter and slipped another cartridge into his rifle you can stay here if you wish  not much murmured darry and came down also in a minute he was following the old scout when they came up a second time they found the bear crawling around roaring in a lower tone evidently he was more than half exhausted  another good shot will finish him sang out joe from a bottom limb of the tree why dont you give it to him in the ear  i will answered the old scout and circled around watching his opportunity at length it camethe rifle cracked sharply and bruin fell on his side to rise no more  hurrah thats a big haul cried darry much delighted i was wishing wed get a bear some time while we were out here  its lucky the bear didnt get joe remarked benson they generally come up a tree after their victim  i jumped from one tree to the other answered the youth but i had quite an exciting time i can assure you  how in the world did you get here questioned darry as joe leaped to the ground did you get through to another cave benson thought that might be the case  that was the case darry and ive had a wonderful adventure too added joe earnestly then he told his story to which the others listened with close attention when he came to mention gilroy fetter and potts old benson uttered a low whistle  so that gang has turned up again eh muttered the old scout this will be news to colonel fairfield i reckon hell be glad to be put on guard if the quartermaster was held up it would prove a big loss  is it true that colonel fairfield killed this gilroys chum  perhaps he did the colonel was in that mixup and after it was over dan hickey was found dead in the bushes but it was a fair fight and the desperadoes knew what to expect when they went in for it  when does the quartermaster expect to come through with the money  i dont know joe like as not it will be soon and that being the case we had better not lose time here but get to the fort just as soon as we can concluded the old scout     chapter vi  darry makes a discovery   as pressed as they were for time darry and joe begged that the bearskin be saved and did all they could toward helping the old scout skin the beast with the pelt they took along about twenty pounds of the juiciest steaks  its a pity to leave the rest to the wolves sighed joe but it cant be helped what a feast they will have  im going to sling the beast into a tree replied old benson that may help save it until somebody else comes this way the soldiers from the fort use the trail yonder you know  soon they were on the way to where benson and darry had left joes horse as joe was tired from his nights adventure his cousin and the old scout took turns in carrying him behind them even then his eyes would occasionally close  we cant make the fort tonight thats certain said the old scout  not if we pushed on hard asked darry  joe cant push on as fast as that darry hell want to rest as soon as sundown comes  perhaps i can get a nap at noon while you two get dinner ready suggested joe i wonder if well meet those rascals anywhere on the road i hope not for theyd be certain to recognize me  well keep an eye open for em responded benson dryly and see to it that your shootingirons are ready for use  whydo you think theyd attack us asked darry quickly  they mightif they thought we were carrying anything of value to such desperadoes all are fish that swim near their net  its a pity the government cant stamp such a gang out benson  the government has stamped out lots of em lad why ten years ago none of these trails was safe nearly every horseman and stagecoach was held up today you dont hear of a holdup once in six months  is this gilroy a very bad man  he isin a way hes a welleducated fellow so ive been told and not as brutal as some but hes committed some robberies that have no equal in the history of these parts once he painted himself as an indian and went to the agency and there collected a lot of money which was coming to the redskins the agent taking him for chief snowbird of the modocs the trick wasnt discovered until three days later when the real snowbird turned up even then it wasnt known who did the trick  and how was gilroy found out  a fellow named downes who belonged to the gang was captured and he gave the secret away but it cost downes his life for he got away from the soldiers and while he was in the mountains some of his gang shot and killed him  at this story both joe and darry shuddered  what a lawless set muttered joe one could hardly believe it unless he saw it with his own eyes  in a rough country the men are bound to be more or less rough lad look at california for instance today its as quiet and orderly as massachusetts or illinois but in the days of 49 it wasnt that way many a miner was held up for his gold dust and many a miners secret of a rich find was stolen from him and the miner himself murdered  and how long do you think it will take to make this territory perfectly safe  there aint no telling about that but probably when you are as old as i am now youll be able to travel anywhere without fear of being stopped the railroads are acoming in towns are building up and one of these days the desperadoes and stagecoach robbers will all be a thing of the pastand a good job done  the third horse had been found and now joe was riding in his own saddle the rain of the night before had made the trail dustless and the air was as pure and sweet as one could wish  by noon they calculated that they had covered ten miles of the worst portion of the distance to the fort the ride had been a strain to joe and when old benson called a halt he was glad enough to slip to the ground and throw himself in the shade of a tree to rest darry and the old scout lit a fire and soon had a nice steak preparing for dinner  hes asleep said darry a little later pointing to joe poor fellow supposing we let him rest for a couple of hours i havent the heart to wake him up  all right answered benson the pair ate their dinner without arousing joe and after it was over the scout sat down near at hand to smoke his stumpy brierroot pipe filling it with cutplug which was as black as coal and puffing away with keen satisfaction  darry was more restless and having put away the things used in preparing the meal he began an inspection of the neighborhood  be careful said old benson as the youth moved around dont get into trouble as joe did  ill keep my eyes open replied darry  opposite the trail was a tall spur of rocks with something of a series of natural steps leading to the top up these steps went the youth some of the climbing was difficult but this he did not mind  when the top was gained a magnificent panorama was spread out before him to one side were the tall mountains hidden in a bluish mist to the other the vast forests and plains northward was the continuation of the gap they were traveling and southward was a series of foothills with here and there a stream or waterfall glinting brightly in the sunshine  how grand he murmured what a vast country this is thousands upon thousands of people could live here and nobody be crowded this would make splendid pasture for cows and sheep and yet there isnt a single animal in sight  beyond the rocky spur was a similar elevation and presently darry crossed to this here there was a lone pine with several low branches and he drew himself up and climbed to the top he could now see much further than formerly and his view took in a portion of the trail passed several hours before as it wound serpentlike between the foothills  hullo he cried as he caught sight of something moving on the trail three people on horseback can they be the desperadoes joe met  he watched the riders with interest and at last felt certain they were three men fully armed and wearing slouch hats and lightcolored coats this description tallied with that given by his cousin and he hastened down to acquaint old benson with the news  must be the gang said the scout are they moving this way  yes  then we had better move on  joe was awakened and leaped to his feet looking rather bewildered  ii thought id take a little nap he stammered i suppose ive slept a good while havent i  about an hour and a half answered his cousin heres your dinner and he passed it over weve got to move on those rascals are behind us  behind us  dont get scared put in old benson they are a good distance back darry discovered em from yonder pint eat what you want and then it will be time enough to start  the repast was quickly disposed of by joe and soon they were in the saddle once more the long nap had refreshed the lad greatly and he said he would now be able to ride as far as anybody  on they went the trail growing more difficult as the top of the mountain was gained here there was a stiff breeze that at times was positively cold and both boys were glad enough to button their jackets tightly around them  if all went well benson calculated that they could reach hank leesons place with ease before dark this was the cabin of an old hunter and trapper who was known from one end of the territory to the other as mentioned at the beginning of this tale leesons place was twenty miles from the fort  i could ride right through said the old scout but you boys couldnt do it if you tried it youd be so sore and stiff the next day you couldnt stand up     chapter vii  at hank leesons cabin   at first the boys were inclined to think that the old scout was mistakenthat they could ride as far as anybody but when shortly after sunset they came within sight of hank leesons place both were glad to think that they would have to ride no more for the present  im sore already whispered darry to his cousin  so am ibut i didnt want benson to know it was the low answer that last mile of the trail was awfully rough  hank leeson had seen them coming and stood at the doorway of his cabin rifle in hand he was a tall thin man with black eyes that were exceedingly sharp and shrewd when he recognized sam benson he dropped his firearm into a corner and ran to meet the scout  downright glad ter see ye he said shaking hands sam yer a sight fer sore eyes thets wot  and im glad to see you hank responded benson just as warmly how have things been with you  putty slow to tell the truth leeson looked at the boys two tenderfoots along i see  yes this is joe moore brother to the captain up at the fort and this is darry germain his cousin boys this is hank leeson the best trapper and allaround shot in these parts  oh come dont be apraisin me so much cried leeson as he took the boys hands in a grip that made them wince as fer shootin ye kin do thet yerself as good as anybody sam he looked the boys over glad to know ye lads i know captain moore downright well and hes a good soldier  ive got news hank put in the old scout joe fell in with matt gilroys gang down near buckwater run  what roared the old trapper do you mean to tell me thet measly crowd is around here agin  three of em aregilroy fetter and a young fellow named potts i think potts comes from denver  i know him his father was ike potts the cardsharp thet blood is about as bad as any in the gang what are they up to  they are laying a trap for the quartermaster when he comes through with the soldiers money joe heard part of their talk by accident do you know when the quartermaster is expected  i do not ye see ever since old capn bissile was held up the army officers keep mum about the movements of the cashbox i reckon they have orders from washington to do it  i want to warn colonel fairfield as soon as i can went on the old scout  yes he ought to be warned  can you lend me a fresh hoss  i can  then ill be off as soon as ive had a bit of supper the boys can stay with you all night cant they  they can an welcome replied hank leeson  you are going to leave us queried joe  dont see any other way to do lad the sooner i get the news to the fort the better ill come back in the morning after youor send your brother or somebody else  we can ride it alone cant we questioned darry  i wouldnt try it if i were you the trail is a rough one and there are several forks where you might go astray  better stay with me lads put in leeson ill treat ye well never fear and he smiled broadly  thank you returned joe i was only thinking id like to see my brother soon thats all  a few hours more or less wont make much difference said darry he had looked around the trappers cabin and was interested let us wait and so it was arranged  it did not take long to get a bit of supper and in less than half an hour sam benson was off astride of a powerful steed which had been hank leesons pride for years  jest tell him to go to the fort said leeson and hell carry ye thar with his eyes shet and he gave a parting salute to the old scout  the cabin was a primitive affair of rough logs with the chinks filled with dried clay it contained two rooms each about twelve feet square back of the cabin was a leanto where leeson kept his horses two in number there was room for more animals so the beasts ridden by our friends were easily accommodated  night had fallen by the time the horses had been rubbed down and fed and the boys had finished their evening repast and it was dark when they gathered around the doorstep to rest hank leeson sat on a choppingblock cleaning his rifle and smoking at the same time and as the three rested joe told of his adventure in the cave and darry took up the tale of the bear  you had a lucky escape lad said the trapper a lucky escape an no error like as not them desperadoes would have killed ye had they caught ye  ive been thinkingdo you imagine theyll come here tonight asked darry  hank leeson shook his head  dont allow as they will about a year ago i gave thet fetter fair warnin if he showed his face about my cabin id plug him full o holes an i sent gilroy the same message they know me an know i wont stand any nonsense theyll be likely to give me a wide berth they know i aint got much worth stealin  then we ought to be safe until the soldiers get the news  reckon you will be lad answered the trapper  he was very much of a quaint character and for two hours the boys sat up listening to his tales of encounters with wild animals desperadoes and indians  ive had my own little fun with bars he said got in a tree onct and a bar kept me there fer a whole day i had wounded him in the leg and in running over a brook i dropped my gun  how did you get away asked darry  i didnt know what to do fust the bar had me foul and kept right at the bottom of the tree all the time with his wounded leg he couldnt come up and i didnt dare to go down and there we wasalookin at each other he agrowlin and i asayin all kind o unpleasant things about him  didnt you have a pistol  no all i had with me at the time was a powderhorn a matchbox and my pocketknife what to do i didnt know and i was athinkin id be starved out when a thought struck me to blow him up with powder  blow him up cried both boys  thets wot ladsblow him up i had a handkerchief ye see an into this i dumped bout half my powder an into the powder i put three matches with the ends pointing out then i tied powder an matches into a hard lump and watched my chance there was a flat rock near the roots of the tree and putty soon mr bar squatted on this rock then i let drive fer the rock an the powder an matches landed good an hard i can tell ye  and exploded put in joe eagerly  yes exploded with a noise ye could hear most a mile i calkerlate the powder flashed straight up into thet bars face blindin him and tearing his jaw half off and the way he ran to save himself was a caution as soon as he was gone i dropped down and ran for my gun then i made after the bar and caught him between the rocks and finished him  this was the last story told that night and soon after the tale was concluded leeson showed the boys into the inner room of the cabin where there was something of a rough bed with a straw mattress  make yerselves ter hum he said it aint no hotel but its the best ive got to offer ye  but we dont want to turn you out said darry  ill make myself comfortable near the door answered leeson i want to sleep with one eye openin case those rascals should take a notion to come this way  the boys were glad enough to rest indoors again and take off the clothing they had worn during the storm  camping out is well enough declared joe but i dont want too much of it  oh weve seen the worst side of it returned darry i expect lots of good times when we get to the fort  oh so do i for the matter of that  after turning in it did not take long for the cousins to get to sleep and a little while later hank leeson also threw himself down to rest but the old trapper remained close to the doorstep and slept with his rifle near at hand  an hour went by and the darkness and silence continued there was no moon and only a few stars were visible at a distance a few night birds were calling and occasionally the howl of some lonely wolf could be heard but that was all  at last from out of the darkness of the trail came three men on foot they were matt gilroy and his companions they had tethered their horses in the bushes some distance away they stole toward the cabin like so many grim and silent shadows     chapter viii  the stealing of the horses   go slow men came softly from gilroy you know what kind of a man leeson is  reckon i do know came in a growl from fetter and ive got an account to settle with him too  im pretty certain the boy is here went on the leader but we must make sure if the others are here too or if they have ridden off to the fort if they have gone to the fort  hist came in warning from potts youre talking too much ive heard that this leeson sleeps with his ears wide open  he does grumbled fetter and then the three desperadoes relapsed into silence  they were advancing upon the cabin from the rear and each held a ready pistol in his hand while his rifle was slung over his back they had seen the boys and benson head for the trappers home while it was still light and they were on a high cliff but darkness had closed in on the scene and they had come up to the spot in ignorance of what had followed  tiptoeing their way they reached the leanto where the horses had been stabled and with caution gilroy went inside by feeling the animals he soon learned that three had been in use but a few hours before while the fourth was cool and comfortable  their horses are here he announced and a fourth is here too  thats leesons answered fetter but i thought he had two or three  might as well take them while we have the chance murmured potts four nags will bring some money over at highwater we can get gingo to sell em  let them out answered gilroy without horses theyll have their hands full trying to follow us  it was no easy task to untie the horses in a place that was pitchdark and it took some time to get even the horses belonging to our friends released  as fetter and potts took the animals out gilroy worked to untie the sturdy mare belonging to hank leeson this was a pet animal and not used to strangers as gilroy caught hold of the halter she gave a neigh of suspicion  hush murmured the desperado and ran his hand down the mares nose but this made her skittish and she stamped sharply half a dozen times  whats up thar came in hank leesons voice and the trapper was wide awake on the instant whoa nancy whoa  hang the luck muttered gilroy and ran outside after fetter and potts he must have been on the watch  we must get out responded fetter hes a sureshot remember nothing but the darkness can save us  im going came from potts and he leaped on the back of one of the horsesthat which joe had been riding  im with you said fetter and mounted old bensons steed come matt and be quick about it  by this time hank leeson was running around the corner of the cabin gun in hand his call had aroused joe and darry and they were pulling on their clothing with all speed  something is wrong exclaimed joe  it must be those desperadoes responded his cousin  the boys were not yet dressed when they heard a clatter of hoofs and a shot followed by another  then they came out rifles in hand to find leeson reloading near the stable  those desperadoes have been here exclaimed the old trapper they ran off with your hosses consarn em  went off with the horses repeated darry did you shoot at them  i did but the lights against me and i dont reckon as how i hit anything hank leeson meditated for a moment ive half a mind ter do ityes i have he muttered  do what asked joe  go after em on my mare would you be afraid to stay here alone if i went  no go ahead cried both boys  well keep watch while you are away continued joe  if you can get the horses back it will be a great favor said darry the three are worth over five hundred dollars  without further words hank leeson dashed into the stable untied his mare and mounted her rifle over shoulder and pistol in hand he dashed away on the back trail whence the desperadoes had disappeared soon he was swallowed up in the darkness although they heard the hoofbeats of nancy for several minutes after  this is the worst yet was joes comment when they were alone those fellows are as daring as they are rascally i never dreamed they would come up in that fashion i wonder what they would have done if leeson hadnt woke up  perhaps we would all have been murdered answered his cousin with a shudder what shall we do now we are dressed  that depends upon how long leeson remains away i move we remain on guardone at the front of the cabin and the other at the rear if we keep our eyes peeled they cant come very close even though it is dark  all right joe keep your rifle handy  dont fear about that darry  they were soon on guard the one on the doorstep and the other near the leanto on a stump thus an hour dragged by to both it was an unusually long while  i dont see a thing said darry coming to where his cousin rested  nor i and im getting sleepy i hardly think leeson will be back until morning  just what i was thinking let us take turns at watching the one on duty can walk around the cabin now and then and that will give each of us some sleep  this was agreed upon and they tossed up to see who should go on guard first it fell to darrys lot and joe hardly able to keep his eyes open quickly retired without undressing  darrys vigil was certainly a lonely one doubly so because it was new to him as he tramped slowly around the cabin he could not help but contrast this situation with the one he was used to at home  i dont know as id like to be a night policeman or a nightwatchman he reasoned they must be awfully tiresome jobs and the city isnt near as lonely as this either even in the middle of the night he drew a long breath and looked at his watch gracious only threequarters of an hour gone and ive got an hour and a quarter still to serve how awfully slow it is if leesonwhats that  he broke off short and came to a halt with his rifle in his hands and his gaze fixed on some brushwood a hundred feet to the rear of the stable he had seen some dark object moving but whether it was man or beast he could not tell  it was something im sure of that he told himself after the object had disappeared from view if it was a man he must have been crawling on hands and knees  he wondered if he had better awaken joe but hesitated knowing how sleepy his cousin was perhaps the object would go awayif it was a wild beast  keeping his eyes on the spot darry waited what seemed to him a long time but which was really but a few minutes then slowly the bushes parted and the object came forth with eyes that gleamed fitfully even in that darkness  a mountain wolf muttered the boy well im glad it isnt one of those desperadoes  taking up a stone he hurled it at the wolf at the same time shouting to the beast to go away at once the wolf turned tail and disappeared whence it had come  did you call came sleepily from joe  theres a wolf in the bushes back of the cabin returned darry  does he want to attack you  i dont know i just threw a stone at him and hes slunk out of sight  by this time joe was also outside and the two cousins waited for the reappearance of the wolf  but the animal was cowardly and did not show himself again and presently joe returned to bed the remainder of the night passed without anything unusual happening     chapter ix  arrival at the fort   the morning found the two boys still alone the sun was well up over the eastern prairie before both were dressed for they had taken turns at guarding as agreed and each had consequently lost half his regular sleeping time  well whats to do now questioned darry while they were stirring around getting breakfast  i dont know of anything to do but to wait here until we hear from benson and hank leeson answered his cousin  breakfast was soon disposed of and then they sat down to wait still keeping their firearms close to hand in case of unexpected attack the meeting with the desperadoes had opened the boys eyes and they did not intend to be caught napping no matter what else happened  shortly before ten oclock joe espied three horsemen coming down the trail which led to the fort both watched the approaching riders with interest and presently saw that they were soldiers one wore the uniform of a lieutenant and the others were privates  you are from the fort cried joe running forward to meet them  yes was the answer from the lieutenant which of you is joseph moore  i am  i am glad to know you moore your brother the captain and i are great friends i am lieutenant richard carrol  oh ive heard of you answered joe smiling will has often mentioned his chum dick carrol in his letters this is my cousin darry germain did old benson reach the fort last night  he did answered lieutenant carrol as he shook hands with both boys and your brother and a detachment of company a have gone out to look for matt gilroy and his gang benson went with them and i was asked to come down here and escort you to the fort  if my brother wants to round up gilroys gang he should have come here said joe the rascals were here last night and stole our three horses  is it possible and where is hank leeson  he went after them on his horse the only one they didnt get we are looking for his return at any moment we promised to watch the cabin until he got back  i see the lieutenant turned to the privates men you may dismount and tie up the horses for the present we wont be going back just yet  lieutenant carrol leaped to the ground and one of the privates took charge of his steed the young officer was a handsome fellow with a smiling face and both joe and darry took to him at once  yes captain moore and i are great friends he said you see we went through west point together and we have been more or less together ever since he has often told me about you two fellows so i feel as if ive known you for a long while he looked at joe you must have had quite an adventure with those desperadoes at the cave  i did have answered joe i hope my brother and the others round them up do you know if they came anywhere near here  no they struck off on another trailthe one the quartermaster is expected to use you see he is to come in tomorrow with that money  tomorrow then theyll have time to warn him  that depends upon circumstances the quartermaster is an odd sort of a fellow and sometimes changes his mind about routes he may come in the way we expect and he may take some entirely different trail  we cant say when leeson will be back put in darry but it seems to me it is our duty to stay here until he returns dont you think so joe  i do darry but he will probably be back before long  it was only a few minutes later when one of the privates came forward with the information that a man was coming through the underbrush skirting the timber it was hank leeson and he held his mare to a walk for nancy was all but exhausted  mornin lieutenant he called out as he drew closer and saluted come for them boys i reckon  i did leeson they tell me youve been after the gang what luck  hank leeson shook his head dubiously reckon i didnt have any luck lieutenant got one shot but if i hit it didnt count much they had the best o me in the timber and they got away not only with the hosses belonging to the boys an benson but likewise with their own which they had tethered in a hollow not far away  then our horses are gone cried darry his face falling  thets it lad im sorry but i did my best  oh i dont blame you leeson butbut if we havent any horses how are we to get to the fort  well take turns at carrying you replied lieutenant carrol  hank leeson was as worn out as his mare and while one of the soldiers cared for nancy the old trapper sank down on his doorstep and told his story he had followed the desperadoes up hill and down for fifteen miles and gotten one shot at fetter which he believed had struck the rascal in the arm but the party had turned on the trail while passing through a wide patch of timberland and on coming out at the other side he had been unable to locate them again then as it was almost morning he had thought best to return to his cabin to ascertain how the boys were faring  which road were they near when you saw them last asked lieutenant carrol  over at hunkwaters rock answered leeson moving toward the knob  humph then i am afraid captain moore wont round them up very quickly  my brother didnt go near that trail questioned joe  no hes on a trail three miles further north still the desperadoes may turn north  thats so said leeson  as there was nothing to keep them at the cabin the boys were now anxious to move on to the fort and a short while later lieutenant carrol set off one private carried joe and the other darry and as the horses were powerful beasts good progress was made  hurrah the fort cried joe as he caught sight of a large flag waving in the distance he was right and soon they could see the tall stockade quite plainly it was three hundred feet long by two hundred feet wide and surrounded by a ditch twelve feet deep inside of the stockade were the fort proper and a dozen other buildings including the officers quarters the mens quarters the messroom hospital and the gymnasium and also a goodsized stable  why its a regular town in itself murmured darry when they got inside  thats right a town of exactly two hundred and seventyfive people answered the lieutenant and of that number two hundred and sixty are soldiers belonging to three companies three are officers wives two are indian scouts and the rest are cooks and other helpers  colonel fairfield a tall dignified old officer had been told of their approach and now came from the officers quarters to meet them  i am glad to see you boys he said as he shook hands warmly if the story benson told is true you have had quite a few adventures in reaching here i am sorry your brother is not here to meet you joseph but he was anxious to go after the gilroy gang and i let him have his way  you havent heard about all of our adventures colonel said darry and told of the stolen horses  worse and worse returned the colonel stroking his mustache thoughtfully that proves that the gangor what is left of itis as desperate as ever those fellows will never give up until they are either arrested or shot down  i hope my brother doesnt get into trouble with them said joe anxiously  well a soldier has to take some risks my boy but captain moore is as shrewd as he is brave so you need not fear for his safety come right in mrs fairfield will be glad to see you she wants to hear from all the folks at home  the boys followed the old officer into the quarters and here received an equally warm greeting from mrs fairfield whom they had met in chicago dinner was soon served and while the lads were satisfying the inner man they had to tell their whole story over again and also tell all the news from home  while you are here boys you must make yourselves perfectly at ease said the colonel i know your fathers will expect me to be a father to you as for captain moore i will allow him to be with you as much as military discipline permits     chapter x  the result of a swim   to the boys who had never visited a military quarters before the fort proved of great interest and they were glad after the meal was over to have lieutenant carrol take them around this occupied some time and when they had finished it was time for the evening parade  this was quite an affair and the two lads joined the ladies of the place to witness it everybody turned out in uniform as clean as possible on inspection the drums rolled the fifers struck up a lively air and the three companies headed by a major marched around the stockade several times and then to the paradeground in front of the gates here the command went through the manual of arms and through a number of fancy evolutions  its splendid murmured joe everything moves like clockwork  it makes me almost wish to be a soldier answered darry but if a fellow had this day in and day out i am afraid he would grow tired of it  you are right darry said mrs fairfield the colonel has to think up a great number of things whereby to interest his men they get up all sorts of contests and concerts and theatricals and go hunting when they can get the chanceanything to keep them from growing too dull  have they had any real military duty to do lately asked joe  not for over a year then the modoc indians got up a sundance and they had to march over to kedahmina and stop it two indians were killed and one soldier was badly wounded since that time the indians have been quiet  but the indians may rise again  probably they willone is never sure of them as one old general has said the only safe indian is the dead indian  the boys were assigned to a small room next to that occupied by captain moore and lieutenant carrol the apartment was neatly furnished with iron cots an iron washstand and a small wardrobe for extra clothing fortunately the extra clothing they had carried had not been stolen so they were not as bad off as they would otherwise have been  joe was anxious to hear from his brother will but had to be patient yet he was not greatly worried for he was almost certain that the soldiers would fail to fall in with the desperadoes each having taken a different trail  the day following their arrival the boys fell in with several soldiers who were going fishing up a mountain stream not far away having obtained special leave of absence for that purpose the soldiers who were named biggs ferry and lambert were glad enough to have the boys for company  well show you some good sport said lambert who proved to be something of a leader no better fish in these parts than those you can catch in rocky pass river  the boys had no fishingtackle but lieutenant carrol fitted them out and soon the party was on the way the soldiers were to be gone but four hours and so struck out at a gait that taxed joe and darry to the utmost to keep up with them  its the air does it explained biggs when darry spoke about the speed after youve been out here a while youll eat like a horse and feel like walking ten miles every morning before breakfast i tell you the air is wonderful  it certainly is bracing answered darry i noticed that as soon as we began to climb the foothills  a walk of half an hour brought them to rocky pass river and they journeyed along the bank until they came to a favorite fishinghole  here we are said lambert now for the first fish  ten cents to whoever catches it cried joe and placed a shining dime on a nearby tree stump at this the three soldiers laughed  that dime is mine declared ferry who was the first to throw in  perhaps answered biggs but i reckon ive got just as good a chance now  here i come put in lambert and threw over his friends heads hardly had his bait gone down than he felt a tug and whipped in a little fish not over six inches long  mine he cried  it isnt worth ten cents cried biggs and ferry nevertheless lambert pocketed the coin amid a general laughing  the boys now went to a spot a little above where the soldiers were fishing and set to work on their own lines just as ferry announced a fine haul they threw in and soon everybody in the party was busy bringing in several kinds of fish big and little including some fine trout of a variety the boys had not before seen  inside of an hour everybody had all the fish he wanted and then the soldiers said they were going to take a swim the boys were willing and soon the whole crowd were in the water calling out and laughing and having a good time generally  dont go too far down the stream cautioned lambert the falls are below and you might get caught in the rapids  all right well surely remember answered joe  ill race you across the river and back said darry a little later  done cried joe to what point  to that willow hanging down near the big rock  so it was agreed and in a minute both boys were off they were good swimmers and the race interested the soldiers so that they gave up sporting around to watch the result  at this point the stream widened out to nearly two hundred feet so the race was not a particularly short one the water ran quite swiftly and they soon found they had to swim partly up stream to prevent being carried below the willow  darry made the mark first and touching the willow started on the return joe was close behind and now it became a neckandneck race between them  go it boys shouted lambert do your best  i bet on joe said ferry  i bet on darry added biggs  hardly had the wager been made when joe shot ahead slowly but surely he drew away from his cousin  while the sport was going on nobody had noticed a large tree that was drifting rapidly down the middle of the river now however lambert saw the danger  look out he cried wildly look out a tree is coming down upon you  joe heard the cry and looking up the stream managed to get out of the way of the big piece of driftwood but darry was not so fortunate and in a twinkling the youth was struck and carried out of sight  this accident came so quickly that for the moment nobody knew what to do  darry darry cried joe where are you  he went under shouted lambert the tree branches struck him on the head  hell be drowned gasped biggs what shall we do  by this time the tree had drifted past the point where the soldiers were stationed joe had now struck bottom with his feet and at once went ashore  we must do something he panted we cant let darry be drowned  he must be caught under the branches said lambert as the tree hit him it turned partly over perhapsthere is his foot  he pointed to the treeand there sure enough was darrys left foot kicking wildly above the surface of the river then the boys head came up but only for a moment  save me he spluttered and immediately disappeared  this is awful groaned joe cant we throw a fishingline over the tree and haul it ashore  a good idea answered lambert well take two lines  he caught up the fishingtackle and lines in hand ran along the river bank until he was below the tree the others followed and helped him to get the lines into shape then a quick cast was made but the lines fell short  too bad came from joe quick try once more  the tree is turning over again shouted biggs and he was right as some other branches came into view they beheld darry caught in a crotch and held there as if in a vise  another cast was made and then a third but all in vain then the tree with its helpless victim moved forward more rapidly than ever in the direction of the roaring falls which were but a short distance off     chapter xi  something about drilling   darry is lost nothing can save him now  such was the agonizing thought which rushed through joes brain as he watched the progress of the drifting tree as it moved swiftly toward the falls of rocky pass river  he knew the falls to be over thirty feet high at the bottom was a boiling pool which sent up a continual shower of spray nobody entering that pool could survive  darry too realized his peril and continued to call for help had he been able to loosen himself he would have leaped into the water but he was weak and helpless and his voice could scarcely be heard above the rushing of the rapids  joe and the three soldiers continued to run along the river bank over rough rocks that cut their feet and through bushes which scratched them in scores of places at last they came out on a point directly above the falls  the tree still spun on and joe closed his eyes to shut out the sight of what was to follow  suddenly lambert let out a shout  the tree is caught it has stopped moving  again joe looked and he saw that what the soldier said was true the under branches of the drifting tree had hit some sharp rocks below the rivers surface and one branch had wedged itself fast  this catching of the driftwood bent down the limb that held darry and soon they saw that the imperiled boy was free from the grip which had held him but what to do next the lad did not know to swim to the shore was out of the question  ii cant make it he told himself as he panted for breath he was so exhausted that he felt very much like fainting away but he knew he must keep his senses or all would be over with him  darry darry are you much hurt called out joe  not much but ii cantswimashore was the gasped out answer  ill try the fishing lines again said lambert and prepared them once more a first cast did not reach darry but a second did and he caught the sinkers to the lines with a good deal of satisfaction  will they hold questioned joe  i hope so answered lambert anyway its the best we can do  letting the lines run out as far as possible the soldiers and joe moved up the bank of the stream to where there was a series of rocks projecting into the water a distance of several yards  now brace me and i will haul in said lambert then he called to darry to help them by swimming as well as he was able with the lines caught around him under the arms  all right im ready cried the boy and dropped into the stream taking care to steer clear of the tree  lambert hauled in slowly but steadily the line straightened out and became taut and looked as if it might snap at any instant joes heart came up into his throat and he breathed a silent prayer that his cousin might be saved  here he comes muttered lambert at length and they could see that darrys feet at last rested on the sandy bottom of the river they continued to haul in and soon he was safe when on shore he pitched himself on the grass completely exhausted  oh how glad i am cried joe as he knelt beside his cousin i was almost certain youd be drowned  it was a narrow escape answered dairy when he could speak when the tree first struck me i was almost stunned and when i realized what had happened i found myself fast and hardly able to budge just look there and he showed a deep scratch on one side of his body and a heavy red mark on the other but never mind he went on i am thankful my life was spared  it was a soberminded party that dressed and journeyed back to the fort joe carrying both his own fish and those his cousin had caught  i am afraid that will end fishing and swimming for a while said biggs the soldiers never go near the falls for they all know the danger but colonel fairfield is too strict to run any chances  dont say anything about the adventure on the tree said darry  will you keep mum  i will and so will you wont you joe  yes  so it was arranged that nothing should be said that the soldiers little recreation might not be interfered with for both boys saw that they had little pleasure at the best  a fine haul for you boys said lieutenant carrol as he surveyed the catch i must go myself and try my luck i havent been fishing this summer  its a splendid place for bites said joe  i know it but you have to be careful up there theres a nasty fall in the river if you went over that youd never come out alive  yes we saw the fall answered darry and gave a shudder in spite of himself  again at sunset there was a parade similar to that of the day before after it was over the boys procured guns and had lambert put them through their paces as he called it  first well drill a bit without guns said the old soldier for lambert had seen sixteen years of service toe this line heads up chest out and little fingers on the seams of your trousers thats all right now then eyes right when i say that turn your eyes to the right but dont move your faces now eyes front thats good eyes left eyes front thats firstrate  but were not moving said darry  now well move watch me right face do you see how its done balance on the heel this way and swing around now then right face  the two boys came around like welltrained old soldiers  good boys good now then front face good left face thats not so well front face now heres another about face  so the drilling went on until the boys could move as lambert wished them to then they began to march and to wheel right and left at last he put the guns in their hands and let them march with the pieces and then showed them the manual of arms  illustration at last he put the guns in their hands and let them march with the pieces  youll learn in no time said the old soldier when his off time came to an end youve crowded a dozen lessons into one  and i feel it said darry im going in to rest and he went followed by joe all told the boys had enjoyed the drill very much  joe was somewhat worried when bedtime came and still nothing had been heard of his brother yet colonel fairfield told him not to mind the prolonged absence  but should not your quartermaster be here asked the boy  he may come in tomorrow morning answered the colonel  the next day dawned cloudy and by noon a steady rain was falling the boys hardly knew what to do and after watching a drill and some performances in the gymnasium went back to the living quarters they had hardly entered when there came a shout from the guard at the stockade  captain moore is coming with the quartermaster was the cry  hurrah its will shouted joe and ran out despite the rain to welcome his brother  soon the soldiers came up mudstained and tired they embraced half of company a and in their midst was the quartermaster of the regiment with two attendants each of these three carried heavy saddlebags filled with government money for the soldiers for payday was now due  joe cried captain moore as he dismounted and caught his brother by the hand i am glad to see you safe and sound  and i am glad to see you answered joe  i will be with you sooni must first report to colonel fairfield went on the young officer and lost no time in seeking the commandant  his story was soon told and it speedily spread to all parts of the fort along with his men and old benson he had looked in vain for the gilroy gang for a whole day then he had come upon them just as they were preparing for an attack upon the quartermaster and his escort the gang had numbered eight and in the fight which had followed two of the crowd had been wounded although all had made their escape by swimming their steeds over a dangerous mountain torrent of the soldiers three had been wounded one man quite seriously the young captain had received a bullet through his hat  it was matt gilroy himself who fired that shot said captain moore and i wont forget it when next we meet  old benson had been in the thickest of the fight from beginning to end and it was he who had wounded one of the desperadoes while the fellow was in the act of carrying off one of the moneybags the rascals had fought hard over that moneybag but in the end had been compelled to drop everything and ride to save their lives  as soon as captain moore had made his report another detachment was sent out to follow the desperadoes if they could be found this detachment was fifty strong and under the leadership of lieutenant carrol the lieutenant was a man who had met numerous desperadoes in his time and it was felt that he could do the work much better than the average soldier     chapter xii  deer hunting   with his brother at hand joe felt much more at home than formerly and the captains presence also made a difference to his cousin old benson remained at the fort for the time being and did what he could to please the boys  he took an especial interest in their shooting and would often set up a target on the prairie for them to practice on  youll do firstrate in a little while he said and as lambert says you take to drilling it wont be long afore youre both outandout soldiers  i dont know as i care to be a regular soldier answered darry i wouldnt mind it for a while but to enlist for five yearswhy thats another thing  lambert has enlisted four times when his time is out hell be in service twenty years  and yet he is only a private put in joe  he is content and doesnt want to go any higher he likes the life and he told me not long ago that he wouldnt know what to do with himself if he was out of uncle sams employ  one day after another passed until the boys had been at the fort a little over a week they now knew the drills and the timecard as well as anybody and often practiced on the apparatus in the gymnasium  its not so bad after you once get used to it said joe the men are a good deal of company for each other  its odd to see so many men and so few women returned darry  some of the men dont want any women around so ive been told they are like some of the oldtime miners who used to move out of camp as soon as a dressskirt showed itself  one day captain moore and old benson got permission to go off on a hunt and took the boys along all of the party were mounted and each carried a saddlebag with part of the necessary camping outfit  if its possible to do so ill show you some big game announced the old scout although ill allow big game is mighty scarce even in these parts  have the hunters shot down everything asked joe  a good bit lad you see many used to come out here just to shoot for the sake of killing ive known a party of six men to kill twenty or thirty buffalo and then leave the carcasses to the wolves that was a shame  so it was cried darry one or two buffalo would have been enough  some hunters never know when to stop put in captain moore they shoot as long as anything shows itself if it wasnt for that these hills would be filled with buffalo deer bears and all other kind of game  the morning was clear and cool and everybody in the party was in the best of spirits the course was down into a broad valley in the middle of which flowed the rocky pass river and then up a series of hills leading to tom long mountaina favorite resort in this territory for sportsmen  do you think well see or hear anything of those desperadoes asked joe of his brother as they rode along side by side  its not likely answered the young captain as soon as they learn that the soldiers are after them theyll take to their heels in doublequick order they havent any taste for meeting our regulars  its queer that this matt gilroy should go in for this sort of lifeif he is as well educated as you say  some men dont like anything better joethey wouldnt earn their living honestly if they could its queer that this is so but its a fact those men have no regular homes although many often talk of settling down generally they die with their boots on as the saying goes  by noon the party had covered fifteen miles and were well into the hills they came to a rest beside a fine spring which flowed from a split in the rocks near at hand was some dense brushwood and old benson rightfully guessed that it would not be difficult to beat up some birds  you can now try your luck at aiming he said to the boys and led the way into the dense growth soon a flock of birds arose directly before them and both darry and joe took a quick shot bringing down seven of the quarry then the scout fired and five other birds dropped  pretty good for a starter cried old benson as they stalked around picking up the game that target practice has made you both pretty steady just a round dozen all told thats aplenty for dinner i reckon  captain moore was also pleased when told of what his brother and his cousin had accomplished youll make great hunters in time he said the main thing is to keep your nerve when big game confronts you you know you have the best of a bird or squirrel or anything like that but when it comes to a buffalo or a bear  i know all about bears interrupted joe and at this there was a general laugh if i ever meet another bear i want to be well prepared for him he continued  generally a wild animal wont fight went on the young captain but when one is cornered he is apt to get very ugly eh benson  right you are captain i was once cornered by a buffalo and had all i could do to save myself  the old scout calculated that they would strike some game that afternoon and he was not mistaken about two oclock they sighted several deer far up the hillside  fine plump animals said benson if we get a couple of them we can be well satisfied  it was decided that they should move around in a semicircle so as to get to leeward of the herd  if we dont do that the deer will scent us and be off in no time explained captain moore  their horses were tethered in the brush near some trees and the party of four started out on foot the way was rough but the boys did not mind this their sole thought was upon the deer and each resolved to bring down one of the game no matter at what cost  it was no light task to reach a spot from which to shoot they had to cross several depressions on the hillside and here the undergrowth was so heavy that progress at times seemed impossible once darry went into a hole up to his waist and came out with several rents in his coat where the thorns had clung to him  oh he muttered oh  are you hurt questioned joe quickly  not much but i reckon im a good deal scratched up answered darry with a wry face  at last they gained a point well to leeward of the quarry and benson brought the party to a halt  well creep in as far as we can he said but keep your guns ready for use and as soon as one fires the others had best fire too for the deer wont wait after one shot which will you take captain  ill take the one near the big rock answered captain moore joe you had better take the one on the knoll  i will  ill take the one rubbing his side with his prong put in darry  and ill take the one coming through the brush finished old benson now then forward make no noise and be sure your gun doesnt go off and hit somebody else instead of the deer  rifles in hand they crept through the underbrush and down toward the glade in which the deer were feeding  the animals did not become suspicious until they were less than a hundred yards away then of a sudden the leader threw up his head and began to sniff the air  now fire said benson in a low tone  at once the four rifles came up and each hunter took steady aim darry and joe fired at the same instant and the young captain and benson discharged their pieces immediately after  the aim of the two older hunters was true and two deer fell dead after going less than six steps but the other game was only wounded joes deer in the side and darrys in the flank and they bounded away up the hillside  missed groaned joe and slipped another cartridge into his firearm darry did the same and both fired a second time then seeing how badly the deer were wounded they ran after the animals  the course of the deer was straight for the timber down the mountainside and through the brush crashed quarry and boys until another hundred yards were covered then coming to a rocky cliff and being unable to leap to the top the deer came to a halt  do you see em panted darry almost out of breath with running  yesthere they are returned joe see  i do they cant get up the rocks joe weve got em after all we must shootgracious  the boy broke off short and with good reason the deer had spotted them and now without warning turned and ran straight for both as if to gore them to death     chapter xiii  a fish and a snake   look out darry or hell kill you  look out for yourself joe  these cries were followed by two shots as both the young hunters discharged their weapons but in their haste the aim of each was poor and the bullets flew wide of the mark then the maddened deer came closer and both boys took to their heels running as they had never run before  hi whats up came in old bensons voice  the deer are after us yelled joe shoot em quick  hardly had the lad spoken when he felt one of the deer close behind him he leaped to one side and the animal charged past with great vigor considering how badly he was wounded but that charge was his last for bensons rifle spoke up and the animal fell lifeless where he stood  in the meantime darry was having his hands full with the second deer the youth had been unable to reload and now he found himself in a thicket with the deer fairly on top of him he caught his firearm by the barrel and hit the animal a resounding blow on the head this made the deer stagger back and pause  help help yelled the boy somebody shoot this beast  im coming came in captain moores voice where are you  here in the bush quick or hell stick me to death  the deer was now charging with lowered head he was in a fearful rage as he came on there was a sharp report and the young captain burst into view his rifle barrel still smoking then the deer gave one last leap into the air and came down upon darry the fall knocked the boy senseless  while captain moore was removing the weight from darrys body the old scout came up followed by joe  hullo he got it did he said benson is he badly hurt  i hope not answered the young captain you see the deer didnt touch him until i fired then he leaped up and knocked my cousin down  hope there aint any bones broken  the deer was removed and benson went off to get some water when he came back captain moore and joe were rubbing darrys wrists the water was dashed into the unconscious youths face and soon he gave a gasp and opened his eyes  the deer were his first words  you are safe said the captain reassuringly the deer is dead  oh darry uttered a sigh of relief i was thinking he was goring me to pieces  you had a narrow escape put in old benson if it hadnt been for the captain he would have mauled you for certain didnt you hear me yell to be careful  i thought it would be an easy matter to bring him down after he was wounded said darry still gasping for breath  any bones broken questioned captain moore  ii guess not darry gave a sigh and sat up how did joe make out  i am all right answered that individual benson did the trick for me though benson i owe you a good deal  and i owe you a good deal said darry turning to his cousin  im glad i came up darry answered the young captain after this both you and joe must be more careful if either of you had been killed i would never have forgiven myself for bringing you out on the hunt  i want to give you both a bit of advice and i want you to remember it too came from the old scout never get too close to big game until you are certain of what you are doing and be extry careful of big game that is wounded and cornered even a sneaking fox will turn on you if he sees there is no other way out of his difficulty  ill remember that answered both joe and darry and they did remember and thus was one peril of biggame hunting abolished  darry felt too weak for the time being to do much so joe led him back to where they had left the horses while captain moore and old benson took upon themselves the task of bringing in the four deer each was a beautiful prize and the quartet made an imposing sight when hung up on a couple of tree branches  the colonel will like this haul said the young captain it will mean prime venison for some days to come benson i wish we could get some of it back to the fort without delayso we can put it on ice and keep it nice  ill take em all to the fort tonight if you say so answered the scout i can take one on my horse and load the other three on one of the other animals  then do that and while at the fort ask the colonel if he will give me permission to remain out until saturday tell him we think we can bring in something for all hands to enjoy  ill do it said the old scout  soon the deer were packed on the horses old benson having first cut some steaks from the smallest of the game to leave behind  take good care of yourselves while i am gone he said on departing and you joe and darry mind what i told you about getting cornered then he was off and a turn in the mountain trail soon hid him from view  a fine old fellow was joes comment when benson was gone  he is that answered the young captain i liked him from the first time i saw him and i have never had cause to regret it he is a good hunter an excellent scout and has done us many a good turn  what shall we do while he is absent questioned darry  oh we can try our hand at small game and we can fish answered the young captain as it is i reckon both of you would just as lief take it easy until morning  i would that deer on me has made me feel sore all over  they were soon in camp again and while the boys rested captain moore stirred around and showed them how the soldiers prepared their meals he cooked the steaks to a turn and boiled a pot of coffee and these with some crackers they had brought along made a most excellent meal being in no hurry they took their time over the repast and it was dark long before they finished  its going to be a fine night so we can sleep under the trees without fear said the young captain  dont you think some wild animals will attack us  not if we keep our campfire burning  the boys brought in plenty of brush and some heavier wood and arranged it so that it would burn for a long while doing this by forming the stuff into something of a circle then the horses were looked after and each retired with his blanket rolled around him to keep off the mountain dew which was already showing itself  when the boys awoke the sun was shining brightly into their faces for a moment each stared at the other  gracious i never slept so soundly in my life cried joe i couldnt have done better in a bed at home  nor i returned his cousin i can tell you sleeping in the open air when it doesnt rain is all right  but when darry got up on his feet he changed his tune the fall of the day previous combined with the night air had made him woefully stiff and it was a good halfhour before he became limbered up  they found captain moore already stirring and the kettle over the fire was boiling merrily the captain himself was trying his luck at a brook not a great distance off  i saw some fish in here some weeks ago he explained i thought i might get a couple for breakfast but you lads will have to wait until i strike luck  im willing to wait said joe there is nothing to do is there until benson gets back  nothing that i know of unless you want to fish or go after some small game i want to hear what he has to say if the colonel wont let me stay out ill have to return to the fort tonight  it did not take long for captain moore to land several goodsized specimens of the finny tribe and these the boys took turns at preparing for eating while the captain continued to fish the balance of the morning was passed at the brook and strange to say the captain and joe were both quite successful while darry hardly got a bite  im going to try my luck further up the stream announced the boy i believe we are all fishing too closely together  that doesnt seem to hurt my luck said joe  darry was soon climbing the rocks leading up the brook the way was rough but he was growing used to this life in the open air and he enjoyed even the hardship if such it can be called  that ought to make a good fishinghole he said to himself as he reached a point where several big rocks hung over the waters edge its dark down there and thats what some fish like  he prepared his bait with care and then dropped his line into the hole almost immediately he felt a nibble and giving a jerk found he had caught something that was both large and powerful  gracious it must be a whopper he muttered as the fish darted hither and thither then he braced back on the rock to play the game for bringing in the catch at once seemed out of the question the pole bent greatly and he was afraid it would snap on him  he could not stand on the slippery rock very well and so stepped behind it on a number of loose stones hardly had he done so when he heard a strange hissing looking down he saw a snake glide from under the rock in a moment more the angry reptile faced him     chapter xiv  over the mountain top   darry was much alarmed and with good reason never before had he faced such a snake and the reptile looked ready to spring upon him at any instant  what to do the boy did not know yet instinctively he leaped back to the top of the rock then the fish gave a jerk which almost took him from his feet  joe will he shouted come this way im in a pickle  whats the matter shouted captain moore and soon he and his brother were coming forward as quickly as they could  in the meantime darry was having his hands full for the big fish was bound to get away at the bottom of the rock lay the snake with head raised and mouth wide open its eyes shone like diamonds  a snake kill it shrieked darry  a snake echoed joe where  at the bottom of this big rock oh my hes going to come up  i see him put in captain moore  as he spoke the snake made a leap for the top of the rock as the reptile went up darry went down and ran along the brooks edge still with his fishingpole in his hand  catching up a sharp stone captain moore flung it at the snake hitting the reptile in the tail at once the thing whirled around and now forgetting darry it turned on its assailant  hes coming for you ejaculated joe run will or youll be bitten sure  im not running from a snake answered the young officer and in a trice he whipped out his pistol as the snake came on he let drive his aim was true and the snake dropped with its head half severed from its body  good for you said joe and now he picked up a stone as large as his hand this he dropped directly on the quivering head and thus ended the battle although the body of the snake continued to wriggle for a long while afterward  with white face and set teeth darry continued to play his catch and he was still at it when joe and his brother came rushing up  did the snake bite you questioned the young captain why didnt you pull in  ive got something big on answered darry i didnt want to miss it  well i never gasped captain moore and you didnt let go even with that snake at your heels well you like a fish better than i do i can tell you that  again the pole bent and threatened to break but darry knew what he was doing and promptly let the fish have more line then he wound in and as the fish unexpectedly came close to shore he gave a sudden strong steady sweep and up came the prize on the rocks flapping and flopping violently  my what a whopper cried joe he must weigh at least seven or eight pounds  he felt as if he weighed about forty when he was in the water returned darry a little crestfallen that the catch was not larger  thats the biggest fish ive ever seen taken out of this stream said the young captain you can be proud of it darry but to hold on when that snake was behind you he shook his head  oh i knew youd come up and take care of that cousin will  but i might have been too late  was it a poisonous one  some claim they are poisonous but the surgeon up at the fort says not still i wouldnt want to risk a bite  perhaps there are more around suggested joe  no the peculiarity of this variety of snakes is that they always travel alone if they meet they fight until one or the other is dead  did you ever see such a fight will  i did when i first came to these parts i was riding over a rocky trail when my horse suddenly stopped nearly throwing me on looking ahead to find out what had frightened my animal i discovered two of these snakes they were facing each other with mouths wide open and fangs showing each was so interested in the other that neither noticed me or the horse they faced each other for fully a minute and during that time began to hiss louder and louder suddenly they sprang at each other and one snake was stung in the eye he curled himself around the other snakes neck and in an instant both were in a tight ball they rolled around and around among the rocks once in a while a head would show itself and then there would be more hissing after ten minutes the ball fell gradually apart and then one snake crawled slowly away more dead than alive the other snake proved to be dead with both eyes torn from its head  didnt you kill the other snake asked darry  i did thats the first and only battle i ever saw between snakes and it was terrible while it lasted i can tell you that  fishing over they went into camp and here rested until old benson came back  the colonel was tickled to death to receive so much deer meat said the old scout and he says you can stay until saturday night if you wish his lady said she had been wanting some venison for several weeks  captain moore felt glad to think he could be out four days more  well have a grand time now he said benson we can go right over yonder mountain cant we  to be sure answered the scout  is the hunting good over there asked joe  yes lad there used to be some buffalo there  good let us get a buffalo by all means cried darry  you go slow about tackling a buffalo especially a bull said the young captain if we do sight a buffalo you let benson manage the whole affair  it was not long before the party were off once more up a trail which led directly to the mountain top here traveling was difficult and both riders and horses were glad to rest at frequent intervals  when the top was gained the sun was just sinking in the far west the sight on every side was a glorious one and as the captain had a small fieldglass with him they could see for miles  there is the fort said joe after looking through the glass i can see the flag quite plainly  in the west were more mountains and between these the valley for which they were bound timber and underbrush were dense in spots while at other points the mountain sides were covered with bold blackish rocks with here and there luxuriant moss of several hues springs and brooks were numerous so there was no danger of a water famine  i can make out some game over yonder said darry when he had the glass adjusted to his sight  what is it  i cant see very plainly  hand over the glass said old benson and took a careful look but the setting sun now cast a deep shadow between the mountains and he was unable to tell what it was  mountain deer most likely he said well find out tomorrowif the good weather holds out  do you think well have a storm asked joe quickly  well have something dont you think so captain  i think well have more wind than rain returned captain moore  if we have a high wind will it be safe right on the mountain top questioned joe  we wont stay here said old benson i know of a much better campingplace come while it is still a little light and they set off once more  the place the old scout had in mind was close beside a cliff the wall of rocks was twice as high as their heads and on either side was a growth of heavy timber there was a spring at hand and a grassy patch which promised them an easy bed providing it did not rain  if it storms we can seek the shelter of the cliff said old benson it wont be as comfortable as a house or cabin but it will be a good deal better than being right in the open  the boys were glad enough to rest after the wearisome ride over the top of the mountain and hungry for the meal the old scout took upon himself to prepare  when the fire was lit it burned up lively blowing the sparks in several directions as soon as he finished cooking the meal benson put out the blaze  too much wind he said in reply to a question from joe i dont want to set the whole mountain side on fire  benson was right about the wind which was now sweeping strongly through the tops of the tall trees presently it came lower and shook up the brushwood the night birds began to fly around uttering their shrill cries the old scout listened to the birds with some concern  its going to be a big blow he said to darry  you are sure  yes the birds are afraid of it see how they flutter around thats a sure sign  birds must know a good deal benson  they do lada heap sight more than folks gives em credit for we could learn a good deal from them if wed only set our minds to it  they took their time about eating having nothing else to do then benson cared for the horses putting them in the shelter of the brush but away from the big trees  at last it began to blow in earnest and presently they heard a tree limb here and there snap with a loud report then the wind became so furious they were glad enough to huddle under the cliff for shelter  its coming now shouted old benson suddenly hold fast to your hats boys or youll never see them again and sit down on the traps  and in a moment more the fury of the wind storm was upon them     chapter xv  the result of a hurricane   both joe and darry had witnessed many a blow but nothing to compare to that which now swept through the valley and up the mountain side the velocity of the wind was simply terrific and it was well that old benson had cautioned them to hold on to their hats and sit on their traps otherwise all would have been blown away to parts unknown  say but this is fierce gasped darry after several minutes had passed  its a regular hurricane said captain moore ive been out in them before fortunately they do not last over a quarter or half an hour down on the prairies of kansas they would call it a cyclone here however it cant get the sweep that it can on the level  hark what is that put in joe as a tremendous crashing reached their ears  thats a tree in the forest going down answered old benson  there goes another said darry as more crashing was heard i am glad we didnt go into the timber its more dangerous than lightning  so it is shouted benson it was with difficulty that he made himself heard here comes the worse of it he added  a strange humming now filled the air followed by twigs and flying branches overhead it was unusually dark and they could scarcely see one another joe and darry kept close together and clasped hands captain moore was on one side of them and old benson on the other  as the wind struck the cliff it sent a shower of loose stones in all directions then it tore through the undergrowth where the horses were tethered next it seemed to hit the trees fronting the cliff one tall monarch of the forest was twisted completely from its roots and began to topple  see the tree is coming on top of us shrieked joe  his words were drowned out in the fury of the wind and the crashing of the tree the next moment the monarch of the forest came down on the cliff with a bang cracking the stone in several places the bottom limbs caught those under the cliff and pinned them fast  to both boys it seemed as if the end of the world had come they rolled over one on top of the other and for several seconds lay dazed then they tried to get up but found themselves unable to do so  get off of my chest gasped joe who was underneath  i cantim pinned down panted darry  boys are you safe came from old benson who was also caught  ii guess so answered joe but its a tight squeeze then the youth called out to his brother but no answer came back  will must be hurt he exclaimed his heart rising in his throat will will where are you he continued  still there was no answer or if so the fury of the wind drowned it out completely the boys tried their best to move but could only budge a few inches  in five minutes the fury of the blow spent itself and the last of the wind sent the fallen tree rolling along the cliff a distance of several rods this released joe and darry and they arose to their feet dazed and bewildered and scarcely knowing what to do next it was now raining and darker than ever  benson called out joe where is my brother  the captain must still be under the tree replied the old scout he was next to you when the tree came down wasnt he  he was but i believe the wind carried his hat off and he made a dive for it thats the last i saw of him  staggering to his feet joe looked around trying to pierce the darkness darry followed him and old benson also got up the scout had received a nasty cut on the shoulder from which the blood was flowing  in a few minutes joe found his brother the captain lay on the rocks unconscious a big lump on his forehead where the largest of the trees branches had struck him kneeling at his brothers side the boy made a hasty examination  hes alive he said but he must have been struck a terrible crack  there was little to do excepting to bathe the unconscious officers head and this was done in the meantime darry assisted old benson at binding up the wounded shoulder  take the tree off such were the first words captain moore uttered when he returned to consciousness it was some time before he could sit up  you are all right willthe tree is not on you said joe soothingly  but it came down right on top of me  yes it came down on all of us  anybody killed  no benson has a cut on the shoulder and you were knocked out feel the lump on your head  the young captain did so  phew but thats a regular gooseegg isnt it he muttered i suppose i can be thankful that i am alive  we can all be thankful for that will  it was the greatest blow i ever experiencedin more ways than one said the captain i see it is raining we had better go back to the cliff for protection  dont do it cried old benson from out of the darkness the tree struck the cliff a heavy blow and we dont want that down on our heads next  no let us give the cliff a wide berth said darry id rather remain right out in the open and get soaked than take any more risks  the rain wont amount to much said benson it never does after such a hurricane  the scout was right and in less than half an hour after it had begun the downpour was over and the stars were struggling forth in the sky without delay a campfire was lit and the blaze did much toward making them comfortable it was found that bensons wound was by far the worst yet the old scout said it would not interfere with his outing  ive had lots of em in my time was the way he expressed himself lots and i aint dead yet pears to me im about as tough as a pineknot  it was found that the horses had not suffered in the least from the storm although they had been much frightened soon they calmed down and by midnight all was as quiet as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred but captain moore and old benson carried the marks of the adventure for many days after  on the following morning no one felt much in the humor for hunting and half a day was lost in bumming around as joe expressed it this gave all a good rest and put the horses in fine fettle and when they started out after the midday meal all were once again in high spirits  that night found them on the edge of what old benson called the buffalo ground a broad valley where the grass was thick and of a peculiar richness on the way they had shot a number of birds and also a few small animals but nothing of importance once some deer had been sighted but the game was too far off to be pursued  as they expected to remain at this point until ready to return home the old scout proceeded to put up a shelter of brush which when completed was almost as comfortable as a cabin on the bottom were strewn pine boughs which gave the shelter a peculiar odor  best thing in the world for colds and weak lungs that smell said benson ive never known it to fail the boys declared that the odor made them sleep like logs  its queer we havent seen any indians remarked darry i thought these mountains were full of them  they were full before the fort was established answered benson but the kind that are in this neighborhood dont like white men very much and they only come around the fort when its necessary but we may meet some after buffalo an injun will do a heap to get a critter like that  the old scout said it would be useless to go out in a body to look for buffalo and so it was arranged that he should first go over the ground alone leaving the captain and the two boys to look for smaller game  this settled benson soon set off and a little later captain moore joe and darry took their way along some bushes skirting a small watercourse they went on foot leaving their horses tethered near the shelter  i will go up one side of the stream and you can go up the other said the captain by doing that well be sure to stir up anything within a hundred yards of the water  the boys agreed and soon each member of the party was hard at work on the hunt for any small game the vicinity might afford  it was not long before they gained a spot where the underbrush along the brook was thick here the stream divided into two branches and without knowing it the captain and the boys became gradually more and more separated the brush and small trees hiding each from the other  i dont see much said joe after half a mile had been covered those little birds arent worth wasting powder and shot on  it looks to me as if somebody had gone over this ground returned darry see here arent those fresh footprints  i believe they are and see here are the prints of several horses hoofs benson didnt come this way did he  i dont think he did  then there must be other hunters not far off  they continued on their way coming to a halt where the branch of the brook entered a small rocky canyon  no use of going further said joe let us retrace our steps  where can your brother be i havent heard him for some time  joe set up a yell and both listened attentively no answer came back then both called in concert still the silence continued  its mighty queer was joes comment let us go back perhaps hes in trouble     chapter xvi  captain moores adventure   in the meanwhile never dreaming of the danger at hand captain moore pursued his way up the other branch of the watercourse here the underbrush was even more dense than where the boys were and consequently he did not think it strange that he heard nothing of his brother and his cousin  the fact that he stirred up no game nettled him and he pushed on determined to bring down something before he went back  suddenly he espied something moving in the patch of wood ahead of him rifle in hand he moved cautiously in the direction  as he did this a man glided out from the bushes to his right and followed him as silently as a shadow  the man was gus fetter the desperado was fully armed and his face was black with hatred of the young army officer  as the wood was gained captain moore paused to locate the object he had seen  but before he could do this he was caught from behind and his rifle was wrenched from his grasp  fetter he ejaculated as he caught sight of the desperado  up with your hands captain moore growled the rascal savagely up i say ive got the drop on you  fetter had thrown the captains rifle to the ground and now stood upon it in his hands he held his own weapon and the muzzle was aimed at the young officers head  realizing that discretion was the better part of valor captain moore threw up his hands promptly at which the desperado grinned wickedly  where did you come from fetter demanded the captain  from not far away captain  what do you mean by treating a united states army officer in this fashion  ive got a score to settle with you captain dont forget that  are the rest of the gang around  they are  following his last words gus fetter gave a long clear whistle followed by two shorter ones at once an answer came back from the woods and in a few seconds matt gilroy appeared  hullo so youve got him sang out the leader of the desperadoes a good haul how are you captain moore delighted to see me i suppose  not at all glad to meet youconsidering the circumstances answered the young officer trying to keep cool although he realized that he was in a dangerous situation  well youre honest about it anyway said gilroy with a brutal laugh  have you been following our party  you had better not ask too many questions captain  by this time potts and two other men were coming up one of the latter carried his left arm in a sling captain moores recognized him as a fellow who had been wounded in the raid on the quartermasters party  the desperadoes consulted among themselves for a few minutes and then captain moore was ordered to march on  to where he asked  youll see when you get there answered fetter now move or by the boots i shoot you down where you stand  seeing it would be worse than useless to resist the young officer did as ordered and the whole party moved away from the watercourse and took to a trail leading back to the side of the mountain  presently they came upon a number of horses and here they mounted there were two steeds without riders and captain moore was ordered to the back of one of these all rode off in a bunch the prisoner being kept in the center of the party he had been searched and his pistol taken from him also his pocketknife fieldglass and his money and jewelry  in less than quarter of an hour a split in the mountain side was gained to the rear was something of a cave the entrance overgrown with brush and vines at the mouth of the cave the party came to a halt and were met by several other desperadoes  now you can get down said gilroy fetter i guess we had better bind his hands behind him  you are going to bind me queried captain moore  and why not you are such a nice chap captain we dont want to part with you just yet  why are you going to keep me a prisoner  well dont forget that we hold you responsible for that little mixup when we were after the quartermasters moneybags  i only did my duty gilroy  perhaps but if it hadnt been for you and your men our gang would have been about twenty thousand dollars richer than we are today  and i wouldnt have this lame arm growled the fellow who had been wounded  as i said before i only did my duty repeated the captain calmly even if i hadnt arrived dont you suppose the quartermaster would have done all he could to defend himself  certainly but his party numbered only three however we wont talk now we have other things to do get into that cave and dont try to escape or it will be the worse for you  with a downcast heart the young officer entered the cave which was an old rendezvous of the desperadoes inside were a rude table and a couple of benches and he threw himself down on one of the latter one of the gang potts put himself on guard outside rifle in hand the others separated into two parties and went off again  can they be going after joe and darry or after benson was the question the captain asked himself  he waited until the hoofbeats outside had entirely ceased then called to potts  where are they going he asked  thats captain gilroys business was the answer  oh so you call gilroy captain now  we do  how many men is he captain of  about thirty if youre anxious to know  thirty there are not that number of desperadoes within three hundred miles of this place  all right if you know better than i do  has the captain gone off for the rest of my party  perhaps he has  it wont do him any good to make them prisoners  i reckon he knows his own business best captain moore  and what will you get out of this affair potts  me ill get my share when we make another haul  do you expect to make another haul soon  as i said afore better ask the captain were organized into a regular company now and all the privates like me have to do is to obey orders you know how it is in the regular army  a company of desperadoes mused captain moore thats something we havent had out here in years  potts would talk no more after this but sat down on a rock to smoke his pipe and continue his guard duty  the young captain had had his hands bound tightly behind him and try his best he found himself unable to either break or slip his bonds  he was anxious concerning himself but he was even more upset concerning his brother and his cousin  if they kick up a fuss more than likely gilroy and the others will shoot them down he groaned its too bad i thought we would have a splendid time hunting and here we are falling into all sorts of difficulties  as impatient as he was he could do nothing but stalk around the cave the place was five yards wide by over a hundred feet long to the rear was a rude fireplace the smoke drifting through some wide cracks overhead a small fire was burning and he kicked a fresh log on the blaze which soon gave him more light then he sat down again  as he rested his eyes roamed around the rocky apartment and presently fell upon a sheet of paper lying under the table curious to know what it might contain he bent down backwards and by an effort secured the paper and placed it upon the table then by the flickering flames he tried to make out the writing it contained  the letterfor such the sheet proved to bewas a communication which had been sent to matt gilroy by a writer who signed himself mose it ran as follows       the plan will work perfectly and all we must do is to wait until      the money is at the fort i am sure the soldiers will leave as      requested and the defense will amount to little or nothing will      see to it that colonel fairfield is drugged and will treat captain      moore and the other officers the same way if i can get the      chance     chapter xvii  three prisoners   it did not take joe and darry long to retrace their steps at the watercourse they continued to call to the young captain and once joe shot off his rifle as a signal but as we know no answer came back  i cant understand this at all said joe when they halted near the shelter i didnt hear him do any firing did you  not a shot answered darry he must have gone away from the brook instead of along the bank  the two boys hung around the shelter for some time and then decided to follow up the trail left by the young officer  this was easy for part of the distance but soon the footprints became so indistinct that they came to another halt  stumped muttered joe we might as well go back to the shelter and wait till he returns one thing is certain he hasnt found any game or we would have heard the firing  tired by their long tramp the boys sat down in the shelter thinking that captain moore would return at any moment  thus an hour was passed it was now noon and joe and darry set to work to prepare dinner for themselves  the repast was just finished when joe let out a cry of alarm  matt gilroy  he was right the captain of the desperadoes had appeared followed by several others  the boys were taken completely off their guard darry made a clutch for his rifle but on the instant gilroy had him covered  leave the gun alone cried the rascal leave it alone or it will be the worse for you  what do you want questioned joe  we want you to behave yourselves answered fetter who was in the crowd  you played us a nice trick that time you escaped from the cave growled gilroy eying joe darkly  do you blame me for wanting to get away  hardly but ill warrant you wont get away again  then you consider me your prisoner  i do  oh joe do you think they met will began darry and then stopped short  yes your brother is waiting to meet you said fetter addressing joe  then he is also a prisoner  yes  joes heart sank within him  if old benson was only here he muttered  still guarding the boys the desperadoes took their guns and also a pistol the young captain had loaned his brother  now get on your horses commanded gilroy and mind if you try to play us foul both of you will get shot  are you going to take us to captain moore asked darry  perhaps  the desperadoes would answer no more questions and in a few minutes the whole party was off for the cave both darry and joe wished to leave behind some sort of message which benson might pick up but they were watched so closely they could do nothing  when the cave was gained the boys were told to go inside and keep quiet  joe and you too darry cried captain moore i was afraid of this  no wonder we couldnt find you said joe and told of the hunt he and his cousin had made  these rascals are up to some deep game whispered the young captain i just picked up a message which gilroy must have dropped and he told what the sheet contained  if i were you id burn the paper said darry then he wont know you have seen it  no i would like to keep the sheetto show to colonel fairfield if i can manage to get away  who wrote the message  i have no idea there used to be a halfbreed around here whom the soldiers called mose but i thought he was dead he was thick with the modoc indians  then if he was the writer that would show that the indians are going to help the desperadoes wouldnt it asked joe  before his brother could answer matt gilroy stalked into the cave  i told you not to talk he growled as he cast his eye on the table and then around the rocky floor you cant get away so it wont do you any good to plot against me and my men  he was evidently looking for the sheet of paper for presently he lit a torch and went over the whole cave carefully  see anything of a bit of paper around here he asked presently  what kind of a paper questioned darry  something with writing on it  i havent seen anything  what was the writing about gilroy asked captain moore  thats my business then you havent seen the paper all right and the desperado stalked from the cave again  that was a close shave whispered the young captain and it proves that the paper is valuable and that he is worried about it  slowly the balance of the day wore along and at nightfall one of the men brought them a scanty supply of food  they ate sparingly fearing the food might be drugged but no evil effects followed the meal  at the mouth of the cave sat two of the desperadoes on guard each with his rifle across his knees  a dash into the darkness might save us suggested darry but the captain shook his head  no those fellows are too good shots he said we will have to remain as we are until something turns up in our favor  our friends wondered if the desperadoes would remain about the cave all night the other party which had gone off when gilroy went for joe and darry had not yet returned and the leader of the gang seemed to grow anxious concerning them  something has happened to them he said to fetter perhaps we had better send somebody off on the trail to find out whats up  so it was agreed and fetter was the man chosen for the mission  as may have been surmised by some of my readers the other party had gone off to watch for old benson and make him a prisoner the crowd numbered three and were desperadoes well acquainted with that territory  the old scout had spent several hours in a vain endeavor to locate some buffalo when on resting in the crotch of a tree he saw the desperadoes approaching  the rascals were tired out with their search for the scout and came to a halt directly under the tree  its a fool errand old benson heard one of the men say matt gilroy ought to have been satisfied with corraling captain moore and those boys  the captain wants to make a grand roundup answered another of the men he told me that if we missed benson the scout might make trouble  benson listened to this conversation with intense interest and soon learned the truththat captain moore was already a prisoner and that another party had gone off to bring in joe and darry  this is a nice state of affairs he thought these rascals mean mischief i wish i could get the drop on them id soon teach them a thing or two  he watched the men as a cat watches mice and when the party of three moved on stole after them like an indian on the warpath  the desperadoes skirted the brushwood but did not go out on the grassy slope of the valley fearing that the old scout might be near by in hiding and see them  they were a shiftless lot and soon came to another halt under some small trees here they threw themselves on the ground and while two of them smoked their pipes the third indulged in a nap  not a great distance off was a spring of pure cold water and presently one of the men got up and walked over to this to get a drink  my chance for number one muttered old benson and crawled after the desperado as the man turned the corner of a number of rocks he came up behind clapped his hands over the fellows mouth and bore him to the earth     chapter xviii  benson puts some men in a hole   the man whom old benson had attacked was taken completely by surprise and he went to the ground easily but once down he struggled fiercely to release himself and at the same time did his best to cry out for assistance  silence commanded the scout in a whisper if you yell it will go hard with you  the desperado now saw who had attacked him and his face changed color but he continued to struggle and was on the point of breaking away when the old scout hit him a heavy blow on the ear which bowled him over and rendered him partly unconscious  hi did you call came from the other man who had been smoking  old benson looked at the man before him and saw that the fellow would be unable to do anything for several minutes to come  yes he answered in a rough voice heres something funny to look at come quick  at once the second man leaped up and without stopping to pick up his rifle came to the spring old benson quickly stepped behind a bush out of sight  hullo riley whats the trouble cried the second man when he beheld his prostrate companion  he bent over riley and while he was making an examination old benson came behind him and threw him as he had thrown the first desperado  but the second man was game and the struggle lasted for several minutes at one time it looked as if the old scout would get the worst of the encounter but in the end he triumphed and the rascal was disarmed  all the time the struggle was going on benson had been afraid the third man would rouse up especially as the second called several times for help but the rascal had now fallen into a heavy sleep and heard nothing  what to do with the two desperadoes before him the old scout did not know until he suddenly thought of a big cavelike hole he had discovered that very morning while hunting for buffalo tracks the hole was fifteen to twenty feet in diameter and twice as deep and once at the bottom he felt certain the desperadoes would have considerable trouble in getting to the top  come with me he said to the second fellow and no monkey shines if you know when you are well off  wot yer goin to do wid me growled the desperado  youll see your blood is so hot it needs cooling off answered the old scout  he forced the man along and soon the big hole was reached much against his will the rascal was forced to drop to the bottom  now if you try to climb up ill shoot you said benson and ran back swiftly to where the second rascal was just getting out of his unconscious state  before the other desperado could realize what was coming he too was down in the big hole old benson made certain that each of the men was relieved of all his weapons  now im going to keep watch on you he said as a warning be careful of what you try to do  dont leave us here pleaded riley a buffalo or a bear might fall in on us  youve got to take your chances on that answered benson  the next movement of the old scout was to go back to where the third man was sleeping it was an easy matter to secure all the weapons belonging to this fellow then benson procured a rope from their outfit and bound his feet together and then his hands during the latter operation the rascal awoke  wot yer doin he demanded sleepily and then seeing the old scout stared in openmouthed astonishment let go o me wot did yer tie me up fer  you keep quiet said benson with a broad smile over the trick he had played  whars riley an nason  not far off  did they go ter sleep too  you can ask them when you see them anderson  so you know me do yer  i do and i havent forgotten that affair at mountain meadow went on old benson referring to a shooting in which anderson had been the guilty party  at these words the desperado winced  well now ye have got me fast wot yer goin to do with me he questioned  im going to ask you a few questions anderson and i want you to answer me straight too if i learn youve given it to me crooked ill fix you for it remember that  wot do yer want to know  where are gilroy and the rest of your crowd stopping  wot do yer want to know that fur  answer the questionand tell me the truth and old benson looked sternly at his prisoner  at a cave near bald top returned anderson sulkily but i dont know how long they were goin ter stay there  where were they going to take captain moore  this question came as a surprise to the desperado  wot do yer know about dat he cried  answer the question  goin ter take him to dat same cave first  and then  dey was bound fer lone creek up to where old cimber onct had a claim  you are telling me the truth remember if you put me on the wrong trail  its the truth benson but say dont be rough on me i aint such a bad egg dat shootin  i know all about you anderson now come with me  reaching down the old scout untied the rascals feet that he might walk and then forced anderson to journey to the big hole  here they found the other two desperadoes sitting at the bottom growling over their luck and speculating upon what old benson intended to do next  if you leave us here well die of hunger and thirst said one  no you wont answered the old scout youve got your hands to work with and if you aint lazy you can dig your way to the top inside of twentyfour hours  and our hosses  ill take care of them riley if you want em again you can get em by applying at the fort  at the fort  exactly and in the meantime well keep them in exchange for the animals matt gilroy stole when i and my friends were stopping at hank leesons cabin  with the desperadoes safe for the time being at the bottom of the hole old benson set off without delay for the cave near bald top mountain as it was called for years by rocky mountain pioneers he rode his own horse leading the others by his lariat which he always carried with him  he fully realized that there was danger ahead and that if he wanted to assist his friends he must move with caution he knew that captain moore had been made a prisoner but whether or not joe and darry had been captured also was still a question  coming in sight of the spot where the cave was located he dismounted and tied all the horses in the woods at the foot of a slope then he crawled forward until he was within a hundred feet of the entrance to the cave  he was just in time to see fetter depart on his mission the desperado passed within fifty yards of where the horses were stationed and for several minutes benson was fearful that the animals would be discovered but fetter was looking in another direction and so saw nothing of the steeds  as darkness had come on the desperadoes had lit a campfire near the entrance to the cave  two men still remained on guard the others took it easy and did very much as they pleased all waited for riley and the others to return with fetter bringing in old benson as a prisoner  as the scout heard the talk about himself he chuckled grimly and grasped his rifle tighter than ever  reckon youd be surprised to know i was so close he muttered well if it comes to a mixup ill try to hold up my end just you see if i dont     chapter xix  escaping in the darkness   it was after midnight when the camp settled down to rest fetter had not returned and matt gilroy was much worried in consequence yet he was tired out having lost a good portion of the night previous in traveling and he lay down with the others  the guards at the entrance to the cave had been changed those now there were two young men recruits to the desperadoes organization  inside of the cave captain moore joe and darry having untied each others bonds held a long consultation the upshot of which was that they intended to escape if the deed could be accomplished  there is no use in telling you that we will run a big risk said the captain but as for myself these rascals are plotting against colonel fairfield and the soldiers at the fort and i feel it my duty to do my best toward getting away and warning my commander  whatever you do will i will back you up so far as i am able was his brothers answer  and i will back you up too came from darry but we must be cautious for these desperadoes will not hesitate to shoot and shoot to kill and the boy shivered in spite of himself for no matter how brave a person may be he seldom cares to run the risk of losing his life  the prisoners had been ordered to keep to the back of the cave but after all but the guards had retired captain moore made bold enough to walk carefully to the mouth of the place  hi you want to keep back there growled one of the guards promptly raising his rifle  dont be hard on us pleaded the captain let me get a little fresh air its vile in the back of the cave  orders were to keep you out of sight growled the second guard  all right ill go back as soon as ive cleaned out my lungs  while the captain was speaking he was peering around sharply trying to locate the other desperadoes and ascertain what the chances of escape really were  as he gazed first to one side and then the other he caught sight of a hand waving in the air a second later he made out the head and shoulders of old benson as the scout rose to his feet behind some brushwood  the thought that the scout was at hand to assist them cheered the young officer wonderfully and he drew a deep breath of satisfaction  are you going back soon growled one of the guards  yes answered the captain but i say he went on why cant we come to terms  dont want to make any terms with you growled the other guard  it might be better for you to do so  we know our own business best captain you just go back as you was ordered to do if you dont  i dont feel safe in the cave men to tell the truth what is that pounding overhead  pounding overhead  yes  dont know of any pounding do you ike  nary a bit replied the other guard  by this time joe and darry were just behind the young officer  watch out whispered captain moore old benson is outside in the bushes on the left  good for him whispered joe joyfully  what are you talking about demanded one of the guards  i want to know about that pounding overhead said captain moore i dont want the roof to cave in on us  he spoke so decidedly that both of the guards were deceived  nobody is up there said one of the two it must be some wild animal  cant one of you go up and look asked the young officer  you want the chance to get away was the suspicious answer  how can we get away when we are unarmed and you have that rifle went on the captain speaking loudly for old bensons benefit it wont take you a minute to look  the men however refused to budge  well stay right here said one and the other nodded affirmatively  in the meantime old benson had crawled closer until he was directly behind the pair  now of a sudden he leaped between them and as quick as a flash caught their rifles and twisted the weapons from their grasp  illustration he leaped between them and caught their rifles  as the old scout did this the young captain also leaped in followed by joe and darry  the guards struggled but with four against them could do little or nothing one however had a powerful pair of lungs and before he could be stopped set up a loud cry of alarm  come with me cried old benson be quick or it will be too late  he led the way to the wood where the horses were tethered and the captain joe and darry came close behind him  hardly had they gotten away from the guards when the whole camp was in alarm  whats the trouble demanded matt gilroy leaping to his feet and catching up his rifle  the prisoners have escaped answered one of the guards we were attacked by some men from behind there they go  stop roared the leader of the desperadoes and raised his rifle but before he could take aim our friends were behind the shelter of the trees  it took but a few seconds to loosen the horses and as the captain and the two boys had long since relieved themselves of their bonds they were soon in the saddle and following the old scout who seemed to know the way perfectly despite the darkness  it was lucky you came up benson cried joe as they dashed along  wait we are not yet out of this trouble answered benson hark they are following  he was right gilroy and several of his men had rushed to their horses and were now coming along the forest trail at a good rate of speed  but their horses were no better than the animals our friends rode so the desperadoes did not succeed in cutting down the distance between the two parties and at last gave up the chase  it has been a most stirring adventure from start to finish said captain moore after each had told his story and it brings to an end this outing i must now get to the fort without delay  and i am perfectly willing to go along said darry there is no fun in hunting in a country where the desperadoes are so thick  this will open colonel fairfields eyes went on the young officer i shouldnt be surprised if he organized another expedition against gilroys gang and didnt let up on them until they were all either in prison or shot down  its what they deserve came from old benson ill go on such a hunt with pleasure  our friends continued in the saddle all night and until ten oclock the next morning then tired and hot they went into camp by a cooling stream here they went fishing and soon caught enough fish for dinner after which they took a nap lasting several hours  and now for the fort cried captain moore and the sooner we get there the better  the nap had done the boys a world of good and as they rode along their spirits rose so high that darry proposed a race joe was willing and away they went along the welldefined trail before either the young officer or the old scout could stop them  they are full of life said joes brother let them go well make the fort tonight even if they do tire the horses a bit  its all right if they dont get into trouble answered benson  on and on went the two lads down something of a slope and then along a level stretch the bushes grew thick upon both sides and here and there were numerous wild flowers at last they reached a glade rich with green grass  joe was slightly ahead when he came to a sudden halt  back darry he cried get back behind the bushes  whats up queried his cousin as he brought his steed to a standstill  buffaloes  buffaloes where  right around the cliff on our right see they are coming this way heres luck  joe was right they had come most unexpectedly upon a herd of seven buffaloes the shaggy beasts were all large and powerfullooking they were not in the least alarmed and came toward the boys at a slow but steady walk     chapter xx  something about white ox   what shall we do joe wait until your brother and old benson come up asked darry as they surveyed the approaching animals  i suppose we ought to wait answered joe but if they take alarm theyll be off in doublequick order i am afraid  each of the boys brought around his rifle which had been picked up on leaving the desperadoes rendezvous and saw that it was ready for use  if we could only signal to the others suggested darry impatiently  one of us might go back began joe when he gave a sudden start they see us see they are turning away he cried  hardly had he spoken when darry fired aiming at the largest of the buffaloes joe followed with a second shot aimed at the same beast both bullets reached their mark and the animal was hit in the breast and in the right foreleg  we hit him ejaculated darry let us fire at him again and he started to reload with all speed  when struck the buffalo uttered a bellow of pain and went down on his knees but he quickly arose and now came straight for the boys his head down as if to gore them to death  crack it was darrys rifle which spoke up and the buffalo staggered hit on the head a glancing blow however which did little damage  by this time joe had reloaded but he did not fire at once hoping to get a closer shot at the beast in the meantime the others of the herd had disappeared completely  soon the buffalo was less than fifty yards off and not daring to wait longer joe took steady aim and let drive his riflebarrel had been pointed at one of those gleaming bloodshot eyes and the bullet sped true entering the brain of the beast with a roar and a grunt the buffalo went down tearing up a great patch of grass in his fall  hi whats all the shooting about the cry came from benson as he rode down the trail at a breakneck speed rifle ready for use  a buffalo cried darry  a buffalo look out for yourselves  yes take care came from captain moore who was behind the old scout  weve fixed him said joe not without a good deal of pardonable pride  fixed him old benson looked out upon the glade by the great jehosophat he roared gone and shot a buffalo all by your lone selves or maybe he was dead when you got here he added suspiciously  you wouldnt think he was dead if you could have seen him come toward us said darry  but who shot him i heard four shots  and every one of em went into the buffalo answered joe two for darry and two for myself  but joe finished him with a shot in the eye said darry quickly  but darry hit him in the leg and that lamed him said joe just as quickly i guess honors are even  certainly remarkable shooting was captain moores comment old hunters couldnt do better could they benson  not much better captain i never would have dreamed of it boys and to think i couldnt get a smell of em when i was out looking em up benson said shaking his head dubiously  this buffalo wasnt alone said darry the others went in that direction you might follow them up  it wouldnt be any use now lad they are gone and thats the end of it  we mustnt lose too much time put in the young captain i must make the fort tonight no matter what comes  but will we cant leave this magnificent buffalo behind pleaded his brother darry and i will want the skin and well want to mount the head and horns eh darry  to be sure  how long will it take to skin the beast benson  an hour and over if i want to make a good job of it was the slow reply its too nice a hide to ruin by quick cutting  supposing i ride ahead then and you follow with the boys as soon as you are ready  this was agreed to and in a minute the young officer was off once more urging his horse forward at the animals best speed  now i can take my time declared old benson sorry i aint got my huntingknife  where is it  it was lost in the shuffle with those desperadoes i put in the hole the old scout chuckled my my how they must love me for putting em down there  theyll have it in for you when they get out remarked darry  oh im not afraid lad  the buffalo had fallen into something of a heap and it took their combined efforts to turn the huge carcass over then old benson got out his claspknife sharpened the blade upon the leather of his boot and set to work the boys assisting him as much as possible which was not much since the process was entirely new to them  that will be a load said joe when they had the skin and a part of the head free how much do they weigh benson  close on to a hundred pounds  and how shall we carry that load  well tie it up into something of a long bundle and take turns at toting it behind our saddles of course we wont be able to move along as fast as before but that wont be necessary now the captain has gone ahead to break the news  the trail now led toward the river where darry had almost lost his life by being hit with the drifting tree the path was uncertain in spots and they had to be careful for fear of getting into some boggy hole  what a splendid place for a ranch home suggested darry benson i am surprised that there are so few cabins in this neighborhood  there used to be quite a number through here lad but the modoc and other indians burnt them all down i suppose new settlers will come in now the indians are behaving themselves  but are they behaving themselves questioned joe  they are doing a good deal better than formerly joe there is only one old chief in this neighborhood who seems to want to cause trouble  and who is that  white ox he is some sort of a relative to sitting bull so ive been told and he wont give in that the white man is master of the situation he has tried to get his warriors to rise against us several times but so far he hasnt accomplished much  where is white ox now  over behind yonder mountain to the north he is chief of a band that numbers between a hundred and a hundred and fifty people he himself is one of the best indian shots in the west  its a pity they cant become citizens as well as other folks remarked darry  thats the whole trouble lad the united states didnt treat them right in the first place and we are bound to suffer in consequence but in the end the injun will be wiped out completely  as night came on countless stars shone in the sky making the trail fairly light old benson rode in advance with darry next and joe bringing up the rear  presently the old hunter drew rein and motioned the others to do the same  somebody ahead he said in a low voice four or five men on hossback if i aint mistaken theyre injuns too  indians exclaimed joe do they come this way often  no lad fact is they havent any right over here so close to the fort its against colonel fairfields rules  then what can they be doing here  thats for us to find out  old benson led the way to a side trail and then into the shelter of a number of trees  he quickly passed the pelt over to darry  both of you stay here until i get back he said im going to find out what those redskins are up to  you wont be gone long will you asked joe  dont expect to be gone over an hour at the most if i aint back in two hours make up your mind something has happened then youll have to get back to the fort the best way you can concluded the old scout  a moment later the darkness of the night hid him from their view and they were left alone in the bit of timberland     chapter xxi  a trick of the enemy   i must say i dont fancy this much observed joe after the sounds of bensons departure had lost themselves in the distance  nor do i like it joe came from darry with a longdrawn sigh but i guess well have to make the best of it  with what was on that message my brother found in the cave and what benson said about this indian chief it looks as if the folks at the fort might have trouble in the near future  thats true too i hope will got through in safety  dismounting the two boys sat down under the trees to wait in the darkness the horses were glad enough of the rest and fell to cropping the short grass which showed itself in spots in the vicinity  thus half an hour passed the silence was oppressive broken only by the occasional note of a night bird or the dismal croaking of a frog in some hollow and the answering squeak of a lizard  somebody is coming cried joe at last and both of the boys stood on the defensive rifles in hand the party came closer and closer and at last they made out the form of the old scout he was riding at the top of his speed  quick follow me he exclaimed as he dashed up there is not a moment to lose  the boys needed no second bidding and in a trice they were in the saddle once more and riding after old benson who now took to another trail leading somewhat to the south of that formerly pursued  you saw the indians questioned joe as they dashed on  i did white ox is ahead with sixty or seventy of his best warriors from what i could learn he and lieutenant carrol have had a fight and half a dozen of the soldiers were either killed or wounded now white ox is marching for the fort  to attack it  i cant say about that but i think he is going to hide in the vicinity to wait for the coming of the desperadoes  and what of my brother questioned joe anxiously did he get through all right  nothing was said about the captain lad i suppose he got through  it was hard to talk while riding at such a rate of speed and soon the conversation came to an end the horses now showed plain evidence of their long journey but each rider kept his steed at his best  it was after two oclock in the morning when the fort came into view dark and silent in the midst of the plain surrounding it benson now rode in advance  halt came the sudden command while the scout was still a hundred yards from the stockade the command was loud and clear but the speaker was invisible  its all right friend answered the old scout its me sam benson let me in quick ive news for the colonel  all right benson was the answer but who is that behind you  joe moore and darry germain is the colonel sleeping  the colonel is very sick  sick  yes  whats the trouble  the surgeon cant make out exactly hes in a sort of stupor and they cant rouse him  by this time the stockade gate was open and all three of our friends lost no time in entering the yard then the gate was closed and barred again  has captain moore returned asked joe as soon as he could get the guards attention  i havent seen him  how long have you been on duty  came on about an hour ago  has lieutenant carrol come in came from benson  not that i know of reckon not answered the guard  worse and worse groaned the old scout who is in command here  captain lee but hes about half sick too  its a trick of the enemy cried darry  a trick queried the guard with interest  yes a trick put in joe benson hadnt they better sound the alarm  yes and ill interview captain lee  no more was said and while the sentinel called the corporal of the guard the old scout hurried off to find the captain in command with him went joe and darry joes heart was like a lump of lead for he was much concerned over the nonappearance of his brother had the captain met the indians and been killed or taken prisoner  captain lee was in a sound sleep but quickly roused up when told that an important message awaited him he met the party in one of the living rooms of the fort his head was tied up in a wet towel and his eyes showed that he was suffering  this is certainly a deeplaid plot he said when all had told their story the desperadoes and indians intend to combine in an attack on the fort mose is undoubtedly that wily old halfbreed who is still alive and who is very thick with white ox but i didnt know he could write  but what about this money at the fort asked joe  the money is here in a chest that is hidden away it amounts to forty thousand dollars in gold and is the property of the nevell mining company it was left for safekeeping until mr nevell could have it transported to denver you see nevell is a brotherinlaw to colonel fairfield  the colonel must be drugged said benson thats the reason he acts so queerly  i suppose so and that is what has affected me i presume answered captain lee last night my head ached as if it would split open we must tell the surgeon of this perhaps he can then do something to relieve colonel fairfield  the captain lost no time in issuing the necessary orders and in a few minutes the whole place was in alarm and the soldiers were on the watch for the first appearance of the indians  my poor husband drugged cried mrs fairfield when she heard the news what villains those indians and desperadoes are doctor can you do nothing  i think i can madam answered the surgeon much depends upon what drugs were administered and how much the colonel has taken rest assured i will do my best for him  upon examination it was found that out of all the officers at the fort only four were fit for duty all the others being sick either through being drugged or otherwise of the privates not more than sixtyfive were in a condition to fight should an attack come  and the worst of it is the men wont know what to eat or drink after this said captain lee to benson who can tell what has been drugged perhaps its in the very bread we eat and the water we drink  strict orders were given to the men to touch nothing until the surgeon had passed upon it then the doctor got out his medicines to counteract the drugs and set to work to bring the colonel and the other sufferers out of their stupor  hour after hour went slowly by and still captain moore did not return what had become of his brother joe could not imagine he feared the worst and when morning came it was all he could do to keep back the tears  dont take it so to heart joe said darry sympathetically it may be all right  but he said he was going to ride straight hereyou heard him darry  so i did but he may have seen the indians or met lieutenant carrol and that might have changed his plans anyway i wouldnt worry too much just yet  with the coming of daylight captain lee brought out his longdistance glass and swept the surroundings of the fort with extreme care  some campfires are burning to the northward he announced  any injuns questioned old benson laconically he had been told to come along to the top of the fort for consultation  nobody in sight benson  humph well i dont calculate they are far off  nor i from what you and the boys told me how long will it take those desperadoes to reach here  they ought to arrive this morning if they are not with the injuns already  all told we have about seventy officers and men available for duty went on the captain thoughtfully what is worse they must know how greatly our garrison is reduced since they have had that skunk of a mose do the drugging for them  the injuns number over sixty and if there are thirty desperadoes that will give them a force of almost a hundred or twice as many as we have captain but then we hold the fort they cant come anywhere near us without being cut downif we set out to do it  of course but white ox may send off for more indianswhen he hears how small the available garrison is  does he know much of affairs here  i am afraid he does there were two indians here yesterday to lodge a complaint against a miner who had stolen a horse from them i think now that the complaint was a blind and the indians were here merely to size up the situation concluded captain lee     chapter xxii  in the hands of the enemy   little dreaming of all the adventures in store for him captain moore left the scene of the buffalo shooting and rode forth swiftly in the direction of fort carson  he felt that he carried news of great importance and the sooner he gained the fort the better should anything happen to colonel fairfield the command of the post would fall upon himself as next in rank  as he dashed along the trail over hill and valley he reviewed the situation with care and the more he thought of it the more worried did he become  something is going to happeni can feel it in the air he muttered  the thought had scarcely crossed his mind when something did happen but not exactly what he anticipated  a shadow fell across his path and as he drew rein he found himself confronted by several indians  white officer stop cried the leader of the red men sternly  hullo what do you want demanded the captain the meeting was a complete surprise  want to have a talk  who are you  me red wolf belong to white ox tribe returned the indian with a scowl  and what are you doing out here at this time of night red wolf  indians on a big hunt see buffalo yesterday  yes i saw one of the buffaloes myself captain moore paused not knowing how to go on you are pretty close to the fort  red wolf and warriors get on the wrong trail was the slow reply but want to talk now come along  as the indian concluded he caught the captains steed by the bridle  let go the horse  want to talk to white officer  you havent any right to touch my horse  hardly had the words been spoken when two indians rushed up behind the captain and dragged him to the ground  the fellows were large and powerful and they disarmed him before he could even fire a shot  without further ado captain moore was forced to march along between two of the red men while a third led his horse  a route around the rocks was taken and presently they came to a dense bit of timberland in the midst of this was a clearing and here was the camp of some ten or a dozen indians  the indians at hand were a guard over several white soldiers and to his intense surprise the young captain recognized some of lieutenant carrols men  what are you doing here he asked  had a mixup and came off second best began one of the soldiers when an indian guard clapped a dirty hand over his mouth and ordered him to be silent under penalty of death  then the captain was taken to another part of the glade and here he was made a close prisoner by being bound hands and feet to the trunk of a blasted tree  red wolf wished to know what the captain had been doing away from the fort  ive been on a hunting expedition  alone  no  where are the others  safe by this time what do you intend to do with me red wolf  white ox shall decide that grunted the red man  then he is on this hunt too  he is  when will he be here  soon  dont you know that i am an army officer and that you are laying up a good deal of trouble for yourself by making me a prisoner  the white man has not treated the indians right  this is no way to redress wrongs red wolf why dont you go to colonel fairfield and make a complaint he will send the story to the great father at washington  the great father will not listen we have sent many complaintsas the white captain knows  he will listenif the complaint is a just one the trouble is the indians will not obey colonel fairfields orders  and why should they obey the white man is not white ox their chief  that is true but the land is now the white mans and the indians must obey the great father at washington or in the end it will go hard with them  not so cried red wolf savagely in the end the white man will be driven eastward where he belongs no one shall rule in these mountains but the red man white ox and the other great chiefs have spoken  what you are going on the warpath  the hatchet may be dug up if the white man will not listen to the red man  i know what the trouble is red wolf matt gilroy and that scoundrelly halfbreed mose have set you up to this they have filled your ears with false stories about our cruelty and about much money at the fort  by the look on the indians face the young officer saw that he had struck the truth at least in part  but the red man would talk no more fearing he had already said too much and he stalked off warning a guard to be careful and not let the captain escape  when left to himself captain moores reflections were very bitter  if the redskins are out in force theyll probably fall in with benson and the boys he told himself and if they do there will surely be trouble benson wont allow them to take him alive and that will mean a good deal of shooting all around  he listened attentively for shots in the distance but none came and this caused him to be more perplexed than ever  just before daybreak several additional indians came in and the young officer and the soldiers were told to march their feet were unfastened but their hands were not and they were forced to move with the red men on all sides of them and each of the enemy fully armed and ready to shoot them down at the first show of resistance or escape  from one of the privates captain moore learned that lieutenant carrol and the other soldiers had escaped but what had become of them nobody knew  the little body of whites and indians marched over a mountain trail for fully four hours the step was a lively one and when the party came to a halt even the soldiers used to a hard march were tired out  those redskins can walk the legs off of anything i know of was the way one old soldier expressed himself they are like some of these wiry mustangs who dont know the meaning of rest  this region is strange to me peck do you recognize it  i do captain moore yonder is henebeck fall and this trail leads to silver gulch  then we are about six miles from nowhere in particular  youve struck it captain why they brought us to such a forsaken spot is more than i can guessunless they are going to shoot us down like dogs and leave us for the wolves to feed on the wolves are thick around here so leeson told me  i dont believe theyll shoot us down they are not desperate enough yet but they may do it if they attack the fort and lose heavily that will open their eyes and make them as mad as hornets  a little later silver gulch a wide opening in the rocks of the mountain was gained and here the soldiers were again made fast to several trees then the indians prepared their midday meal they took their time about eating and did not offer the white men anything until they had finished  they dont intend to treat us any too good was pecks comment captain cant we fix it to get away  i intend to escape if i can manage it returned the young officer but we must be careful for they are fully armed and they watch us like so many foxes  slowly the afternoon wore away and with the coming of night it grew darker than usual as though a storm was brewing  a storm ought to help us said the captain  some of the indians had departed so that now the guard consisted of but four warriors these red men walked around each prisoner seeing to it that all the bonds were tight  as the men passed peck the old soldier watched his chance and unknown to the red men caught a huntingknife from the belt of one of the number  this knife was concealed up his sleeve and then the soldier waited for his chance to use the blade which was as sharp as a razor  the indians decided that two of their number should sleep while the other two remained on guard soon those to retire turned in while the others sat down to smoke their pipes  this was pecks opportunity and with a slash of the huntingknife he released his hands a moment later the lariat around his ankles was likewise severed  watching his chance peck passed the knife to captain moore and then went back to his position by the tree as if still fastened  thus the knife was passed from soldier to soldier until all were liberated  all told the party numbered six and nobody was armed excepting peck to whom the huntingknife had been returned  motioning to the others to keep quiet captain moore picked up a stick of wood lying near and threw it in some bushes a distance away  this made considerable noise and instantly the two guards gazed in the direction  a wolf perhaps said one of the indians in his native tongue and walked over to the bushes his companion started to follow when captain moore leaped upon him and bore him to the earth     chapter xxiii  a panther in camp   as captain moore fell upon one of the indians peck the private stole after the guard who had walked toward the bushes the other soldiers jumped to where the remaining indians were sleeping to gain possession of the firearms  the indian the captain had tackled was a young but powerful brave and he put up a hard fight to release himself but he had been taken unawares and after he was on the ground the captain saw to it that he did not get up  in the meantime the indian near the bushes turned just in time to see peck raise the huntingknife crack went the red mans rifle and the bullet clipped the soldiers ear the shot was so close that to the day of his death peck carried in his face some traces of the burnt powder  the shot was the last the indian ever fired for in the midst of the smoke peck hurled himself at the warrior and a second later down came the huntingknife piercing the red mans back and entering his right lung the stroke was a fatal one and before the fighting in the glade came to an end the indian had breathed his last  when the sleeping indians awoke they could not for the moment realize what was going on in his bewilderment one leaped up and rushed at a soldier who promptly laid him low by a heavy blow from a rifle stock which almost cracked the warriors skull seeing this the other brave became frightened and ran for the bushes  dont let him escape cried captain moore who was still holding his man down  at once two of the soldiers ran after the fleeing indian and presently two rifle shots rang out followed by a scream from the red man  hes done for said one of the soldiers after the smoke had cleared away he has gone to his happy huntingground  after this turn of affairs it did not take the soldiers long to make prisoners of the two indians who remained alive these fellows were in truth much frightened but tried their best to suppress their feelings  from one of the indians captain moore learned that more indians were expected early the next morning  thats all right said he they will come in time to release you and save you from starvation  going to tie em up captain asked peck  yes there is nothing else to do  better shoot em  i cant shoot them in cold blood peck that would not be human  the wretches dont deserve to live captain the indians and those desperadoes are plotting to wipe out everybody left at the fort  i know that still i cannot bring myself to take their livesand we cant stop to take them along as prisoners the sooner we get back to the fort the better  if we can get back put in another soldier  i dont believe the fort is surrounded just yet returned the young officer  but if it is  then perhaps it will be better for us to be out than in  you wouldnt desert the crowd at the fort would you  you know me better than that gorman we might be able to ride to the next fort and obtain reenforcements  thats so captain i didnt think of that  leaving the dead indians in the bushes and the others tied to the trees the captain and his companions now lost no time in striking out for the fort  fortunately peck was well acquainted with every foot of the territory to be covered and he led the way by a route which was fairly easy and as direct as could be expected considering the wild region to be covered  as he hurried along the young captains thoughts were busy where were joe darry and benson and how were things going at the fort  the indians are not so much to be blamed as the desperadoes he said they have some wrongs although they are more fancied than real but the desperadoes ought all to be either shot down or placed under arrest  right you are returned gorman this district will never prosper until the desperadoes are cleaned out  it was not long before the party began to grow hungry and they had to halt for an hour to prepare some birds which one of the number had brought down with a gun  all the time they were eating one of the soldiers remained on guard for they were fearful a band of indians might come up unawares to surprise them but not a red man or desperado showed himself  nightfall found them still sixteen miles from the fort and unable to walk further  we will camp out where we are said captain moore it is useless to think of covering the distance in the dark besides we might fall into some trap  a storm had been threatening but now the clouds passed and the night proved clear and pleasant it was decided that two men should remain on guard at a time each taking a turn of three hours  the young captain slept from nine oclock until three in the morning then he awoke with the feeling that further sleep was out of the question getting up he walked to a nearby brook intending to wash up and obtain a needed drink  while captain moore was in the vicinity of the brook something stirring in the bushes attracted his attention  carwell did you see that he asked of the guard who was nearest to him  see what captain  that thing in yonder bushes  i see nothing sir  something is moving there come here and look  the private did as commanded and both gazed steadily into the bushes  by jove exclaimed the young officer at length do you see what it is now carwell  i do not captain  its a panther unless i am greatly mistaken  where  lying on the fallen tree behind that tall bush and captain moore pointed with his hand  as he did this the panther arose suddenly then crouched down as if to make a leap at them  shoot ordered the captain and as quickly as the private could raise his rifle he fired but his aim was poor and the bullet flew a foot over the panthers head  missed hang the luck muttered carwell  scarcely had the words left his lips when the panther made a fierce leap and landed directly at the feet of the astonished pair the beast was evidently very hungry or it would not have attacked human beings in this semilight of the early dawn  full of fear carwell staggered back with his smoking rifle still in his hand  the panther growled and switched its tail from side to side the rifle shot had filled it with wonder and it did not know what to do next  be carefulhe is going to take another leap cried the young captain  he was right the panther was now preparing for another spring before carwell could get out of the way the beast came on pinning the private to the earth  as carwell went down the whole camp roused up and the second guard came up on the double quick  whats up captain he sang out  shoot the panther answered the young officer quick or youll be too late dont hit carwell  crack the rifle spoke up and the beast was hit fairly and squarely in the side at this it let out a bloodcurdling scream of pain it had caught carwell by the arm but now it released its hold  a panther roared one of the old soldiers and a big one git your guns boys he aint no beast to fool with i can tell you that  those who had guns ran for them but in the meantime the panther turned around as if to retreat  then of a sudden it seemed to catch sight of captain moore and with a snarl of rage it threw itself upon the young officer and both went over with a loud splash into the brook     chapter xxiv  the skirmish in the brush   up to the time the panther had turned upon him the young officer had thought but little of his own safety being concerned chiefly about carwell who was flat on his back and who looked as if he as going to be chewed up by this wild lean and hungry beast of the forest  but now captain moore found himself attacked and as he went over into the brook he realized that he was in the most perilous position he had yet encountered facing indians and desperadoes was nothing compared to facing this beast that seemed bent upon his destruction  the spot where the young officer struck the brook was five or six feet deep and as the panther came down on top of him he went straight to the bottom  the beast was also submerged but not for long panthers although they can swim do not like the water and this one lost no time in coming to the surface to get air then it let out another scream of pain while the bullet wound in its side dyed the brook red  as the panther came up the young captain tried to do the same but the first thing he encountered was the beasts fierce claws and he received a deep and painful scratch in his left shoulder then he went down again and tried to come up further down the stream but unfortunately the panther moved in the same direction  in the meantime the other soldiers came up to the edge of the brook they realized their captains peril and as soon as the panther showed itself two of them blazed away one hitting the beast in the back and the other landing a bullet in the panthers neck  the fury of the animal was now intense and whirling around it lashed the water of the brook into a perfect foam then it leaped for the opposite shore and made a break for the underbrush before anybody could fire again it was gone  when captain moore regained the surface of the brook willing hands helped him out  hurt questioned peck anxiously  a littleon the shoulder was the answer with a gasp where is the beast  got away in yonder bushes sir thats a nasty dig you had better let me bind it up  carwell how are you  the beast nipped me in the arm answered the private trying to suppress a groan by george but he was an ugly one  thats right put in another soldier you can be thankful you wasnt chewed up  a brief search revealed the fact that the panther had left the vicinity and then the others set to work to bind up the wounds the captain and carwell had sustained  we had better move on now said the young officer when the hurts had been attended to if there are indians or desperadoes around they must certainly have heard those shots and they will be wondering what they mean  they marched on in the gloom and did not halt until the sun was showing itself over the hills to the eastward they had now gained a rise of ground from which with a fieldglass the fort might have been seen but the young captains glass was goneconfiscated as already told by those who had first attacked him  we will draw closer with caution said the young officer we dont want to walk into any trap  less than a mile was covered when peck who had been sent out in advance came back and called for silence  some indians are ahead he said  how many of them questioned captain moore  not less than a dozen or fifteen captain i counted eleven and heard some talking that i couldnt see  where are they  down behind where the brook flows over those sawtooth rocks we were out there fishing last summer  i know the spot you mean what are the redskins doing  nothing in particular i overheard one say to another that he expected white ox along before sundown  they must be an advance guard of the tribe then returned the young officer thoughtfully did any of them see you  i dont think they did  but in this peck was mistaken for scarcely had the soldiers started to walk around the spot where the indians were encamped when a savage warwhoop rang out followed by half a dozen shots  the first round was a deadly one killing two of the men and wounding peck in the side a bullet likewise grazed captain moores shoulder  to cover shouted the young officer as soon as he could speak the indians are on us  he had a gun in his hand and as he gave the command he leveled it at the leader of the party he who had killed one of the soldiers captain moores aim was true and the indian fell lifeless over the very body of the man he had slain  by this time the other indians were coming up and all the soldiers could do was to take to the nearest cover as the captain had ordered the warwhoops continued and shots were fired from several directions  scarcely knowing whether he was hit or not captain moore dashed into the midst of some brushwood and not far away from him came peck the latter had broken his rifle over the head of one of the red men and now advanced with the huntingknife which was still in his possession the young captain held a rifle but just now had no time in which to reload the weapon  they are after us hotlike cried peck after several hundred feet had been covered  the privates breath came short and sharp and now for the first captain moore saw how he was suffering  you are wounded peck  thats right captain  you cant run any more  ive got to run muttered peck between his set teeth theyll be onohon us in another minute  give me your armill help you along  the private held out his hand then gave a pitch and before the young officer could catch him sank on the grass insensible  captain moores heart leaped into his throat for he had known peck for years and the two were very friendly he listened and heard a distant shot evidently the indians were not yet coming in that direction they would first hunt down the others providing they were not already slain  bending down the young officer took peck in his strong arms and threw the private over his shoulder the weight was considerable and made him stagger  ive got to carry him somehow he muttered heaven give me strength to do it  the brushwood was thick ahead but there was a sort of trail made by wild animals and he pursued this until he came to a brook then to keep the indians from following them should they come in that direction he followed the brook for a hundred yards or more at last he reached a point where the banks of the brook were rocky and here he came out and crawled over the rocks not far off was an opening between two large bowlders and here he sank down too exhausted to take another step  it was half an hour before peck came to his senses in the meantime the captain had obtained some water washed the privates wound and bound it up in bandages torn from his shirt the loss of blood had made peck lightheaded  keep them off he murmured keep them off they want to bore a hole in my side keep them off  be quiet peck you are safe answered the young captain soothingly youve been wounded thats the trouble but the private continued to rave for some time when he relaxed into a stupor  with strained ears captain moore waited for the appearance of friends or enemies but nobody came up the brook once he heard two shots far to the northward but whether fired by the soldiers or the indians he could not tell  im afraid its been a regular slaughter he mused sadly and our getting away was a miracle and this surmise proved correct for as was afterward proven all the others of the party were slain within an hour after the surprise occurred     chapter xxv  a lucky meeting   captain where am i  in the woods with me peck  what has happened  dont you remember the indians surprised us and you were shot in the side  the brow of the wounded soldier contracted for a moment and then he drew a long and painful breath  ah yes i remember now are we alone  yes  and what of the others captain  i am afraid they have either been shot down or taken prisoners poor carwell and leeds i know are dead  it was a nasty surprise wasnt it i was sure they hadnt seen me  those indians are sly peck they never let on until they are fully ready we can be thankful that we escaped  how long have we been here  the best part of the day i carried you along the brook and to here and i havent dared to go any further those indians cant be far off  it was good of you to do that for me captain said the private gratefully  i know you would have done as much for me peck what i am worried about is what we are to do next  perhaps you had better wait till dark and then sneak to the fort  how do you feel  weak captain weak as a rag  i shant leave you peck  but you ought to try to save yourself  we can both try to do that when you are stronger  slowly the day wore along until night was once more on the pair peck had tried to stand up but the effort had proved a dismal failure  its no use he murmured i reckon im a fit subject for the hospital and he gave a sickly grin  the night was one captain moore never forgot he was hungry but there was nothing at hand with which to satisfy the cravings of the inner man pecks mind began to ramble again and once he struggled violently thinking he was fighting with an indian who was trying to tear out his side  with the coming of dawn the young officer felt that matters were growing desperate and that he must do something he determined to go on a short exploring tour leaving the soldier where he lay  ill be back inside of half an hour he said make yourself as comfortable as possible while i am gone  dont desert me groaned peck promise to come back captainpromise he pleaded and the young officer promised  on the opposite side of the brook was a series of rocks leading to the top of rather a high hill and captain moore had an idea that from this eminence he could obtain a faint view of the fort and its surroundings  half of the rocks were passed when he came to a sudden halt a low groan ahead had reached his ears as he stopped and listened the groan was repeated  that sounds familiar he thought ive heard that before but where  at last he made up his mind that the sounds came from some wild animal that was wounded and plucking up courage he moved forward again but with his rifle before him ready to shoot at the slightest provocation  the pantherand dying  the young officer was right there on a shelf of rocks lay the wounded beast its breath coming short and heavy and its eyes letting out a glassy stare that caused the captain to shiver in spite of himself  at the sight of a human being the panther tried to rise but the effort was too much for it and it sank down groaning with pain in a pool of blood which had formed  at first captain moore thought to finish by putting a bullet through its head but then he remembered that ammunition was scarce and lowered his rifle  hell be dead by the time i get back he thought and continued on his way up the mountain side  at last the top was gained and he looked around eagerly at first only the plain far below met his view but presently he made out a spot which he knew must be the fort but all was in a blue haze and no details could be distinguished  having spent quarter of an hour on the mountain top he picked his way back to where he had left the panther the creature had now breathed its last and lay stiffened out on the rocky ledge  i must have something to eat and so must peck he said to himself panther steaks may be tough but they will be better than nothing ill go back for the huntingknife and cut off as much meat as well be likely to need for a couple of days  when he reached pecks side he found the soldier sleeping quietly and did not disturb him going back he cut off a generous slice of the panther meat leaving the rest to the wild beasts  the captain hated to build a fire fearing it would attract the attention of the enemy but he did not wish to eat the meat raw and presently having no matches shot his gun into the midst of some dry leaves by this means he soon had a blaze which he fed with the driest wood he could find thus avoiding a great cloud of smoke over the blaze he cooked the steak which was soon done to a turn  when peck awoke he felt stronger and readily partook of the meal brought to him washing down the meat with some water from the brook  what do you calculate to do now captain he asked  from the top of yonder hill i can see the fort in the distance answered the young officer but how to get to it is a question it would be a hard enough journey as it is without having to be on guard against indians and desperadoes  better leave me here and go it alone  no i shant desert you peck well see the thing through together  but the indians might come down on us  weve got to run that risk the question is can you walk at all  for reply peck got up on his feet at first he swayed around a little but presently steadied himself  im good for a little distance captain but i dont reckon to go into any walking match just yet  then well go ahead as soon as you feel played out dont hesitate to say so  captain moore carried the rifle huntingknife and what was left of the meat and also insisted upon having the private lean on his arm in this fashion two miles were covered by noon when they came to a rest under the shade of a big tree peck was pale and showed plainly that the exertion had done him no good  hardest walking i ever did he admitted as he stretched himself at full length it was his willpower alone that had kept him up  well we are gaining said captain moore cheerfully three miles more will see us through  if the enemy dont gobble us in the meantime  the indians are nowhere in sight  they wont be showing themselves if they can help it they spring on ushark  peck broke off short and both listened  somebody is coming this way whispered the young officer come we must get out of sight  he took the wounded soldier by the hand and with all speed the pair crept into some brushwood behind the big tree in the meantime the footsteps of the unknown party came closer  as the man came into view captain moore let out a shout which was full of joy  hank leeson how glad i am to see you  the old hunter started around and drew up his gun then the weapon dropped and he ran forward  captain moore he ejaculated hang me ef i aint glad to set eyes on ye who is that with you  private peck of company b weve had a fight with the indians and a number of the soldiers were killed  the injuns are on the warpath along with the desperadoes under matt gilroy returned leeson i got the word from sam benson early this mornin  and where was benson  out among the hills alookin fer you  and what of my brother and my cousin have you heard anything of them  they are safe at the fort  thank heaven for that  i see yeer both of ye wounded went on leeson as he came closer  my wound is not much but pecks is bad i hardly knew how i was going to get him to the fort are the indians or desperadoes around  they are captainbut whar is jest now the conundrum captain leehes in command nowthinks theres a big plot on foot ter wipe out the fort  he is right but colonel fairfieldwhat of him did they drug him  they did captain but its queer you know of all this  then joe didnt tell you i was with him at the cave  i didnt have time to hear the whole story benson was coming out and i came with him now as youre found i reckon i had better go back with you went on hank leeson  by all means for well have to take turns in supporting peck  a few minutes later the march for the fort was taken up it was a tedious journey and there were times when the young captain felt as if it would never come to an end but at last they came within sight of the stockade and the big flag floating so proudly to the breeze and then several came rushing out to meet them and their hardships for the time being came to an end     chapter xxvi  the enemies within the fort   oh im so glad to see you again will was the greeting which joe gave his brother we were almost certain either the indians or desperadoes had fallen upon you and killed you  well we did have some hot work answered the young captain modestly are you all right  i am  and you darry  im firstclass answered the cousin but i can tell you will there is trouble ahead  i know that darry i must see colonel fairfield at once  he is very ill the surgeon can do hardly anything for him he says he has not the right drugs to reach such a dose as the colonel has swallowed  thats too bad  by this time captain lee was at hand and the two officers exchanged reports nothing had been heard concerning lieutenant carrol the command of the fort now fell upon captain moore  as soon as possible the young commander went in to see his superior he found colonel fairfield very weak and in no condition to talk upon military matters he took the young captains hand and said feebly  you must do your best captain do your best defend the place to the last  i will colonel fairfield answered the young officer and i trust you recover soon  that day and the next passed without incident of a special nature sick and wounded were cared for by the surgeon and a detachment went out accompanied by sam benson and hank leeson to look for any of the soldiers who had been attacked by the indians or desperadoes and who might still be alive  when this party returned they brought in the bodies of two soldiers that had fallen  the indians are gathering in force said old benson who had been right among them in the darkness there are now over a hundred and twenty of them  and what of the desperadoes asked captain moore  the desperadoes number twentysix answered hank leeson i counted noses myself matt gilroy is a reglar captain over em an has em drilled like a company o sharpshootersan i reckon thets wot they are consarn em  then the enemy all told numbers about a hundred and fifty mused the young captain  how many men here fit for duty today captain came from the old scout  not over forty including the cooks and stable help benson all the others are on the sick listand some of them are pretty bad  perhaps the crowd outside are awaitin till ye all git sick suggested leeson with a scowl taint fair fightin is it they ought all to be hung  i must do my best said captain moore gravely i can do no more  as the day wore along and two additional soldiers were taken sick he decided to send a messenger to fort prescott a hundred and sixty miles away for assistance  hank leeson knew every foot of the territory and was chosen for the mission benson was more than willing to go but captain moore told him to remain where he was  if the enemy attack us youll have to be our righthand man benson he said then he added i want to talk to you after leeson is gone  since coming to the fort captain moore had been watching two old soldiers very closely  these soldiers were named moses bicker and jack drossdell their reputations were not of the best and the black marks against them were numerous  some time before the young captain had heard that bicker came of a family of colorado desperadoes and that he had joined the army during a spasm of reformation  the actions of the pair did not suit captain moore in the least and that night he took it upon himself to watch them more closely than ever  in the darkness he saw bicker make his way to the stable and to that spot a little later drossdell followed  something is in the wind and im going to find out what it is he mused and watching his opportunity he passed into the stable unobserved  at first he could hear nothing but the movements of the horses but presently came a low murmur from one corner of the loft  cautiously the young officer climbed the ladder and stepped into the hay  here he could hear the conversation between bicker and drossdell quite plainly  they never suspected the butter he heard bicker say it tastes a little strong but they would rather have it that way than have none and the same way with the condensed milk  when shall we give the signal to the boys came from drossdell  not yet there will be more of them sick by tomorrow night replied bicker  more of the same sort of talk followed until the young captain became fully convinced that bicker and drossdell were in league with the desperadoes and that they had been using some drugs in the butter milk and other articles consumed at the fort in order to make the soldiers sick  as soon as he realized the importance of his discovery captain moore went below  a corporals guard was called out and sent over to the stable and when bicker and drossdell came below they were placed under arrest  whats this for demanded bicker putting on a bold front drossdell had nothing to say and trembled so he could scarcely stand  you know well enough bicker answered captain moore sternly  no i dont i havent done anything wrong captain  march them to the guardhouse was all the young commander said and the two were promptly marched away  as may be surmised the moment the evildoers were alone each accused the other of having done something to bring on exposure  captain moore knew his men well and presently he sent for drossdell and interviewed the soldier in private  i am sorry to see you in such trouble as this drossdell he said i thought you were a better soldier  i havent done anything captain  it is useless for you to deny it do you know what my men would do to you and bicker if they learned the truth they would rebel and hang you on the spotand you would deserve it too  oh captain for the love of heaven dont put us in the hands of the boys pleaded drossdell turning a ghostly white  you and bicker plotted to get us all sick and then let the indians and gilroys gang in on us  ii  it is useless for you to deny it for i heard your talk myself and saw a letter written by bicker to gilroy  bicker formed the plans cried drossdell breaking down completely hehe forced me to help him  forced you  yes captain forced me i stood out a long while but hehewell i might as well make a clean breast of it sir he had me in his power on account of something i did in denver years ago he said he would expose me if i didnt help him  this is the strict truth  yes captain and i will swear to it if you want me to answered the prisoner  you were going to signal the gang when all was in readiness for an attack went on captain moore  bicker was going to do that  what was the signal to be  three white handkerchiefs stuck on the ends of a cross made of sticks six feet long he was going to show these at ten in the morning or four in the afternoon from the southwest corner of the stockade behind the mess hall  and what was the signal to be if you wanted the enemy to hold off for a while  a red shirt if he wanted them to hold off for one day and a red and a blue shirt if they were to hold off for two days  you are certain about these signals remember if you are telling a lie it will all come back on your own head  i am telling the strict truth answered drossdell     chapter xxvii  signals and what followed   the interview over captain moore lost no time in summoning hank leeson  you must depart for fort prescott without delay he said  im ready now captain replied the old hunter  you must ride night and day till you get there  ill do thet too  i have received important news at the longest our enemies will hold off two days i will try to make them hold off a day longer if i can that will give you three days i will write a letter to major hardie at once  this was early in the morning and inside of half an hour the letter was written and the old hunter was off on the back of the freshest and most enduring horse the fort possessed he went fully armed for he knew that he carried his life in his hands  as soon as leeson had gone the young captain summoned the surgeon and told that individual about the drugged butter and condensed milk  dr nestor was incredulous but on an examination said that all were drugged a cat that had drunk of the diluted condensed milk was found in a stupor from which she could not be aroused  its awful said the surgeon  a trustworthy cook was called in and all the butter and condensed milk which were open or which showed signs of having been tampered with were thrown away  this put the soldiers on short rations so far as these commodities went but nobody complained some suspected bicker and drossdell and there was talk of a demand on the captain to have the traitors shot but it came to nothing  what does this mean asked joe when he caught his brother in a quiet spot  in a few words the young captain explained  you and darry must say nothing he concluded we will have our hands full as it is the indians are in this but the drugging was not done by mose the halfbreed  when will you signal to the enemy asked darry  this afternoon at four that will give us at least two whole daysand a lot may happen in that time  if only the surgeon can bring some of the men out of their stupor remarked joe  he hopes to do sonow he knows more about the drugs used against them  if you hadnt caught bicker and drossdell what do you suppose would have happened questioned darry  more than likely every one of us would have been sick answered the young captain with a shudder then the indians and the desperadoes could have walked in here without a struggle  even if help does not come youll fight them wont you will  to be sureto the bitter end  by the way are you certain the ammunition hasnt been tampered with came from joe  i was thinking of that and was going to have an examination made when you stopped me said captain moore and hurried on  an examination showed that some of the powder on the place had been hidden drossdell said this was under the barn flooring and his words proved true  promptly at four oclock captain moore appeared at the southwest corner of the stockade with a red shirt in one hand and a blue shirt in the other  fortunately he was built like bicker and donning a privates hat and coat made him look a good deal like that individual from a distance  slowly he waved the coats to and fro for five minutes  then an answering signal came back from some brushwood on the top of a distant hillthe answer being similar to the signal itself showing the message was seen and understood  it is likely that the indians and desperadoes were much chagrined to think that they would have to hold off for two days but if so they made no sign  the next day proved unusually warm there was nothing for the boys to do in the fort and they wandered around from place to place at drill but thirtyeight soldiers presented themselves all the others being on the sick list  i must say i dont feel very well myself remarked darry i can hardly keep my eyes open  gracious dont say that youre going to get sick too cried joe  i wont get sick if i can help it replied darry but i feel awfully queer  joe did what he could for his cousin but with the limited means at hand this was not much and by sundown darry was flat on his back although the attack he sustained was not as severe as that of many around him  i feel as if i was in something of a dream he told joe that drug must have opium in it  its something like opiumi heard the surgeon say so answered his cousin  at night a strict watch was kept and twice old benson went out to reconnoiter  the indians and desperadoes have surrounded us on all sides he announced but it dont look as if they meant to attack us just yet  with the coming of morning it began to rain but this cleared away by noon and then the sun boiled down as fiercely as ever the sunny spots within the stockade were suffocating and the boys were glad enough to stay within the cool walls of the stone fort  as far as he was able captain moore had prepared the place to resist an attack a weak spot in the stockade was strengthened and the cannon of the fort were put in the best possible condition the soldiers were told where to go in case of a sudden alarm and were cautioned not to waste any ammunition for the supply was limited  thanks to the surgeons efforts colonel fairfield was now somewhat better yet he was too weak by far to get up or to manage affairs so the command still remained in captain moores hands even captain lee was now down and it was a question whether he would live or die  you must do your best captain moore said the colonel feebly i know i can trust you you are brave and your training has been a judicious one  early that night there came a sudden alarm followed by two rifle shots in quick succession at once there was a commotion and everybody sprang to his post  the indians and desperadoes must be coming cried joe and ran for the rifle with which he had been armed  the cause of the alarm however was not from without but from within bicker had forced his way out of the guardhouse and at the risk of breaking his neck had climbed to the roof of the barn and leaped over the stockade into the ditch outside  a guard had seen the leap and had fired on the man hitting him it was thought in the shoulder then a second guard had discharged his weapon but by this time the fleeing prisoner had been swallowed up in the gathering darkness  he must not get away cried the young captain if he does they will attack us at once after him benson and you too forshew and donaldson i will follow with some horses  without delay the old scout climbed the stockade and scrambled over the ditch the others ran around to the gate and soon several additional soldiers followed on second thought captain moore sent the horses out by a lieutenant thinking it best that he remain where he was that being primarily his post of duty  can we go asked joe  no joe stay where you are said his brother if that rascal gets to his friends there will be work enough here never fear  the pursuit of bicker lasted for over an hour and brought on a smart skirmish between the men from the fort and the desperadoes in which one person on each side was slightly wounded but the rascal managed to gain the enemys camp in safety and then those from the fort came back as fast as possible to report  now the deception is up said captain moore with a serious look i wouldnt be surprised to see them attack us before morning  right you are captain replied old benson and my opinion is that the desperadoes and indians will fight hard when once they get going he concluded     chapter xxviii  the demands of the enemy   it was an hour later when the excitement had cooled down a little that captain moore sent for benson again wondering what was to follow the old scout hurried to the room in which the young commander was transacting his business  i want a little talk with you in private benson said the young officer  yes captain  i know youve been wondering why i didnt send you to fort prescott instead of sending hank leeson  you had a right to do as you pleased captain  the truth of the matter is benson i wanted you here you brought joe and darry to the fort and those two boys need looking after we are going to have a fight sooner or later we may win and if we do all right but if we dont  you want me to stand by the boys to the last put in the old scout quickly  i do benson and no matter what comes i want you to promise to do your level best to save them and see them safe back to the east if the worst comes i am willing to die fighting but joe must get out of it somehow if he doesnt it will break my mothers heart and you must do as well by darry for he is an only child  the eyes of the old scout and the young captain met then benson put out his hand which captain moore quickly grasped  i understand captain ill do my best and if those lads dont get away it will be because sam benson aint alive to take em  as you are not a soldier you have a right to leave the fort as quickly as you please went on the young captain therefore if you see the tide of battle turning against us dont wait but get the boys away as speedily and as secretly as you can  i will captain but yourself  never mind me get the boys to a place of safety and i know our family and darrys family will reward you well  i wont want any reward i took to the lads from the start and ill stand by em through thick and thin said old benson  there was but little sleeping done in the fort that night the majority of the soldiers slept on their arms expecting an alarm at any moment yet it did not come and the sun rose on a scene of perfect peace and quiet  but at eight oclock a sentinel announced a horseman approaching bearing a white flag  so they want to talk eh said the young captain all right anything to gain time  the flag of truce was promptly answered and as the horseman came closer many recognized matt gilroy the young captain went out himself to meet the leader of the desperadoes  goodmorning captain moore began the desperado with a regular military salute  what brings you demanded the captain abruptly  well i thought we had best come to termsthats what brought me  terms about what gilroy  terms about surrendering the fort and all of its contents  surrendering to whom  you know well enough captain moore it will be only a waste of time to beat about the bush our crowd and the indians now number over three hundred and we are bound to get possession of the fort and all that is in it  do you speak for the indians as well as for yourself  i do  so far as i know the indians are not on the warpath gilroy i must have a talk with one of their chiefs before i do anything  you know they are on the warpath didnt you have a mixup with them  there are always some indians who are ugly and willing to make trouble  well all the indians are standing in with us on this deal went on gilroy his face darkening and you have got to surrender or take the consequences  what will the consequences be  if you wont surrender well attack the fort immediately we know just how weak you are and let me tell you that we have a dozen or more dynamite bombs on hand with which we can blow the fort skyhigh if we wish  what good will it do you to capture the fort  we know all about the money that is stored here and we want every dollar of it  and if we surrender  if you surrender you will be allowed to march from the place unmolested taking all of your sick with you or leaving them here in care of a doctor if you prefer if you know where your head is level you will surrender went on the desperado earnestly  but if i am compelled to surrender dont you know that our army will be after you gilroy  never mind well take care of that part of it was the answer with a sickly grin then you agree to surrender  i cant do it until i have spoken with one of the leading indian chiefs  at this the desperados face fell  will white ox do he asked after an awkward pause  yes  all right ill bring him along in about half an hour  this ended the interview and turning his horse matt gilroy rode off and captain moore walked back to the fort  a little time gained at least was the young officers comment  it was fully an hour before gilroy reappeared accompanied by white ox and an underchief known as little wildcat  want to talk grunted white ox coming to a halt at a safe distance  have you dug up the hatchet white ox demanded the captain if not let us smoke the pipe of peace together  the pipe of peace is broken answered the old indian the white man is not the red mans friend he makes promises only to break them the indian must fight for what is his own  do you consider this fort your own  the land is the red mansthe white man has stolen it from him the white man must go and leave the red man to his own  if you want the white man to go why dont you drive gilroy and his gang away too  they have promised to leaveafter they have had their share of what is here  oh so thats the bargain  you see how matters stand captain moore broke in the leader of the desperadoes if you know when you are well off youll submit as gracefully as possible  if we leave will you promise to let all go in peace went on the young captain to the indian chief you will not molest the women or any of the young people  yes all the women and young people can go said white ox but the look in his face was not one to be trusted  and if we refuse when do you expect to attack us  at once  the reply came from matt gilroy and white ox nodded in the affirmative  i must consult colonel fairfield first said the captain slowly wondering how he was to gain more time  i thought you were in command remarked gilroy  i wasbut the colonel is getting better meet me here in another hour and i will give you his reply and my own  this did not suit gilroy and white ox but the captain was firm and at last they went off promising to be back exactly at the end of the hour  and then it must be surrender or fight said the leader of the desperadoes sharply no more dillydallying  it must be confessed that captain moore returned to the fort in a thoughtful mood he had an awful responsibility upon his shoulders he called several of the other officers in consultation  for myself i believe in fighting he said but we must consider those who are sick and must consider the women  the colonels wife wishes us to fight to the end replied another officer she is not willing to trust white ox or any of the other redskins  i dont believe in surrendering put in another let us see if we cant hold off until we hear from leeson and fort prescott  and so it was arranged     chapter xxix  opening of the battle   promptly on the minute gilroy and white ox appeared again with the white flag of truce flying between them  this time captain moore took with him one of his lieutenants bacon by name  the interview was shorter than the captain had anticipated  well is it surrender or not asked matt gilroy  we must have more time answered captain moore cannot you wait until tomorrow morning  not another minute was the angry reply is it surrender or not answer yes or no  we will not surrenderat least not yet came from the young captain firmly  then your time is up and we shall attack at once returned the leader of the desperadoes am i not right white ox  you have spoken truly came from the indian chief soon the blood of the white soldiers will flow freely  without another word white ox galloped away and matt gilroy went after him  we are up against a battle now exclaimed lieutenant bacon  i have done my best to delay the contesti can do no more said captain moore  when he returned inside of the stockade he was immediately surrounded  boys we must fight he said in a loud clear voice they will wait no longer but reenforcements must be on the way by this time can i depend upon your standing by me  yes yes was the cry  we know how to do our duty to uncle sam and the flag  let the desperadoes and the indians come on well give them as hot a reception as they ever got  while the soldiers were taking their way to the several defenses of the fort there was the beating of indian drums at a distance followed by the blowing of a bugle in the camp of the desperadoes  soon the beating and blowing came from half a dozen directions  they are gathering sure enough exclaimed joe i wonder how long it will be before they fire the first shot  theyll not be rashbe sure of that answered darry they must know that the fort is a strong place  a little later one of the guards announced that bodies of indians were marching from the south of the fort to the westward  here there was a fringe of trees at a distance of not over a hundred yards from the stockade  colonel fairfield had often thought to have the belt of timberland cut down but had never put the plan into execution  they mean to get as close as possible before they expose themselves said the captain dilberry have the fourpounder trained on that spot  i will captain moore said the head gunner and saluted  quarter of an hour went by and the drumming and bugle calling had ceased  suddenly a shout went up from behind the belt of timberland and a small cannon spoke up sending a shell into the ditch outside the stockade  hullo they have a cannon after all thought captain moore he called dilberry to him can you get the range of that piece he asked  i can try sir  then do it and if you can disable the piece so much the better  at once the head gunner ran off and sighted one of the cannon of the fort with care  a few seconds later the cannon spoke up with a report that rang in the boys ears for long after the ball sped straight into the timberland and cut down a heavy sapling growing beside the piece the enemy were reloading one desperado was killed instantly and another badly injured  a fair shot said the young captain try it again but before dilberry could do so the cannon was withdrawn from sight  after this came another lull as if desperadoes and indians were considering what to do next  its a wonder they dont make a rush said joe if they have so many in their command  nobody cares to risk an advance in the open joe said old benson more than likely they wont try to do much until dark  again the indian drums were rolling coupled with shrill warwhoops  then with a wild yelling and a brandishing of rifles about a hundred and fifty red men burst from cover and ran toward the stockade  they are coming was the cry  stand firm men dont waste your ammunition captain moore cried he turned to the gunner let them have it dilberry  bang the cannon boomed out again and the shot tore through the advancing horde of indians laying four of them low  then came a volley from the red men followed by the discharge of the piece in the hands of the desperadoes the splinters flew in several directions around the stockade and one soldier was seriously wounded the cannon ball grazed the flagstaff and presently it was seen to totter  look out roared old benson to joe and as he spoke down came the stars and stripes on the heads of joe and darry and a section of the flagstaff with it  the flag is down a score of voices took up the cry and a yell of triumph came from the indians and desperadoes  its not going to remain down cried old benson and began to climb what remained of the pole he carried the halyard with him and soon with the aid of the two boys he had the glorious stars and stripes once more in position  in the meantime the soldiers under captain moore were busy the indians were now at the ditch and one had advanced as far as the stockade itself they were yelling like demons and now the desperadoes began to show themselves confident that the fort would soon be taken  they havent got a corporals guard to defend it cried matt gilroy nearly everyone of those inside is sick come on  the noise was now deafening for soldiers and indians were discharging their weapons as rapidly as possible the red men had brought with them a long board to which crosspieces were nailed this board was now set slantingly against the stockade and a dozen warriors rushed upon it  down with them shouted captain moore heave the plank off  a dozen soldiers started to do his bidding the first that showed himself was shot down and the second shared a similar fate but others were more successful and into the ditch went the board with a loud splash carrying the indians with it  the soldiers set up a shout of triumph and as the red men fell back those who could gain a point of vantage fired on the enemy by this movement three indians were left in the ditch dead and several others were wounded a desperado was also brought down those that were uninjured lost no time in seeking cover and thus the first advance on the fort came to an end  all told the attack had lasted nearly an hour and when it was over it was found that everybody was hot dry and dusty but fortunately water was to be had in plenty and a drink refreshed all the dead and wounded were carried away and the latter were made as comfortable as the limited means of the fort afforded  they wont come back in a hurry said the young captain the indians have had their eyes opened  how soon can those reenforcements come will asked joe  i dont think they can get here before tomorrow noon if as soon theyll have a long journey before them and a body of several hundred soldiers cant travel as fast as a single person  of course theyll be cavalry put in darry  i hope soif the cavalry was at fort prescott when leeson got there  colonel fairfield was much disturbed by the shooting and he insisted upon sitting up and hearing the particulars  good he murmured keep them off another twentyfour hours and we shall be saved and then he went off in another stupor  all was now as quiet as if not an enemy was within a mile of the fort but the soldiers remained on guard and this vigilance was increased as the sun went down in the west  this night will tell the tale was old bensons comment boys its do or die and dont you forget it  whether or not the old scout was right we shall soon see     chapter xxx  signals in the dark   joe ive got a scheme to outwit the desperadoes and indians and ive a good mind to propose it to will  it was darry who spoke as he and joe were eating an early supper that night in one corner of the messroom  if the scheme is good for anything let will have it by all means answered his cousin heaven knows we need all the help we can get  my scheme is this went on darry those indians and the desperadoes must know something of our sending off for reenforcements now why cant will send out old benson and a few others to steal off for several miles and light campfires blow bugles and all that to make the enemy think the reenforcements are close at hand  joe clapped his hands thats a grand scheme he cried lets speak to will about it at once  the supper was soon finished and they sought out the young captain who was dividing up his force for guard duty during the night  i was thinking of such a scheme myself he said when he had heard them and old benson suggested it too perhaps ill do it  if old benson goes cant i go with him asked joe quickly  and let me go too put in darry you wont miss us as much as you would miss two of your regulars  at this the young captain grew grave old benson said he would like to take you along perhaps it would be best too he paused you see they may fall on the fort tonight and wipe us out completely  oh will do you really believe that  they will certainly attack us and the men fit for duty number but thirtyfour thirtyfour against several hundred is not much of a force even in a fort  the matter was talked over for half an hour and old benson was called in for consultation in the end it was decided that the old scout should head a party consisting of two regulars and the two boys who were to carry a drum and a bugle and a good supply of matches for bonfires  if you can pass them without being seen head straight for conners hill said captain moore blow the bugle there and beat the drum and then move over to deckers falls and light your first campfire after that youll have to do what you think is best  i understand captain answered the old scout and trust me to fool em nicely if the trick can be done at all  it is not going to be an extradark night went on the young officer so you will have your own troubles in getting away from the fort without being seen  i know a route answered old benson trust me for it but just then he would say no more  the men to go along were named cass and bernstein cass was a good drummer and bugler and bernstein was noted for his good sight and the accuracy of his aim all of the party went fully armed and took with them rations for two days  goodby joe said the captain affectionately and he took his brother by the hand i hope you pull through in safety  and i hope you do too will answered joe and his lip quivered as he spoke perhaps this would be the last time he would see his brother alive never before had the situation appeared so serious as now darry also received an affectionate farewell  in absolute silence old benson led his little party to a far corner of the stockade where there was a small gate fastened with a strong log bar this gate was opened just far enough for them to slip through and then closed again their mission had begun there was no telling how it would end  slipping into the ditch the old scout told the others to lie low while he and bernstein surveyed the situation it was silent and from overhead only a few stars twinkled down upon them  old benson presently pointed with his bony hand  clear that way aint it he whispered  looks so answered bernstein after a searching look lasting several minutes i wouldnt go too close to that patch of underbrush though  the party began crawling along the ditch until they came to a little gully which the last heavy rains had formed here they progressed on hands and knees until they reached some low brushwood then old benson still crouching close to the ground set off on a lope and the others came after him in indian file  if they had been discovered neither indians nor desperadoes gave any sign and inside of ten minutes the fort was left out of sight and they were standing in a hollow fringed with berry bushes the boys were somewhat out of breath and old benson gave them a short spell in which to get back their wind  we were right they are none of em in this vicinity said the old scout getting away was easier than i expected  it was no easy matter with the drum came from cass i came pretty close to falling and smashing it once  the course now led up a small hill and then across a valley to another hill a distance of nearly three miles the trail was by no means straight and the walking was bad and joe and darry had all they could do to keep up with the others  at the last minute captain moore had given the boys half a dozen rockets and explained how the fireworks were to be set off everything they could do to puzzle the enemy was to be done  at last they gained the top of conners hillso called because major conner fell there while battling with some stagerobbers early in the seventies  bringing around his bugle cass blew a long blast and then a regular military call which echoed and reechoed throughout the mountains this was followed by a long roll on the drum and then another call on the bugle  after this all waited impatiently gazing in the direction of the fort which was of course hidden in the darkness  there they go cried joe and as he spoke two rockets flared up dying out almost instantly  the boys had planted two of the fireworks given them and now these were touched off and went hissing skyward leaving a trail of sparks behind two minutes later a single rocket went up from the fort  thats the last observed old benson  ill wager that will set the indians and the desperadoes to thinking said cass  theyll think some more when they see a campfire over deckers falls put in bernstein theyll imagine that they are being surrounded  dont be too sure came from the old scout white ox is no fool he has been through too much fighting if we can only make him hold off a bit thats as much as we can expect you can bet hell have spies up here in less than an hour from now  the march was now for deckers falls a distance three miles to the westward again they advanced in indian file bernstein now leading and old benson bringing up the rear  a mile had been covered when the regular in front called a halt  a small camp is ahead he said there through the trees  without delay old benson went forward to investigate  he found three desperadoes talking earnestly among themselves while warming some coffee over a small fire  listening to their talk he learned that they had been out on the trails leading to fort prescott and had come in with the news that no reenforcements for fort carson were within forty miles of the latter place  gilroy and white ox will be glad to hear our news said one of the crowd theyve been afraid all along colonel fairfield had sent out for aid  not stopping to hear anything further old benson crawled back to the place where he had left the others  we must capture those men dead or alive he said if they carry their news to the enemy there will be another attack on the fort within an hour  leaving the drum bugle and remaining rockets in a safe place our friends advanced until all could see the three desperadoes quite plainly  one of the fellows was unknown to joe but the others were gus fetter and nat potts  the desperadoes had placed their rifles against a tree and old benson motioned to the boys to secure the weapons  as joe grabbed up two of the firearms and darry the third the desperadoes leaped to their feet in alarm  hands up sang out old benson hands up or you are all dead men  the scouts rifle was raised and so were the weapons of cass and bernstein and the desperadoes found themselves at a disadvantage  yet fetter was game and he quickly reached for a pistol hanging in his belt  but the movement quick as it was was not quick enough for bernstein and as the regulars rifle rang out fetter fell headlong across the campfire  do you surrender asked old benson  yes came from potts sulkily and his companion said the same in the meantime fetter had rolled from the campfire and was breathing his last at potts feet  the sight was a thrilling one and caused joe and darry to shudder  cant i do something for that poor wretch asked joe of benson but before the old scout could answer fetter breathed his last  in a few minutes more potts was made a close prisoner  while he was being tied up the third man made a quick leap into the woods  after him cried benson and cass and bernstein did as commanded soon the desperado and the two regulars were out of sight and hearing     chapter xxxi  burning of the stockade   what will you do with him asked joe of benson as he pointed to nat potts  dont be hard on me pleaded potts i meant you no harm  you ought to be hung grunted the old scout you aint fit to live and you know it potts you could make an honest living if you wanted to but you would rather cheat and steal  it was matt gilroy who got me into this answered potts he  dont put it off on to somebody else potts cried the old scout wrathfully if you aint got backbone enough to be honest its your own fault  will you let me go if i promise to leave this territory asked potts eagerly  no sirree was bensons answer you shall suffer the full extent of the law and dont you forget it  while waiting for the return of cass and bernstein the old scout searched potts and the dead body of fetter taking away all their weapons and some papers which potts carried  these papers showed how deeplaid was the plot which the desperadoes had formed to gain possession of the money stored at fort carson and how they had duped the indians under white ox and other chiefs to assist them  at last cass and bernstein came back all out of breath with running  did he get away questioned benson quickly  he did and he didnt answered cass he ran up cedar cliff and seeing we were after him he tried to jump to the other side of the canyon but he missed his footing in the dark and went down and thats the last we seen or heard of him  and thats the last anybody will see or hear of him answered the old scout that canyon is three hundred feet deep and nothing but sharp rocks sides and bottom hes done for  the march onward was now resumed the old scout forcing potts to walk between himself and the boys with his hands tied tightly behind him  if you make any noise it will cost you your life said benson to the prisoner and thereupon potts became perfectly mute to tell the truth the desperado was thoroughly downcast and his face was filled with despair  they calculated that it was two oclock in the morning when the heights above deckers falls was gained a wild spot from which old benson had often viewed the fort miles below in the valley  the driest possible brush was gathered and on this were heaped several goodsized limbs that the fire might burn an hour or two quarter of a mile away another similar fire was kindled and at this spot the boys set off all but one of their remaining rockets  there is the answer from the fort said joe as two rockets flared up in the dim distance anyway will knows we have gotten this far  but he doesnt know of the adventure we have had on the way said darry  as soon as the fires were well under way old benson began to lead the way down the mountain side toward a stretch of timber running within half a mile of the fort  while they were in the midst of the forest a distant firing broke upon their ears  is that from the fort asked joe quickly  reckon it is lad replied the old scout  then our signals havent done any good  perhaps they have but it may be that others have been out spying and they have brought in the same report that potts and his crowd were carrying  as they advanced the firing died away for half an hour but then it was renewed with vigor  coming to another hilltop they could see the flashes of fire as the rifles and cannon were discharged  the indians and desperadoes had approached fort carson in the darkness hoping to catch those inside napping  but the regulars had opened the firing and two indians were killed at the very outset  the red men had brought forward a large quantity of brush and at the risk of their lives they heaped this against the wooden stockade  when joe and the others who were with him gained the plains surrounding the stronghold they saw that the brush was burning at a lively rate  they are firing the fort cried darry heaven have mercy on those inside  i see nothing of indians or desperadoes said joe where have they gone benson  reckon they didnt like those last signals answered the old scout  from a distance they watched the burning of the brush with interest here and there they saw the stockade take fire and then saw a blaze on the stable within the fort yard  the fire has reached inside groaned joe the place is doomed  come on there is no use of our staying here longer cried benson and led the way across the plain now lit up by the conflagration beyond he forced potts with him  suddenly several shots rang out and joe felt a bullet graze his hand then he saw cass pitch forward on his face and heard potts give a yell of mortal agony  poor cass hes a goner muttered bernstein and the desperado is dead too  no more was said for all felt they must run as never before if they would save themselves soon the gully was reached and they dropped to shelter but no more shots followed and in a few minutes more they were close to the burning stockade  friends shouted benson to a guard dont shoot come out here and put out the fire  is that you came from captain moore in the semidarkness are joe and darry safe  yes came from the boys  there was no time to say more for already the soldiers were forming a bucket brigade carrying water with which to put out the flames some had long poles with hooks and with these they dragged a large part of the burning brush into the ditch  all this while some of the regulars remained on guard and occasionally a shot rang out answered by another from a great distance  they have surely withdrawn said the young captain benson the trick worked after all  thats right captain but it wont work many hours you can depend upon that  if it only makes them hold off until morning i shall be satisfied concluded captain moore  by the exertion of the soldiers the fire was kept from communicating with any of the buildings but the stable and of this structure only a corner of the roof suffered but the stockade was greatly damaged and by the time the last spark was out it was seen that it had sustained three openings each eight to twelve feet long  well have to repair these said captain moore and tired though the workers were he made them haul fresh timbers from the woodpile and also tear up part of the barn floor that the stockade might present a whole front to the enemy once more  the fighting had greatly agitated the women in the fort and nobody had slept for two nights yet even now with the fire out and silence brooding everywhere nobody thought of going to bed all felt that this was but the lull before the greater storm  if only the relief would come such was the thought of everyone but drossdell who still remained in the guardhouse heavily chained hands and feet drossdell was deeply downcast and with good reason  at last came the welcome signs of dawn in the east and then a few of the soldiers who could stand the strain no longer threw themselves down to sleep the others pale and haggard sat around in little groups wondering what was going to happen next to each was served extrastrong coffee and the best rations the fort afforded  it cannot last much longer said captain moore trying to cheer them up relief must come sooner or later  he had now but a pitiful twentyeight men left including old benson and joe and darry twentyeight what could such a number do against the attack of two or three hundred desperadoes and indians the situation was certainly one to make the stoutest heart quail  it was too bad you came out here on a vacation said the captain sadly to his brother and his cousin perhaps youll never see home again  oh will do you really think its so bad came from darry  it is hard to tell what i think darry i know we are in a mighty tight box  let us hope for the best said joe leeson must be doing something  if he wasnt caught and shot down joe  that is true and now joe gave a long sigh that meant a good deal  there is but one thing in our favor now this daylight but if no relief reaches us by sundown the captain did not finish but shook his head  a moment later one of the guards called down that he could see some indians to the northwest of the fort  a glass was brought into play and by this a party of seventyfive red men could be made out marching directly for the fort behind the red men came a dozen or fifteen whites  hardly had this discovery been made when another body of indians and whites were seen marching upon the fort from the south  we are to suffer a double attack now was captain moores comment heaven help us and bring us through it in safety     chapter xxxii  relief at lastconclusion   the attack did not come until half an hour later and during the time of waiting the nerves of the boys were strained to the utmost the seriousness of the situation was depicted upon the faces of all the soldiers who felt that the coming contest must decide whether or not the fort was to stand  the firing began on the part of the indians and desperadoes who advanced upon the stronghold from four points of the compass at once the enemy had learned the folly of massing their force and indians and whites came on in a wide open skirmish line  the soldiers within the stockade fired upon the advancing foe as best they could yet by the time red men and desperadoes were within reach of the stockade only three of the foe had fallen  as before some of the indians carried a board with strips nailed across it for steps and the desperadoes had a similar contrivance the two boards were placed at opposite ends of the stockade and while some of the enemy began to mount them others came rushing on with a tree trunk which they used as a batteringram against the stockade gate  the noise was now terrific as rifle and cannon shot sounded out mingled with the warwhoops of the indians and the groans and shrieks of the wounded and dying  as for joe and darry the first shock over each felt as if he was in a dreamas if this terrible sight presented to their gaze could not be true they shot off their rifles mechanically yet when it was all over joe remembered how he had sent one redskin tumbling back into the ditch and darry could tell of a desperado who had dropped his gun because of a shot through the shoulder  fight to the last men shouted captain moore as he discharged his pistol at the leader of the desperadoes gilroy had hit him in the forearm but the young officers aim was still more true and matt gilroy went down never to rise again  in the meanwhile old benson was having a terrific handtohand encounter with white ox each had fired a shot at the other and now they closed in the indian chief with his huntingknife and the old scout with his clubbed rifle  the struggle was as short as it was thrilling benson made a pass which the indian chief dodged then white ox plunged his knife toward the old scouts heart but a quick turn made it catch in bensons huntingshirt down came the rifle butt a second time and the blow catching white ox on the neck forced him to his knees even then he struck at bensons legs but the old scout leaped over his head then down came the rifle butt once more and the indian chief gave a groan which was his last  fully sixty indians and a score of desperadoes were now within the stockade and it looked as if all was lost to our friends a part of the regulars were fighting at the entrance to the stable but the majority were gathered around captain moore at the entrance to the officers quarters behind these were the ladies of the fort and the officers who were sick  perhaps we had better surrender said colonel fairfield when told by his wife of the condition of affairs if we dont he could not finish  kill the white soldiers was the cry from the indians white ox has fallen they must all die spare nobody  captain moore was now fighting as never before beside him stood old benson and not far away were joe and darry each of the number was wounded and hardly any of the regulars were better off ammunition was running low still the horrible din continued and the dust and smoke were blinding  but now hark what was that from a distance sounded out a bugle call then came a shot followed by another and then a regular volley captain moore started and his eyes lit with pleasure  the relief he shouted the relief from fort prescott boys we are saved  hurrah the relief was the shout which made the fort ring from end to end the relief we are saved  give it to the reds and to the desperadoes came from old benson teach em the lesson so they wont forget it dont let a skunk of em escape  nearer and nearer came the shots from without and a bugle continued to blow calls to a detachment still further away then up to the fort rode a troop of dashing cavalry from fort prescott hank leeson beside them and every horse covered with foam crack crack crack spoke up the firearms of the newcomers and indians and desperadoes fell in all directions  we must retreat shouted one of the desperadoes the game is up  retreat retreat came from the others and the red men took up the cry soon the enemy were pouring from the fort grounds even more rapidly than they had entered  there was only a pitiful handful that could follow them the young captain benson and nine regulars but there was no need for even that number for the blood of the cavalry was up and every desperado and red man received one or more shots the instant he appeared soon the enemy were flying in all directions but the cavalry went after them and in the end all but four desperadoes and thirtysix indians were killed the others being forced to surrender  it was rather a silent party that gathered in and around the fort that night victory had come to our friends but the cost had been a heavy one and the hospital ward of the fort was filled to overflowing  hank leeson came in for many a warm handshake and was made to tell his story over and over again  it was a close shave said the old hunter twice i got in a close box with the redskins an i had to shoot one of em down afore i could git away thets wot kept me so long im glad we wasnt an hour later fer then mebbe wed a been too late  all of the principal desperadoes were dead and the same can be said of the indians among the slain was found the body of bicker and if the truth must be told nobody mourned his loss  he is responsible for a great deal of this suffering said captain moore had he lived it is likely he would have been courtmartialed and shot  both of the boys had been slightly wounded yet each felt happy when the fighting was over and they were assured that from henceforth they would be safe to come and go as they pleased  it was like a regular campaign said darry joe we have become soldiers after all  thats so darry replied joe we can call ourselves after this the boys of the fort                                       a few words more and we will bring this story of fort life in the great northwest to a close  two weeks after the events just narrated joe and darry returned to their homes here they were received with open arms by their parents who had heard all manner of ugly reports and who half expected to see them coming back wounded and crippled for life but the lads soon proved that they were not so bad off as that and inside of a few months both were as well as ever  at the fort an active campaign was started under captain moore and the commander of the cavalry and this resulted in the rounding up of six more desperadoes and thirty indians lieutenant carrol and four regulars were found as prisoners of the indians and were released  the desperadoes were turned over to the civil courts and were dealt with severely two being hung and the others being imprisoned for years  drossdell was courtmartialed and after a long trial was sentenced to imprisonment in a military prison for ten years he served six years after which he was released to his credit be it said he turned over a new leaf and from the west went to cuba where he fought with the cubans against spanish rule he was with the cubans at the fall of santiago and died a few weeks later of tropical fever  as soon as the proper medicines could be obtained and administered those who had been drugged at the fort began to recover and inside of two weeks colonel fairfield captain lee and our other friends were around once more although rather weak  the mining company whose money had been saved was exceedingly thankful to captain moore and the others for what had been done and when several years later the young captain left the regular army this company offered him a lucrative position which he accepted and which he fills to this day  old benson and hank leeson still continue to roam the great northwest and are happy occasionally they receive a visit from joe and darry and are never more satisfied than when they have the two young men with them on a hunting and fishing tour  takes me back to years ago says old benson years ago when you were both green as grass  well we
