91760877	the thorogood family by rm ballantyne    although the book is written with ballantynes usual great skill in descriptive passages the actual plan of the book is most unusual for him  in chapter 1 he describes a young family then describes the exploits of some of the boys of the family now grownup in chapters 2 3 4 and 5 but in chapter 5 there is introduced a story about a schoolboy who is nothing to do with the thorogoods though it is quite a good story parts of it reminding one of martin rattler and his days at school  in chapter 6 we are back to one of the thorogood boys who is a missionary in london working among the poor  the final chapter also contains a long story about a third party and ends with most of the family emigrating to the rockies in north america  here again the enwrapped short story is a good read  we must remember that in ballantynes usual style there are often two stories in some way running parallel with each other  in this case there are no less than six and two of those enwrap a further story  it is really quite unusual for ballantyne to write in such a convoluted manner  but be not afraid  the stories are very short  ballantyne normally writes with each of his chapters nearly of the same length but here we have 7 6 7 8 23 9 36 pages in the seven chapters and it consists of at least ten exciting episodes  it is worth a read    the thorogood family rm ballantyne    chapter one  this family was not only thorogood but thoroughgoing  the father was a blacksmith with five sons and one daughter and he used to hammer truth into his childrens heads with as much vigour as he was wont to hammer the tough iron on his anvil but he did it kindly  he was not a growlywowly crossgrained man like some fathers we know ofnot he his broad hairy face was like a sun and his eyes darted sunbeams wherever they turned  the faces of his five sons were just like his own except in regard to roughness and hair  tom and dick and harry and bob and jim were their names  jim was the baby  their ages were equally separated  if you began with jim who was three you had only to sayfour five six seventom being seven  these five boys were broad and sturdy like their father  like him also they were fond of noise and hammering  they hammered the furniture of their fathers cottage until all of it that was weak was smashed and all that was strong became dreadfully dinted  they also hammered each others noses with their little fat fists at times but they soon grew too old and wise for that they soon also left off hammering the heads of their sisters dolls which was a favourite amusement in their earlier days  the mention of dolls brings us to the sister  she was like her mother little soft fair and sweetvoiced just as unlike her brothers in appearance as possibleexcept that she had their bright blue blazing eyes  her age was eight years  it was truly a sight to behold this family sit down to supper of an evening  the blacksmith would come in and seize little jim in his brawny arms and toss him up to the very beams of the ceiling after which he would take little molly on his knee and fondle her while old moll as he sometimes called his wife spread the cloth and loaded the table with good things  a cat a kitten and a terrier lived together in that smiths cottage on friendly terms  they romped with each other and with the five boys so that the noise used sometimes to be tremendous but it was not an unpleasant noise because there were no sounds of discontent or quarrelling in it  you see the blacksmith and his wife trained that family well  it is wonderful what an amount of noise one can stand when it is goodhumoured noise  well this blacksmith had a favourite maxim which he was fond of impressing on his children  it was thiswhatever your hand finds to do do it with all your might doing it as if to the lord and not to men  we need hardly say that he found something like this maxim in the biblea grand channel through which wisdom flows to man  of course he had some trouble in teaching his little ones just as other fathers have  one evening when speaking about this favourite maxim he was interrupted by a most awful yell under the table  why what ever is the matter with the cat said the blacksmith in surprise  its ony me fadder said little jim i found hims tail and i pulled it wid all my might  ah jim said mrs thorogood laughing as she placed a huge plate of crumpets on the table its only when a thing is right we are to do it with our might  pulling the cats tail is wrong    when a things wrong   let it alone   when a things right   do it with might  come now suppers ready  capital poetry old moll shouted the blacksmith as he drew in his chair but not quite so good as the supper  now thensilence  a blessing was asked with clasped hands and shut eyes  then there was a sudden opening of the eyes and a tendency in little hands to grasp at the crumpets butteredtoast bacon and beans but good training told selfrestraint was obvious in every trembling fist and glancing eye only curlyhaired little jim found the smell too much for him  he was about to risk reputation and everything when a glance from his father quelled the rebellious spirit  come jim fairplay  let it go right round like the sunbeginning wi mother  then silence reigned for a timea profound silencewhile upwards of two hundred teeth went to work  ere long most of the children were buttered to the eyes and their rosy cheeks glistened like ripe apples soon the blacksmith drew a long breath and paused  looking round with a benign smile he asked little jim how he got along  fust rate said jim  how i wish said dick with a sad look at the toast that we might go on eatin for ever  is it right daddy asked tom during a pause to eat with all our might  certainly my boy till youve had enough  after that its wrong to eat at all  enoughs as good as a feast you know  now old moll one more cup to wash it all down and then well go in for a confabulation round the fire  now nothing rejoiced the hearts of that family so much as a confabulation round the fire on a winter night or under the great elm in front of the forge on the village green in summer  the table was cleared as if by magic for every member of the family helped  soon little jim was sleeping as sound as a top in his crib and mrs thorogood with her knitting joined the others at the fire by the light of which the blacksmith made a little boat for harry with a gully knife and a piece of stick  its a stormy night said mrs thorogood as a violent gust of wind came down the chimney and rattled the windowframes  ah it was on just such a night that my dear old father and mother were burnt out of house and home said the blacksmith well do i mind about it for i was over ten years old at the time  we never found out what it was that set the house alight but when it had once caught it fetched way like lightningthe wind was so high  the first thing that woke me was sneezin wi the smoke  then id just opened my eyes when i saw the head of a ladder come crash through the window  it was the fireescape  father tried to save mother but he was lame and fell down halfchoked  i tried to help him but i was too young  then a strapping fireman stepped in at the window as cool as a cucumber pitched us all into the escape one after another and so through gods mercy we were saved  ive loved the firemen ever since  they are the boys to show you how to do things well to do things with might and main and no fuss and to submit to discipline without a word  oh father cried harry with blazing eyes i should dearly like to be a fireman an go fightin the flames  and dick asked mrs thorogood wouldnt you like to be one too  no mother  its very grand but i dont like smoke  id rather be a lifeboatman to fight wi the storm and save people from the roarin waves  tom glanced at one of his toy ships and said hed like to fight the battles of his country on the sea  bob looked affectionately at a wooden sword and gun which stood in a corner and thought hed prefer to fight his battles on the land  youre all for fighting i see chimed in softeyed molly i wonder what little jim would like to be if he was awake  i know what battles i would like to see him fighting said mrs thorogood  why exclaimed the blacksmith in surprise i thought you hated fighting of all kinds  no not all kinds  i should like to see little jim fighting the battle of the prince of peace  of course there was a clamorous questioning as to what that meant but we must not devote space to this subject  neither can we afford to follow the history of each member of this family step by step  we will grow them up at once and tell you what came of all their enthusiastic desires and lofty aspirations in succeeding chapters  only thus much will we say in conclusion when the blacksmith said it was time to be off to bed that night the children rose at once gave and received a hearty kiss all round and went off to turn in as sailors express it with a will  they had learned obediencethe most difficult lesson that man has got to learnthe lesson which few learn thoroughly and which our lord sets us as a test of our loyalty to himself when he says saysif ye love me keep my commandments    chapter two  it was what sailors call a dirty night  when you looked out upon the sea it seemed as if there were nothing there but horrible darkness  if you went down to the beach howeverclose under the fishing village of sunlandyou found that there was just enough of light to make the darkness visible  tremendous waves came rolling madly into the bay their white crests gleaming against the black sky until they came down like thunder on the sand  the wind roared and whistled over the bay cutting off the foamtops of the billows and hurling them against the neighbouring cliffs  mingled rain and hail filled the shrieking blast and horrid uproar seemed to revel everywhere  god have mercy on those at sea was uttered by many a lip that night it was a most suitable prayer  some there were doubtless who uttered it with a little shudder as they turned in their beds but said and did nothing more  others there were weak in body perhaps but strong in spirit who reflected with some degree of comfort that they had given of their gold to help those whose business it is to help the perishing and there were others who had little gold to give but who gladly gave their strong stalwart bodies and risked their precious lives to save the perishing  many of these last were on the beach at sunland that night with oilskin coats and caps cowering in the lee of boats and rocks or leaning against the furious gale as they tried to gaze out to sea through the blinding sleet and spray  among these fishermen were two young mentall and strongwho seemed to despise shelter and stood at the very edge of the raging sea  one was a blackbearded man of the coastguard  the other as his dress betokened was a jacktar of the royal navy  there she shows a light said the naval youth as a flame like that of a blazing tarbarrel shot suddenly up against the dark sky and showed the rigging of a wreck far out in the bay where the war of wind and waves was fiercest  scarcely had this light appeared when the coastguardsman laid his hand on the young sailors shoulder and pointed towards the cliffs far away to the left of the bay  there a rocket had cut the heavens with a line of vivid fire  while they gazed another sprang up into the sky  a vessel on the rocks said the coastguardsman he had to shout in the others ear so loud was the gale my duty lies there  will you go with me or stay to see the lifeboat start  ill stick by the lifeboat shouted the manofwars man and they parted  ah it was grand to see that lifeboat go into action  she could be easily seen though the night was so dark for she was painted pure white and bright blue with a scarlet strip round hera thing of light but by no means a light thing  she was so large and stout and heavy that she required a strong carriage on four wheels to transport her from her boathouse to the edge of the sea which foamed and hissed and leaped up at her bow as if to taste the morsel which it hoped soon to swallow  while the boat was yet on its carriage her stout coxswain or captain clambered in  now then my jolly volunteers he shouted jump up and on wi your lifebelts  at that word our handsome young sailor laid his hands on the edge of the boat and vaulted into her as if he had been made of indiarubber  ten more men followed his example and quickly put on their belts  nobodys allowed to go off without a lifebelt said the coxswain to the young sailor besides its against rules to let you go  hows that asked the youth you called for volunteers  yes but our volunteercrew is already made up so you must jump out thank you all the same my fine fellow  the manofwars man was too well disciplined to think of resistance even for a moment  with a look of disappointment and an active bound he leaped out upon the sand  at that moment one of the men raised an oar which was blown round by a sudden blast and its end struck another of the crew on the temple rendering him almost insensible  he had to be put out at once and another volunteer was called for  like a flash of light our youthful seaman again vaulted into the boat  his services were now accepted and a cork lifebelt was given to him which he quickly put on  meanwhile crowds of men and even some women and boys stood ready at the launchingropes  the word was given  there was a strong and a long pull altogether and the lifeboat sprang into the sea as if it had been alive with her crew seated and the oars out  a huge wave caught her bow and raised her up almost perpendicular  she seemed as if about to dance a reel upon her rudder  our manofwars man had rode in many a wild sea but never before had he seen the like of that  nevertheless he clung to his seat like a limpet and pulled at his oar with all his might  the others were more accustomed to that special work  just as she seemed about to topple over the boat dropped forward and plunged out to sea  the next wave caught her in the same way but with less power  another stroke of the short stout oars and they had got fairly off into deep water  then did the heart of the young sailor beat wildly for besides rejoicing in that fierce struggle with the storm he knew that his mission was one of mercy as well as danger  but how much more wildly did his heart beat when he reached the wreck and by the light of the blazing tarbarrel beheld about twenty human beingssome of them women and childrenclinging to the wreck which was buried in foaming water by every sea  one by one they were got into the lifeboat with great difficulty  then the boat was pushed off and rowed towards the land  what a deeptoned shout there was on shore when her light form was dimly seen coming in on the crest of a great billow  and what a mighty cheer rang out when she drew closer and the man at the bowoar stood up and cried thank god all saved  just then a monster wave fell on the stern of the boat and filled it one little girl was swept overboard and went away with the backward rush of water as the boat was hauled out of danger  every one saw this and a terrible cry went up but only one man moved  our young sailor sprang after the child  he knew that it was almost certain death to enter that surf without a rope but a spirit of selfsacrificefounded on the great example of jesusurged him on  he had no time to thinkonly to act  he caught the child and was dragged along with her into the wild sea  at that moment another coastguardsman who chanced to be a friend of the manofwars man came upon the scene  seeing what had occurred he seized the end of a rope which some men had just brought down tied it round his waist dashed into the sea caught the sailor and the girl in the wide grasp of his strong armsand then all three were hauled to the land in safety  the poor child was nearly insensible and had to be carried to a neighbouring cottage and the young sailor staggered so from exhaustion that his friend and another man were obliged to support him as he went  who is he inquired one of the fisherwomen as she followed behind  the coastguardsman looked over his shoulder with a proud glance in his sparkling eye and said aloud his name is richard thorogood  a statement which was received with three loud and ringing cheers    chapter three  but what of the wreck under the sunland cliffs which had sent up rocketsignals of distress on that same dismal night  when our coastguardsman with the black beard reached the scene he found as he had expected that his comrades of the coastguard had not been idle  they had brought down the famous rocket apparatus with which so many lives are saved every year on our stormy shores  the wreck was in a very different position from that in the bay instead of being far away from shore among rolling billows that raged over the flat sands this vessel a brig lay hard and fast among the rocks not a hundred yards from the foot of the cliffs  against these frowning cliffs the wild waves thundered as if they wished to beat them down  failing in that they fell back and seemed to go mad with disappointment leaping hissing and whirling among the rocks on which the brig had been cast  the brig was so near that the men on shore could see the forms of her crew as they clung to the rigging frantically waving their arms and sending up shrieks of despair and loud cries for help  truly there was urgent need for help for the sea broke over the vessel so furiously that it was evident she must soon go to pieces  there was only one little spot of partial shelter at the foot of the cliffs where man could stand on that fearful night  here the men of the coastguard had set up the rocket apparatus  the rocket was in position and about to be fired when our blackbearded coastguardsman arrived the light was applied  suddenly the group of spraywashed men and a few palefaced spectators who had ventured to descend and part of the overhanging cliffs burst into intense light as the great rocket went out to sea with a wild roar  it was like a horrid fiery serpent and carried a line tied to its tail  it plunged into the waves and all was dark again but there was no cheer from the wreck  the aim had not been good and the rocketline had missed its mark  fetch another look alive shouted our blackbearded friend as he seized set up and aimed a second rocket  again the light burst forth and the rocket sprang out in the teeth of the gale  it fell beyond the brig and the line caught in the rigging the wrecked crew seemed to understand what was required of them for they immediately began to haul on the rocketline  to the shoreend of it was fastened by the men on the rocks a block or pulley with a double or endless line called a whip through it  when the men in the brig had hauled this block on board they fastened it to the stump of the main mast  then the rescuers on shore tied a thick cable or hawser to their double line and ran it out to the wreck but when this thick rope reached the crew they did not seem to know what to do with it for it was not hauled upon but continued to hang loose  they must be foreigners and dont know what to do next said one  prhaps theyve got too cold to work it said another  i wish we had a little more light to see what theyre about  we cant afford to wait cried our friend blackbeard quickly throwing off his upper garments run me out lads on the whip  there wont be much risk if youre quick  risk exclaimed one of his comrades it will be certain death  but the daring coastguardsman had already seized the thin line and plunged into the boiling surf  his anxious comrades knew that delay would only make death more certain so they hauled on the endless line as quickly as they could  of course being rove through the block before mentioned the other half of it went out to the wreck with the gallant rescuer holding on  and what an awful swim that was  the line pulled him out indeed but it could not buoy him up  neither could it save him from the jagged rocks that rose out of the sea every now and then like black teeth which were quickly reswallowed by each crashing wave  it was more like a dive than a swim for the seething foam burst over him continually but every time he rose above the surface to gasp for breath he sent up a great shout to god for strength to enable him to save the perishing  those loud prayers were drowned by the roaring tempest but though unheard by man they did not fail to enter the ears of him who rules in earth and heaven  once the hero was thrown headlong on a rock and so severely bruised that he lost hold of the rope and when swept off again was left foundering in the foam  his comrades could barely see that something had happened to him and a loud cry of consternation arose when they felt the line run light and slack  but our hero caught it again and the cry was changed to a cheer as they ran him out to the vessels side  he was soon on board and saw at a glance what was the matter  the crew of the brig being benumbed by long exposure had not strength to tie the heavy cable round the mast  this the coastguardsman did for them at once and as he did so observed that there were two little girls among the crew  then he gave a wellunderstood signal with a ships lantern to the men on shore who fastened a slung lifebuoy to their whip line hung it by a block to the thick cable and ran it quickly out to the wreck  there was no time to lose now  our hero seized the two little girls and put them into the bag which hung from the circular lifebuoy  take care of my darlings gasped the captain of the brig who clung to the ships side almost quite exhausted  come get into the buoy and go ashore with em yourself cried our hero  no  the three of us would be too heavy send the steward  hes a light man and brave replied the captain  the steward was ordered to jump on the buoy and cling to it so as to guard the little ones and prevent their being thrown out  a signal having been again given with the lantern the lifebuoy was drawn swiftly to land  it was a terrible passage for the brig had begun to roll on her rocky bed and at every roll the hawser and the lifebuoy dipped into the sea or were jerked violently out of it while the risk of being let drop on the black rocks that came grinning to the surface was very great  but all went well  the three were received on the rocks with cheers and conveyed up the cliffs to the coastguardhouse above where warm welcome and shelter awaited them  the cheers were not heard by those in the wreck but the reappearance of the lifebuoy proved that the children had been saved and a deep thanks be to god burst from their fathers lips  still the captain refused to go when urged  no he said let the men go first  so one by one the men were safely hauled on shore  now captain its your turn at last said our hero approaching him  he still hesitated  then the stout coastguardsman absolutely lifted him into the lifebuoy  no time for ceremony he said with a smile giving the signal with his lantern the brigs going fast  tell em to look sharp on shore for im gettin used up with all this work  away went the captain and in a few minutes back came the lifebuoy  not a moment too soon  blackbeard sprang in as the mizzenmast snapped with a report like a cannon and went over the side  the next wave broke up the wreck itself  before the lifebuoy had gained the shore it was plunged into the sea out of which it no longer rose the support of the wreck being gone  the men on shore now hauled on the rope with desperate energy for a few minutes more would be sure to settle the question of life or death  through the surging breakers and over the rugged rocks the lifebuoy was dragged and a shout of relief arose when the gallant coastguardsman was seen clinging to it  but he was insensible and it was with difficulty that they loosened the grip of his powerful hands  then they bore him up the cliffs and laid him in his own bed and looked anxiously upon his deadly white face as they covered him with blankets applied hot bottles to his feet and chafed his cold stiff limbs  at last there came a fluttering sigh and the eyelids gently opened  where am i he asked faintly  a young man having the appearance of a clergyman laid his hand gently on his shoulder  all right tom he said through the goodness of the lord youre saved and fourteen souls along with you  thank god said tom thorogood fervently and as he said so the tide of life once more coursed strongly through his veins and brought back the colour to his manly face    chapter four  the great city was sound asleep  it was the deadest hour of the night if we may apply that term to three oclock in the morning the hour at which most people have sought and found their pillows  late revellers had ceased to shout and sing early risers had yet a good hour of rest before them if not more  of course there were many wakeful sick folk ah how many in that mighty hive called london  but these did not disturb the profound quiet that had descended on the city only a few weak but steady lights in windows here and there told of their existence  among the sleepless on that calm dark night there was one man to whom we draw attention  his bronzed cheeks and tall muscular frame told that he was not one of the wakeful sick neither was he a sicknurse to judge from things around him  he sat with his elbows on his knees and his hands clasped gazing into the fire and meditatingperhaps building castles in the flames  his eyebrows were very bushy and his looks stern but there was a play of gentle kindly feeling round his mouth he was one of a gallant band of picked men whose duty it is to do battle with the flames a member of the london firebrigade  two other men like himself lay on two little iron beds sound asleep with their clothes on  there was this difference between them however that the wakeful man wore brass epaulettes on his shoulders  brass helmets and axes hung round the room  a row of boots hung in a rack a little telegraph instrument stood on a table near a map of london and a small but sociable clock ticked on the wall  that clock had quite a lively cheerful tick  it seemed to talk to the fireman with the bushy brows until he smiled and looked at it  tictictic said the man how low and gentle your voice seems tonight  everything is so still and quiet that you appear to be only whispering the flight of time  tictictic replied the clock  but the fireman heard no more for just then a faint fardistant sound broke upon his ear  it drew near like a rushing wind  then like the noise of hurrying feet  the man rose and nudged one of the sleepers who sat up and listened after which he got up quickly reached down his helmet and awoke his companion while the first fireman went to the station door  some one ran against it with fearful violence as he laid his hand on the lock and the alarmbell rang a tremendous peal as he threw it open  fire yelled a man who seemed all eyes and hair  just so where is it replied the fireman calmly glancing at the clock  fire again yelled the man of eyes and hair who was for the moment mad with excitement  youve said that twice where is it said the fireman seizing the man by his arm while the two men who had been asleep slipped out like fleet but quiet ghosts  one called up the sleeping firemen the other got out two horses which stood ready harnessed in their stalls  the firemans grasp sobered the madman  a street was named  the outbreak of the fire was instantly telegraphed to headquarters and thence to other stations concerned  round came the horses in flowed the roused firemen buttoning their garments as they ran each to his own peg for helmet and axe  at the same time two or three hauled out the steam fireengine and yoked the horses  three minutes from the first shout of fire had barely elapsed when the whip cracked eight or ten helmeted men sprang to their seats the steeds bounded away and tore along the no longer quiet streets leaving a trail of sparks behind them  haste haste was the one idea  one minute saved may be a matter of life or death in cases of fire  constant training stern drill made every man act like a calm cool collected thunderbolt  no fuss but tremendous energy  no noise but now and then a deep bass roar when any vehicle chanced to get in the way and a quiet smile when the danger was passed  thus they rushed along like a fierce fiery monster until they reached a square in the great city which was bright as with the sun at noonday a mansion was blazing from cellars to attics  our engine was soon at work  other engines whose stations lay nearer to the scene of action were already pumping volumes of water into the flames  a strong force of police kept back the vast crowd so as to let the firemen do their work undisturbed  it was deadly work they had to do  not only were flames spouting from every window but masses of brickwork and blazing beams were falling in various places rendering the service full of danger  a london crowd is usually wellbehaved but there are sometimes a few forward geese in it who think they can do things better than other people  one such a huge man with a foreign accent became excited shouted oh vy dont you put im hout broke through the crowd and rushed among the firemen  our friend with the brass epaulettes and bushy eyebrows chanced to pass at the moment  vy you not put more vatter on im shouted the foreigner  the stern countenance of the fireman relaxed and a humorous smile lit up his countenance for one instant but he took no other notice of the foreigner who was quickly collared by two policemen as strong as himself and thrust back into the crowd where he was received with laughter and presented with much good advice  one little boy in particular recommended him seriously to go home and ask his mamma to put him to beda remark which was received with great delight by the bystanders  but there was not much laughter for the fire was very terrible and there was a report that some of the inmates had not been rescued by the fireescape men  meanwhile our fireman with the epaulettes who was foreman of that district went about like a general in action watching the flames sternlygiving a quiet order to one indicating a point of vantage to another giving a helping hand here and there with the hose answering a quick question promptly and doing his utmost to dispose his force in such a way as to quell the raging fire  all this time he moved about among smoke and flames and falling materials as if he bore a charmed lifewhich indeed he did for as he afterwards said himself the hand of god shielded him and nothing on earth could kill him till his work on earth was done and nothing on earth could save him when his time to die should come  this sentiment was partly at least the secret of the firemans cool courage in the midst of danger  but the enemy was very strong that night and the brigade could make no impression whatever on the burning house the inside of which glowed like a smelting furnace  try the drawingroom window jim wi the fireescape said our foreman to one of his men  he helped jim to push the huge ladder on wheels to the window mentioned and placed it in position  while jim ran for a nozzle and hose there was a great cry from the crowd  a woman had got out on the ledge of an attic window and knelt there shrieking and waving her arms while the smoke curled round her and the flames leapt up at her  she was high above the head of the escape but there were flyladders which could be raised above that  these were instantly hoisted and our foreman sprang up to the rescue  the danger of the attempt lay in thisthat though the lower and upper parts of the escape were comparatively free from smoke the middle was shrouded with a dense mass through which now and then a lurid red flame burst  but our hero thought only of the woman  in a second or two he had disappeared in the smoke  two of the firemen stood below holding a nozzle of the hose and directing it on a particular spot  they did not dare to move from their post but they could see by a glance upwards what was going on  fred said one to the other in a low voice hell save her or therell be a man less in the brigade tonight  he never does anything by halves  whatever he undertakes he does well  depend ont that harry thorogood will save that woman if she can be saved at all  as he spoke harry was seen emerging above the smoke but when he reached the top of the highest ladder he was fully six feet below the spot where the woman knelt  come girl come he shouted and held out his arms  the terrified creature hesitated  she was afraid  she doubted the strength of the escapethe power of the man  come come again he shouted  she obeyed but came against the fireman with such force that the round of the ladder on which he stood gave way and both were seen to go crashing downwards while something like a mighty groan or cry rose from the multitude below  it was changed however into a wild cheer when harry was seen to have caught the head of the escape and arrested his fall with one powerful hand while with the other he still grasped the woman  god favours them said a voice in the crowd as a gust of wind for a few seconds drove smoke and flames aside  our bold fireman seized the opportunity got the woman into the shoot or canvas bag under the lowest ladder and slid with her in safety to the ground  the pen may describe but it cannot convey a just idea of the thrilling cheers that greeted the rescued woman as she was received at the bottom of the escape or the shouts of applause and congratulation that greeted harry thorogood as he emerged from the same burnt bleeding scraped scarred and blackened but not seriously injured and with a pleasant smile upon his dirty face    chapter five  we turn now to a battlefield but we wont affect to believe that the reader does not know who is one of the chief heroes of that field  robert thorogood is his name  bob does not look very heroic however when we introduce him for he is sound asleep with his mouth open his legs sprawling his eyes tight shut his bed the ground his pillow the root of a tree and his curtains the branches thereof  the only warlike point about bob is the trumpetsound that issues from his upturned nose  bobs sentiments about soldiering are queer  his comrades laugh at him a good deal about them but they never scoff for bob is strong and full of fire besides he is a pattern of promptitude and obedience so they respect him  moreover he is a kindly and jovial man therefore they are fond of him  the battlefield of which we write was in the east  the fight had been between the british and russians  the british had been victorious and slept on the field  when the bugles sounded the next morning they stopped the nasal trumpets everywhere and corporal robert thorogood was the first man of all the host to fall inwhich he did by himself  but he was not long alone others quickly joined him  the companies were soon numbered proved formed into column and marched off  then there was a short halt for breakfast  why youre not half a soldier bob said a hearty young comrade while hastily eating his rations  i saw you spare a russian officer yesterday after he had cut off the little finger of your left hand  what good would it have done to have killed him asked bob with a smile as he looked at the bloody stump which had just been dressed by the surgeon the poor fellows leg was broken by a bullet the moment after he had done it so he could do us no more harm in this campaign then his death would not make my little finger grow on again  besides i dont like killing men  why did you join the army then if you did not do so for the honour and glory of fighting which means killing our enemies  ah you may ask that indeed  i mistook my profession i suppose however ill do my duty while i remain in the service  as he spoke firing was heard in the distance and the men were ordered to fall in hastily before breakfast had been quite finished  the firing increased and soon the advance guard was seen falling back in good order over the brow of a small hill or slope  rifle balls began to fly overhead and a few to drop unpleasantly near the troops suddenly our corporal was startled by an appalling cry behind him  he turned quickly and saw the young soldier with whom he had been so recently conversing lying on his back stone dead with the blood oozing from a hole between his eyes  there was no time to think however  his battalion was ordered to the front to defend a narrow rocky pass which the enemy were attempting to carry by storm  twice already they had made the assault and had almost succeeded on the second attempt  a third assault was being made when thorogoods company came up  they rushed forward just as the russians crowned the heights and were driving the british back  the reinforcements checked them but did not turn the scale at first  there was one gigantic russian who stood towering above his fellows with clubbed rifle furiously knocking down all who came within his reach like horatius or one of the other heroes of ancient rome  at him corporal thorogood sprang grasping his rifle by the muzzle as he ran and whirling it on high  the russian saw him coming  the two rifles met with a crash and flew into splinters  bob dropped his weapon grasped his adversary by the throat thrust him back and bore him headlong to the ground  this incident turned the scale  a cheer followed  the british swept forward with such irresistible fury that the men in front were thrust upon the foe in a mass bob and his enemy being turned heels over head in the rush  a wellsustained fire scattered the foe like chaff and those who had been thrown down were taken prisoners  among them was the gigantic russian with the corporal still holding his collar tight in his iron grasp  well done my man said the colonel of the regiment as he rode past bob  the colonel was a man of few words  he said no more on that occasion but every one knew that he would not forget the man who had so bravely turned the tide of battle that day  bob however did not escape altogether unhurt  he had been rather severely wounded and afterwards had to spend a considerable time in hospital  as his wound did not prevent him from moving about he soon became a valuable assistant to the surgeons and nurses in the hospital  ah said he one night when smoothing the pillow and attending to the wants of a severely wounded soldier this comes more natural to me  it suits me better than fighting  i wish you were one of the regular nurses corporal said one of the surgeons heartily you do everything so thoroughly and with such a will  but bob was not allowed to remain long at his peaceful work  being a healthy and temperate man he soon recovered and ere long found himself in the trenches before sebastopol  it was winter  one bleak raw morning just before daybreak bob plodded down with his party through slush and mud to take his turn of fighting before the great fortress  it was bitterly cold and dark some of the men were grumbling terribly  ah then wont you shut your tatie traps said a big irishman who had won the victoria cross the week before for conspicuous gallantry  we engaged for this sort o work lads when we listed remarked bob an are paid for it so lets stick to our bargain wi the queen an do our duty well  troth thats well said remarked the irishman  whats worth doin at all is worth doin well as my ould grandmother used to say when she whacked me  there was a faint laugh at this and the grumbling ceased  come corporal free said bob as weve got to sit here till morning youd better tell us one of your farfamed stories to make the time pass pleasantlyat least as pleasantly as circumstances will allow  ay jacob free cried the irishman thats well said  give us that one about yoursilf whin ye was a schoolboy  a good story you know is niver a bit the worse o bein twice towld  hear hear cried bob come along now corporal an give us the schoolboys story  corporal jacob free who was a gentlemanly man somewhat advanced in years said he would rather tell about some one else than himself but this only made his comrades more determined  well then said he at last since you will have it ill give you what bob thorogood has namedthe schoolboys story  it was with an intense hatred of lessons and books that i began my schooldays  not an unusual experience i believe with boys  my parents were poorthough i have every reason to conclude that they were scrupulously honest hence i began my school career rather late in lifeat about twelve years of age  but previously to that my muchloved muchabused and longsuffering mother had taught me to read and write so that my brain was not altogether unfurnished when i went to school  it was a village school in a remote district of scotland the master was a tall thin cadaverous and kindly man of considerable attainments and with a strong affection for boys  had it been otherwise he must have died youngerof a broken heart  i loved that manbut i worried him  a pang of toothachelike remorse shoots through me still when i think of the sorrows i caused that good man but the pang is mitigated by the reflection that i lived to make amends to him  i liked the schooldays well enough at first chiefly because i devoted myself entirely to play and refused work  besides there was something amusing in the novelty of the thing and there was much interest in the mischief that could be done in school also in the deeds of daring and violence that could be done out of it with the able assistance of a score or so of boys of almost every age and size  but the liking moderated with experience especially when the master having tried every method of encouragement and persuasion in vain adopted the trying method of keeping me in during playhours  to escape this punishment i tried to learn a little  i was a bully when i went to school being big and strong for my age i mention the fact with shame but it is some satisfaction to be able to add that i was not a bully when i left it  my chief enemy and afterwards dearest friend saved me from that state  he and i were the biggest and strongest boys in the school  his name was tom turner  in nearly all respects turner and i were opposites  he was clever and studious i stupid and idle  he was gentle and kindespecially to little boys i rough and disobliging  he was usually dux i invariably booby  you shouldnt be so hard on little spinks he said to me in a quiet way one day in the playground he cant defend himself you know  you let me an little spinks alone i replied angrily yet with some hesitation for i did not feel quite sure that i could thrash turner  i expected a sharp rejoinder but he merely smiled and turned away  from that date i set tom turner down as a coward and worried spinks more than ever just to spite him  one day i had been harder than usual on little spinks who was a mere human spiderall legs and arms with a roundish bodywhen tom called me aside and quietly began to lecture me just as if he had been a grownup man  i kept down my indignation at first having made up my mind to have a quarrel with him but the amiable tone of his voice subdued me  you should consider jacob he went on taking no notice of my flushed face and angry frown what a poor little squirrel of a thing spinks is and what a great powerful fellow you are  its not fair you know and hes a kindly harmless sort of a fellow too  besides if his poor mother knew how you treat him it would almost break her heart for shes very delicate and he is her only child  you know i visited her last year on my way from london in passing the village where she lives  youve been there havent you  no i replied sulkily  oh man jacob you would enjoy a visit to spinkss home returned tom still taking no notice of my state of mind its such a splendid place for troutfishing with a burn full of the deep oily pools you are so fond of and lots of seatrout and mrs spinks is so kind and jollythough so delicate just like little spinks himself but of course a good deal larger  from this point turner went on to describe his visit in such a cheery way that i was forced into a better state of mind though i did not forgive him for lecturing me  it chanced that i received a lecture also the same evening from our master  jacob my boy he said laying his large hand gently on my head you ought to give more attention to your studies and try to be a better boy  youve got the elements of a smart man in you but a man must be made jacob  if a lad grows up without any selftraining he is generally fit for nothing and only a trouble to society  youre fond of your mother i thinkare you not  yes sir said i in some surprise at the question  then you would be sorry to give her pain i know and your present course of conduct is sure to do that if you dont mend  you would be sorry to see your mother take handfuls of her small income and fling it into the sea would you not  of course i would sir said i still more surprised  well you have caused her to do that for your school fees might as well have been flung away for all the good you have done hitherto  but come ill say no more just now  i feel sure you will try to do better you have only got to try asking god to help you and youre certain to succeed  i expect to be proud of you yet jacob  there be off and play  i was somewhat touched by this brief reproof but not humbled  the lecturing tone assumed by turner still rankled and a feeling that i deserved severer treatment than i received made me worse  i resolved to harden my heart and from that date became more mischievous and domineering as well as idleif possible  i saw that the master was grieved but did not care  one day in autumn some of us were sitting on a rail swinging our legs and chatting  turner was not there but little spinks was  i tell you what said i referring to a remark made by one of the boys i think it is not only contemptible to try to learn ones lessons but ridiculous  id rather learn them than get whacked said one  well i would rather get whacked than learn them said i besides of what earthly use are latin and greek i should like to know  fellows cant get along in the learned professions without them said a boy whom we named tiddler  he was a follower of turner and usually kept pretty near him in the class  very true said i with a look of mock respect but as none of us intend to enter the learned professions except doctor tiddler and professor turner we dont want latin or greek what we want is fun  hear hear burst from spinks who was an impressionable little fellow and easily influenced for good or evil  his exclamation was so genuine and heartfelt that there was a general laugh and one of the boys suggested that as little spinks did not mean to go in for any of the learned professions they should elect him professor of fun  this was unanimously agreed to  but come said i jumping down we must not spend all the evening here idling  what shall we do  go an study greek said the newlyelected professor of fun a suggestion which was received with a shout of derisive laughter  i should like to have some of old maggies apples for supper said i  but whos to crib them asked a largeheaded boy whose appearance reminded one of a tadpole  little spinks of course said i  come be offand be sure that you take good ones  ill follow and watch to see that no mischief happens to you  its a shame to rob the poor old woman said tiddler  ill have nothing to do with it  im sure that tom turner would object if he were here  oh you neednt come if youre afraid said i with a sneer and if there are any other cowardly turnerites here they may join you whoever has got pluck will follow the frees  lead on spinks  the greater number of the boys followed me and from that date the school was divided into two sectionsturnerites and frees  we went straight to the back wall of old maggies garden and i helped little spinks over desiring him to gather a capful and fetch them and then he could return for more if thought desirable  my enemy turner was fond of old maggie and frequently went to see her and have a chat  it chanced that he was visiting her on the evening we had decided to steal her apples  while sitting beside her listening as earnestly to a prolonged and graphic account of the old womans troubles as if he had been the minister of the parish he chanced to look out of the window and saw a boy descending one of the appletrees  one of old maggies troubles was the stealing of her apples by village boys  she had dilated extensively on the subject and aroused her friends anger with a burst of indignation he rushed out and caught little spinks in the act of making off with his second capful of apples  what  spinks  i should not have expected this of you said tom releasing my little victim  i didnt want to do it whimpered spinks but i couldnt help it i  yes yes i understand  who was it that set you on  please i dont want to tell  i am convinced that brave little spinks would have refused to tell to the end of the chapter but i saved him further trouble  wondering as i stood behind the wall what kept him so long i shouted come along spinks look sharp  oh  i know now who did it said turner  go my boy  ill relieve you of the apples  so saying he carried the apples to the owner and spinks came and told me what had occurred  ill thrash tom turner for this i said bitterly as we returned to the school  for some time past i had made up my mind to fight him  on several occasions i had proved myself to be possessed of a little more bodily strength than tom and as regarded endurance and pluck i felt quite at ease on these points  opportunity soon offered  one day i was up a tree birdnesting in one of the lanes near our school  i had flung down my books at the foot of the tree before climbing it  just as i laid hands on the nest in which there were four eggs i heard voices below and looking down observed turner tiddler and tadpole passing  i wonder what careless fellow has flung down his books in that fashion said tom  i am the careless fellow  i shouted  at the same time i flung the nest straight into his upturned face  the result was better than i had expected for it hit him fair and the four eggs bursting on his forehead poured over his eyes and nose  this was received with a shout of laughter by the other boys  i leaped to the ground strode up to tom with doubled fists and asked if he would fight me  not if i can help it said tom quietly wiping his face  amazed at his forbearance i scarce knew how to act  at last i said sneeringly i never quite believed you to be a coward until today  whether im a coward or not is perhaps doubtful but i came under a promise not to quarrel with you if i could avoid it and you see jacob im trying to keep my promise though its not easy  perhaps that will make it less easy i said suddenly fetching him what was meant to be a slap in the face but by a prompt withdrawal of his head he let my hand pass  instantly i fetched him another slap with the left hand but he caught my wrist and stopped it  come jacob said he in a rather stern voice i will fight you but it must be done in the regular way on the green  satisfied with this i left him to prepare for the encounter  the green was a level piece of turf close to school beside a stream which at that place was formed into a deep pool by means of a milldam  we had named the pool the black hole  it was the scene of all our school fights  in class that day i was unusually quiet for i could not help thinking of the impending fight  i felt that it would be a hard one though i never for a moment doubted the result  to keep my mind off the subject i applied myself to my lessons and acquitted myself in a way that gratified the master and amazed the boys  the fight was to come off after school hours  the boys assembled with high expectations something unusually stiff being anticipated and they were not disappointed  i was on the ground with my friends and backers before my adversary appeared  dont make too much of a burst at first said one boy play with him till you see what hes made of  id advise you to go in for sloggin said another  yes knock the wind out of him at once said tadpole hes an english fellow you know and may bother you with science  as he spoke tom appeared  he walked smartly towards me with his usual pleasant smile on his face and held out his hand  come jacob he said shake hands and let us give up this affair why should we fight  i am quite willing to admit that you are cock of the school and have no desire to give or receive black eyes  besides you injured me more than i injured you so that youve no occasion to bear malice  you called me a careless fellow said i hardening myself and looking fierce  well but i did not know at the time that you were the owner of the books  no matter you came here to fight and so did i  dont let us waste more words  truly he suffereth long cried one of the boys with a sneer and a laugh quoting from the bible which it was well known tom turner read daily  i am taught said tom turning gravely to the last speaker as far as lies in me to live peaceably with all men  i have tried to do this and find it impossible to live peaceably with jacob freetherefore  he stopped pulled off his jacket rolled up his sleeves and threw himself into the pugilistic attitude  we did not trouble ourselves about ceremony in that school  we had neither seconds bottles nor sponges  i went at him at once and remembering the advice of tadpole made a tremendous blow at his face tom scarcely moved a muscle he merely put his head a little to one side and let the blow pass  like lightning i delivered my left  tom let it pass in the same way  surprised and maddened i sent in another blow lunging to my full extent  he merely drew back from the waist and the blow fell short  at the same moment i received a tap on the bridge of my nose which raised a host of stars in my imagination  in short i found myself at the mercy of a welltrained boxer  perceiving this i grew desperate and sprang at my adversary with the intention of grappling him but he stepped lightly to one side and i shot past him this would have been a trifling matter had we not edged rather near to the river  in my blind rage i went headforemost into the deep pool already mentioned as the black hole  i could not swim  i rose with a gurgling cry and sank again  turner knew that i was drowning  he was a splendid swimmer and instantly sprang in and caught me but i seized him round the neck and dragged him under while the boys shouted in consternation on the bank  their cries soon brought assistance but ere it arrived we had been sucked within the influence of the dam where the stream went under the sluice with great violence  as we struck against the sluice i caught it  turner held on to me but was dragged partially under  another moment and two powerful countrymen had hold of me and pulled me out they had more difficulty with turner  his right leg had got entangled and in dragging him forcibly out they broke it  this event was the great turningpoint in my schoolboy life  remorse began to tell upon me while they carried him home but words cannot describe the agony of my mind when a fortnight afterwards i was admitted to his room and saw him lying a mere wreck of his former self but with the old kindly smile on his face as he stretched out his thin hand  well be friends now jacob wont we he said with a twinkle in his eye  i could not speak  the thought that i had brought him to this in spite of his desire to be friendly overwhelmed me  i could only seize his hand bury my face in the bedclothes and sob  never mind jacob he said cheerily i shall be all right soon and then we shall have the fight outa little further from the black hole  but tom turner did not get all right soon  he became worse and worse the wetting and the accident combined to throw him into a fever which left him to all appearance a confirmed invalid and a cripple so that he was obliged to give up all idea of returning to school  i would not mind it so much he said to me some months afterwards with a feeble effort to be cheery if it had not stopped my going to school  you see i had set my heart on being a learned man and one has not much chance of being that without a teacher  but gods will be done  i dont grumble jacob though i cant help wishing very hard that it had been otherwise  i formed a great resolve while he was speaking but said no word about it  i determined to apply myself heart and soul to study until i should not only reach but pass the point where tom had left off and then i would become his teacher carrying him on step by step as i advanced  to make a long story shorti carried out my resolution  it was harder work than i had expected but i persevered  my love for turner had become intense  i felt like a highpressure engine with extra steam on and the safetyvalve screwed down  the amazement of the boys at the change in me may be imagined  the satisfaction of the master cannot be imagined  i took no notice of either condition but held on my way soon i came up to tom in learning then shot past him then revealed my designs and took him in tow  tom was charmed with the plan and inexpressibly grateful  when little spinks came to hear of it he begged to be allowed to study along with us in the sickroom  we agreed to this  then dr tiddler was admitted and afterwards the tadpole so that our evening class flourished  but the best of it was that tom did not become a confirmed invalid a new doctor who came to live in our village seemed to understand his case better than the old one  at all events he effected an almost perfect cure so that toms limp became scarcely perceptible and his general strength was so much restored that he and i afterwards had many long geological and botanical rambles over the surrounding country in company with little spinks and the rest of the evening class  and this was no mere flash in the pan  we persevered to the end  from the date of that fight all the boys became turnerites our village school commenced a prosperous career and our kind old master had the satisfaction of living to see it grow into one of the most noted in the district for turning out welleducated boys  finally tom turner became a real professora professor of theology and tiddler became a real doctor of medicine  the tadpole also came off with flying colours  his body grew up to his head insomuch that he became a fine strapping fellow and a professor of natural history in one of our colonial colleges  i am the only one of the lot who did not get on well in life and that lads was owing to drink  in a drunken spree i enlisted and here i am now only a corporal but thank god im also a total abstainer and hope to remain so to the end of my life    most of the men in the trenches had become rather sleepy while listening to jacob frees story but they began to freshen up a little when the first faint streaks of dawn appeared for they knew full well that the enemy would be stirring ere long  and they were right  when day broke the russians commenced firing and every now and then a shell would pass roaring over the mens heads  sometimes one would drop in amongst them  when this happened the men fled right and left or threw themselves flat on their faces until the shell had exploded  on one of these occasions a shell dropped close to a wounded man to whom bob was giving a drink at the time  the men near it sprang away or lay down as usual but the wounded man lay in such a position with his shoulders raised by a little knoll of earth that he could not escape and had not strength even to move  with a look of horror he gazed at the hissing shell  bob thorogood saw this all at a glance  in a moment he had the live shell in his arms rushed to the top of the earthworks and hurled it over only just in time for it burst as it reached the ground and blew the spot on which bob stood with bob himself back into the trenches where the big irishman received him in his arms  not hurt darlin are ye he asked anxiously  no thank god only shaken a bit answered the corporal  next day however our hero was not so fortunate although he gained a reward for which many of his comrades panted  he was on duty at the time in the trenches  the russians had been pretty quiet that night but just before daybreak they made a sortie in considerable force  our corporals company had to bear the brunt of the fighting and suffered much  it was broad daylight before the russians were driven back  some of the more fiery men of the company pursued them too far and were cut off  at last all the survivors returned to the trenches and then the enemy commenced a furious cannonade as if to revenge themselves for the repulse  their sharpshooters too were on the alert and if a man chanced to show the top of his shako above the earthworks several bullets went through it instantly  among those who had fallen on the exposed ground outside was a young officeralmost a boy with fair curling hair and a soft little moustache  he lay severely wounded under the frail protection of a bush round which shot and shell were raining fearfully  corporal thorogood observed him leaped over the earthworks ran through the iron storm raised the youth in his strong arms and brought him under cover in safety  the corporals shako was riddled and his clothes were torn in all directions but nothing had touched his body save one bullet which cut off the forefinger of his right hand  for this gallant deed corporal robert thorogood afterwards received the victoria cross  what pleased him far more however was the fact that the young officers life was saved and he ultimately recovered from his wounds  ah then said the big irishman with a look of pity when bob showed him his bleeding hand your sodgerin days is over me boy  and so they were  at the close of the war our corporal retired from the service with a small pension leaving two fingers behind him    chapter six  one very cold but calm and clear winter night a lame man was seen to hurry along the strand in the direction of saint pauls cathedral  the man was clothed in a thick greatcoat and wore a shawl round his neck which muffled him up to the very eyes  indeed the said shawl would have gone quite over his eyes if it had not been for his fine roman nose which stuck out over it and held it firmly down  the mans lameness was only a limp  it did not prevent him from walking very fast indeed  he was evidently bent on business nevertheless the business was not so pressing but that he could stop now and then to look at anything that interested him in the crowded streets  and how crowded they wereand cheerful too for it was christmastide and people seemed to be more excited and hearty than usual  the shops were resplendentfilled to overflowing with everything that could tempt man to spend money and blazing with gaslight so that the streets seemed even brighter than at noon  the poulterers shops in particular were so stuffed that rows of fat geese and ducks apparently finding the crush too much for them inside seemed to have come outside the shops and hung themselves up round the doors and windows  the lame man did not linger long however but hurried onwards until he reached that quarter of the city near to the bank of england where very poor and wretched people lived upon wondrously little of that gold which lay in such huge quantities so near them  in the back slums of this region there were no bright gaslights  the shops were illlighted and miserable like the population except a few at the corners of streets where rough men and ragged women and even children went to poison themselves with gin  in one of the darkest and dirtiest of these streets the lame man found an open door and entered taking off his greatcoat and shawl which he handed to a pleasantfaced man who stood there  im in good time i hope said the lame man  oh yes theyre ony alf through their tea yet  miss homes bin singin to em  the lame mans body was very thin and not very strong but his face was particularly handsome and grave with a strange mingling of humour and sadness in his expression  opening an inner door he entered a large schoolroom and going to the upper end of it took his place behind some gentlemen who nodded to him as he passed  the room was filled with the very lowest classes of the london poor among them were ferociouslooking dirty ragged men who might have been thieves burglars or pickpockets  not less disreputablelooking were the women and children  the air of the room smelt horribly of dirty clothes and drink  they were all very quiet however and wellbehaved at the time for all were busily engaged in eating splendid hunks of bread and cheese and drinking huge mugsful of hot tea truly there are few quieters of the savage human breast equal to food probably all the people there were hungry many of them had been starving and were ravenous  there was scarcely any sound except of moving jaws when accompanied by a few chords from a harmonium a sweet mellow female voice told of the love of jesus christ to poor perishing guilty man  both the words and music of the hymn had a soothing influence on the people  when the calm contentment resulting from satisfied hunger had settled down on them a gentleman rose and continuing the theme of the hymn told his hearers earnestly about the saviour of sinners  his address was very short because he said a city missionarya personal friendhad come that night to speak to them  as he said this he turned to the lame man who rose at once and stood forward  there was something in the gaze of this mans piercing yet tender eyes which forced the attention of even the most careless among them  his handsome young face was very pale and his lips were for a moment compressed as if he were trying to keep back the words which were ready to rush out  when he spoke the soft tones of a deep bass voice helped to secure attention so that you could have heard a pin drop  at once the lame man launched into a most thrilling description of a scene of peril and rescue  he told of a gallant ship battling with a furious gale of her striking on a shoal of the masts going over the side of wreck and ruin all around and the wild waves bursting over passengers and crew and gradually breaking up the shipno hopeno hopeonly cries for mercyshrieks of despair  as the lame man spoke his eyes seemed to flash  his cheeks were no longer pale  the rough men before him frowned and gazed as if their anxiety had been roused  the women leaned forward with eager looks of sympathy  even the children were spellbound  one hulking fellow with a broken nose and a black eye sat clutching both knees with his muscular hands and gazed openmouthed and motionless at the speaker who went on to say that when things were at their worst and death stared the perishing people in the face a beautiful object seemed suddenly to rise out of the raging sea its colour was a mixture of pure white and bright blue  it was the lifeboat which sheered alongside and took them on board one by one  some there were said the lame man impressively who hung back and some who at first did not believe in the lifeboat and refused to leave the doomed ship  there was no hope for those who refusednone whatever but they gave in at last  god put it into their hearts to trust the lifeboat and so the whole were rescued and brought in safety to the land  well done burst from the hulking man with the broken nose and a deep sigh of relief escaped from many of the women but there was instant silence again for the speakers hand was up his eyes were glittering and his lips compressed  every one knew that more was coming and they bent forward  then in a low soft voice he began to tell of a dark but quiet night and a slumbering city of a little spark which like sin in a child was scarcely visible at first but soon grew fierce and spread until it burst out in all the fury of an unquenchable fire  he told of the alarm the shouts of fire the rushing to the rescue and the arrival of the engines and the fireescape  then he described the horror of a young woman in the burning house who awaking almost too late found herself on the very edge of destruction with the black smoke circling round and the impassable gulf of flame below  just then the head of the fireescape approached her and a man with extended arms was seen a few feet below her calling out come  like some of those in the shipwreck she did not at first believe in the fireescape  she could not trust  she would not leap  while in that condition there was no hope for her but god put it into her heart to trust  she leaped and was saved  the speaker stopped  again there was a sigh of relief and a tendency to cheer on the part of the hulking man but once more the sparkling eyes and compressed lips riveted the people and tied their tongues  in another moment the missionary had them on a battlefield which he described with thrilling power passing rapidly from the first bugle call through all the fight until the foe was finally put to flight amid the shouts of victory  men and women he said in conclusion i am painting no fancy pictures  the things i have told to you did really happen and four dear brothers of my own were chief actors in the scenes described  they helped to rescue the perishing from the sea and from the fire and joined in the shout of victory on the battlefield  now friends you are in a worse case than any i have yet described  the tempest of sin is roaring round and in you  this world is sinking beneath you but jesus christ our lifeboat is alongside  will you come  the fire is burning under your very feet there is no deliverance from the flames of gods wrath except by the great escape  jesus is at hand to save will you come  the battle is raging  dont you know it  do you forget that awful combat with the tempter when you fought your way past the ginshop but were beaten and turned back  or that terrible assault when passion after a deadly struggle laid you helpless on your back  oh may gods holy spirit open your eyes to see jesusthe captain of your salvationat your elbow this moment waiting at the door of your heart and knocking till you will open and let him in to lead you on tovictory  here the speaker dropped his voice again and spoke tenderly of the love of jesus to the chief of sinners and as he spoke tears were seen trickling down many a dirty face and sobs broke the solemn stillness  as the lame man was going home that night a young girl ran after him and seized his arm  her eyes were swollen with weeping  oh sir she cried in a low voice that trembled with emotion can willjesus save the like of me  assuredly my poor girl  he says come unto me and whosoever will let him come  if you are willing there is no doubt about his willingness  the difficulty only lies with you not with him where do you live  i have no home sobbed the girl i have run away from my home and have no place to lay my head in here  but oh sir i want to be saved  the lame man looked with the deepest commiseration into the appealing eyes  come he said walk with me  i will tell you of one who had no place where to lay his head  she took his arm without a word and the two hurried through the still crowded streets  arrived at his own door the lame man knocked  it was opened by a fair soft and exceedingly pretty little woman of about thirty years of age whose fresh face was the very personification of goodness  why jim she exclaimed looking at the girl in surprise  here we are molly exclaimed the lame man bustling into a snug room in which a fire was blazing and cheering preparations for tea were going on and ive brought a friend to spend the night with us theres plenty of room on your floor for a shakedown eh  this is my sister he added turning to the girl mary thorogood but we always call her molly  she has come to visit me this christmasmuch against her will i believe shes so fond of the old folk at home  come now take her into your room molly make her comfortable and then well have tea  molly took the girl into her room  returning a moment later for something forgotten she was touched on the shoulder by her brother who whispered low in her ear  a brand molly dear plucked from the burning  molly turned her eyes upon her brother with a glad smile as she reentered her little room and shut the door    chapter seven  twelve months passed away and christmas came again with its frost and snow and sunshineits blazing fires its good cheer and its merry greetings  many a christmastide had now passed over the head of our blacksmith john thorogood and his excellent wife mary but time had touched them lightly in its flight  they both looked young and hale and full of vigour  the only difference in them was a wrinkle or two at the corners of the eyes and a few grey hairs mingling with the brown  perhaps john was a little more corpulent than when he was a youth but he could wield the forehammer as easily and powerfully as ever  a cloud however had been gathering over their happy home during the past year  mollythe sweet active girl who had never known a days illness from her childhoodhad fallen into bad health  her step had lost its spring but her cheerful spirit was unsubdued  youre better today molly darling asked the smith in a tone which showed he was not sure of the answer  yes father much better  molly did not use endearing terms but the sweetness of her looks and voice rendered such needless  she was pale and thin and could not check the touch of sadness in her tones  fred is sure to come darling said mrs thorogood stopping in her preparations for supper to smooth her daughters fair head  oh yes mother i know that fred is sure to come returned molly with a laugh and a little blush  no fear of him  i was not thinking of him but of jim  it is the first christmas we shall have spent without him  dear jim  i wonder what company he will have to spend it with him in the backwoods  whatever company it may be returned the mother theyll only have his body and mindhis spirit will be here  well said old moll we shall have the best part of him tonight in spite of the atlantic ocean cried the blacksmith who was seated on a stool making fun with the terrier the cat and the kittennot the original animals of course but the lineal descendants of those which were introduced at the beginning of our tale  i hope they wont be late remarked mrs thorogood looking with some anxiety into a big pot which rested on the roaring fire  the boys are never late moll remarked the smith giving the cat a sly poke on the nose which it resented with a fuff causing the terrier to turn its head on one side inquiringly  as he spoke the front door opened and feet were heard in the passage stamping off the snow  there they are exclaimed old moll slipping the lid on the big pot and wiping her hands hastily  no it is too soon for them yet theyre always sharp to time  it is fred said molly with a quiet smile  she was right  fred harper a fine strapping young fellowa carpenterhad met molly in london and got engaged to her  she offered to let him off when she became ill and delicate but he would not be let off  molly this enthusiast had said if you were to become so thin that all your flesh were to disappear id be proud to marry your skeleton  fred sat down by her side but had scarcely begun to make earnest inquiries after her health when the outer door again opened and another stamping of feet was heard in the passage  it was a tremendous stamping and accompanied with strong loud manly voices  no mistake now said the smith rising and opening the door when in walked four such men as any father and mother might be proud of  it was not that they were bigplenty of blockheads are big nor was it that they were handsomeplenty of nincompoops are wellfavoured but besides being tall and strong and handsome they were free and hearty and sensible and wiseeven in their jovialityand so thoroughgoing in word sentiment and act that it was quite a pleasure merely to sit still and watch them and listen  i told ee theyd come in their togs old woman said the smith as his son tom appeared dusting the snow from his coastguard uniform on the breast of which was displayed the gold medal of the royal national lifeboat institution  you might be sure of that mother seeing that we had promised said dick the blithe and hearty manofwars man as he printed a kiss on his mothers cheek that might have been heard as he truly said from the main truck to the keelson  at the same time bushybrowed harry with the blue coat and brass epaulettes of the firebrigade was paying a similar tribute of affection to his sister while fiery bobthe old uniform on his back and the victoria cross on his breastseized his fathers hand in both of his with a grip that quite satisfied that son of vulcan despite the absence of two of the fingers  they were all deepchested strongvoiced men in the prime of life and what a noise they did make to be sure  youre not too soon boys said the smith old moll has been quite anxious about a mysterious something in the big pot there  let me help you to take it off the fire mother said the gallant tar stepping forward  nay thats my duty cried harry leaping to the front and seizing the pot which he dragged from the flames with professional ability  when the something was displayed it was found to be a gorgeous meatpudding of the most tempting characterround and heavy like a cannonball  of course it did not flourish alone  old moll had been mysteriously engaged the greater part of that day over the fire and the result was a feast worthy as her husband said of the king of the cannibal islands  talking of cannibal islands said dick the sailor during a pause in the feast youve no idea what a glorious place that pacific ocean is with its coral islands palmgroves and sunshine  it would be just the place to make you well again molly  youd grow fat in a month  ha get fat would she growled bob the soldier so as to be ready for the first niggerchief that took a fancy to have her cooked for suppereh  never fear molly we wont let you go to the cannibal islands  give us another cut o that cannonball mother  its better eating than those ive been used to see skipping over the battlefield  but theyre not all cannibal islands man returned dick why wherever the missionaries go there the niggers get to be as wellbehaved as you are  dyou know molly ive really been thinking of cutting the service and emigrating somewhere if you and fred would go with me  it would be charming replied molly with a sweet though languid smile  wed live in a wooden hut roofed with palmleaves and while you and fred were away hunting for dinner i would milk the buffaloes and boil the cocoanuts  ah molly said tom the coastguardsman stroking his bushy beard the same idea has been running in my head as well as in dicks ever since we got that letter from jim telling us of the beauty of his new home and urging us all to emigrate  ive more than half a mind to join him out there if you and the old folk will consent to go  youre not serious are you tom asked harry the fireman laying down his knife and fork  indeed i am  well you might do worse  i would join you myself if there were only houses enough to insure a fire or two every month  why man said fred harper in these lands the whole forest goes on fire sometimessurely that would suffice to keep your spirits up and your heart warm  lets have a look at jims last epistle mother said dick when the feast was nearly over and fragrant coffee smoked upon the board for you know the thorogood family were total abstainers and let fred read it aloud  hes by far the best reader amongst us  well thats not sayin much for him remarked the fireman with a sly glance at his sister  your lamp is not as powerful as it might be mother said fred drawing his chair nearer to that of the fair invalid as he unfolded the letter  turn your eyes this way mollythere keep em steady on the page i can see now  eagles nest rocky mountain slopes 5th october 18 began fred darling motheryouve no idea what a charming place god has given me here with plenty of work to do of the most congenial kind  i have only an opportunity for a short letter this time because the postboy has arrived unexpectedly and wont wait  postboy  you would smile at that word if you saw him  hes a sixfoot man in leather with a big beard and a rifle and tomahawk  he was attacked by indians on the way over the mountains but escaped and he attacked a grizzly bear afterwards which didnt escapebut i must not waste time on him well i must devote all my letter this post to urging you to come out  this is a splendid country for big strong hearty willing men like father and my brothers  of course it is no better than other countriesrather worsefor weak men either in mind or body  idlers go to the wall here as elsewhere but for men willing and able to workready to turn their hands to anythingit is a splendid opening  for myselfi feel that my heavenly father has sent me here because there is work for me to do and a climate which will give me health and strength to do it  my health is better now than it has ever been mince the day of that fall which damaged my constitution so much as to render me one of the confirmed cripples of the earth  but it was a blessed fall nevertheless  i was cast down in order that i might be lifted up  you would smile motherperhaps youd laughif you saw me at my work  im a jackofalltrades  among other things im a farmer a gardener a carpenter a schoolmaster a shoemaker and a missionary  the last you know i consider my real calling  the others are but secondary matters assumed in the spirit of paul the tentmaker  you and dear molly would rejoice with me if you saw my bible class on weekdays and my congregation on sundays  it is a strange congregation to whom i have been sent to tell the old old story of jesus and his love  there are farmers miners hunters even painted savages among them  my church is usually a barnsometimes a tentoften the open air  there are no denominations here so that i belong to none  only two sects exist believers and unbelievers  but the place is growing fast  doubtless there will be great changes ere long  meanwhile it is my happy duty and privilege to scatter seed in the wilderness  now i urge you to come because there is health for molly to be found on these sunny slopes of this grand backbone of america  that is my strongest point  if that does not move you nothing else will  one glance from the windows of my wooden housethis eagles nest on the rocky mountain slopeswould be sufficient to begin the work of convalescence  woods dells knolls hills plains prairies lakes streamswith the blue mountains in the far far distance  oh if i were a poet what a flight i would make into the realms ofofwell you understand me  i have no time for more  the bigbearded postboy is growing impatient  only this much will i adddo do come if you love me  my kindest love to you all  may god guide you in this matteryour affectionate son jim  psone of the members of my congregation is a celebrated hunter named reuben dale  his wife is also one of my flock and so is his friend jacob strang  the manner in which reuben got married is so curious that i have amused myself by writing an account of it for mother  i enclose it  read the story aloud fred said molly  what jim thought interesting must be well worth reading  thus urged fred took the manuscript and read as follows  the hunters wedding  a story of the rocky mountains  on the summit of a green knoll in one of those beautiful valleys which open from the prairieslike inviting portalsinto the dark recesses of the rocky mountains there stands or stood not long ago a small blockhouse surrounded by a wooden palisade  although useless as a protection from artillery this building was found to be a sufficient defence against the bullets and arrows of the red men of north america and its owner kenneth macfearsome a fiery scotch highlander had up to the date on which our story opens esteemed it a convenient and safe place for trade with the warlike savages who roamed fought and hunted in the regions around it  some people referring to its peaceful purposes called it macfearsomes trading post  others having regard to its military aspect styled it macs fort  reuben dale stood at the front gate of the fort conversing with a pretty darkhaired brightfaced girl of eighteen years or thereabouts reuben himself being twentyeight and as strapping a hunter of the rocky mountains as ever outwitted a redskin or circumvented a grizzly bear  but reuben was naturally shy  he had not the courage of a rabbit when it came to making love  loo said reuben resting his hand on the muzzle of his long rifle and his chin on his hands as he gazed earnestly down into the quiet soft little face at his elbow  well reuben said loo keeping her eyes prudently fixed on the ground lest they should betray her  the conversation stopped short at this interesting point and was not resumed  indeed it was effectually checked by the sudden appearance of the macfearsome  what have ye not managed it yet reuben said the highlander as his daughter tripped quickly away  not yet said the hunter despondingly  man youre not worth a gunflint returned macfearsome with a twinkling glance from under his bushy grey eyebrows if ye had not saved loos life twice and mine three times id scorn to let you wed her  but youll have to settle it right off for the parson wont stop another day  he counted on spendin only one day here on his way to the conference and he has been two days already  you know itll take him all his time to get to beaver creek by the tenth  but ill mount him on my best buffalorunner and guide him myself by a short cut said the hunter so that he shall still be in good time for the circumference and  the conference reuben dont misuse the english language  but its of no use i tell you  he wont stop another day so you must have it settled right off today for it shall never be said that a macfearsome was married without the benefit of the clergy  well ill do itslick off said the hunter shouldering his rifle and striding away in the direction of a coppice into which he had observed loo disappear with the air of a man who meant to pursue and kill a dangerous creature  we will not do reuben dale the injustice to lift the curtain at this critical point in his history  suffice it to say that he went into that coppice pale and came out redso red that his handsome sunburned countenance seemed on the point of catching fire  there was a pleased expression on it however which was eminently suggestive  he went straight to a wigwam which stood near the fort lifted the skin door entered and sat down beside the fire opposite to a hunter not unlike himself  the man was as tall and strong though not quite so goodlooking  he was at the time smoking one of those tomahawks which some indians have made with pipe bowls in their heads the handles serving for stems so that when not employed in splitting skulls they may be used for damaging stomachsie for smoking tobacco  ive done it jacob strang said reuben with a grave nod as he slowly filled his pipe  these two hunters were knit together with somewhat of the love that david bore to jonathan  jacob gazed at his friend for some time in mute admiration  honour bright he asked at length  honour bright replied reuben  well now said jacob to the cloud that issued from his lips i couldnt ha done that to save my scalp  ive tried it off an on for the last six year and alers stuck at the pintor raither just before it for i never got quite the length o the pint  but ive bin very near it reuben more than once uncommon near  one time i got so close to the edge o the precipice that another inch would have sent me right over  my dear liz says i but i stuck there an the sweet little thing runned away larfin an so im a bachelor still  but im right glad reuben that youve got it over at last  how did it feel  feel echoed the hunter it felt as bad or wuss nor the time that grizzly bar up the yellowstone river got his claws into the small o my backonly i hadnt you to help me out o the difficulty this time  i had to do it all myself jacob and hard work it was i tell ee boy howsever its all over now an were to be spliced this evenin  thats raither sharp work aint it reuben said jacob with a critical wrinkle of his eyebrows and a remonstrative tone in his voice i aint much of an authority on sitch matters but it do seem to me as if you might have given the poor gal a day or two to make sure whether her head or heels was uppermost  youre right jacob youre judgment was always sound but you see i was forced to do it slick off because the parson wont wait another day an id like to have it done all shipshape for ive a respec for the parsons you see  a man whos come straight down from the pilgrim fathers like me behoves to act discreetlyso the weddins to be this evenin  well you are the best judge reuben an its as well that it should come off when old fiddlestrings is here for a weddin without a fiddle aint much of a spree  by good luck too theres the lads from buffalo creek at the fort just now so well muster strong  no i wouldnt give much for a weddin without a good dancenot even yours reuben  that afternoon the macfearsome arranged with the reverend william tucker to delay his departure for one day in order to unite his only daughter loo to reuben dale  you must know mr tucker he explained in a slightly apologetic tone although reuben is only a hunter his parents were gentlefolks they died when reuben was quite a little fellow so that he was allowed to run wild on a frontier settlement and as a matter of course took to the wilderness as naturally as a young duck takes to the water  but reuben is a superior person mr tucker i assure you and as fine a disposition as you could wish  hes as bold as a lion too and has saved my girls life twice and my own three timesso you see he  he deserves a good wife said the reverend william tucker heartily  just so replied the old trader wrinkling his fierce yet kindly face with a bland smile and youll confer a great favour on me if you will stay and perform the ceremony  of course according to scotch law we could marry them without your assistance but i respect the church mr tucker and think it becoming to have a clergyman on occasions of this kind  having settled this important piece of business kenneth macfearsome went off to make arrangements for the indispensable dance and the clergyman being fond of equestrian exercise went out alone for an afternoon ride  that same afternoon a band of indians belonging to the blackfeet tribe encamped in a gloomy defile of the rocky mountains not far from macs fort  it was easy to see that they were a warparty for besides being armed to the teeth their faces were hideously painted and they had no women or children with them  they had stopped for the double purpose of eating a hasty meal and holding a council of war  one of the warriors stood up in the midst of his brethren and made a speech which to judge from its effect on the others must have been highly inflammatory and warlike  during the delivery of it he turned his ugly visage frequently and pointed with his bluestriped nose as it were in the direction of fort macfearsome  whatever might have been the tendency of the speech it was suddenly cut short by the sound of a horses hoofs clattering in the glen below after bestowing a united eagle glance on the approaching horseman the blackfeet warriors turned a look of intelligence on each other lay flat down in the long grass and melted from the scene as completely and silently as snowwreaths melt before the sun in spring  the reverend william tucker was a muscular christian  that is to say he believed that the body as well as the soul ought to be cultivated to the highest possible extentboth having the same originand held that physical health strength and vigour if not absolutely necessary to the advancement of christianity in the earth were at least eminently conducive thereto  holding such opinions and being powerfully built he threw himself heart and soul into whatever he did  hence the clatter of his horses hoofs as he galloped swiftly up the glen  but the reverend william tucker was also merciful and not only drew rein when the path became too steep but dismounted and led his steed by the bridle when he reached the rugged ground near the spot where the warparty had melted away  great and grand were the preparations made for the approaching festivities at macs fort  michel the cook constructed a venison pie the tin dish of which repaired expressly for the occasion that afternoon by the fort blacksmith might have served for a bath to an average baby  the carpenter arranged the hall or large public room cleared away the tables fitted up a device in evergreens which was supposed to represent the words loo and reu and otherwise garnished the ballroom with specimens of his originality and taste while old fiddlestrings who was a selftaught halfbreed fitted to his violin a new string made by his wife that day from a deersinew  when the hour arrived for the performance of the ceremony reuben dale appeared among the men of the fort dressed not like a gentleman in broadcloth but in hunters costume of the most approved cut and materiala yellow deerskin coat ornamented with bead and quill work blue cloth leggings a small fur cap moccasins garnished with silk flowers fitting as tight to his feet as gloves fit the hands and a crimson worsted sash round his waist  he also wore slung on his shoulder by scarlet worsted cords a powderhorn and shotpouchnot that these implements of the chase were necessary to the occasion but because he would as soon have thought of appearing at any time without them as without his nose  for the same reason his rifle accompanied him to the wedding  a short time before the appointed hour the brideelect adorned herself in simple yet tasteful costume which being peculiar to no particular nation or time we prefer to leave to the readers imagination merely remarking that as loo was simple and pretty her garb corresponded to her appearance and character  but the appointed hour passed and the reverend william tucker did not appear  hunters of the rocky mountains however are not an impatient race  reuben quietly waited as he would have done for a good shot at game  not so the macfearsome  his celtic blood fired and he muttered a few uncomplimentary remarks about the reverend absentee which it is well not to repeat  as time passed however the dwellers in macs fort became anxious then alarmed and finally the wedding was postponed while a search for the lost one was organised but they searched in vain because tracks which might easily be traced in the wilderness get inextricably mixed up in the vicinity of a fort  next day kenneth macfearsome coming rather hastily and angrily to the conclusion that mr tucker had given them the slip and gone off to his conference determined himself to perform the marriage ceremony as directed in the church of england prayerbook  you see reuben he said i have a great respect for the church and would fain have had this matter knocked off by one of its parsons but as this parson appears to be little better than a wolf in sheeps clothingif as goodill just do it myself for ill not have my daughters wedding delayed another day for any man woman or beast alive  wouldnt it be as well sir suggested the hunter modestly to have a hunt after the parson by daylight first  no it wouldnt said the old trader with the air and decision ofwe were going to say the great mogul but perhaps it would be more emphatic and appropriate to saythe macfearsome  knowing that appeal from that decision would be in vain reuben once more arrayed himself in the wedding dress which he had changed when the search for mr tucker was undertaken and once again presented himself before his admiring friends in the decorated hall of macs fort the cook warmed up his gigantic pie old fiddlestrings retuned his homemade violin and pretty little loo at last appeared on the scene with two halfbreed young women as bridesmaids and two indian females as backersup  my friends said kenneth macfearsome taking up the prayerbook and commencing a speech which he had spent the entire forenoon in preparing i have a few words to say to you on this interesting occasion  the old gentlemans usually stern and handsome countenance had relaxed and assumed a bland sweet expression which was more consonant with the circumstances in which they were assembled  before he could utter another word however he was interrupted to his great surprise by reuben  excuse me mr macfearsome said that bold though bashful hunter but my friend and comrade jacob strang has not yet arrived and it would grieve me to the heart if he was absent at such a time as this couldnt we wait a bit  i wouldnt ask you to do so for any other man alive but ive hunted wi him since we were slips of boys andand i cant help thinkin that somethins gone wrong wi him for jacobs good and true and trusty as steel an wasnt used to fail in his engagements  while the hunter was speaking the bland expression faded from the highlanders countenance and a fierce look flashed from his blue eyes as he replied in stern decided tones  reuben dale if your friend jacob was the great israel of bible story or even moses himself i would not wait for him  dont interrupt me again lad  he turned to the assembled company with a wave of his hand as if to dismiss the interruption from memory and attempted to reassume the benignant expression with only partial success  my friends he said but said no more for at that moment he was a second time interrupted  a shout was heard outside the door of the hall burst open and jacob strang himself strode in bearing the reverend william tucker on his shoulders  depositing his burden on the floor he said hurriedly hes not dead only stunned  the reptiles did their best to kill him  theyre not far off macfearsome  wed better go after them  the macfearsome usually gave vent to his feelings in gaelic when labouring under strong excitement  on this occasion his utterances were terrible in tone whatever their meaning might be  go after them he cried in a blaze of wrath yes well go after them  saddle my horse and fetch my gun  arm yourself boys  some of you will remain to guard the fort and see that you keep the gates shut can you guide us to the villains jacob  i can at least follow up the trail  stay i can guide you said a voice behind them  it was the reverend william tucker himself who had recovered and was sitting up on the floor looking rather confused  no sir you will remain at the fort and take care of the women said macfearsome gruffly  in a few minutes the chief of the fort was galloping over the prairie at the back of his establishment followed by six of his best men with reuben dale and led by jacob strang  in thus giving chase to the red men the highlander did not act with his wonted caution  his wrath was too much for him  jacob the hunter while out after deer had come on the trail of the warparty of blackfeet  suspecting them of mischief he had followed them up and found them just at the time when they made prisoner of mr tucker  he saw them bind the unlucky pastor and carry him off mounted behind a savage chief  jacob chanced fortunately to be concealed in a rugged piece of ground where horses could not act  as the indians were riding away he shot the horse that bore the pastor and at the same time uttered a series of yells and extempore warwhoops so appalling that the savages gave him credit for being at least a dozen foes and fled over a ridge before turning to see what had happened  the fall of the horse had stunned the pastor but the indian leaped up and drew his knife fortunately jacobs rifle was a doublebarrelled one  uttering another ferocious yell he fired and by good fortune hit the right arm of the indian chief who dropping his knife followed his companions like a hunted stag  jacob immediately dashed out of his ambush lifted the reverend gentleman on his own horse which he had left in a hollow close at hand and brought him as we have seen safe back to the fort  now if the white men had been satisfied with this all would have been well but the macfearsome had been roused as we have said and set off needlessly in pursuit of the savages  it chanced that the blackfeet had arranged to attack the fort in two bands that nightadvancing on it from opposite directions  the consequence was that while macfearsome and his men were away after one band the othera much larger band ignorant of what had occurred to their comrades advanced after dusk on the fort and gave the signal for attack  they were surprised at receiving no reply from their comrades but did not delay the assault on that account  the men who had been left in charge of the fort were quite worthy of the trust  stationing themselves a few yards apart all round the palisades inside they kept guard  mr tucker armed with an axehandle as a bludgeonfor he objected to taking life if he could avoid itmounted guard at the gate  pretty little loo kept him company  the other women were stationed so as to carry ammunition to the men or convey orders from the blacksmith who had been left in command  this is a sad interruption to your wedding remarked the pastor as he leaned against the fort gate and examined his weapon  it is assented loo meekly but you will marry us tomorrow  my father will return too late to have it done tonight i fear  however late he comes we must get the ceremony over tonight loo for i positively cannot delay my journey another day  indeed even as it is i shall be late for the conference of my brethren  hark  what sound was that  i heard nothing but the hoot of an owl said loo  as she spoke an arrow entering between the palisades whizzed past her at the same moment a volley was fired from the other side of the fort  keep closer to the gate loo said mr tucker grasping his club with a feeling that the girls safety depended on the use he made of that unclerical weapon  come round to the east angle all of you shouted the blacksmith  all the men in the fort obeyed the summons in time to repel a vigorous assault made on that point by what seemed to be the whole band of the enemy but the bride and one of her maids remained at the front gate to keep watch there  just as the victory was gained and the enemy were driven off at the east angle a loud scream was given by the women  mr tucker heard it and was first to run to the rescue  he found that three of the blackfeet during the assault on the other side had crept round to the front gate  one of these had placed his head against the stockade a second had mounted on his shoulders and a third had thus gained the top of the pickets  seeing at a glance how matters stood mr tucker ran forward and thrust his bludgeon with a straight point between the posts right into the painted face of the lower savage who fell back at once carrying the second savage along with him but the third had already laid his hands on the top and vaulting over with monkeylike agility came down on the pastors shoulders with such violence that both rolled together on the ground  but the savage was no match for the athletic pastor who compressed his throat with a grip that soon caused him to relax his hold  here give me your kerchief loo gasped the pastor ill tie his hands  why dont you stick him asked one of loos bridesmaids with great simplicity  because i wont take life if i can help it replied mr tucker as he bound the indians wrists  at that moment there arose a wild warwhoop from another part of the fort and a volume of smoke and flame burst from the back of the chief dwellinghouse which stood in the centre of the square  the blackfeet had gained an entrance at another point and set fire to the western wing of the building unperceived  with a shout of rage the blacksmith and his men rushed to the scene of disaster  theres father said loo with a cry of joy  where exclaimed mr tucker looking round with a bewildered air  help to open the gate cried loo  the pastor did so at once and as he heaved at the bar which held it he could hear the clatter of hoofs and the shouts of men outside  the heavy gate swung back just as the cavalcade came up and they dashed in at full gallop  open the back gate wide loo and leave this one open too shouted macfearsome as he flew past like an enraged thunderbolt  our bride possessed that most valuable quality a tendency to prompt unquestioning obedience  running lightly to the other side of the fort she undid the fastenings and forced the back gate wide open  meanwhile her father and our bridegroom with his friend jacob and the six men charged down on the savages with wild yells of fury  the sight of them was sufficient  the blackfeet turned and fled through the open gates in consternation  as they coursed towards the woods like hares the blacksmith managed to turn on them a small shipscannon loaded with buckshot which awoke the echoes of the wilderness with a deafening roar  the horsemen also pursued and scattered them right and left then the gates were reclosed while the bright flame of the burning buildings lit up the scene as at noonday  hold your hands now boys shouted macfearsome drawing rein  those nearest to the chief obeyed and the others soon perceiving what was being done rejoined their comrades  where is reuben asked macfearsome as they were turning towards the fort  each looked at the other but none could answer  i saw him down in the hollow charging the indians said one  and i saw him coming back by the stablefence said another  off with you to both places and look for him cried the chief and the rest of you follow me  they searched swiftly to and fro for some minutes and soon found his riderless horse  then a cry from one of their number was heard from the hollow  galloping thither they found reuben lying on his back apparently dead with an arrow in his chest  in a moment jacob was on his knees at his friends side and soon the arrow was extracted but it was found that blood gushed freely from the wound  stanching this as best they could they bore the wounded man carefully to the fort  oh father  i hope the fight is over now exclaimed loo as her sire rode through the gateway  yes the fight is over replied the highlander sternly but it has cost us much  our house is on fire and reuben is  he did not finish the sentence  indeed there was no occasion to do so for while he spoke the men advanced who bore reubens all but lifeless body  loo did not scream or utter a word but her white face and compressed lips told their own tale as she walked by her bridegrooms side into the hall which had been so gaily fitted up but was now a blackened and partially burned room  while the hunters wound was being examined every one save the pastor and the women was sent from the hall to aid in extinguishing the fire which had been nearly subdued  macfearsome was somewhat expert as an amateur doctor and so was the reverend william tucker  their united opinion was that the hunters case was a very grave one  they did all that could be done to stop the bleeding and sustain the strength of the wounded man whose consciousness returned after a short time  is it all over with me father asked reuben in a faint voice addressing the macfearsome for the first time by that endearing title  i fear it is my son replied the chief  you know it is not my habit to mince matters at any time and i dont think you are such a baby as to fear death when it is sent to you  however i will not say that your case is hopeless till i have tried my medicine on youso keep up your heart reuben  father said reuben will you allow me to be alone with loo for a little  certainly my dear boy but you must have your medicine first  reuben replied with a smile and a nod  after taking the physic he was left alone with loo  for some time neither could speak  at last loo said oh reuben dear you are not going to die  i hope not dearest but when the lords time comes we must be ready to answer to our names  if i am to go now i would spend the few hours that remain to me listening to your sweet voice reading the masters word  reuben said loo with sudden animation will you grant me a favour  you know i will whatever it be replied the hunter with a languid smile what is it  that we may be married tonightwithin this hour said loo with decision  why  of what use to wed a dying man  because i want to nurse you as your wife to the end if it be his will that you shall go and i wish to be for ever after called by your dear name  it is a strange notiona sweet one to me dearest loo  it shall be as you wish  call father  at first the highlander strongly objected to the wish of his child but loo knew how to overcome her fathers objections  in the course of halfanhour reuben sent for mr tucker  the macfearsomes medicine whatever it was was potent as well as patent  reuben was able to talk with considerable energy when the pastor appearedsummoned as he fancied to prepare the dying man for the great change  great therefore was his amazement when reuben begged of him to make arrangements for performing the interrupted marriage ceremony within halfanhour  but you seem to be dying friend said the perplexed pastor  that may be so replied the hunter quietly but loo wants to be wed before i die and wed better waste no time about it  there was no resisting this so the reverend william tucker made arrangements for the wedding while the macfearsome and his men were busied extinguishing the last sparks of the fire  it was near midnight before these arrangements were completed  then the men were summoned once more to the hall but how different were their feelings now from what they had been earlier on that day  the occupation of old fiddlestrings was gone  even the huge pie was dismissed from the scene  the wedding guests crept quietly in their gay costumes torn and covered with charcoal and bearing other evidences of the recent conflict  they were very silent too and sad for they were aware of the critical condition of the bridegroom  when all was at last prepared a new and unexpected difficulty arose  it was found that reuben had fallen into a sound sleep  thereupon a whispered but anxious conversation took place at the end of the hall farthest from the wounded mans couch  we must waken him said macfearsome with stern look and tone  no father said loo with a tearful smile we must wait  your daughter is right whispered mr tucker  whatever be the condition of reuben sleep is the best thing for him  but you must start for your conference at four in the morning and he may not awake before that objected macfearsome  their perplexities were suddenly removed by reuben himself who awoke while they were consulting and asked his friend jacobwho watched at his side with the tenderness of a brotherwhere loo had gone to  shes here reuben waitin to get married replied his friend  the hunter roused himself looked hastily round raised himself one one elbow and said in a strong voice come im ready now  lets get it over  immediately loo was at his side the whole party assembled round his couch the pastor opened his book and in these exceptional circumstances reuben dale and louisa macfearsome were married  now reuben dear whispered loo as she pressed his lips lie down again and go to sleep  on one condition only said the wounded man with something like a twinkle in his eye that you go on with the wedding feast  jacob says a wedding is worth nothing without a dance  now as this wedding is worth all the world to me loo im determined that it shall be worth something to my old friend and comrade  it was found that remonstrances were in vain so as resistance to his wishes might have proved hurtful to the invalid the wedding feast was continued and carried through with far more vigour than might have been expected reuben himself being apparently one of the most interested spectators  so jacob had his dance and he performed his part with unwonted energyfor the sake of pleasing his friend rather than himself  when the lights were waxing low and the great pie had been eaten and old fiddlestrings had been used up reuben called his friend to his side  what with searchin he said an fightin and firestoppin an dancin youve had a pretty stiff time of it jacob  but youre a strong manleastwise you used to bean i daresay theres plenty of go in you yet  im fresh as a lark reuben replied his friend  what want ye wi me  i just want ye go fetch your horse an saddle my best buffalorunner for the parson an take him to beaver creek  do it as fast as you can jacob and by the short cut and dont spare the cattle  ill do it reuben  jacob was a man of few words  he did it and thus it came to pass that when grey dawn began to break over macs fort it found the reverend william tucker and his guide scouring over the western plains at the rate of thirty or forty miles an hourmore or lesswhile reuben dale lay sound asleep in his bloodstained wedding dress his strong hand clasping that of pretty little loo who was also sound asleep in an easy chair by his side  about the same time the macfearsome flung himself down on his halfburned bed where in dreamsto judge from his snorting snoring and stertorous breathinghe waged war with the whole blackfeet race singlehanded  when the pastor bade farewell to reuben he had done so with the sad feelings of one who expected never to see his face again but the pastors judgment was at fault  reuben dale livedhe lived to become as strong and able a hunter of the rocky mountains as ever he had been he lived to take loo to the western settlements and squat down beside the macfearsomes new farm as a species of hunting farmer he lived to become a respected member of the reverend william tuckers church in the wilderness where he filled two pews with little dales which as an irish comrade remarked was a dale more than he deserved and last but not least he lived to urge argue badger bamboozle worry and haul jacob strang up to that pint at which he had so often stuck before but over which he finally fell and managed to secure that dear liz who was destined to become the sunshine of his afterlife  in regard to this matter jacob was wont to say to his friend at times when he was particularly confidential that the catchin of liz was the best bit of trappin he had done since he took to huntin in the rocky mountains and that if it hadnt bin for his chum reuben dale he never would have bin able to come up to the pint much less git over it though he had lived to the age of methuselah and hunted for a wife all the time  a good story said dick thorogood as fred folded up the manuscript but to return to matter of greater importance than this hunters wedding curious though it be what about emigrating  ill go for one exclaimed the blacksmith bringing his huge fist down with a heavy thud on the table  john john its not the anvil youve got before you said old moll  no nor yet is my fist the forehammer rejoined the smith with sparkling eyes  nevertheless i repeat that ill goalways supposing that you and molly have no objections  it was one of the dearest wishes of the old womans heart to be near her crippled and favourite son but she would not commit herself at once  what says molly she asked turning to her daughter  molly cast a sidelong glance at fred who gave the slightest possible nod and then said in her gentle voice the sooner we begin to pack the better  bravo lass cried the young sailor slapping his thigh well said and well all go together  what say you boys  agreedagreed was the hearty reply  and this was no idle talk  that night at worship the father of the family spread jims letter as he said before the lord and asked for guidance  the end of the whole matter was that a few months later the thorogood family emigrated to the backwoods of america and began that career of useful energetic patient goddirected labour which ended in the formation of a happy garden in a part of the wilderness which had formerly been the haunt of wild beasts and wilder men  and here kind reader we must close our little tale for it would take a large book if not two books to tell the story of that thoroughgoing familys adventures while endeavouring to spread the truth in the far west  suffice it to say that they all found what they went in search ofhealth and happinessbecause they sought for these blessings in accordance with the teachings of the blessed word of god
