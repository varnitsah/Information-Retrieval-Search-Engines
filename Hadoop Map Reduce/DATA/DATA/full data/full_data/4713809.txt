and ned he piped low and old sam he piped low   into a sorrowful fall did our music flow   and the ladies that sate with the squire vowed theyd never forget   how the eyes of them cried for delight

lurking everywhere   some one came and kissed me there    tired i was my head would go   nodding under the mistletoe   palegreen fairy mistletoe   no footsteps came no voice but only   just as i sat there sleepy lonely   stooped in the still and shadowy air   lips unseen  and kissed me there     the lost shoe    poor little lucy      by some mischance   lost her shoe      as she did dance    twas not on the stairs      not in the hall   not where they sat      at supper at all   she looked in the garden      but there it was not   henhouse or kennel      or high dovecote   dairy and meadow      and wild woods through   showed not a trace      of lucys shoe   bird nor bunny      nor glimmering moon   breathed a whisper      of where twas gone   it was cried and cried      oyez and oyez   in french dutch latin      and portuguese   ships the dark seas      went plunging through   but none brought news      of lucys shoe   and still she patters      in silk and leather   oer snow sand

little children      magic hath stolen away    the primroses scattered by april      the stars of the wide milky way   cannot outnumber the hosts of the children      magic hath stolen away    the buttercup green of the meadows      the snow of the blossoming may   lovelier are not than the legions of children      magic hath stolen away    the waves tossing surf in the moonbeam      the albatross lone on the spray   alone know the tears wept in vain for the children      magic hath stolen away    in vain for at hush of the evening      when the stars twinkle into the grey   seems to echo the faraway calling of children      magic hath stolen away     three queer tales     berries    there was an old woman      went blackberry picking   along the hedges      from weep to wicking    half a pottle      no more she had got   when out steps a fairy      from her green grot   and says well jill      would ee pick ee mo   and jill she curtseys      and looks just so   be off says the fairy      as quick as you can   over the meadows      to the little green lane   that dips to the hayfields      of farmer grimes   ive berried those hedges      a score of times   bushel on bushel      ill promiseee jill   this side of supper      ifee pick with a will   she glints very bright      and speaks her fair   then lo and behold      she had faded in air    be sure old goodie      she trots betimes   over the meadows      to farmer grimes   and never was queen      with jewelry rich   as those same hedges      from twig to ditch   like dutchmens coffers      fruit thorn and flower    they shone like william      and marys bower   and be sure old goodie      went back to weep   so tired with her basket      she scarce could creep    when she comes in the dusk      to her cottage door   theres towser wagging      as never before   to see his missus      so glad to be   come from her fruitpicking      back to he   as soon as next morning      dawn was grey   the pot on the hob      was simmering away   and all in a stew      and a huggermugger   towser and jill      aboiling of sugar   and the dark clear fruit      that from faerie came   for syrup and jelly      and blackberry jam    twelve jolly gallipots      jill put by   and one little teeny one      one inch high   and that shes hidden      a good thumb deep   half way over      from wicking to weep     off the ground    three jolly farmers   once bet a pound   each dance the others would   off the ground   out of their coats   they slipped right soon   and neat and nicesome   put each his shoon   one  two  three    and away they go   not too fast   and not too slow   out from the elmtrees   noonday shadow   into the sun   and across the meadow   past the schoolroom   with knees well bent   fingers aflicking   they dancing went   up sides and over   and round and round   they crossed clickclacking   the parish bound   by tupmans meadow   they did their mile   teettum   on a threebarred stile   then straight through whipham   downhill to week   footing it lightsome   but not too quick   up fields to watchet   and on through wye   till seven fine churches   theyd seen skip by    seven fine churches   and five old mills   farms in the valley   and sheep on the hills   old mans acre   and dead mans pool   all left behind   as they danced through wool   and wool gone by   like tops that seem   to spin in sleep   they danced in dream   withy  wellover    wassopwo   like an old clock   their heels did go   a league and a league   and a league they went   and not one weary   and not one spent   and io and behold   past willowcumleigh   stretched with its waters   the great green sea   says farmer bates   i puffs and i blows   whats under the water   why no man knows   says farmer giles   my wind comes weak   and a good man drownded   is far to seek   but farmer turvey   on twirling toes   ups with his gaiters   and in he goes   down where the mermaids   pluck and play   on their twangling harps   in a seagreen day   down where the mermaids   finned and fair   sleek with their combs   their yellow hair   bates and giles   on the shingle sat   gazing at turveys   floating hat   but never a ripple   nor bubble told   where he was supping   off plates of gold   never an echo   rilled through the sea   of the feasting and dancing   and minstrelsy   they calledcalledcalled   came no reply   nought but the ripples   sandy sigh   then glum and silent   they sat instead   vacantly brooding   on home and bed   till both together   stood up and said   us knows not dreams not   where you be   turvey unless   in the deep blue sea   but axcusing silver   and it comes most willing    heres us two paying   our forty shilling   for its sartin sure turvey   safe and sound   you danced us square turvey   off the ground     the thief at robins castle    there came a thief one night to robins castle   he climbed up into a tree   and sitting with his head among the branches   a wondrous sight did see    for there was robin supping at his table   with candles of pure wax   his dame and his two beauteous little children   with velvet on their backs    platters for each there were shinshining   of silver many a pound   and all of beaten gold three brimming goblets   standing the table round    the smell that rose up richly from the baked meats   came thinning amid the boughs   and much that greedy thief who snuffed the night air   his hunger did arouse    he watched them eating drinking laughing talking   busy with finger and spoon   while three most cunning fiddlers clad in crimson   played them a suppertune    and he waited in the treetop like a starling   till the moon was gotten low   when all the windows in the walls were darkened   he softly in did go    there robin and his dame in bed were sleeping   and his children young and fair   only robins hounds from their warm kennels   yelped as he climbed the stair    all all were sleeping page and fiddler   cook scullion free from care   only robins stallions from their stables   neighed as he climbed the stair    a wee wan light the moon did shed him   hanging above the sea   and he counted into his bag of beaten silver   platters thirtythree    of spoons three score of jolly golden goblets   he stowed in four save one   and six fine threebranched cupid candlesticks   before his work was done    nine bulging bags of money in a cupboard   two snuffers and a dish   he found the last all studded with great garnets   and shapen like a fish    then tiptoe up he stole into a chamber   where on tasselled pillows lay   robin and his daule in dreaming slumbers   tired with the summers day    that thief he mimbled round him in the gloaming   their treasure for to spy   combs brooches chains and rings and pins and buckles   all higgledy piggledy    a watch shaped in the shape of a flat apple   in purest crystal set   he lifted from the hook where it was ticking   and crammed in his pochette    he heaped the pretty baubles on the table   trinketsi knickknackerie   pearls diamonds sapphires topazes and opals   all in his bag put he    and there in nights pale gloom was robin dreaming   he was hunting the mountain bear   while his dame in peaceful slumber in no wise heeded   a greedy thief was there    and that ravenous thief he climbed up even higher   till into a chamber small   he crept where lay poor robins beauteous children   lovelier in sleep withal    oh fairer was their hair than gold of goblet   yond silver their cheeks did shine   and their little hands that lay upon the linen   made that thiefs hard heart to pine    but though a moment there his hard heart faltered   eftsoones be took them twain   and slipped them into his bag with all his plunder   and soft stole down again    spoon platter goblet ducats dishes trinkets   and those two children dear   aquaking in the clinking and the clanking   and half bemused with fear    he carried down the stairs into the courtyard   but there he made no stay   he just tied up his garters took a deep breath   and ran like the wind away    past forest river mountain river forest   he coursed the whole night through   till morning found him come into a country   where none his bad face knew    past mountain river forest river mountain   that thiefs lean shanks sped on   till evening found him knocking at a dark house   his breath now wellnigh gone    there came a little maid and asked his business   a cobbler dwelt within   and though she much misliked the bag he carried   she led the bad man in    he bargained with the cobbler for a lodging   and soft laid down his sack   in the dead of night with none to spy or listen   from off his weary back    and he taught the little chicks to call him father   and he sold his stolen pelf   and bought a palace horses slaves and peacocks   to ease his wicked self    and though the children never really loved him   he was rich past all belief   while robin and his dame oer delf and pewter   spent all their days in grief     places and people     a widows weeds    a poor old widow in her weeds   sowed her garden with wildflower seeds   not too shallow and not too deep   and down came april  drip  drip  drip   up shone may like gold and soon   green as an arbour grew leafy june   and now all summer she sits and sews   where willow herb comfrey bugloss blows   teasle and pansy meadowsweet   campion toadflax and rough hawksbit   brown bee orchis and peals of bells   clover burnet and thyme she smells   like oberons meadows her garden is   drowsy from dawn to dusk with bees   weeps she never but sometimes sighs   and peeps at her garden with bright brown eyes   and all she has is all she needs    a poor old widow in her weeds     sooeep    black as a chimney is his face      and ivory white his teeth   and in his brassbound cart he rides      the chestnut blooms beneath    sooeep sooeep he cries and brightly peers      this

halfpast nine   not a sound is nigh   but the bright moons creeping   across the sky    or a far dog baying   or a twittering bird   in its drowsy nest   in the darkness stirred    or like the roar   of a distant sea   a longdrawn sssh   in the linden tree     the little green orchard    some one is always sitting there            in the little green orchard      even when the sun is high      in

loved earth mans honey passing well   oft at the hives of his tame bees   they would their sugary thirst appease    when dusk began to darken to night   they would hie along in the fading light   with elflocked hair and scarlet lips   and small stone knives to slit the skeps   so softly not a bee inside   should hear the woven straw divide   and then with sly and greedy thumbs   would rifle the sweet honeycombs    and drowsily drone to drone would say   a cold cold wind blows in this way   and the great queen would turn her head   from face to face astonished   and though her maids with comb and brush   would comb and soothe and whisper hush   about the hive would shrilly go   a keening  keening to and fro   at which those robbers neath the trees   would taunt and mock the honeybees   and through their sticky teeth would buzz   just as an angry hornet does    and when this gimmul and this mel   had munched and sucked and swilled their fill   or ever mans first cock could crow   back to

by the ivied orchard wall   over the leaves in the dark night      breathe a sighing call   and faint away in the silence      while i in my bed   wondered twixt dreaming and waking         what it said    nobody knows what the wind is      under the height of the sky   where the hosts of the stars keep far away house      and its wave sweeps by    just a great wave of the air      tossing the leaves in its sea   and foaming under the eaves of the roof         that covers me    and so we live under deep water      all of us beasts and men   and our bodies are buried down under the sand

  marching in the dayshine like a ghost came he   and behind me was the moaning and the murmur         of the sea    as i sat musing twas not one but ten    rank on rank of ghostly soldiers marching oer the fen   marching in the misty air they showed in dreams to me   and behind me was the shouting and the shattering         of the sea    as i sat musing twas a host in dark array   with their horses and their cannon wheeling onward         to the fray   moving like a shadow to the fate the brave must dree   and behind me roared the drums rang the trumpets         of the sea     the bees

batlight         touchwoodlight and toadlight   and the sea a shimmering gloom of grey         and a small face smiling         in a dreams beguiling   in a world of wonders far away     the song of shadows    sweep thy faint strings musician      with thy long lean hand   downward the starry tapers burn      sinks soft the waning sand   the old hound whimpers couched in sleep      the embers smoulder low   across the walls the shadows         come and go    sweep softly thy strings musician      the minutes mount to hours   frost on the windless casement weaves      a labyrinth of flowers   ghosts linger in the darkening air      hearken at the open door   music hath called them dreaming         home once more     the song of the mad prince    who said peacock pie      the old king to the sparrow   who said crops are ripe      rust to the harrow   who said where sleeps she now      where rests she now her head   bathed in eves loveliness       thats what i said    who said ay mums the word      sexton to willow   who said green duck for dreams      moss for a pillow    who said all times delight      hath she for narrow bed   lifes troubled bubble broken       thats what i said     the song of finis    at the edge of all the ages      a knight sate on his steed   his armor red and thin with rust      his soul from sorrow freed   and he lifted up his visor      from a face of skin and bone   and his horse turned head and whinnied      as the twain stood there alone    no bird above that steep of time      sang of a livelong quest   no wind breathed         rest   lone for an end cried knight to steed      loosed an eager rein   charged with his challenge into space      and quiet did quiet remain
