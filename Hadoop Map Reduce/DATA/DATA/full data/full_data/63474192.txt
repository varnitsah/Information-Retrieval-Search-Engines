63474192	odd craft  by ww jacobs    blundells improvement  venia turnbull in a quiet unobtrusive fashion was enjoying herself  the cool livingroom at turnbulls farm was a delightful contrast to the hot sunshine without and the drowsy humming of bees floating in at the open window was charged with hints of slumber to the middleaged  from her seat by the window she watched with amused interest the efforts of her fatherkept from his sunday afternoon nap by the assiduous attentions of her two admirersto maintain his politeness  father was so pleased to see you both come in she said softly its very dull for him here of an afternoon with only me  illustration father was so pleased to see you both come in she said softly  i cant imagine anybody being dull with only you said sergeant dick daly turning a bold brown eye upon her  mr john blundell scowled this was the third time the sergeant had said the thing that he would have liked to say if he had thought of it  i dont mind being dull remarked mr turnbull casually  neither gentleman made any comment  i like it pursued mr turnbull longingly always did from a child  the two young men looked at each other then they looked at venia the sergeant assumed an expression of careless ease while john blundell sat his chair like a human limpet  mr turnbull almost groaned as he remembered his tenacity  the gardens looking very nice he said with a pathetic glance round  beautiful assented the sergeant  i saw it yesterday  some o the roses on that big bush have opened a bit more since then said the farmer  sergeant daly expressed his gratification and said that he was not surprised  it was only ten days since he had arrived in the village on a visit to a relative but in that short space of time he had to the great discomfort of mr blundell made himself wonderfully at home at mr turnbulls  to venia he related strange adventures by sea and land and on subjects of which he was sure the farmer knew nothing he was a perfect mine of information  he began to talk in low tones to venia and the heart of mr blundell sank within him as he noted her interest  their voices fell to a gentle murmur and the sergeants sleek wellbrushed head bent closer to that of his listener  relieved from his attentions mr turnbull fell asleep without more ado  blundell sat neglected the unwilling witness of a flirtation he was powerless to prevent  considering her limited opportunities miss turnbull displayed a proficiency which astonished him  even the sergeant was amazed and suspected her of long practice  i wonder whether it is very hot outside she said at last rising and looking out of the window  only pleasantly warm said the sergeant  it would be nice down by the water  im afraid of disturbing father by our talk said the considerate daughter  you might tell him weve gone for a little stroll when he wakes she added turning to blundell  mr blundell who had risen with the idea of acting the humble but in his opinion highly necessary part of chaperon sat down again and watched blankly from the window until they were out of sight  he was half inclined to think that the exigencies of the case warranted him in arousing the farmer at once  it was an hour later when the farmer awoke to find himself alone with mr blundell a state of affairs for which he strove with some pertinacity to make that aggrieved gentleman responsible  why didnt you go with them he demanded  because i wasnt asked replied the other  mr turnbull sat up in his chair and eyed him disdainfully  for a great big chap like you are john blundell he exclaimed its surprising what a little pluck youve got  i dont want to go where im not wanted retorted mr blundell  thats where you make a mistake said the other regarding him severely girls like a masterful man and instead of getting your own way you sit down quietly and do as youre told like a tametame  tame what inquired mr blundell resentfully  i dont know said the other frankly the tamest thing you can think of  theres daly laughing in his sleeve at you and talking to venia about waterloo and the crimea as though hed been there  i thought it was pretty near settled between you  so did i said mr blundell  youre a big man john said the other but youre slow  youre all muscle and no head  i think of things afterward said blundell humbly generally after i get to bed  mr turnbull sniffed and took a turn up and down the room then he closed the door and came toward his friend again  i dare say youre surprised at me being so anxious to get rid of venia he said slowly but the fact is im thinking of marrying again myself  you said the startled mr blundell  yes me said the other somewhat sharply  but she wont marry so long as venia is at home  its a secret because if venia got to hear of it shed keep single to prevent it  shes just that sort of girl  mr blundell coughed but did not deny it  who is it  he inquired  miss sippet was the reply  she couldnt hold her own for half an hour against venia  mr blundell a great stickler for accuracy reduced the time to five minutes  and now said the aggrieved mr turnbull now so far as i can see shes struck with daly  if she has him itll be years and years before they can marry  she seems crazy about heroes  she was talking to me the other night about them  not to put too fine a point on it she was talking about you  mr blundell blushed with pleased surprise  said you were not a hero explained mr turnbull  of course i stuck up for you  i said youd got too much sense to go putting your life into danger  i said you were a very careful man and i told her how particular you was about damp sheets  your housekeeper told me  its all nonsense said blundell with a fiery face  ill send that old fool packing if she cant keep her tongue quiet  its very sensible of you john said mr turnbull and a sensible girl would appreciate it  instead of that she only sniffed when i told her how careful you always were to wear flannel next to your skin  she said she liked daredevils  i suppose she thinks daly is a daredevil said the offended mr blundell  and i wish people wouldnt talk about me and my skin  why cant they mind their own business  mr turnbull eyed him indignantly and then sitting in a very upright position slowly filled his pipe and declining a proffered match rose and took one from the mantelpiece  i was doing the best i could for you he said staring hard at the ingrate  i was trying to make venia see what a careful husband you would make  miss sippet herself is most particular about such things and venia seemed to think something of it because she asked me whether you used a warmingpan  illustration she asked me whether you used a warmingpan  mr blundell got up from his chair and without going through the formality of bidding his host goodby quitted the room and closed the door violently behind him  he was red with rage and he brooded darkly as he made his way home on the folly of carrying on the traditions of a devoted mother without thinking for himself  for the next two or three days to venias secret concern he failed to put in an appearance at the farma fact which made flirtation with the sergeant a somewhat uninteresting business  her sole recompense was the dismay of her father and for his benefit she dwelt upon the advantages of the army in a manner that would have made the fortune of a recruiting sergeant  shes just crazy after the soldiers he said to mr blundell whom he was trying to spur on to a desperate effort  ive been watching her close and i can see what it is now shes romantic  youre too slow and ordinary for her  she wants somebody more dazzling  she told daly only yesterday afternoon that she loved heroes  told it to him to his face i sat there and heard her  its a pity you aint a hero john  yes said mr blundell then if i was i expect shed like something else  the other shook his head  if you could only do something daring he murmured halfkill somebody or save somebodys life and let her see you do it  couldnt you dive off the quay and save somebodys life from drowning  yes i could said blundell if somebody would only tumble in  you might pretend that you thought you saw somebody drowning suggested mr turnbull  and be laughed at said mr blundell who knew his venia by heart  you always seem to be able to think of objections complained mr turnbull ive noticed that in you before  id go in fast enough if there was anybody there said blundell  im not much of a swimmer but  all the better interrupted the other that would make it all the more daring  and i dont much care if im drowned pursued the younger man gloomily  mr turnbull thrust his hands in his pockets and took a turn or two up and down the room  his brows were knitted and his lips pursed  in the presence of this mental stress mr blundell preserved a respectful silence  well all four go for a walk on the quay on sunday afternoon said mr turnbull at last  on the chance inquired his staring friend  on the chance assented the other its just possible daly might fall in  he might if we walked up and down five million times said blundell unpleasantly  he might if we walked up and down three or four times said mr turnbull especially if you happened to stumble  i never stumble said the matteroffact mr blundell  i dont know anybody more surefooted than i am  or thickheaded added the exasperated mr turnbull  mr blundell regarded him patiently he had a strong suspicion that his friend had been drinking  stumbling said mr turnbull conquering his annoyance with an effort stumbling is a thing that might happen to anybody  you trip your foot against a stone and lurch up against daly he tumbles overboard and you off with your jacket and dive in off the quay after him  he cant swim a stroke  mr blundell caught his breath and gazed at him in speechless amaze  theres sure to be several people on the quay if its a fine afternoon continued his instructor  youll have half dunchurch round you praising you and patting you on the backall in front of venia mind you  itll be put in all the papers and youll get a medal  and suppose we are both drowned said mr blundell soberly  drowned  fiddlesticks   said mr turnbull  however please yourself  if youre afraid  ill do it said blundell decidedly  and mind said the other dont do it as if its as easy as kissing your fingers be halfdrowned yourself or at least pretend to be  and when youre on the quay take your time about coming round  be longer than daly is you dont want him to get all the pity  all right said the other  after a time you can open your eyes went on his instructor then if i were you i should say goodbye venia and close em again  work it up affecting and send messages to your aunts  it sounds all right said blundell  it is all right said mr turnbull  thats just the bare idea ive given you  its for you to improve upon it  youve got two days to think about it  mr blundell thanked him and for the next two days thought of little else  being a careful man he made his will and it was in a comparatively cheerful frame of mind that he made his way on sunday afternoon to mr turnbulls  the sergeant was already there conversing in low tones with venia by the window while mr turnbull sitting opposite in an oaken armchair regarded him with an expression which would have shocked iago  we were just thinking of having a blow down by the water he said as blundell entered  what a hot day like this  said venia  i was just thinking how beautifully cool it is in here said the sergeant who was hoping for a repetition of the previous sundays performance  its cooler outside said mr turnbull with a wilful ignoring of facts much cooler when you get used to it  he led the way with blundell and venia and the sergeant keeping as much as possible in the shade of the dustpowdered hedges followed  the sun was blazing in the sky and scarce halfadozen people were to be seen on the little curved quay which constituted the usual sunday afternoon promenade  the water a dozen feet below lapped cool and green against the stone sides  at the extreme end of the quay underneath the lantern they all stopped ostensibly to admire a fullrigged ship sailing slowly by in the distance but really to effect the change of partners necessary to the afternoons business  the change gave mr turnbull some trouble ere it was effected but he was successful at last and walking behind the two young men waited somewhat nervously for developments  twice they paraded the length of the quay and nothing happened  the ship was still visible and the sergeant halting to gaze at it the company lost their formation and he led the complaisant venia off from beneath her fathers very nose  youre a pretty manager you are john blundell said the incensed mr turnbull  i know what im about said blundell slowly  well why dont you do it demanded the other  i suppose you are going to wait until there are more people about and then perhaps some of them will see you push him over  it isnt that said blundell slowly but you told me to improve on your plan you know and ive been thinking out improvements  well said the other  it doesnt seem much good saving daly said blundell thats what ive been thinking  he would be in as much danger as i should and hed get as much sympathy perhaps more  do you mean to tell me that you are backing out of it  demanded mr turnbull  no said blundell slowly but it would be much better if i saved somebody else  i dont want daly to be pitied  bah  you are backing out of it said the irritated mr turnbull youre afraid of a little cold water  illustration bah you are backing out of it said the irritated mr turnbull  no im not said blundell but it would be better in every way to save somebody else  shell see daly standing there doing nothing while i am struggling for my life  ive thought it all out very carefully  i know im not quick but im sure and when i make up my mind to do a thing i do it  you ought to know that  thats all very well said the other but who else is there to push in  thats all right said blundell vaguely  dont you worry about that i shall find somebody  mr turnbull turned and cast a speculative eye along the quay  as a rule he had great confidence in blundells determination but on this occasion he had his doubts  well its a riddle to me he said slowly  i give it up  it seems halloa  good heavens be careful  you nearly had me in then  did i  said blundell thickly  im very sorry  mr turnbull angry at such carelessness accepted the apology in a grudging spirit and trudged along in silence  then he started nervously as a monstrous and unworthy suspicion occurred to him  it was an incredible thing to suppose but at the same time he felt that there was nothing like being on the safe side and in tones not quite free from significance he intimated his desire of changing places with his awkward friend  its all right said blundell soothingly  i know it is said mr turnbull regarding him fixedly but i prefer this side  you very near had me over just now  i staggered said mr blundell  another inch and i should have been overboard said mr turnbull with a shudder  that would have been a nice how dye do  mr blundell coughed and looked seaward  accidents will happen he murmured  they reached the end of the quay again and stood talking and when they turned once more the sergeant was surprised and gratified at the ease with which he bore off venia  mr turnbull and blundell followed some little way behind and the former gentlemans suspicions were somewhat lulled by finding that his friend made no attempt to take the inside place  he looked about him with interest for a likely victim but in vain  what are you looking at he demanded impatiently as blundell suddenly came to a stop and gazed curiously into the harbour  jellyfish said the other briefly  i never saw such a monster  it must be a yard across  mr turnbull stopped but could see nothing and even when blundell pointed it out with his finger he had no better success  he stepped forward a pace and his suspicions returned with renewed vigour as a hand was laid caressingly on his shoulder  the next moment with a wild shriek he shot suddenly over the edge and disappeared  venia and the sergeant turning hastily were just in time to see the fountain which ensued on his immersion  illustration with a wild shriek he shot suddenly over the edge and disappeared  oh save him  cried venia  the sergeant ran to the edge and gazed in helpless dismay as mr turnbull came to the surface and disappeared again  at the same moment blundell who had thrown off his coat dived into the harbour and rising rapidly to the surface caught the fastchoking mr turnbull by the collar  keep still he cried sharply as the farmer tried to clutch him keep still or ill let you go  help  choked the farmer gazing up at the little knot of people which had collected on the quay  a stout fisherman who had not run for thirty years came along the edge of the quay at a shambling trot with a coil of rope over his arm  john blundell saw him and mindful of the farmers warning about kissing of fingers etc raised his disengaged arm and took that frenzied gentleman below the surface again  by the time they came up he was very glad for his own sake to catch the line skilfully thrown by the old fisherman and be drawn gently to the side  ill tow you to the steps said the fisherman dont let go o the line  mr turnbull saw to that he wound the rope round his wrist and began to regain his presence of mind as they were drawn steadily toward the steps willing hands drew them out of the water and helped them up on to the quay where mr turnbull sitting in his own puddle coughed up salt water and glared ferociously at the inanimate form of mr blundell sergeant daly and another man were rendering what they piously believed to be first aid to the apparently drowned while the stout fisherman with both hands to his mouth was yelling in heartrending accents for a barrel  hehepushpushed me in gasped the choking mr turnbull  nobody paid any attention to him even venia seeing that he was safe was on her knees by the side of the unconscious blundell  hehes shamming bawled the neglected mr turnbull  shame said somebody without even looking round  he pushed me in repeated mr turnbull  he pushed me in  oh father said venia with a scandalised glance at him how can you  shame  said the bystanders briefly as they watched anxiously for signs of returning life on the part of mr blundell  he lay still with his eyes closed but his hearing was still acute and the sounds of a rapidly approaching barrel trundled by a breathless samaritan did him more good than anything  goodbye venia he said in a faint voice goodbye  miss turnbull sobbed and took his hand  hes shamming roared mr turnbull incensed beyond measure at the faithful manner in which blundell was carrying out his instructions  he pushed me in  there was an angry murmur from the bystanders  be reasonable mr turnbull said the sergeant somewhat sharply  he nearly lost is life over you said the stout fisherman  as plucky a thing as ever i see  if i adnt ha been andy with that there line youd both ha been drownded  givemy loveto everybody said blundell faintly  goodbye venia goodbye mr turnbull  wheres that barrel  demanded the stout fisherman crisply  going to be all night with it  now two of you  mr blundell with a great effort and assisted by venia and the sergeant sat up  he felt that he had made a good impression and had no desire to spoil it by riding the barrel  with one exception everybody was regarding him with moisteyed admiration  the exceptions eyes were perhaps the moistest of them all but admiration had no place in them  youre all being made fools of he said getting up and stamping  i tell you he pushed me overboard for the purpose  oh father  how can you  demanded venia angrily  he saved your life  he pushed me in repeated the farmer  told me to look at a jellyfish and pushed me in  what for inquired sergeant daly  because said mr turnbull  he looked at the unconscious sergeant and the words on his lips died away in an inarticulate growl  what for  pursued the sergeant in triumph  be reasonable mr turnbull  wheres the reason in pushing you overboard and then nearly losing his life saving you  that would be a fools trick  it was as fine a thing as ever i saw  what you ad mr turnbull said the stout fisherman tapping him on the arm was a little touch o the sun  what felt to you like a push said another man and over you went  as easy as easy said a third  youre red in the face now said the stout fisherman regarding him critically and your eyes are starting  you take my advice and get ome and get to bed and the first thing youll do when you get your senses back will be to go round and thank mr blundell for all es done for you  illustration you take my advice and get ome and get to bed  mr turnbull looked at them and the circle of intelligent faces grew misty before his angry eyes  one man ignoring his sodden condition recommended a wet handkerchief tied round his brow  i dont want any thanks mr turnbull said blundell feebly as he was assisted to his feet  id do as much for you again  the stout fisherman patted him admiringly on the back and mr turnbull felt like a prophet beholding a realised vision as the spectators clustered round mr blundell and followed their friends example tenderly but firmly they led the hero in triumph up the quay toward home shouting out eulogistic descriptions of his valour to curious neighbours as they passed  mr turnbull churlishly keeping his distance in the rear of the procession received in grim silence the congratulations of his friends  the extraordinary hallucination caused by the sunstroke lasted with him for over a week but at the end of that time his mind cleared and he saw things in the same light as reasonable folk  venia was the first to congratulate him upon his recovery but his extraordinary behaviour in proposing to miss sippet the very day on which she herself became mrs blundell convinced her that his recovery was only partial
