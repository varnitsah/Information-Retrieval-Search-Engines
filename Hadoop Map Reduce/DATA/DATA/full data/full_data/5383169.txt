5383169	illustration richard   the purple land  being the narrative of one richard lambs adventures in the banda oriental in south america as told by himself  by  w h hudson  illustrated by  keith henderson    second edition 1904   new york     preface  this work was first issued in 1885 by messrs sampson low in two slim volumes with the longer and to most persons enigmatical title of the purple land that england lost a purple land may be found in almost any region of the globe and tis of our gains not our losses we keep count a few notices of the book appeared in the papers one or two of the more serious literary journals reviewing it not favourably under the heading of travels and geography but the reading public cared not to buy and it very shortly fell into oblivion there it might have remained for a further period of nineteen years or for ever since the sleep of a book is apt to be of the unawakening kind had not certain men of letters who found it on a forgotten heap and liked it in spite of its faults or because of them concerned themselves to revive it  we are often told that an author never wholly loses his affection for a first book and the feeling has been likened more than once to that of a parent towards a firstborn i have not said it but in consenting to this reprint i considered that a writers early or unregarded work is apt to be raked up when he is not standing by to make remarks he may be absent on a journey from which he is not expected to return it accordingly seemed better that i should myself supervise a new edition since this would enable me to remove a few of the numerous spots and pimples which decorate the ingenious countenance of the work before handing it on to posterity  besides many small verbal corrections and changes the deletion of some paragraphs and the insertion of a few new ones i have omitted one entire chapter containing the story of a piebald horse recently reprinted in another book entitled el ombù i have also dropped the tedious introduction to the former edition only preserving as an appendix the historical part for the sake of such of my readers as may like to have a few facts about the land that england lost  w h h  september 1904  for the second edition   illustration margarita  illustration dolores  illustration paquÍta  illustration toribia  illustration monica  illustration anita  illustration santa coloma  illustration candelaria  illustration demetria  illustration hilario      chapter i   three chapters in the story of my lifethree periods distinct and well defined yet consecutivebeginning when i had not completed twentyfive years and finishing before thirty will probably prove the most eventful of all to the very end they will come back oftenest to memory and seem more vivid than all the other years of existencethe fourandtwenty i had already lived and the say forty or fortyfivei hope it may be fifty or even sixtywhich are to follow for what soul in this wonderful various world would wish to depart before ninety the dark as well as the light its sweet and its bitter make me love it  of the first of these three a word only need be written this was the period of courtship and matrimony and though the experience seemed to me then something altogether new and strange in the world it must nevertheless have resembled that of other men since all men marry and the last period which was the longest of the three occupying fully three years could not be told it was all black disaster three years of enforced separation and the extremest suffering which the cruel law of the land allowed an enraged father to inflict on his child and the man who had ventured to wed her against his will even the wise may be driven mad by oppression and i that was never wise but lived in and was led by the passions and illusions and the unbounded selfconfidence of youth what must it have been for me when we were cruelly torn asunder when i was cast into prison to lie for long months in the company of felons ever thinking of her who was also desolate and breaking her heart but it is endedthe abhorrent restraint the anxiety the breedings over a thousand possible and impossible schemes of revenge if it is any consolation to know that in breaking her heart he at the same time broke his own and made haste to join her in that silent place i have it ah no it is no comfort to me since i cannot but reflect that before he shattered my life i had shattered his by taking her from him who was his idol we are quits then and i can even say peace to his ashes but i could not say it then in my frenzy and grief nor could it be said in that fatal country which i had inhabited from boyhood and had learned to love like my own and had hoped never to leave it was grown hateful to me and flying from it i found myself once more in that purple land where we had formerly taken refuge together and which now seemed to my distracted mind a place of pleasant and peaceful memories  during the months of quietude after the storm mostly spent in lonely rambles by the shore these memories were more and more with me sometimes sitting on the summit of that great solitary hill which gives the town its name i would gaze by the hour on the wide prospect towards the interior as if i could see and never weary of seeing all that lay beyondplains and rivers and woods and hills and cabins where i had rested and many a kindly human face even the faces of those who had illtreated or regarded me with evil eyes now appeared to have a friendly look most of all did i think of that dear river the unforgettable yí the shaded white house at the end of the little town and the sad and beautiful image of one whom i alas had made unhappy  so much was i occupied towards the end of that vacant period with these recollections that i remembered how before quitting these shores the thought had come to me that during some quiet interval in my life i would go over it all again and write the history of my rambles for others to read in the future but i did not attempt it then nor until long years afterwards for i had no sooner begun to play with the idea than something came to rouse me from the state i was in during which i had been like one that has outlived his activities and is no longer capable of a new emotion but feeds wholly on the past and this something new affecting me so that i was all at once myself again eager to be up and doing was nothing more than a casual word from a distance the cry of a lonely heart which came by chance to my ear and hearing it i was like one who opening his eyes from a troubled doze unexpectedly sees the morning star in its unearthly lustre above the wide dark plain where night overtook himthe star of day and everlasting hope and of passion and strife and toil and rest and happiness  i need not linger on the events which took us to the bandaour nocturnal flight from paquítas summer home on the pampas the hiding and clandestine marriage in the capital and subsequent escape northwards into the province of santa fé the seven to eight months of somewhat troubled happiness we had there and finally the secret return to buenos ayres in search of a ship to take us out of the country troubled happiness ah yes and my greatest trouble was when i looked on her my partner for life when she seemed loveliest so small so exquisite in her dark blue eyes that were like violets and silky black hair and tender pink and olive complexionso frail in appearance and i had taken herstolen herfrom her natural protectors from the home where she had been worshippedi of an alien race and another religion without means and because i had stolen her an offender against the law but of this no more i begin my itinerary where safe on our little ship with the towers of buenos ayres fast fading away in the west we began to feel free from apprehension and to give ourselves up to the contemplation of the delights before us winds and waves presently interfered with our raptures paquíta proving a very indifferent sailor so that for some hours we had a very trying time of it next day a favourable northwest breeze sprang up to send us flying like a bird over those unlovely red billows and in the evening we disembarked in montevideo the city of refuge we proceeded to an hotel where for several days we lived very happily enchanted with each others society and when we strolled along the beach to watch the setting sun kindling with mystic fire heaven water and the great hill that gives the city its name and remembered that we were looking towards the shores of buenos ayres it was pleasant to reflect that the widest river in the world rolled between us and those who probably felt offended at what we had done  this charming state of things came to an end at length in a somewhat curious manner one night before we had been a month in the hotel i was lying wide awake in bed it was late i had already heard the mournful longdrawn voice of the watchman under my window calling out halfpast one and cloudy  gil blas relates in his biography that one night while lying awake he fell into practising a little introspection an unusual thing for him to do and the conclusion he came to was that he was not a very good young man i was having a somewhat similar experience that night when in the midst of my unflattering thoughts about myself a profound sigh from paquíta made me aware that she too was lying wide awake and also in all probability chewing the cud of reflection when i questioned her concerning that sigh she endeavoured in vain to conceal from me that she was beginning to feel unhappy what a rude shock the discovery gave me and we so lately married it is only just to paquíta however to say that had i not married her she would have been still more unhappy only the poor child could not help thinking of father and mother she yearned for reconciliation and her present sorrow rose from her belief that they would never never never forgive her i endeavoured with all the eloquence i was capable of to dispel these gloomy ideas but she was firm in her conviction that precisely because they had loved her so much they would never pardon this first great offence my poor darling might have been reading christabel i thought when she said that it is toward those who have been most deeply loved the wounded heart cherishes the greatest bitterness then by way of illustration she told me of a quarrel between her mother and a till then dearly loved sister it had happened many years ago when she paquíta was a mere child yet the sisters had never forgiven each other  and where i asked is this aunt of yours of whom i have never heard you speak until this minute  oh answered paquíta with the greatest simplicity imaginable she left this country long long ago and you never heard of her because we were not even allowed to mention her name in the house she went to live in montevideo and i believe she is there still for several years ago i heard some person say that she had bought herself a house in that city  soul of my life said i you have never left buenos ayres in heart even to keep your poor husband company yet i know paquíta that corporeally you are here in montevideo conversing with me at this very moment  true said paquíta i had somehow forgotten that we were in montevideo my thoughts were wanderingperhaps it is sleepiness  i swear to you paquíta i replied that you shall see this aunt of yours tomorrow before set of sun and i am positive sweetest that she will be delighted to receive so near and lovely a relation how glad she will be of an opportunity of relating that ancient quarrel with her sister and ventilating her mouldy grievances i know these old damesthey are all alike  paquíta did not like the idea at first but when i assured her that we were getting to the end of our money and that her aunt might be able to put me in the way of obtaining employment she consented like the dutiful little wife she was  next day i discovered her relation without very much trouble montevideo not being a large city we found doña isidorafor that was the ladys nameliving in a somewhat meanlooking house at the eastern extremity of the town farthest away from the water there was an air of poverty about the place for the good dame though well provided with means to live comfortably made a pet of her gold nevertheless she received us very kindly when we introduced ourselves and related our mournful and romantic story a room was prepared for our immediate reception and she even made me some vague promises of assistance on a more intimate acquaintance with our hostess we found that i had not been very far out in guessing her character for several days she could talk of nothing except her immemorial quarrel with her sister and her sisters husband and we were bound to listen attentively and to sympathise with her for that was the only return we could make for her hospitality paquíta had more than her share of it but was made no wiser as to the cause of this feud of long standing for though doña isidora had evidently been nursing her wrath all those years to keep it warm she could not for the life of her remember how the quarrel originated  after breakfast each morning i would kiss her and hand her over to the tender mercies of her isidora then go forth on my fruitless perambulations about the town at first i only acted the intelligent foreigner going about staring at the public buildings and collecting curiosstrangely marked pebbles and a few military brass buttons long shed by the garments they once made brave rusty misshapen bullets mementoes of the immortal nine or ten years siege which had won for montevideo the mournful appellation of modern troy when i had fully examined from the outside the scene of my future triumphsfor i had now resolved to settle down and make my fortune in montevideo ibegan seriously to look out for employment i visited in turn every large mercantile establishment in the place and in fact every house where i thought there might be a chance of lighting on something to do it was necessary to make a beginning and i would not have turned up my nose at anything however small i was so heartily sick of being poor idle and dependent nothing could i find in one house i was told that the city had not yet recovered from the effects of the late revolution and that business was in consequence in a complete state of paralysis in another that the city was on the eve of a revolution and that business was in consequence in a complete state of paralysis and everywhere it was the same storythe political state of the country made it impossible for me to win an honest dollar  feeling very much dispirited and with the soles nearly worn off my boots i sat down on a bench beside the sea or riverfor some call it one thing some the other and the muddied hue and freshness of the water and the uncertain words of geographers leave one in doubt as to whether montevideo is situated on the shores of the atlantic or only near the atlantic and on the shores of a river one hundred and fifty miles wide at its mouth i did not trouble my head about it i had other things that concerned me more nearly to think of i had a quarrel with this oriental nation and that was more to me than the greenness or the saltness of the vast estuary that washes the dirty feet of its queenfor this modern troy this city of battle murder and sudden death also calls itself queen of the plata that it was a very just quarrel on my part i felt well assured now to be even with every human being who despitefully uses me has ever been a principle of action with me nor let it be said that it is an unchristian principle for when i have been smitten on the right or left cheek the pain is just the same in either case before i am prepared to deliver the return blow so long a time has often elapsed that all wrathful or revengeful thoughts are over i strike in such a case more for the public good than for my own satisfaction and am therefore right in calling my motive a principle of action not an impulse it is a very valuable one too infinitely more effective than the fantastical code of the duellist which favours the person who inflicts the injury affording him facilities for murdering or maiming the person injured it is a weapon invented for us by nature before colonel colt ever lived and it has this advantage that one is permitted to wear it in the most lawabiding communities as well as amongst miners and backwoodsmen if inoffensive people were ever to cast it aside then wicked men would have everything their own way and make life intolerable fortunately the evildoers always have the fear of this intangible sixshooter before them a wholesome feeling which restrains them more than reasonableness or the law courts and to which we owe it that the meek are permitted to inherit the earth but now this quarrel was with a whole nation though certainly not with a very great one since the population of the banda orientál numbers only about a quarter of a million yet in this sparsely settled country with its bountiful soil and genial climate there was apparently no place for me a muscular and fairly intelligent young man who only asked to be allowed to work to live but how was i to make them smart for this injustice i could not take the scorpion they gave me when i asked them for an egg and make it sting every individual composing the nation i was powerless utterly powerless to punish them and therefore the only thing that remained for me to do was to curse them  looking around me my eyes rested on the famous hill across the bay and i all at once resolved to go up to its summit and looking down on the banda orientál pronounce my imprecation in the most solemn and impressive manner  the expedition to the cerro as it is called proved agreeable enough notwithstanding the excessive heats we were just then having many wild flowers were blooming on its slopes which made it a perfect garden when i reached the old ruined fort which crowns the summit i got upon a wall and rested for half an hour fanned by a fresh breeze from the river and greatly enjoying the prospect before me i had not left out of sight the serious object of my visit to that commanding spot and only wished that the malediction i was about to utter could be rolled down in the shape of a stupendous rock loosed from its hold which would go bounding down the mountain and leaping clear over the bay crash through the iniquitous city beyond filling it with ruin and amazement  whichever way i turn i said i see before me one of the fairest habitations god has made for man great plains smiling with everlasting spring ancient woods swift beautiful rivers ranges of blue hills stretching away to the dim horizon and beyond those fair slopes how many leagues of pleasant wilderness are sleeping in the sunshine where the wild flowers waste their sweetness and no plough turns the fruitful soil where deer and ostrich roam fearless of the hunter while over all bends a blue sky without a cloud to stain its exquisite beauty and the people dwelling in yon citythe key to a continentthey are the possessors of it all it is theirs since the world out of which the old spirit is fast dying has suffered them to keep it what have they done with this their heritage what are they doing even now they are sitting dejected in their houses or standing in their doorways with folded arms and anxious expectant faces for a change is coming they are on the eve of a tempest not an atmospheric change no blighting simoom will sweep over their fields nor will any volcanic eruption darken their crystal heavens the earthquakes that shake the andean cities to their foundations they have never known and can never know the expected change and tempest is a political one the plot is ripe the daggers sharpened the contingent of assassins hired the throne of human skulls styled in their ghastly facetiousness a presidential chair is about to be assaulted it is long weeks or even months perhaps since the last wave crested with bloody froth rolled its desolating flood over the country it is high time therefore for all men to prepare themselves for the shock of the succeeding wave and we consider it right to root up thorns and thistles to drain malarious marshes to extirpate rats and vipers but it would be immoral i suppose to stamp out these people because their vicious natures are disguised in human shape this people that in crimes have surpassed all others ancient or modern until because of them the name of a whole continent has grown to be a byword of scorn and reproach throughout the earth and to stink in the nostrils of all men  i swear that i too will become a conspirator if i remain long on this soil oh for a thousand young men of devon and somerset here with me every one of them with a brain on fire with thoughts like mine what a glorious deed would be done for humanity what a mighty cheer we would raise for the glory of the old england that is passing away blood would flow in yon streets as it never flowed before or i should say as it only flowed in them once and that was when they were swept clean by british bayonets and afterwards there would be peace and the grass would be greener and the flowers brighter for that crimson shower  is it not then bitter as wormwood and gall to think that over these domes and towers beneath my feet no longer than half a century ago fluttered the holy cross of st george for never was there a holier crusade undertaken never a nobler conquest planned than that which had for its object the wresting this fair country from unworthy hands to make it for all time part of the mighty english kingdom what would it have been nowthis bright winterless land and this city commanding the entrance to the greatest river in the world and to think that it was won for england not treacherously or bought with gold but in the old saxon fashion with hard blows and climbing over heaps of slain defenders and after it was thus won to think that it was lostwill it be believednot fighting but yielded up without a stroke by craven wretches unworthy of the name of britons here sitting alone on this mountain my face burns like fire when i think of itthis glorious opportunity lost for ever we offer you your laws your religion and property under the protection of the british government loftily proclaimed the invadersgenerals beresford achmuty whitelocke and their companions and presently after suffering one reverse they or one of them lost heart and exchanged the country they had drenched in blood and had conquered for a couple of thousand british soldiers made prisoners in buenos ayres across the water then getting into their ships once more they sailed away from the plata for ever this transaction which must have made the bones of our viking ancestors rattle with indignation in their graves was forgotten later on when we seized the rich falklands a splendid conquest and a glorious compensation for our loss when yon queen city was in our grasp and the regeneration possibly even the ultimate possession of this green world before us our hearts failed us and the prize dropped from our trembling hands we left the sunny mainland to capture the desolate haunt of seals and penguins and now let all those who in this quarter of the globe aspire to live under that british protection of which achmuty preached so loudly at the gates of yon capital transport themselves to those lonely antarctic islands to listen to the thunder of the waves on the grey shores and shiver in the bleak winds that blow from the frozen south  after delivering this comminatory address i felt greatly relieved and went home in a cheerful frame of mind to supper which consisted that evening of mutton scrag boiled with pumpkin sweet potatoes and milky maizenot at all a bad dish for a hungry man    chapter ii  several days passed and my second pair of boots had been twice resoled before doña isidoras schemes for advancing my fortunes began to take form perhaps she was beginning to think us a burden on her somewhat niggardly establishment anyway hearing that my preference was for a country life she gave me a letter containing half a dozen lines of commendation addressed to the mayordomo of a distant cattlebreeding establishment asking him to serve the writer by giving her nephewas she called meemployment of some kind on the estancia probably she knew that this letter would really lead to nothing and gave it merely to get me away into the interior of the country so as to keep paquíta for an indefinite time to herself for she had become extremely attached to her beautiful niece the estancia was on the borders of the paysandù department and not less than two hundred miles from montevideo it was a long journey and i was advised not to attempt it without a tropilla or troop of horses but when a native tells you that you cannot travel two hundred miles without a dozen horses he only means that you cannot do the distance in two days for it is hard for him to believe that one may be satisfied with less than one hundred miles a day i travelled on one horse and it therefore took me several days to accomplish my journey before i reached my destination called estancia de la virgin de los desamparados i met with some adventures worth relating and began to feel as much at home with the orientáles as i had long been with the argentinos  fortunately after i left the town a west wind continued blowing all day bringing with it many light flying clouds to mitigate the sun so that i was able to cover a good number of leagues before the evening i took the road northwards through camelones department and was well on into the florida department when i put up for the night at the solitary mud rancho of an old herdsman who lived with his wife and children in a very primitive fashion when i rode up to the house several huge dogs rushed out to attack me one seized my horse by the tail dragging the poor beast about this way and that so that he staggered and could scarcely keep his legs another caught the bridlereins in his mouth while a third fixed his fangs in the heel of my boot after eyeing me for some moments the grizzled old herdsman who wore a knife a yard long at his waist advanced to the rescue he shouted at the dogs and finding that they would not obey sprang forward and with a few dexterous blows dealt with his heavy whiphandle sent them away howling with rage and pain then he welcomed me with great courtesy and very soon when my horse had been unsaddled and turned loose to feed we were sitting together enjoying the cool evening air and imbibing the bitter and refreshing maté his wife served to us while we conversed i noticed numberless fireflies flitting about i had never seen them so numerous before and they made a very lovely show presently one of the children a bright little fellow of seven or eight came running to us with one of the sparkling insects in his hand and cried  look tatita i have caught a linterna see how bright it is  the saints forgive you my child said the father go little son and put it back on the grass for if you should hurt it the spirits would be angry with you for they go about by night and love the linterna that keeps them company  what a pretty superstition i thought and what a mild merciful heart this old oriental herdsman must possess to show so much tenderness towards one of gods tiny creatures i congratulated myself on my good fortune in having fallen in with such a person in this lonely place  the dogs after their rude behaviour to me and the sharp punishment they had suffered in consequence had returned and were now gathered around us lying on the ground here i noticed not for the first time that the dogs belonging to these lonely places are not nearly so fond of being noticed and caressed as are those of more populous and civilised districts on attempting to stroke one of these surly brutes on the head he displayed his teeth and growled savagely at me yet this animal though so truculent in temper and asking for no kindness from his master is just as faithful to man as his bettermannered brother in the more settled country i spoke on that subject to my gentle herdsman  what you say is true he replied i remember once during the siege of montevideo when i was with a small detachment sent to watch the movements of general riveras army we one day overtook a man on a tired horse our officer suspecting him to be a spy ordered him to be killed and after cutting his throat we left his body lying on the open ground at a distance of about two hundred and fifty yards from a small stream of water a dog was with him and when we rode off we called it to follow us but it would not stir from its dead masters side  three days later we returned to the same spot to find the corpse lying just where we had left it the foxes and birds had not touched it for the dog was still there to defend it many vultures were near waiting for a chance to begin their feast we alighted to refresh ourselves at the stream then stood there for half an hour watching the dog he seemed to be halffamished with thirst and came towards the stream to drink but before he got halfway to it the vultures by twos and threes began to advance when back he flew and chased them away barking after resting a few minutes beside the corpse he came again towards the stream till seeing the hungry birds advance once more he again flew back at them barking furiously and foaming at the mouth this we saw repeated many times and at last when we left we tried once more to entice the dog to follow us but he would not two days after that we had occasion to pass by that spot again and there we saw the dog lying dead beside his dead master  good god i exclaimed how horrible must have been the feelings you and your companions experienced at such a sight  no señor not at all replied the old man why señor i myself put the knife into that mans throat for if a man did not grow accustomed to shed blood in this world his life would be a burden to him  what an inhuman old murderer i thought then i asked him whether he had ever in his life felt remorse for shedding blood  yes he answered when i was a very young man and had never before dipped weapon in human blood that was when the siege began i was sent with half a dozen men in pursuit of a clever spy who had passed the lines with letters from the besieged we came to a house where our officer had been informed he had been lying concealed the master of the house was a young man about twentytwo years old he would confess nothing finding him so stubborn our officer became enraged and bade him step out and then ordered us to lance him we galloped forty yards off then wheeled back he stood silent his arms folded on his breast a smile on his lips without a cry without a groan with that smile still on his lips he fell pierced through with our lances for days afterwards his face was ever present to me i could not eat for my food choked me when i raised a jug of water to my lips i could señor distinctly see his eyes looking at me from the water when i lay down to sleep his face was again before me always with that smile that seemed to mock me on the lips i could not understand it they told me it was remorse and that it would soon leave me for there is no ill that time will not cure they spoke truth and when that feeling left me i was able to do all things  the old mans story so sickened me that i had little appetite for supper and passed a bad night thinking waking or sleeping of that young man in this obscure corner of the world who folded his arms and smiled on his slayers when they were slaying him very early next morning i bade my host goodbye thanking him for his hospitality and devoutly hoping that i should never look upon his abhorred face again  i made little progress that day the weather proving hot and my horse lazier than ever after riding about five leagues i rested for a couple of hours then proceeded again at a gentle trot till about the middle of the afternoon when i dismounted at a wayside pulpería or store and publichouse all in one where several natives were sipping rum and conversing standing before them was a brisklooking old manold i say because he had a dark dry skin though his hair and moustache were black as jetwho paused in the discourse he appeared to be delivering to salute me then after bestowing a searching glance on me out of his dark hawklike eyes he resumed his talk after calling for rum and water to be in the fashion i sat down on a bench and lighting a cigarette prepared to listen he was dressed in shabby gaucho habilimentscotton shirt short jacket wide cotton drawers and chiripa a shawllike garment fastened at the waist with a sash and reaching down halfway between the knees and ankles in place of a hat he wore a cotton handkerchief tied carelessly about his head his left foot was bare while the right one was cased in a coltsskin stocking called botadepotro and on this distinguished foot was buckled a huge iron spur with spikes two inches long one spur of the kind would be quite sufficient i should imagine to get out of a horse all the energy of which he was capable when i entered he was holding forth on the pretty wellworn theme of fate versus free will his arguments were not however the usual dry philosophical ones but took the form of illustration chiefly personal reminiscences and strange incidents in the lives of people he had known while so vivid and minute were his descriptionssparkling with passion satire humour pathos and so dramatic his action while wonderful story followed storythat i was fairly astonished and pronounced this old pulpería orator a born genius  his argument over he fixed his keen eyes on me and said  my friend i perceive you are a traveller from montevideo may i ask what news there is from that city  what news do you expect to hear said i then it came into my thought that it was scarcely proper to confine myself to more commonplace phrases in replying to this curious old oriental bird with such ragged plumage but whose native woodnotes wild had such a charm in them it is only the old story over again i continued they say there will be a revolution some day some of the people have already retired into their houses after chalking in very big letters on their front doors please come into this house and cut the owners throat for him so that he may rest at peace and have no fear of what may happen others have climbed on to their roofs and occupy themselves there looking at the moon through spyglasses thinking that the conspirators are concealed in that luminary and only waiting for a cloud to obscure it in order to descend upon the city unobserved  hear cried the old man rapping delighted applause on the counter with his empty glass  what do you drink friend i asked thinking his keen appreciation of my grotesque speech deserved a treat and wishing to draw him out a little more  rum friend thank you they say it warms you in winter and cools you in summerwhat can you have better  tell me said i when his glass had been refilled by the storekeeper what i shall say when i return to montevideo and am asked what news there is in the country  the old fellows eyes twinkled while the other men ceased talking and looked at him as if anticipating something good in reply to my question  say to them he answered that you met an old mana horse tamer named luceroand that he told you this fable for you to repeat to the townspeople once there was a great tree named montevideo growing in this country and in its branches lived a colony of monkeys one day one of the monkeys came down from the tree and ran full of excitement across the plain now scrambling along like a man on all fours then erect like a dog running on its hind legs while its tail with nothing to catch hold of wriggled about like a snake when its head is under foot he came to a place where a number of oxen were grazing and some horses ostriches deer goats and pigs friends all cried the monkey grinning like a skull and with staring eyes round as dollars great news great news i come to tell you that there will shortly be a revolution where said an ox in the treewhere else said the monkey that does not concern us said the ox oh yes it does cried the monkey for it will presently spread about the country and you will all have your throats cut then the ox replied go back monkey and do not molest us with your news lest we get angry and go to besiege you in your tree as we have often had to do since the creation of the world and then if you and the other monkeys come down to us we will toss you on our horns  this apologue sounded very well so admirably did the old man picture to us with voice and gesture the chattering excitement of the monkey and the majestic aplomb of the ox  señor he continued after the laugh had subsided i do not wish any of my friends and neighbours here present to fly to the conclusion that i have spoken anything offensive had i seen in you a montevidean i should not have spoken of monkeys but señor though you speak as we do there is yet in the pepper and salt on your tongue a certain foreign flavour  you are right i said i am a foreigner  a foreigner in some things friend for you were doubtless born under other skies but in that chief quality which we think was given by the creator to us and not to the people of other landsthe ability to be one in heart with the men you meet whether they are clothed in velvet or in sheepskinsin that you are one of us a pure oriental  i smiled at his subtle flattery possibly it was only meant in payment of the rum i had treated him to but it pleased me none the less and to his other mental traits i was now inclined to add a marvellous skill in reading character  after a while he invited me to spend the night under his roof your horse is fat and lazy he said with truth and unless you are a relation of the owl family you cannot go much farther before tomorrow my house is a humble one but the mutton is juicy the fire warm and the water cool there the same as in another place  i readily accepted his invitation wishing to see as much as i could of so original a character and before starting i purchased a bottle of rum which made his eyes sparkle so that i thought his namelucerorather an appropriate one his rancho was about two miles from the store and our ride thither was about as strange a gallop as i ever took lucero was a domador or horsetamer and the beast he rode was quite unbroken and vicious as it could be between horse and man a fierce struggle for mastery raged the whole time the horse rearing plunging buckjumping and putting into practice every conceivable trick to rid itself of its burden while lucero plied whip and spur with tremendous energy and poured out torrents of strange adjectives at one moment he would come into violent collision with my old sober beast at another there would be fifty yards of ground between us still lucero would not stop talking for he had begun a very interesting story at starting and he stuck to his narrative through everything resuming the thread after each tempest of execration vented on his horse and raising his voice almost to a shout when we were far apart the old fellows staying powers were really extraordinary and when we arrived at the house he jumped airily to the ground and seemed fresh and calm as possible  in the kitchen were several people sipping maté luceros children and grandchildren also his wife a grey old dame with dimlooking eyes but then my host was old in years himself only like ulysses he still possessed the unquenched fire and energy of youth in his soul while time bestowed infirmities together with wrinkles and white hairs on his helpmate  he introduced me to her in a manner that brought the modest flame to my cheeks standing before her he said that he had met me at the pulpería and had put to me the question which a simple old countryman must ask of every traveller from montevideowhat the news was then assuming a dry satirical tone which years of practice would not enable me to imitate he proceeded to give my fantastical answer garnished with much original matter of his own  señora i said when he had finished you must not give me credit for all you have heard from your husband i only gave him brute wool and he has woven it for your delight into beautiful cloth  hear him did i tell you what to expect juana cried the old man which made me blush still more  we then settled down to maté and quiet conversation sitting in the kitchen on the skull of a horsea common article of furniture in an oriental ranchowas a boy about twelve years old one of luceros grandchildren with a very beautiful face his feet were bare and his clothes very poor but his soft dark eyes and olive face had that tender halfmelancholy expression often seen in children of spanish origin which is always so strangely captivating  where is your guitar cipriano said his grandfather addressing him whereupon the boy rose and fetched a guitar which he first politely offered to me  when i had declined it he seated himself once more on his polished horseskull and began to play and sing he had a sweet boys voice and one of his ballads took my fancy so much that i made him repeat the words to me while i wrote them down in my notebook which greatly gratified lucero who seemed proud of the boys accomplishment here are the words translated almost literally therefore without rhymes and i only regret that i cannot furnish my musical readers with the quaint plaintive air they were sung to      o let me goo let me go     where high are born amidst the hills     the streams that gladden all the south     and oer the grassy desert wide     where slakes his thirst the antlered deer     hurry towards the great green ocean      the stony hillsthe stony hills     with azure airflowers on their crags     where cattle stray unowned by man     the monarch of the herd there seems     no bigger than my hand in size     roaming along the tall steep summit      i know them welli know them well     those hills of god and they know me     when i go there they are serene     but when the stranger visits them     dark rainclouds gather round their tops     over the earth goes forth the tempest      then tell me notthen tell me not     tis sorrowful to dwell alone     my heart within the city pent     pines for the deserts liberty     the streets are red with blood and fear     makes pale and mournful womens faces      o bear me faro bear me far     on swift sure feet my trusty steed     i do not love the burialground     but i shall sleep upon the plain     where long green grass shall round me wave     over me graze wild herds of cattle     chapter iii   leaving the eloquent old horsetamers rancho early next morning i continued my ride jogging quietly along all day and leaving the florida department behind me entered upon that of the durazno here i broke my journey at an estancia where i had an excellent opportunity of studying the manners and customs of the orientals and where i also underwent experiences of a mixed character and greatly increased my knowledge of the insect world this house at which i arrived an hour before sunset to ask for shelter permission to unsaddle is the expression the traveller uses was a long low structure thatched with rushes but the low enormously thick walls were built of stone from the neighbouring sierras in pieces of all shapes and sizes and presenting outwardly the rough appearance of a stone fence how these rudely piledup stones without cement to hold them together had not fallen down was a mystery to me and it was more difficult still to imagine why the rough interior with its innumerable dusty holes and interstices had never been plastered  i was kindly received by a very numerous family consisting of the owner his hoaryheaded old motherinlaw his wife three sons and five daughters all grown up there were also several small children belonging i believe to the daughters notwithstanding the fact that they were unmarried i was greatly amazed at hearing the name of one of these youngsters such christian names as trinity heart of jesus nativity john of god conception ascension incarnation are common enough but these had scarcely prepared me to meet with a fellowcreature namedwell circumcision besides the people there were dogs cats turkeys ducks geese and fowls without number not content with all these domestic birds and beasts they also kept a horrid shrieking paroquet which the old woman was incessantly talking to explaining to the others all the time in little asides what the bird said or wished to say or rather what she imagined it wished to say there were also several tame young ostriches always hanging about the big kitchen or livingroom on the lookout for a brass thimble or iron spoon or other little metallic bonne bouche to be gobbled up when no one was looking a pet armadillo kept trotting in and out in and out the whole evening and a lame gull was always standing on the threshold in everybodys way perpetually wailing for something to eatthe most persistent beggar i ever met in my life  the people were very jovial and rather industrious for so indolent a country the land was their own the men tended the cattle of which they appeared to have a large number while the women made cheeses rising before daylight to milk the cows  during the evening two or three young menneighbours i imagine who were paying their addresses to the young ladies of the establishment dropped in and after a plentiful supper we had singing and dancing to the music of the guitar on which every member of the familyexcepting the babiescould strum a little  about eleven oclock i retired to rest and stretching myself on my rude bed of rugs in a room adjoining the kitchen i blessed these simpleminded hospitable people good heavens thought i to myself what a glorious field is waiting here for some new theocritus how unutterably worn out stilted and artificial seems all the socalled pastoral poetry ever written when one sits down to supper and joins in the graceful cielo or pericon in one of these remote semibarbarous south american estancias i swear i will turn poet myself and go back some day to astonish old blasé europe with something sosowhat the deuce was that my sleepy soliloquy was suddenly brought to a most lame and impotent conclusion for i had heard a sound of terrorthe unmistakable zzzzing of an insects wings it was the hateful vinchuca here was an enemy against which british pluck and sixshooters are of no avail and in whose presence one begins to experience sensations which are not usually supposed to enter into the brave mans breast naturalists tell us that it is the connorhinus infectans but as that information leaves something to be desired i will proceed in a few words to describe the beast it inhabits the entire chilian argentine and oriental countries and to all the dwellers in this vast territory it is known as the vinchuca for like a few volcanoes deadly vipers cataracts and other sublime natural objects it has been permitted to keep the ancient name bestowed on it by the aborigines it is all over of a blackishbrown colour as broad as a mans thumbnail and flat as the blade of a tableknifewhen fasting by day it hides buglike in holes and chinks but no sooner are the candles put out than forth it comes to seek whom it may devour for like the pestilence it walks in darkness it can fly and in a dark room knows where you are and can find you having selected a nice tender part it pierces the skin with its proboscis or rostrum and sucks vigorously for two or three minutes and strange to say you do not feel the operation even when lying wide awake by that time the creature so attenuated before has assumed the figure size and general appearance of a ripe gooseberry so much blood has it drawn from your veins immediately after it has left you the part begins to swell up and burn as if stung by nettles that the pain should come after and not during the operation is an arrangement very advantageous to the vinchuca and i greatly doubt whether any other bloodsucking parasite has been equally favoured by nature in this respect  imagine then my sensations when i heard the sound of not one but two or three pairs of wings i tried to forget the sound and go to sleep i tried to forget about those rough old walls full of intersticesa hundred years old they were my host had informed me most interesting old house thought i and then very suddenly a fiery itching took possession of my great toe there it is said i heated blood late supper dancing and all that i can almost imagine that something has actually bitten me when of course nothing of that kind has happened then while i was furiously rubbing and scratching it feeling a badgerlike disposition to gnaw it off my left arm was pierced with redhot needles my attentions were quickly transferred to that part but soon my busy hands were called elsewhere like a couple of hardworked doctors in a town afflicted with an epidemic and so all night long with only occasional snatches of miserable sleep the contest went on  i rose early and going to a wide stream a quarter of a mile from the house took a plunge which greatly refreshed me and gave me strength to go in quest of my horse poor brute i had intended giving him a days rest so pleasant and hospitable had the people shown themselves but now i shuddered at the thought of spending another night in such a purgatory i found him so lame that he could scarcely walk and so returned to the house on foot and very much cast down my host consoled me by assuring me that i would sleep the siesta all the better for having been molested by those little things that go about for in this very mild language he described the affliction after breakfast at noon acting on his hint i took a rug to the shade of a tree and lying down quickly fell into a profound sleep which lasted till late in the afternoon  that evening visitors came again and we had a repetition of the singing dancing and other pastoral amusements till near midnight then thinking to cheat my bedfellows of the night before i made my simple bed in the kitchen but here also the vile vinchucas found me and there were moreover dozens of fleas that waged a sort of guerilla warfare all night and in this way exhausted my strength and distracted my attention while the more formidable adversary took up his position my sufferings were so great that before daybreak i picked up my rugs and went out a distance from the house to lie down on the open plain but i carried with me a smarting body and got but little rest when morning came i found that my horse had not yet recovered from his lameness  do not be in a hurry to leave us said my host when i spoke of it i perceive that the little animals have again fought with and defeated you do not mind it in time you will grow accustomed to them  how they contrived to endure it or even to exist was a puzzle to me but possibly the vinchucas respected them and only dined when like the giant in the nursery rhyme they smelt the blood of an englishman  i again enjoyed a long siesta and when night came resolved to place myself beyond the reach of the vampires and so after supper went out to sleep on the plain about midnight however a sudden storm of wind and rain drove me back to the shelter of the house and the next morning i rose in such a deplorable state that i deliberately caught and saddled my horse though the poor beast could scarcely put one foot on the ground my friends laughed goodhumouredly when they saw me making these resolute preparations for departure after partaking of bitter maté i rose and thanked them for their hospitality  you surely do not intend leaving us on that animal said my host he is unfit to carry you  i have no other i replied and am anxious to reach my destination  had i known this i would have offered you a horse before he returned and then he sent one of his sons to drive the horses of the estancia into the corral  selecting a goodlooking animal from the herd he presented it to me and as i did not have money enough to buy a fresh horse whenever i wanted one i accepted the gift very gladly the saddle was quickly transferred to my new acquisition and once more thanking these good people and bidding adieu i resumed my journey  when i gave my hand before leaving to the youngest and also to my mind the prettiest of the five daughters of the house instead of smiling pleasantly and wishing me a prosperous journey like the others she was silent and darted a look at me which seemed to say go sir you have treated me badly and you insult me by offering your hand if i take it it is not because i feel disposed to forgive you but only to save appearances  at the same moment when she bestowed that glance on me which said so much a look of intelligence passed over the faces of the other people in the room all this revealed to me that i had just missed a very pretty little idyllic flirtation conducted in very novel circumstances love cometh up as a flower and men and charming women naturally flirt when brought together yet it was hard to imagine how i could have started a flirtation and carried it on to its culminatory point in that great public room with all those eyes on me dogs babes and cats tumbling about my feet ostriches staring covetously at my buttons with great vacant eyes and that intolerable paroquet perpetually reciting how the waters came down at lodore in its own shrieky beaky birdy hurdygurdy parrot language tender glances soft whispered words handtouchings and a thousand little personal attentions showing which way the emotions tend would scarcely have been practicable in such a place and in such conditions and new signs and symbols would have to be invented to express the feelings of the heart and doubtless these orientals living all together in one great room with their children and pets like our very ancient ancestors the pastoral aryans do possess such a language and this pretty language i should have learnt from the most willing of teachers if those venomous vinchucas had not dulled my brain with their persecutions and made me blind to a matter which had not escaped the observation of even unconcerned lookerson riding away from the estancia the feeling i experienced at having finally escaped from these execrable little things that go about was not one of unmixed satisfaction     chapter iv   continuing my journey through the durazno district i forded the pretty river yí and entered the tacuarembó department which is immensely long extending right away to the brazilian frontier i rode over its narrowest part however where it is only about twentyfive miles wide then crossing two very curiously named rivers rios salsipuedes chico and salsipuedes grande which mean getoutifyoucan rivers little and big i at length reached the termination of my journey in the province or department of paysandù the estancia de la virgen de los desamparados or to put it very shortly vagabonds rest was a goodsized square brick house built on very high ground which overlooked an immense stretch of grassy undulating country  there was no plantation about the house not even a shade tree or cultivated plant of any description but only some large corrales or enclosures for the cattle of which there were six or seven thousand head on the land the absence of shade and greenery gave the place a desolate uninviting aspect but if i was ever to have any authority here this would soon be changed the mayordomo or manager don policarpo santierra de peñalosa which roughly done into english means polycarp of the holy land abounding in slippery rocks proved to be a very pleasant affable person he welcomed me with that quiet oriental politeness which is never cold and never effusive and then perused the letter from doña isidora finally he said i am willing my friend to supply you with all the conveniences procurable at this elevation and for the rest you know doubtless what i can say to you a ready understanding requires few words nevertheless there is here no lack of good beef and to be short you will do me a great favour by making this house with everything it contains your own while you honour us by remaining in it  after delivering himself of these kindly sentiments which left me rather in a mist as to my prospects he mounted his horse and rode off probably on some very important affair for i saw no more of him for several days  i at once proceeded to establish myself in the kitchen no person inthe house appeared ever to pay even a casual visit to any other room this kitchen was vast and barnlike forty feet long at least and proportionately wide the roof was of reeds and the hearth placed in the centre of the floor was a clay platform fenced round with cows shankbones half buried and standing upright some trivets and iron kettles were scattered about and from the centre beam supporting the roof a chain and hook were suspended to which a vast iron pot was fastened one more article a spit about six feet long for roasting meat completed the list of cooking utensils there were no chairs tables knives or forks everyone carried his own knife and at mealtime the boiled meat was emptied into a great tin dish whilst the roast was eaten from the spit each one laying hold with his fingers and cutting his slice the seats were logs of wood and horseskulls the household was composed of one woman an ancient hideously ugly greyheaded negress about seventy years old and eighteen or nineteen men of all ages and sizes and of all colours from parchmentwhite to very old oak there was a capatas or overseer and seven or eight paid peones the others being all agregadosthat is supernumeraries without pay or to put it plainly vagabonds who attach themselves like vagrant dogs to establishments of this kind lured by the abundance of flesh and who occasionally assist the regular peones at their work and also do a little gambling and stealing to keep themselves in small change at break of day everyone was up sitting by the hearth sipping bitter maté and smoking cigarettes before sunrise all were mounted and away over the surrounding country to gather up the herds at midday they were back again to breakfast the consumption and waste of meat was something frightful frequently after breakfast as much as twenty or thirty pounds of boiled and roast meat would be thrown into a wheelbarrow and carried out to the dustheap where it served to feed scores of hawks gulls and vultures besides the dogs  of course i was only an agregado having no salary or regular occupation yet thinking however that this would only be for a time i was quite willing to make the best of things and very soon became fast friends with my fellow agregados joining heartily in all their amusements and voluntary labours  in a few days i got very tired of living exclusively on flesh for not even a biscuit was procurable at this elevation and as for a potato one might as well have asked for a plumpudding it occurred to my mind at last that with so many cows it might be possible to procure some milk and introduce a little change into our diet in the evening i broached the subject proposing that on the following day we should capture a cow and tame her some of the men approved of the suggestion remarking that they had never thought of it themselves but the old negress who being the only representative of the fair sex present was always listened to with all the deference due to her position threw herself with immense zeal into the opposition she affirmed that no cow had been milked at that establishment since its owner had paid it a visit with his young wife twelve years before a milchcow was then kept and on the señora partaking of a large quantity of milk before breaking her fast it produced such an indigestion in her that they were obliged to give her powdered ostrich stomach and finally to convey her with great trouble in an oxcart to paysandù and thence by water to montevideo the owner ordered the cow to be released and never to her certain knowledge had cow been milked since at la virgen de los desamparados  these ominous croakings produced no effect on me and the next day i returned to the subject i did not possess a lasso and so could not undertake to capture a halfwild cow without assistance one of my fellow agregados at length volunteered to help me observing that he had not tasted milk for several years and was inclined to renew his acquaintance with that singular beverage this newfound friend in need merits being formally introduced to the reader his name was epifanio claro he was tall and thin and had an idiotic expression on his long sallow face his cheeks were innocent of whiskers and his lank black hair parted in the middle fell to his shoulders enclosing his narrow face between a pair of ravens wings he had very large lightcoloured sheepishlooking eyes and his eyebrows bent up like a couple of gothic arches leaving a narrow strip above them that formed the merest apology for a forehead this facial peculiarity had won for him the nickname of cejas eyebrows by which he was known to his intimates he spent most of his time strumming on a wretched old cracked guitar and singing amorous ballads in a lugubrious whining falsetto which reminded me not a little of that hungry complaining gull i had met at the estancia in durazno for though poor epifanio had an absorbing passion for music nature had unkindly withheld from him the power to express it in a manner pleasing to others i must however in justice to him allow that he gave a preference to ballads or compositions of a thoughtful not to say metaphysical character i took the trouble of translating the words of one literally and here they are      yesterday my senses opened     at a rapatap from reason     inspiring in me an intention     which i never had before     seeing that through all my days     my life has been just what it is     therefore when i rose i said     today shall be as yesterday     since reason tells me i have been     from day to day the selfsame thing  this is very little to judge from being only a fourth part of the song but it is a fair specimen and the rest is no clearer of course it is not to be supposed that epifanio claro an illiterate person took in the whole philosophy of these lines still it is probable that a subtle ray or two of their deep meaning touched his intellect to make him a wiser and a sadder man  accompanied by this strange individual and with the grave permission of the capatas who declined however in words of many syllables all responsabilidad in the matter we went out to the grazing grounds in quest of a promisinglooking cow very soon we found one to our liking she was followed by a small calf not more than a week old and her distended udder promised a generous supply of milk but unfortunately she was fiercetempered and had horns as sharp as needles  we will cut them by and by shouted eyebrows  he then lassoed the cow and i captured the calf and lifting it into the saddle before me started homewards the cow followed me at a furious pace and behind came claro at a swinging gallop possibly he was a little too confident and carelessly let his captive pull the line that held her anyhow she turned suddenly on him charged with amazing fury and sent one of her horrid horns deep into the belly of his horse he was however equal to the occasion first dealing her a smart blow on the nose which made her recoil for a moment he then severed the lasso with his knife and shouting to me to drop the calf made his escape we pulled up as soon as we had reached a safe distance claro drily remarking that the lasso had been borrowed and that the horse belonged to the estancia so that we had lost nothing he alighted and stitched up the great gash in the poor brutes belly using for a thread a few hairs plucked from its tail it was a difficult task or would have been so to me as he had to bore holes in the animals hide with his knifepoint but it seemed quite easy to him taking the remaining portion of the severed lasso he drew it round the hind and one of the fore feet of his horse and threw him to the ground with a dexterous jerk then binding him there performed the operations of sewing up the wound in about two minutes  will he live i asked  how can i tell he answered indifferently i only know that now he will be able to carry me home if he dies afterwards what will it matter  we then mounted and rode quietly home of course we were chaffed without mercy especially by the old negress who had foreseen all along she told us just how it would be one would have imagined to hear this old black creature talk that she looked on milkdrinking as one of the greatest moral offences man could be guilty of and that in this case providence had miraculously interposed to prevent us from gratifying our depraved appetites  eyebrows took it all very coolly  do not notice them he said to me the lasso was not ours the horse was not ours what does it matter what they say  the owner of the lasso who had goodnaturedly lent it to us roused himself on hearing this he was a very big roughlooking man his face covered with an immense shaggy black beard i had taken him for a goodhumoured specimen of the giant kind before but i now changed my opinion of him when his angry passions began to rise blas or barbudo as we called the giant was seated on a log sipping maté  perhaps you take me for a sheep sirs because you see me wrapped in skins he observed but let me tell you this the lasso i lent you must be returned to me  these words are not for us remarked eyebrows addressing me but for the cow that carried away his lasso on her hornscurse them for being so sharp  no sir returned barbudo do not deceive yourself they are not for the cow but for the fool that lassoed the cow and i promise you epifanio that if it is not restored to me this thatch over our heads will not be broad enough to shelter us both  i am pleased to hear it said the other for we are short of seats and when you leave us the one you now encumber with your carcass will be occupied by some more meritorious person  you can say what you like for no one has yet put a padlock on your lips said barbudo raising his voice to a shout but you are not going to plunder me and if my lasso is not restored to me then i swear i will make myself a new one out of a human hide  then said eyebrows the sooner you provide yourself with a hide for the purpose the better for i will never return the lasso to you for who am i to fight against providence that took it out of my hands  to this barbudo replied furiously  then i will have it from this miserable starved foreigner who comes here to learn to eat meat and put himself on an equality with men evidently he was weaned too soon but if the starveling hungers for infants food let him in future milk the cats that warm themselves beside the fire and can be caught without a lasso even by a frenchman  i could not endure the brutes insults and sprang up from my seat i happened to have a large knife in my hand for we were just preparing to make an assault on the roasted ribs of a cow and my first impulse was to throw down the knife and give him a blow with my fist had i attempted it i should most probably have paid dearly for my rashness the instant i rose barbudo was on me knife in hand he aimed a furious blow which luckily missed me and at the same moment i struck him and he reeled back with a dreadful gash on his face it was all done in a second of time and before the others could interpose in another moment they disarmed us and set about bathing the barbarians wound during the operation which i daresay was very painful for the old negress insisted on having the wound bathed with rum instead of water the brute blasphemed outrageously vowing that he would cut out my heart and eat it stewed with onions and seasoned with cummin seed and various other condiments  i have often since thought of that sublime culinary conception of blas the barbarian there must have been a spark of wild oriental genius in his bovine brains  when the exhaustion caused by rage pain and loss of blood had at length reduced him to silence the old negress turned on him exclaiming that he had been rightly punished for had he not in spite of her timely warnings lent his lasso to enable these two heretics for that is what she called us to capture a cow well his lasso was lost then his friends with the gratitude only to be expected from milkdrinkers had turned round and wellnigh killed him  after supper the capatas got me alone and with excessive friendliness of manner and an abundance of circumlocutory phrases advised me to leave the estancia as it would not be safe for me to remain i replied that i was not to blame having struck the man in selfdefence also that i had been sent to the estancia by a friend of the mayordomo and was determined to see him and give him my version of the affair  the capatas shrugged his shoulders and lit a cigarette  at length don policarpo returned and when i told him my story he laughed slightly but said nothing in the evening i reminded him of the subject of the letter i had brought from montevideo asking him whether it was his intention to give me some employment on the estancia  you see my friend he replied to employ you now would be useless however valuable your services might be for by this time the authorities will have information of your fight with blas in the course of a few days you may expect them here to make inquiries into that affair and it is probable that you and blas will both be taken into custody  what then would you advise me to do i asked  his answer was that when the ostrich asked the deer what he would advise him to do when the hunters appeared the deers reply was run away  i laughed at his pretty apologue and answered that i did not think the authorities would trouble themselves about mealso that i was not fond of running away  eyebrows who had hitherto been rather inclined to patronise me and take me under his protection now became very warm in his friendship which was however dashed with an air of deference when we were alone together but in company he was fond of parading his familiarity with me i did not quite understand this change of manner at first but by and by he took me mysteriously aside and became extremely confidential  do not distress yourself about barbudo he said he will never again presume to lift his hand against you and if you will only condescend to speak kindly to him he will be your humble slave and proud to have you wipe your greasy fingers on his beard take no notice of what the mayordomo says he also is afraid of you if the authorities take you it will only be to see what you can give them they will not keep you long for you are a foreigner and cannot be made to serve in the army but when you are again at liberty it will be necessary for you to kill someone very much amazed i asked him why you see he replied your reputation as a fighter is now established in this department and there is nothing men envy more it is the same as in our old game of pato where the man that carries the duck away is pursued by all the others and before they give up chasing him he must prove that he can keep what he has taken there are several fighters you do not know who have resolved to pick quarrels with you in order to try your strength in your next fight you must not wound but kill or you will have no peace i was greatly disturbed at this result of my accidental victory over bias the bearded and did not at all appreciate the kind of greatness my officious friend claro seemed so determined to thrust upon me it was certainly flattering to hear that i had already established my reputation as a good fighter in so warlike a department as paysandu but then the consequences entailed were disagreeable to say the least of it and so while thanking eyebrows for his friendly hint i resolved to quit the estancia at once i would not run away from the authorities since i was not an evildoer but from the necessity of killing people for the sake of peace and quietness i certainly would depart and early next morning to my friends intense disgust and without telling my plans to anyone i mounted my horse and quitted vagabonds rest to pursue my adventures elsewhere    chapter v  faith in the estancia as a field for my activities had been weak from the first the mayordomos words on his return had extinguished it altogether and after hearing that ostrich parable i had only remained from motives of pride i now determined to go back towards montevideo not however over the route i had come by but making a wide circuit into the interior of the country where i would explore a new field and perhaps meet with some occupation at one of the estancias on the way riding in a southwesterly direction towards the rio marlo in the tacuarembó department i soon left the plains of paysandù behind me and being anxious to get well away from a neighbourhood where i was expected to kill someone i did not rest till i had ridden about twentyfive miles at noon i stopped to get some refreshment at a little roadside pulpería it was a wretchedlooking place and behind the iron bars protecting the interior giving it the appearance of a wild beasts cage lounged the storekeeper smoking a cigar outside the bar were two men with englishlooking faces one was a handsome young fellow with a somewhat worn and dissipated look on his bronzed face he was leaning against the counter cigar in mouth looking slightly tipsy i thought and wore a large revolver slung ostentatiously at his waist his companion was a big heavy man with immense whiskers sprinkled with grey who was evidently very drunk for he was lying fulllength on a bench his face purple and swollen snoring loudly i asked for bread sardines and wine and careful to observe the custom of the country i was in duly invited the tipsy young man to join in the repast an omission of this courtesy might amongst proud and sensitive orientals involve one in a sanguinary quarrel and of quarrelling i had just then had enough  he declined with thanks and entered into conversation with me then the discovery quickly made that we were compatriots gave us both great pleasure he at once offered to take me to his house with him and gave a glowing account of the free jovial life he led in company with several other englishmensons of gentlemen every one of them he assured mewho had bought a piece of land and settled down to sheepfarming in this lonely district i gladly accepted the invitation and when we had finished our glasses he proceeded to wake the sleeper  hullo i say cap wake up old boy shouted my new friend quite time to go home dont you know thats rightup you come now let me introduce you to mr lamb im sure hes an acquisition what off again damn it old cloud thats unreasonable to say the least of it  at length after a great deal of shouting and shaking he succeeded in rousing his drunken companion who staggered up and stared at me in an imbecile manner  now let me introduce you said the other mr lamb my friend captain cloudesley wriothesley bravo steady old cocknow shake hands  the captain said nothing but took my hand swaying forwards as if about to embrace me we then with considerable difficulty got him on to his saddle and rode off together keeping him between us to prevent him from falling off half an hours ride brought us to my host mr vincent winchcombes house i had pictured to myself a charming little homestead buried in cool greenery and flowers and filled with pleasant memories of dear old england i was therefore grievously disappointed to find that his home was only a meanlooking rancho with a ditch round it protecting some ploughed or dugup ground on which not one green thing appeared mr winchcombe explained however that he had not yet had time to cultivate much only vegetables and such things dont you know he said  i dont see them i returned  well no we had a lot of caterpillars and blister beetles and things and they ate everything up dont you know said he  the room into which he conducted me contained no furniture except a large deal table and some chairs also a cupboard a long mantelpiece and some shelves against the walls on every available place were pipes pouches revolvers cartridgeboxes and empty bottles on the table were tumblers cups a sugarbasin a monstrous tin teapot and a demijohn which i soon ascertained was halffull of brazilian rum or caña round the table five men were seated smoking drinking tea and rum and talking excitedly all of them more or less intoxicated they gave me a hearty welcome making me join them at the table pouring out tea and rum for me and generously pushing pipes and pouches towards me  you see said mr winchcombe in explanation of this convivial scene there are altogether ten of us settlers here going in for sheepfarming and that sort of thing four of us have already built houses and bought sheep and horses the other six fellows live with us from house to house dont you know well weve made a jolly arrangementold cloudcaptain cloud dont you know first suggested itand it is that every day one of the fourthe glorious four we are calledkeeps open house and its considered the right thing for the other nine fellows to drop in on him some time during the day just to cheer him up a bit well we soon made the discoveryold cloud i fancy made itthat tea and rum were about the best things to have on these occasions today it was my day and tomorrow it will be some other fellows dont you know and by jove how lucky i was to meet you at the pulperia it will be ever so much jollier now  i had certainly not stumbled upon a charming little english paradise in this oriental wilderness and as it always makes me uncomfortable to see young men drifting into intemperate habits and making asses of themselves generally i was not rapturously delighted with old clouds system still i was glad to find myself with englishmen in this distant country and in the end i succeeded in making myself tolerably happy the discovery that i had a voice pleased them greatly and when somewhat excited from the effects of strong cavendish rum and black tea i roared out      and may his soul in heaven dwell     who first found out the leather botél  they all got up and drank my health in big tumblers and declared they would never let me leave the colony  before evening the guests departed all except the captain he had sat with us at the table but was too far gone in his cups to take part in the boisterous fun and conversation once in about every five minutes he had implored someone in a husky voice to give him a light for his pipe then after two or three ineffectual puffs he would let it go out again he had also attempted two or three times to join in the chorus of a song but soon relapsed again into his imbecile condition  next day however when he sat down refreshed by a nights sleep to breakfast i found him a very agreeable fellow he had no house of his own yet not having received his money from home he confidentially informed me but lived about breakfasting in one house dining in a second and sleeping in a third never mind he would say by and by it will be my turn then i will receive you all every day for six weeks to make it all square  none of the colonists did any work but all spent their time lounging about and visiting each other trying to make their dull existence endurable by perpetual smoking and tea and rum drinking they had tried they told me ostrichhunting visiting their native neighbours partridgeshooting horseracing etc but the partridges were too tame for them they could never catch the ostriches the natives didnt understand them and they had finally given up all these socalled amusements in each house a peon was kept to take care of the flock and to cook and as the sheep appeared to take care of themselves and the cooking merely meant roasting a piece of meat on a spit there was very little for the hired men to do  why dont you do these things for yourselves i innocently asked  i fancy it wouldnt quite be the right thing dont you know said mr winchcombe  no said the captain gravely we havent quite come down to that yet  i was greatly surprised to hear them i had seen englishmen sensibly roughing it in other places but the lofty pride of these ten rumdrinking gentlemen was quite a new experience to me  having spent a somewhat listless morning i was invited to accompany them to the house of mr bingley one of the glorious four mr bingley was really a very nice young fellow living in a house far more worthy of the name than the slovenly rancho tenanted by his neighbour winchcombe he was the favourite of the colonists having more money than the others and keeping two servants always on his receptionday he provided his guests with hot bread and fresh butter as well as with the indispensable rumbottle and teapot it therefore happened that when his turn came round to keep open house not one of the other nine colonists was absent from his table  soon after our arrival at bingleys the others began to appear each one on entering taking a seat at the hospitable board and adding another cloud to the dense volume of tobacco smoke obscuring the room there was a great deal of hilarious conversation songs were sung and a vast amount of tea rum bread and butter and tobacco consumed but it was a wearisome entertainment and by the time it was over i felt heartily sick of this kind of life  before separating after john peel had been sung with great enthusiasm someone proposed that we should get up a foxhunt in real english style everyone agreed glad of anything i suppose to break the monotony of such an existence and next day we rode out followed by about twenty dogs of various breeds and sizes brought together from all the houses after some searching about in the most likely places we at length started a fox from a bed of darkleafed miomio bushes he made straight away for a range of hills about three miles distant and over a beautifully smooth plain so that we had a very good prospect of running him down two of the hunters had provided themselves with horns which they blew incessantly while the others all shouted at the top of their lungs so that our chase was a very noisy one the fox appeared to understand his danger and to know that his only chance of escape lay in keeping up his strength till the refuge of the hills was reached suddenly however he changed his course this giving us a great advantage for by making a short cut we were all soon close at his heels with only the wide level plain before us but reynard had his reasons for what he did he had spied a herd of cattle and in a very few moments had overtaken and mixed with them the herd struck with terror at our shouts and hornblowing instantly scattered and flew in all directions so that we were able still to keep our quarry in sight far in advance of us the panic in the cattle ran on from herd to herd swift as light and we could see them miles away fleeing from us while their hoarse bellowings and thundering tread came borne by the wind faintly to our ears our fat lazy dogs ran no faster than our horses but still they laboured on cheered by incessant shouts and at last ran into the first fox ever properly hunted in the banda orientál  the chase which had led us far from home ended close to a large estancia house and while we stood watching the dogs worrying their victim to death the capatas of the establishment accompanied by three men rode out to inquire who we were and what we were doing he was a small dark native wearing a very picturesque costume and addressed us with extreme politeness  will you tell me señores what strange animal you have captured he asked  a fox shouted mr bingley triumphantly waving the brush which he had just cut off over his head in our countryin englandwe hunt the fox with dogs and we have been hunting after the manner of our country  the capatas smiled and replied that if we were disposed to join him it would afford him great pleasure to show us a hunt after the manner of the banda orientál  we consented gladly and mounting our horses set off at a swinging gallop after the capatas and his men we soon came to a small herd of cattle the capatas dashed after them and unloosening the coils of his lasso flung the noose dexterously over the horns of a fat heifer he had singled out then started homewards at a tremendous pace the cow urged forward by the men who rode close behind and pricked it with their knives rushed on bellowing with rage and pain trying to overtake the capatas who kept just out of reach of its horns and in this way we quickly reached the house one of the men now flung his lasso and caught the beasts hind leg pulled in two opposite directions it quickly came to a standstill the other men now dismounting first hamstrung then ran a long knife into its throat without removing the hide the carcass was immediately cut up and the choice pieces flung on to a great fire of wood which one of the men had been making in an hours time we all sat down to a feast of carne con cuero or meat roasted in the hide juicy tender and exquisitely flavoured i must tell the english reader who is accustomed to eat meat and game which has been kept till it is tender that before the tender stage is reached it has been permitted to get tough meat game included is never so tender or deliciously flavoured as when cooked and eaten immediately after it is killed compared with meat at any subsequent stage it is like a newlaid egg or a salmon with the cream on compared with an egg or a salmon after a weeks keeping  we enjoyed the repast immensely though captain cloud bitterly lamented that we had neither rum nor tea to wash it down when we had thanked our entertainer and were about to turn our horses heads homewards the polite capatas once more stepped out and addressed us  gentlemen he said whenever you feel disposed to hunt come to me and we will lasso and roast a heifer in the hide it is the best dish the republic has to offer the stranger and it will give me great pleasure to entertain you but i beg you will hunt no more foxes over the ground belonging to this estancia for you have caused so great a commotion amongst the cattle i am placed here in charge of that it will take my men two or three days to find them all and bring them back again  we gave the desired promise plainly perceiving that foxhunting in the english fashion is not a sport adapted to the oriental country then we rode back and spent the remaining hours at the house of mr girling of the glorious four drinking rum and tea smoking unlimited pipes of cavendish and talking over our hunting experience     chapter vi   i spent several days at the colony and i suppose the life i led there had a demoralising effect on me for unpleasant as it was every day i felt less inclined to break loose from it and sometimes i even thought seriously of settling down there myself this crazy idea however would usually come to me late in the day after a great deal of indulgence in rum and tea a mixture that would very soon drive any man mad  one afternoon at one of our convivial meetings it was resolved to pay a visit to the little town of tolosa about eighteen miles to the east of the colony next day we set out every man wearing a revolver slung at his waist and provided with a heavy poncho for covering for it was the custom of the colonists to spend the night at tolosa when they visited it we put up at a large publichouse in the centre of the miserable little town where there was accommodation for man and beast the last always faring rather better than the first i very soon discovered that the chief object of our visit was to vary the entertainment of drinking rum and smoking at the colony by drinking rum and smoking at tolosa the bibulous battle raged till bedtime when the only sober member of our party was myself for i had spent the greater part of the afternoon walking about talking to the townspeople in the hope of picking up some information useful to me in my search for occupation but the women and old men i met gave me little encouragement they seemed to be a rather listless set in tolosa and when i asked them what they were doing to make a livelihood they said they were waiting my fellowcountrymen and their visit to the town was the principal topic of conversation they regarded their english neighbours as strange and dangerous creatures who took no solid food but subsisted on a mixture of rum and gunpowder which was the truth and who were armed with deadly engines called revolvers invented specially for them by their father the devil the days experience convinced me that the english colony had some excuse forits existence since its periodical visits gave the good people of tolosa a little wholesome excitement during the stagnant intervals between the revolutions  at night we all turned into a large room with a clay floor in which there was not a single article of furniture our saddles rugs and ponchos had all been thrown together in a corner and anyone wishing to sleep had to make himself a bed with his own horsegear and toggery as best he could the experience was nothing new to me so i soon made myself a comfortable nest on the floor and pulling off my boots coiled myself up like an opossum that knows nothing better and is friendly with fleas my friends however were evidently bent on making a night of it and had taken care to provide themselves with three or four bottles of rum after conversation with an occasional song had been going on for some time one of thema mr chillingworthrose to his feet and demanded silence  gentlemen he said advancing into the middle of the room where by occasionally throwing out his arms to balance himself he managed to maintain a tolerably erect position i am going to make a whatdyecallit  furious cheers greeted this announcement while one of the hearers carried away with enthusiasm at the prospect of listening to his friends eloquence discharged his revolver at the roof scattering confusion amongst a legion of longlegged spiders that occupied the dusty cobwebs above our heads  i was afraid the whole town would be up in arms at our carryings on but they assured me that they all fired off their revolvers in that room and that nobody came near them as they were so well known in the town  gentlemen continued mr chillingworth when order had been at length restored ive been thinking thats what ive been doing now lets review the situation here we stand a colony of english gentlemen here we are dont you know far from our homes and country and all that sort of thing what says the poet i daresay some of you fellows remember the passage but what for i ask what gentlemen is the object of our being here thats just what im going to tell you dont you know we are here gentlemen to infuse a little of our anglosaxon energy and all that sort of thing into this dilapidated old tinpot of a nation  here the orator was encouraged by a burst of applause  now gentlemen he continued isnt it harddevilish hard dont you know that so little is made of us i feel iti feel it gentlemen our lives are being frittered away i dont know whether you fellows feel it you see we aint a melancholy lot were a glorious combination against the blue devils thats what we are only sometimes i feel dont you know that all the rum in the place cant quite kill them i cant help thinking of jolly days on the other side of the water now dont you fellows look at me as if you thought i was going to blubber im not going to make such a confounded ass of myself dont you know but what i want you fellows to tell me is this are we to go on all our lives making beasts of ourselves guzzling rumii beg your pardon gentlemen i didnt mean to say that really rum is about the only decent thing in this place rum keeps us alive if any man says a word against rum ill call him an infernal ass i meant to say the country gentlementhis rotten old country dont you know no cricket no society no bass no anything supposing we had gone to canada with ourour capital and energies wouldnt they have received us with open arms and whats the reception we get here now gentlemen what i propose is this lets protest lets get up a whatdyoucallit to the thing they call a government well state our case to the thing gentlemen and well insist on it and be very firm thats what well do dont you know are we to live amongst these miserable monkeys and give them the benefit of ourouryes gentlemen our capital and energies and get nothing in return no no we must let them know that we are not satisfied that we will be very angry with them thats about all i have to say gentlemen  loud applause followed during which the orator sat down rather suddenly on the floor then followed rule britannia everyone assisting with all the breath in his lungs to make night hideous  when the song was finished the loud snoring of captain wriothesley became audible he had begun to spread some rugs to lie on but becoming hopelessly entangled in his bridlereins surcingle and stirrupstraps had fallen to sleep with his feet on his saddle and his head on the floor  hallo we cant have this shouted one of the fellows lets wake old cloud by firing at the wall over him and knocking some plaster on to his head itll be awful fun you know  everybody was delighted with the proposal except poor chillingworth who after delivering his speech had crept away on all fours into a corner where he was sitting alone and looking very pale and miserable  the firing now began most of the bullets hitting the wall only a few inches above the recumbent captains head scattering dust and bits of plaster over his purple face i jumped up in alarm and rushed amongst them telling them in my haste that they were too drunk to hold their revolvers properly and would kill their friend  my interference raised a loud angry remonstrance in the midst of which the captain who was lying in a most uncomfortable position woke and struggling into a sitting posture stared vacantly at us his reins and straps wound like serpents about his neck and arms  whats all the row bout he demanded huskily getting up revlution i spose aright only thing to do in this country only dont ask me to be presdent nor good enough goo night boys dont cut my throat by mistake gor bless you all  no no dont go to sleep cloud they shouted lambs the cause of all this he says were drunkthats the way lamb repays our hospitality we were firing to wake you up old cap to have a drink  a drinkyes assented the captain hoarsely  and lamb was afraid we would injure you tell him old cloud whether youre afraid of your friends tell lamb what you think of his conduct  yes ill tell him returned the captain in his thick tones lamb shant interfere gentlemen but you know you took him in didnt you now and what was my opinion of him it wasnt right of you fellows was it now he couldnt be one of us you know could he now ill leave it to you gentlemen didnt i say the fellow was a cad why the devil doesnt he leave me alone then ill tell you what ill do with lamb ill punch his damned nose dont you know  and here the gallant gentleman attempted to rise but his legs refused to assist him and tumbling back against the wall he was only able to glare at me out of his watery eyes  i went up to him intending i suppose to punch his nose but suddenly changing my mind i merely picked up my saddle and things then left the room with a hearty curse on captain cloudesley wriothesley the evil genius drunk or sober of the colony of english gentlemen i was no sooner outside the door than the joy they felt at being rid of me was expressed in loud shouts clapping of hands and a general discharge of firearms into the roof  i spread my rugs out of doors and soliloquised myself to sleep and so ends said i fixing my somewhat drowsy eyes on the constellation of orion adventure the second or twentysecondlittle does it matter about the exact number of them since they all alike end in smokerevolver smokeor a flourish of knives and the shaking of dust from off my feet and perhaps at this very moment paquíta roused from light slumbers by the droning cry of the nightwatchman under her window puts out her arms to feel me and sighs to find my place still vacant what must i say to her that i must change my name to ernandes or fernandes or blas or chas or sandariaga gorostiaga madariaga or any other aga and conspire to overthrow the existing order of things there is nothing else for me to do since this oriental world is indeed an oyster only a sharp sword will serve to open as for arms and armies and military training all that is quite unnecessary one has only got to bring together a few ragged dissatisfied men and taking horse charge pellmell into poor mr chillingworths dilapidated old tinpot i almost feel like that unhappy gentleman tonight ready to blubber but after all my position is not quite so hopeless as his i have no brutalised purplenosed briton sitting like a nightmare on my chest pressing the life out of me  the shouts and choruses of the revellers grew fainter and fewer and had almost ceased when i sank to sleep lulled by a solitary tipsy voice droning out in a lugubrious key    we wont gohome till morning     chapter vii   early next morning i left tolosa and travelled the whole day in a southwesterly direction i did not hurry but frequently dismounted to give my horse a sip of clear water and a taste of green herbage i also called during the day at three or four estancia houses but failed to hear anything that could be advantageous to me in this way i covered about thirtyfive miles of road going always towards the eastern part of the florida district in the heart of the country about an hour before sunset i resolved to go no farther that day and i could not have hoped to find a nicer restingplace than the one now before mea neat rancho with a wide corridor supported by wooden pillars standing amidst a bower of fine old weepingwillows it was a calm sunshiny afternoon peace and quiet resting on everything even bird and insect for they were silent or uttered only soft subdued notes and that modest lodge with its rough stone walls and thatched roof seemed to be in harmony with it all it looked like the home of simpleminded pastoral people that had for their only world the grassy wilderness watered by many clear streams bounded ever by that faroff unbroken ring of the horizon and arched over with blue heaven starry by night and filled by day with sweet sunshine  on approaching the house i was agreeably disappointed at having no pack of loudmouthed ferocious dogs rushing forth to rend the presumptuous stranger to pieces a thing one always expects the only signs of life visible were a whitehaired old man seated within the corridor smoking and a few yards from it a young girl standing under a willowtree but that girl was a picture for one to gaze long upon and carry about in his memory for a lifetime never had i beheld anything so exquisitely beautiful it was not that kind of beauty so common in these countries which bursts upon you like the sudden southwest wind called pampero almost knocking the breath out of your body then passing as suddenly away leaving you with hair ruffled up and mouth full of dust its influence was more like that of the spring wind which blows softly scarcely fanning your cheek yet infusing through all your system a delicious magical sensation likelike nothing else in earth or heaven she was i fancy about fourteen years old slender and graceful in figure and with a marvellously clear white skin on which this bright oriental sun had not painted one freckle her features were i think the most perfect i have ever seen in any human being and her golden brown hair hung in two heavy braids behind almost to her knees as i approached she looked up to me out of sweet greyblue eyes there was a bashful smile on her lips but she did not move or speak on the willowbranch over her head were two young doves they were it appeared her pets unable yet to fly and she had placed them there the little things had crept up just beyond her reach and she was trying to get them by pulling the branch down towards her  leaving my horse i came to her side  i am tall señorita i said and can perhaps reach them  she watched me with anxious interest while i gently pulled her birds from their perch and transferred them to her hands then she kissed them wellpleased and with a gentle hesitation in her manner asked me in  under the corridor i made the acquaintance of her grandfather the whitehaired old man and found him a person it was very easy to get on with for he agreed readily with everything i said indeed even before i could get a remark out he began eagerly assenting to it there too i met the girls mother who was not at all like her beautiful daughter but had black hair and eyes and a brown skin as most spanishamerican women have evidently the father is the whiteskinned goldenhaired one i thought when the girls brother came in by and by he unsaddled my horse and led him away to pasture this boy was also dark darker even than his mother  the simple spontaneous kindness with which these people treated me had a flavour about it the like of which i have seldom experienced elsewhere it was not the common hospitality usually shown to a stranger but a natural unstrained kindness such as they might be expected to show to a beloved brother or son who had gone out from them in the morning and was now returned  by and by the girls father came in and i was extremely surprised to find him a small wrinkled dark specimen with jetblack beadlike eyes and podgy nose showing plainly enough that he had more than a dash of aboriginal charrua blood in his veins this upset my theory about the girls fair skin and blue eyes the little dark man was however quite as sweettempered as the others for he came in sat down and joined in the conversation just as if i had been one of the family whom he had expected to find there while i talked to these good people on simple pastoral matters all the wickedness of orientalsthe throatcutting war of whites and reds and the unspeakable cruelties of the ten years siegewere quite forgotten i wished that i had been born amongst them and was one of them not a weary wandering englishman overburdened with the arms and armour of civilisation and staggering along like atlas with the weight of a kingdom on which the sun never sets on his shoulders  by and by this good man whose real name i never discovered for his wife simply called him batata sweet potato looking critically at his pretty girl remarked why have you decked yourself out like this my daughterit is not a saints day  his daughter indeed i mentally ejaculated she is more like the daughter of the evening star than of such a man but his words were unreasonable to say the least of it for the sweet child whose name was margarita though wearing shoes had no stockings on while her dressvery clean certainlywas a cotton print so faded that the pattern was quite undistinguishable the only pretence of finery of any description was a narrow bit of blue ribbon tied about her lilywhite neck and yet had she been wearing richest silks and costliest gems she could not have blushed and smiled with a prettier confusion  we are expecting uncle anselmo this evening papita she replied  leave the child batata said the mother you know what a craze she has for anselmo when he comes she is always prepared to receive him like a queen  this was really almost too much for me and i was powerfully tempted to jump up and embrace the whole family on the spot how sweet was this primitive simplicity of mind here doubtless was the one spot on the wide earth where the golden age still lingered appearing like the last beams of the setting sun touching some prominent spot when elsewhere all things are in shadow ah why had fate led me into this sweet arcadia since i must presently leave it to go back to the dull world of toil and strife      that vain low strife     which makes men mad the tug for wealth and power     the passions and the cares that wither life     and waste its little hour  had it not been for the thought of paquíta waiting for me over there in montevideo i could have said o good friend sweet potato and good friends all let me remain for ever with you under this roof sharing your simple pleasures and wishing for nothing better forget that great crowded world where all men are striving to conquer nature and death and to win fortune until having wasted their miserable lives in their vain endeavours they drop down and the earth is shovelled over them  shortly after sunset the expected anselmo arrived to spend the night with his relations and scarcely had he got down from his horse before margarita was at his side to ask the avuncular blessing at the same time raising his hand to her delicate lips he gave his blessing touching her golden hair then she lifted her face bright with new happiness  anselmo was a fine specimen of the oriental gaucho dark and with good features his hair and moustache intensely black he wore costly clothes while his whiphandle the sheath of his long knife and other things about him were of massive silver of silver also were his heavy spurs the pommel of his saddle his stirrups and the headstall of his bridle he was a great talker never in fact in the whole course of my varied experience have i encountered anyone who could pour out such an incessant stream of talk about small matters as this man we all sat together in the social kitchen sipping maté i taking little part in the conversation which was all about horses scarcely even listening to what the others were saying reclining against the wall i occupied myself agreeably watching the sweet face of margarita which in her happy excitement had become suffused with a delicate rosy colour i have always had a great love for the beautiful sunsets wild flowers especially verbenas so prettily called margaritas in this country and beyond everything the rainbow spanning the vast gloomy heavens with its green and violet arch when the stormcloud passes eastward over the wet sunflushed earth all these things have a singular fascination for my soul but beauty when it presents itself in the human form is even more than these things there is in it a magnetic power drawing my heart a something that is not love for how can a married man have a feeling like that towards anyone except his wife no it is not love but a sacred ethereal kind of affection resembling love only as the fragrance of violets resembles the taste of honey and the honeycomb  at length some time after supper margarita to my sorrow rose to retire though not without first once more asking her uncles blessing after her departure from the kitchen finding that the inexhaustible talkingmachine anselmo was still holding forth fresh as ever i lit a cigar and prepared to listen     chapter viii   when i began to listen it was a surprise to find that the subject of conversation was no longer the favourite one of horseflesh which had held undisputed sway the whole evening uncle anselmo was just now expatiating on the merits of gin a beverage for which he confessed to a special liking  gin is without doubt said he the flower of all strong drinks i have always maintained that it is incomparable and for this reason i always keep a little of it in the house in a stone bottle for when i have taken my maté in the morning and after it one or two or three or four sips of gin i saddle my horse and go out with a tranquil stomach feeling at peace with the whole world  well sirs it happened that on the morning in question i noticed that there was very little gin left in the bottle for though i could not see how much it contained owing to its being of stone and not of glass i judged from the manner in which i had to tip it upwards when pouring it out in order to remember that i had to bring home some with me that day i tied a knot in my handkerchief then mounting my horse i rode out towards the side on which the sun sets little expecting that anything unusual was going to happen to me that day but thus it often is for no man however learned he may be and able to read the almanac can tell what a day will bring forth  anselmo was so outrageously prosy i felt strongly inclined to go to bed to dream of beautiful margarita but politeness forbade and i was also somewhat curious to hear what extraordinary thing had happened to him on that very eventful day  it fortunately happened continued anselmo that i had that morning saddled the best of my creamnoses for on that horse i could say without fear of contradiction i am on horseback and not on foot i called him chingolo a name which manuel also called the fox gave him because he was a young horse of promise able to fly with his rider manuel had nine horsescreamnoses every oneand how from being manuels they came to be mine i will tell you he poor man had just lost all his money at cardsperhaps the money he lost was not much but how he came to have any was a mystery to many to me however it was no mystery and when my cattle were slaughtered and had their hides stripped off by night perhaps i could have gone to justicefeeling like a blind man for something in the wrong placeand led her in the direction of the offenders house but when one has it in his power to speak knowing at the same time that his words will fall like a thunderbolt out of a blue sky upon a neighbours dwelling consuming it to ashes and killing all within it why sirs in such a case the good christian prefers to hold his peace for what has one man more than another that he should put himself in the place of providence we are all of flesh true some of us are only dogs flesh fit for nothing but to all of us the lash is painful and where it rains blood will sprout this i say but remember i say not that manuel the fox robbed mefor i would sully no mans reputation even a robbers or have anyone suffer on my account  well sirs to go back to what i was saying manuel lost everything then his wife fell ill with fever and what was there left for him but to turn his horses into money in this way it came about that i bought the creamnoses and paid him fifty dollars for them true the horses were young and sound nevertheless it was a great price and i paid it not without first weighing the matter well in my own mind for in things of this nature if a person makes not his reckoning beforehand where let me ask sirs will he find himself at the years end the devil will take him with all the cattle he inherited from his fathers or got together by his own proper abilities and industry  for you see the thing is this i have a poor head for figures all other kinds of knowledge come easy to me but how to calculate readily has never yet found an entrance into my head at the same time whenever i find it impossible to make out my accounts or settle what to do i have only to take the matter to bed with me and lie awake thinking it over for when i do that i rise next morning feeling free and refreshed like a man that has just eaten a watermelon for what i have to do and how it is to be done is all as plain to my sight as this matécup i hold in my hand  in this difficulty i therefore resolved to take the subject of the horses to bed with me and to say here i have you and you shall not escape from me but about suppertime manuel came in to molest me and sat in the kitchen with a sad face like a prisoner under sentence of death  if providence is angry against the entire human race said he and is anxious to make an example i know not for what reason so harmless and obscure a person as i am should have been selected  what would you have manuel i replied wise men tell us that providence sends us misfortunes for our good  true i agree with you he said it is not for me to doubt it for what can be said of that soldier who finds fault with the measures of his commander but you know anselmo the man i am and it is bitter that these troubles should fall on one who has never offended except in being always poor  the vulture said i ever preys on the weak and ailing  first i lose everything he continued then this woman must fall ill of a calenture and now i am forced to believe that even my credit is gone since i cannot borrow the money i require those who knew me best have suddenly become strangers  when a man is down said i the very dogs will scratch up the dust against him  true said manuel and since these calamities fell on me what has become of the friendships that were so many for nothing has a worse smell or stinks more than poverty so that all men when they behold it cover up their faces or fly from such a pestilence  you speak the truth manuel i returned but say not all men for who knowsthere being so many souls in the worldwhether you may not be doing injustice to someone  i say it not of you he replied on the contrary if any person has had compassion on me it is you and this i say not in your presence only but publicly proclaim it to all men  words only were these and now he continued my cards oblige me to part with my horses for money therefore i come this evening to learn your decision  manuel said i i am a man of few words as you know and straightforward therefore you need not have used compliments and before saying this to have said so many things for in this you do not treat me as a friend  you say well he replied but i love not to dismount before checking my horse and taking my toes from the stirrups  that is only as it should be said i nevertheless when you come to a friends house you need not alight at such a distance from the gate  for what you say i thank you he answered my faults are more numerous than the spots on the wild cat but not amongst them is precipitancy  that is what i like said i for i do not love to go about like a drunk man embracing strangers but our acquaintance is not of yesterday for we have looked into and know each other even to the bowels and to the marrow in the bones why then should we meet as strangers since we have never had a difference or any occasion to speak ill of each other  and how should we speak ill replied manuel since it has never entered into either of us even in a dream to do the other an injury some there are who loving me badly would blow up your head like a bladder with lies if they could laying i know not what things to my charge whenheaven knowsthey themselves are perhaps the authors of all they so readily blame me for  if you speak said i of the cattle i have lost trouble not yourself about such trifles for if those who speak evil of you only because they themselves are evil were listening they might say this man begins to defend himself when no one has so much as thought of drawing against him  true there is nothing they will not say of me said manuel therefore i am dumb for nothing is to be gained by speaking they have already judged me and no man wishes to be made a liar  as for me i said i never doubted you knowing you to be a man honest sober and diligent if in anything you had given offence i should have told you of it so great is my frankness towards all men  all that you tell me i firmly believe said he for i know that you are not one that wears a mask like others therefore relying on your great openness in all things i come to you about these horses for i love not dealing with those who shake you out a whole bushel of chaff for every grain of corn  but manuel said i you know that i am not made of gold and that the mines of peru were not left to me for an inheritance you ask a high price for your horses  i do not deny it he replied but you are not one to stop your ears against reason and poverty when they speak my horses are my only wealth and happiness and i have no glory but them  frankly then i answered tomorrow i will tell you yes or no  let it be as you say but friend if you will close with me tonight i will abate something from the price  if you wish to abate anything said i let it be tomorrow for i have accounts to make up tonight and a thousand things to think of  after that manuel got on to his horse and rode away it was black and rainy but he had never needed moon or lantern to find what he sought by night whether his own house or a fat cowalso his own perhaps  then i went to bed the first question i asked myself when i had blown out the candle was are there fat wethers enough in my flock to pay for the creamnoses then i asked how many fat wethers will it take at the price don sebastiana miserly cheat be it said in passingoffers me a head for them to make up the amount i require  that was the question but you see friends i could not answer it at length about midnight i resolved to light the candle and get an ear of maize for by putting the grains into small heaps each heap the price of a wether then counting the whole i could get to know what i wanted  the idea was good i was feeling under my pillow for the matches to strike a light when i suddenly remembered that all the grain had been given to the poultry no matter said i to myself i have been spared the trouble of getting out of bed for nothing why it was only yesterday said i still thinking about the maize that pascuala the cook said to me when she put my dinner before me master when are you going to buy some grain for the fowls how can you expect the soup to be good when there is not even an egg to put in it then there is the black cock with the twisted toeone of the second brood the spotted hen raised last summer though the foxes carried off no less than three hens from the very bushes where she was sittinghe has been going round with drooping wings all day so that i verily believe he is going to have the pip and if any epidemic comes amongst the fowls as there was in neighbour gumesindas the year before last you may be sure it will only be for want of corn and the strangest thing is and it is quite true though you may doubt it for neighbour gumesinda told me only yesterday when she came to ask me for some parsley because as you know very well her own was all rooted up when the pigs broke into her garden last october well sir she says the epidemic which swept off twentyseven of her best fowls in one week began by a black cock with a broken toe just like ours beginning to droop its wings as if it had the pip  may all the demons take this woman i cried throwing down the spoon i had been using with her chatter about eggs and pip and neighbour gumesinda and i know not what besides do you think i have nothing to do but to gallop about the country looking for maize when it is not to be had for its weight in gold at this season and all because a sickly spotted hen is likely to have the pip  i have said no such thing retorted pascuala raising her voice as women do either you are not paying proper attention to what i am telling you or you pretend not to understand me for i never said the spotted hen was likely to have the pip and if she is the fattest fowl in all this neighbourhood you may thank me after the virgin for it as neighbour gumesinda often says for i never fail to give her chopped meat three times a day and that is why she is never out of the kitchen so that even the cats are afraid to come into the house for she flies like a fury into their faces but you are always laying hold of my words by the heels and if i said anything at all about pip it was not the spotted hen but the black cock with the twisted toe i said was likely to have it  to the devil with your cock and your hen i shouted rising in haste from my chair for my patience was all gone and the woman was driving me crazy with her story of a twisted toe and what neighbour gumesinda said and may all the curses fall on that same woman who is always full as a gazette of her neighbours affairs i know well what the parsley is she comes to gather in my garden it is not enough that she goes about the country giving importance to the couplets i sang to montenegros daughter when i danced with her at cousin teodoros dance after the cattlemarking when heaven knows i never cared the blue end of a fingernail for that girl but things have now come to a pretty pass when even a chicken with a broken toe cannot be indisposed in my house without neighbour gumesinda thrusting her beak into the matter  such anger did i feel at pascuala when i remembered these things and other things besides for there is no end to that womans tongue that i could have thrown the dish of meat at her head  just then while occupied with these thoughts i fell asleep next morning i got up and without beating my head any more i bought the horses and paid manuel his price for there is in me this excellent gift when i am puzzled in mind and in doubt about anything night makes everything plain to me and i rise refreshed and with my determination formed  here ended anselmos story without one word about those marvellous matters he had set out to tell they had all been clean forgotten he began to make a cigarette and fearing that he was about to launch forth on some fresh subject i hastily bade good night and retreated to my bed     chapter ix   early next morning anselmo took his departure but i was up in time to say goodbye to the worthy spinner of interminable yarns leading to nothing i was in fact engaged in performing my morning ablutions in a large wooden bucket under the willows when he placed himself in the saddle then after carefully arranging the drapery of his picturesque garments he trotted gently away the picture of a man with a tranquil stomach and at peace with the whole world even neighbour gumesinda included  i had spent a somewhat restless night strange to say for my hospitable hostess had provided me with a deliciously soft bed a very unusual luxury in the banda orientál and when i plunged into it there were no hungry bedfellows waiting my advent within its mysterious folds i thought about the pastoral simplicity of the lives and character of the good people slumbering near me and that inconsequent story of anselmos about manuel and pascuala caused me to laugh several times finally my thoughts which had been roaming around in a wild uncertain manner like rooks blown about the windy skies settled quietly down to the consideration of that beautiful anomaly that mystery of mysteries the whitefaced margarita for how in the name of heredity had she got there whence that pearly skin and lithesome form the proud sweet mouth the nose that phidias might have taken for a model the clear spiritual sapphire eyes and the wealth of silky hair that if unbound would cover her as with a garment of surpassing beauty with such a problem vexing my curious brain what sleep could a philosopher get  when batata saw me making preparations for departure he warmly pressed me to stay to breakfast i consented at once for after all the more leisurely one does a thing the sooner will it be accomplishedespecially in the banda orientál one breakfasts here at noon so that i had plenty of time to see and renew my pleasure in seeing pretty margarita  in the course of the morning we had a visitor a traveller who arrived on a tired horse and who slightly knew my host batata having i was told called at the house on former occasions marcos marcó was his name a tall sallowfaced individual about fifty years old slightly grey very dirty and wearing threadbare gaucho garments he had a slouching gait and manner and a patient waiting hungry animal expression of face very very keen were his eyes and i detected him several times watching me narrowly  leaving this oriental tramp in conversation with batata who with misplaced kindness had offered to provide him with a fresh horse i went out for a walk before breakfast during my walk which was along a tiny stream at the foot of the hill on which the house stood i found a very lovely bellshaped flower of a delicate rosecolour i plucked it carefully and took it back with me thinking it just possible that i might give it to margarita should she happen to be in the way on my return to the house i found the traveller sitting by himself under the corridor engaged in mending some portion of his dilapidated horsegear and sat down to have a chat with him a clever bee will always be able to extract honey enough to reward him from any flower and so i did not hesitate tackling this outwardly very unpromising subject  and so you are an englishman he remarked after we had had some conversation and i of course replied in the affirmative  what a strange thing he said and you are fond of gathering pretty flowers he continued with a glance at my treasure  all flowers are pretty i replied  but surely señor some are prettier than others perhaps you have observed a particularly pretty one growing in these partsthe white margarita  margarita is the oriental vernacular for verbena the fragrant white variety is quite common in the country so that i was justified in ignoring the fellows rather impudent meaning assuming as wooden an expression as i could i replied yes i have often observed the flower you speak of it is fragrant and to my mind surpasses in beauty the scarlet and purple varieties but you must know my friend that i am a botanistthat is a student of plantsand they are all equally interesting to me  this astonished him and pleased with the interest he appeared to take in the subject i explained in simple language the principles on which a classification of plants is founded telling him about that lingua franca by means of which all the botanists in the world of all nations are able to converse together about plants from this somewhat dry subject i launched into the more fascinating one of the physiology of plants now look at this i continued and with my penknife i carefully dissected the flower in my hand for it was evident that i could not now give it to margarita without exposing myself to remarks i then proceeded to explain to him the beautiful complex structure by means of which this campanula fertilises itself  he listened in wonder exhausting all the spanish and oriental equivalents of such expressions as dear me how extraordinary lawks a mussy you dont say so i finished my lecture satisfied that my superior intellect had baffled the rude creature then tossingaway the fragments of the flower i had sacrificed i restored the penknife to my pocket  these are matters we do not often hear about in the banda orientál he said but the english know everythingeven the secrets of a flower they are also able to do most things did you ever sir botanist take part in acting a comedy  after all i had wasted my flower and scientific knowledge on the animal for nothing yes i have i replied rather angrily then suddenly remembering eyebrows teaching i added and in tragedy also  is that so he exclaimed how amused the spectators must have been well we can all have our fill of fighting presently for i see the white flower coming this way to tell us that breakfast is ready batatas roast beef will give something for our knives to do i only wish we had one of his own floury namesakes to eat with it  i swallowed my resentment and when margarita came to us looked up into her matchless face with a smile then rose to follow her into the kitchen     chapter x   after breakfast i bade a reluctant goodbye to my kind entertainers took a last longing lingering look at lovely margarita and mounted my horse scarcely was i in the saddle before marcos marcó who was also about to resume his journey on the fresh horse he had borrowed remarked  you are travelling to montevideo good friend i am also going in that direction and will take you the shortest way  the road will show me the way i rejoined curtly  the road he said is like a lawsuit roundabout full of puddles and pitfalls and long to travel it is only meant to be used by old halfblind men and drivers of bullockcarts  i hesitated about accepting the guidance of this strange fellow who appeared to have a ready wit under his heavyslouching exterior the mixed contempt and humility in his speech every time he addressed me gave me an uncomfortable sensation then his povertystricken appearance and his furtive glances filled me with suspicion i looked at my host who was standing near thinking to take my cue from the expression of his face but it was only a stolid oriental face that revealed nothing an ancient rule in whist is to play trumps when in doubt now my rule of action is when two courses are open to me and i am in doubt to take the bolder one acting on this principle i determined to go with marcos and accordingly we rode forth together  my guide soon struck away acrosscountry leading me wide of the public road through such lonely places that i at length began to suspect him of some sinister design against my person since i had no property worth taking presently he surprised me by saying you were right my young friend in casting away idle fears when you accepted my company why do you let them return to trouble your peace men of your blood have never inflicted injuries on me that cry out for vengeance can i make myself young again by shedding your life or would there be any profit in changing these rags i now wear for your garments which are also dusty and frayed no no sir englishman this dress of patience and suffering and exile my covering by day and my bed by night must soon be changed for brighter garments than you are wearing  this speech relieved me sensibly and i smiled at the poor devils ambitious dream of wearing a soldiers greasy red jacket for i supposed that that was what his words meant still his shortest way to montevideo continued to puzzle me considerably for two or three hours we had been riding nearly parallel to a range of hills or cuchilla extending away on our left hand towards the southeast but we were gradually drawing nearer to it and apparently going purposely out of our way only to traverse a most lonely and difficult country the few estancia houses we passed perched on the highest points of the great sweep of moorlike country on our right appeared to be very far away where we rode there were no habitations not even a shepherds hovel the dry stony soil was thinly covered with a forest of dwarf thorntrees and a scanty pasturage burnt to a rustbrown colour by the summer heats and out of this arid region rose the hills their brown woodless sides looking strangely gaunt and desolate in the fierce noonday sun  pointing to the open country on our right where the blue gleam of a river was visible i said my friend i assure you i fear nothing but i cannot understand why you keep near these hills when the valley over there would have been pleasanter for ourselves and easier for our horses  i do nothing without a reason he said with a strange smile the water you see over there is the rio de las canas river of grey hairs and those who go down into its valley grow old before their time  occasionally talking but oftener silent we jogged on till about three oclock in the afternoon when suddenly as we were skirting a patch of scraggy woodland a troop of six armed men emerged from it and wheeling about came directly towards us a glance was enough to tell us that they were soldiers or mounted policemen scouring the country in search of recruits or in other words of deserters skulking criminals and vagabonds of all descriptions i had nothing to fear from them but an exclamation of rage escaped my companions lips and turning to him i perceived that his face was of the whiteness of ashes i laughed for revenge is sweet and i still smarted a little at his contemptuous treatment of me earlier in the day  is your fear so great i said  you do not know what you say boy he returned fiercely when you have passed through as much hellfire as i have and have rested as sweetly with a corpse for a pillow you will learn to curb your impertinent tongue when you address a man  an angry retort was on my lips but a glance at his face prevented me from uttering itit was in its expression the face of a wild animal worried by dogs  in another moment the men had cantered up to us and one their commander addressing me asked to see my passport  i carry no passport i replied my nationality is a sufficient protection for i am an englishman as you can see  we have only your word for that said the man there is an english consul in the capital who provides english subjects with passports for their protection in this country if you have not got one you must suffer for it and no one but yourself is to blame i see in you only a young man complete in all his members and of such the republic is in need your speech is also like that of one who came into the world under this sky you must go with us  i shall do nothing of the sort i returned  do not say such a thing master said marcos astonishing me very much with the change in his tone and manner you know i warned you a month ago that it was imprudent to leave montevideo without our passports this officer is only obeying the orders he has received still he might see that we are only what we represent ourselves to be  oh exclaimed the officer turning to marcos you are also an englishman unprovided with a passport i suppose you might at least have supplied yourself with a couple of blue crockery eyes and a yellow beard for your greater safety  i am only a poor son of the soil said marcos meekly this young englishman is looking for an estancia to buy and i came as his attendant from the capital we were very careless not to get our passports before starting  then of course this young man has plenty of money in his pocket said the officer  i did not relish the lies marcos had taken upon himself to tell about me but did not quite know what the consequences of contradicting them might be i therefore replied that i was not so foolish as to travel in a country like the banda orientál with money on my person to pay for bread and cheese till i reach my destination is about as much as i have i added  the government of this country is a generous one said the officer sarcastically and will pay for all the bread and cheese you will require it will also provide you with beef you must now come with me to the juzgado de las cuevas both of you  seeing no help for it we accompanied our captors at a swinging gallop over a rough undulating country and in about an hour and a half reached las cuevas a dirty miserablelooking village composed of a few ranchos built round a large plaza overgrown with weeds on one side stood the church on the other a square stone building with a flagstaff before it this was the official building of the juez de paz or rural magistrate just now however it was closed and with no sign of life about it except an old deadandalivelooking man sitting against the closed door with his bare mahoganycoloured legs stretched out in the hot sunshine  this is a very fine thing exclaimed the officer with a curse i feel very much inclined to let the men go  you will lose nothing by doing so except perhaps a headache said marcos  hold your tongue till your advice is asked retorted the officer thoroughly out of temper  lock them up in the calaboso till the juez comes tomorrow lieutenant suggested the old man by the door speaking through a bushy white beard and a cloud of tobaccosmoke  do you not know that the door is broken old fool said the officer lock them up here i am neglecting my own affairs to serve the state and this is how i am treated we must now take them to the juez at his own house and let him look after them come on boys  we were then conducted out of las cuevas to a distance of about two miles where the señor juez resided in the bosom of his family his private residence was a very dirty neglectedlooking estancia house with a great many dogs fowls and children about we dismounted and were immediately taken into a large room where the magistrate sat at a table on which lay a great number of papersgoodness knows what they were about the juez was a little hatchetfaced man with bristly grey whiskers standing out like a cats moustache and angry eyesor rather with one angry eye for over the other a cotton handkerchief was tied no sooner had we all entered than a hen leading a brood of a dozen halfgrown chickens rushed into the room after us the chickens instantly distributing themselves about the floor in quest of crumbs while the mother more ambitious flew on the table scattering the papers right and left with the wind she created  a thousand demons take the fowls cried the juez starting up in a fury man go and bring your mistress here this instant i command her to come  this order was obeyed by the person who had ushered us in a greasylooking swarthyfaced individual in threadbare military clothes and in two or three minutes he returned followed by a very fat slatternly woman looking very goodtempered however who immediately subsided quite exhausted into a chair  what is it fernando she panted  what is it how can you have the courage to ask such a question toribia look at the confusion your pestilent fowls are creating amongst my paperspapers that concern the safety of the republic woman what measures are you going to take to stop this before i have your fowls all killed on the spot  what can i do fernandothey are hungry i suppose i thought you wanted to ask my advice about these prisonerspoor fellows and here you are with your hens  her placid manner acted like oil on the fire of his wrath he stormed about the room kicking over chairs and hurling rulers and paperweights at the birds apparently with the most deadly intentions but with shockingly bad aimshouting shaking his fist at his wife and even threatening to commit her for contempt of court when she laughed at last after a great deal of trouble the fowls were all got out and the servant placed to guard the door with strict orders to decapitate the first chicken that should attempt to enter and disturb the proceedings  order being restored the juez lit a cigarette and began to smooth his ruffled feathers proceed he said to the officer from his seat at the table  sir said the officer in pursuance of my duty i have taken in charge these two strangers who are unprovided with passports or documents of any description to corroborate their statements according to their story the young man is an english millionaire going about the country buying up estates while the other man is his servant there are twentyfive reasons for disbelieving their story but i have not sufficient time to impart them to you now having found the doors of the juzgado closed i have brought these men here with great inconvenience to myself and i am now only waiting to have this business despatched without further delay so that i may have a little time left to devote to my private affairs  address not me in this imperative manner sir officer exclaimed the juez his anger blazing out afresh do you imagine sir that i have no private interests that the state feeds and clothes my wife and children no sir i am the servant of the republic not the slave and i beg to remind you that official business must be transacted during the proper hours and at the proper place  sir juez said the officer it is my opinion that a civil magistrate ought never to have any part in matters which more properly come under the military authorities however since these things are differently arranged and i am compelled to come with my reports to you in the first place i am only here to know without entering into any discussion concerning your position in the republic what is to be done with these two prisoners i have brought before you  done with them send them to the devil cut their throats let them go do what you like since you are responsible not i and be sure sir officer i shall not fail to report your insubordinate language to your superiors  your threats do not alarm me said the officer for one cannot be guilty of insubordination towards a person one is not bound to obey and now sirs he added turning to us i have been advised to release you you are free to continue your journey  marcos rose with alacrity  man sit down yelled the irate magistrate and poor marcos thoroughly crestfallen sat down again sir lieutenant continued the fierce old man you are dismissed from further attendance here the republic you profess to serve would perhaps be just as well off without your valuable aid go sir to attend to your private affairs and leave your men here to execute my commands  the officer rose and having made a profound and sarcastic bow turned on his heel and left the room  take these two prisoners to the stocks continued the little despot i will examine them tomorrow  marcos was first marched out of the room by two of the soldiers for it happened that an outhouse on the place was provided with the usual wooden arrangement to make captives secure for the night but when the other men took me by the arms i recovered from the astonishment the magistrates order had produced in me and shook them roughly aside señor juez i said addressing him let me beg you to consider what you are doing surely my accent is enough to satisfy any reasonable person that i am not a native of this country i am willing to remain in your custody or to go wherever you like to send me but your men shall tear me to pieces before making me suffer the indignity of the stocks if you maltreat me in any way i warn you that the government you serve will only censure and perhaps ruin you for your imprudent zeal  before he could reply his fat spouse who had apparently taken a great fancy to me interposed on my behalf and persuaded the little savage to spare me  very well he said consider yourself a guest in my house for the present if you are telling the truth about yourself a days detention cannot hurt you  i was then conducted by my kind intercessor into the kitchen where we all sat down to partake of maté and talk ourselves into good humour  i began to feel rather sorry for poor marcos for even a worthless vagabond such as he appeared to be becomes an object of compassion when misfortune overtakes him and i asked permission to see him this was readily granted i found him confined in a large empty room built apart from the house he had been provided with a matécup and a kettle of hot water and was sipping his bitter beverage with an air of stoical indifference his legs confined in the stocks were thrust straight out before him but i suppose he was accustomed to uncomfortable positions for he did not seem to mind it much after sympathising with him in a general way i asked him whether he could really sleep in that position  no he replied with indifference but do you know i do not mind about being taken they will send me to the comandancia i suppose and after a few days liberate me i am a good workman on horseback and there will not be wanting some estanciero in need of hands to get me out will you do me one small service friend before you go to your bed  yes certainly if i can i answered  he laughed slightly and looked at me with a strange keen glitter in his eyes then taking my hand he gave it a powerful grip no no my friend i am not going to trouble you to do anything for me he said i have the devils temper and today in a moment of rage i insulted you it therefore surprised me when you came here and spoke kindly to me i desired to know whether that feeling was only on the surface since the men one meets with are often like horned cattle when one falls his companions of the pastureground remember only his past offences and make haste to gore him  his manner surprised me he did not now seem like the marcos marcó i had travelled with that day touched with his words i sat down on the stocks facing him and begged him to tell me what i could do for him  well friend said he you see the stocks are fastened with a padlock if you will get the key and take me out i will sleep well then in the morning before the old oneeyed lunatic is up you can come and turn the key in the lock again nobody will be the wiser  and you are not thinking of escaping i said  i have not even the faintest wish to escape he replied  you could not escape if you did i said for the room would be locked of course but if i were disposed to do what you ask how could i get the key  that is an easy matter said marcos ask the good señora to let you have it did i not notice her eyes dwelling lovingly on your facefor doubtless you reminded her of some absent relative a favourite nephew perhaps she would not deny you anything in reason and a kindness friend even to the poorest man is never thrown away  i will think about it i said and shortly after that i left him  it was a sultry evening and the close smoky atmosphere of the kitchen becoming unendurable i went out and sat down on a log of wood out of doors here the old juez in his character of amiable host came and discoursed for half an hour on lofty matters relating to the republic presently his wife came out and declaring that the evening air would have an injurious effect on his inflamed eye persuaded him to go indoors then she subsided into a place at my side and began to talk about fernandos dreadful temper and the many cares of her life  what a very serious young man you are she remarked changing her tone somewhat abruptly do you keep all your gay and pleasant speeches for the young and pretty señoritas  ah señora you are yourself young and beautiful in my eyes i replied but i have no heart to be gay when my poor fellowtraveller is fastened in the stocks where your cruel husband would also have confined me but for your timely intervention you are so kindhearted cannot you have his poor tired legs taken out in order that he may also rest properly tonight  ah little friend she returned i could not attempt such a thing fernando is a monster of cruelty and would immediately put out my eyes without remorse poor me what i have to endureand here she placed her fat hand on mine  i drew my hand away somewhat coldly a born diplomatist could not have managed the thing better  madam i said you are amusing yourself at my expense when you have done me a great favour will you now deny me this small thing if your husband is so terrible a despot surely you can do this without letting him know let me get my poor marcos out of the stocks and i give you my word of honour that the juez will never hear of it for i will be up early to turn the key in the lock before he is out of his bed  and what will my reward be she asked again putting her hand on mine  the deep gratitude and devotion of my heart i returned this time without withdrawing my hand  can i refuse anything to my sweet boy said she after supper i shall slip the key into your hand i am going now to get it from his room before fernando retires ask to see your marcos to take him a rug or some tobacco or something and do not let the servant see what you do for he will be at the door waiting to lock it when you come out  after supper the promised key was secretly conveyed to me and i had not the least difficulty in liberating my friend in misfortune luckily the man who took me to marcos left us alone for some time and i related my conversation with the fat woman  he jumped up and seizing my hand wrung it till i almost screamed with pain  my good friend he said you have a noble generous soul have done me the greatest service it is possible for one man to render to another you have in fact now placed me in a position toenjoy my nights rest good night and may heavens angels put it in my power to reward you at some future time  the fellow was overdoing it a little i thought then when i had seen him safely locked up for the night i walked back to the kitchen slowly and very thoughtfully     chapter xi   i walked thoughtfully back because after rendering that unimportant service to marcos i began to experience sundry qualms of conscience and inward questionings concerning the strict morality of the whole proceeding allowing that i had done something very kind charitable and altogether praiseworthy in getting the poor fellows unfortunate feet out of the stocks did all that justify the cajolery i had practised to attain my object or to put it briefly in the old familiar way does the end sanctify the means assuredly it does in some cases very easy to be imagined let us suppose that i have a beloved friend an ailing person of a nervous delicate organisation who has taken it into his poor cracked brains that he is going to expire at the stroke of twelve on a given night without consulting the authorities on ethical questions i should in such a case flit about his room secretly manipulating his timepieces till i had advanced them a whole hour and then just before the stroke of midnight triumphantly produce my watch and inform him that death had failed to keep the appointment such an acted lie as that would weigh nothing on the conscience of any man the fact of the matter is the circumstances must always be considered and every case judged on its own particular merits now this affair of getting the key was not one for me to judge since ihad been a chief actor in it but rather for some acute and learned casuist i therefore made a mental note of it with the intention of putting it impartially before the first person of that description i should meet having thus disposed of a troublesome matter i felt greatly relieved in mind and turned into the kitchen once more i had scarcely sat down however before i round that one disagreeable consequence of my performancethe fat señoras claim on my undying devotion and gratitudehad yet to be faced she greeted my entrance with an effusive smile and the sweetest smiles of some people one meets are less endurable than their black looks in selfdefence i assumed as drowsy and vacant an expression as i could summon on the instant to a countenance by nature almost too ingenuous i pretended not to hear or to misunderstand everything that was said to me finally i grew so sleepy that i was several times on the point of falling off my chair then after each extravagant nod i would start up and stare vacantly around me my grim little host could scarcely conceal a quiet smile for never had he seen a person so outrageously sleepy before at length he mercifully remarked that i seemed fatigued and advised me to retire very gladly i made my exit followed in my retreat from the kitchen by a pair of sad reproachful eyes  i slept soundly enough in the comfortable bed which my obese gulnare had provided for me until the numerous cocks of the establishment woke me shortly after daybreak with their crowing remembering that i had to secure marcos in the stocks before the irascible little magistrate should appear on the scene i rose and hastily dressed myself i found the greasy man of the brass buttons already in the kitchen sipping his matutinal matéamargo and asked him to lend me the key of the prisoners room for this was what i had been instructed to do by the señora he got up and went with me to open the door himself not caring i suppose to trust me with the key when he threw the door open we stood silently gazing for some time into the empty apartment the prisoner had vanished and a large hole cut in the thatch of the roof showed how and where he had made his exit i felt very much exasperated at the shabby trick the fellow had played on us on me especially for i was in a measure responsible for him fortunately the man who opened the door never suspected me of being an accomplice but merely remarked that the stocks had evidently been left unlocked by the soldiers the evening before so that it was not strange the prisoner had made his escape  when the other members of the household got up the matter was discussed with little excitement or even interest and i soon concluded that the secret of the escape would remain between the lady of the house and myself she watched for an opportunity to speak to me alone then shaking her fat forefinger at me in playful anger whispered ah deceiver you planned it all with him last evening and only made me your instrument  señora i protested with dignity i assure you on the word of honour of an englishman i never suspected the man had any intention of escaping i am very angry it has happened  what do you suppose i care about his escaping she replied laughingly for your sake sweet friend i would gladly open the doors of every prison in the banda if i had the power  ah how you flatter but i must now go to your husband to learn from him what he intends doing with the prisoner who has not attempted to escape  with this excuse i got away from her  the wretched little juez when i spoke to him put me off with a number of vague meaningless phrases about his responsible position the peculiar nature of his functions and the unsettled state of the republicas if it had ever known or was ever likely to know any other state he then mounted his horse and rode away to las cuevas leaving me with that dreadful woman and i verily believe that in doing so he was only carrying out her private instructions the only comfort he gave me was the promise he made before going that a communication respecting me would be forwarded to the commandante of the district in the course of the day which would probably result in my being passed on to that functionary in the meanwhile he begged me to make free use of his house and everything in it of course the misguided little wretch had no intention of throwing his fat wife at my head still i had no doubt that it was she who inspired these complimentary phrases telling him perhaps that he would lose nothing by a courteous treatment of the english millionaire  when he rode away he left me sitting on the gate feeling very much disgusted and almost wishing that like marcos marcó i had run away during the night never had i taken so sudden and violent a dislike to anything as i then and there did to that estancia where i was an honoured albeit a compulsory guest the hot brilliant morning sunshone down on the discoloured thatch and mudplastered walls of the sordidlooking building while all about wherever i cast my eyes they rested on weeds old bones broken bottles and other rubbisheloquent witnesses of the dirty idle thriftless character of the inmates meanwhile my sweet angelic childwife with her violet eyes dim with tears was waiting for me far away in montevideo wondering at my long absence and even now perhaps shading her face with her lily hand and looking out on the white dusty road watching for my arrival and here i was compelled to sit idly swinging my legs on the gate because that abominable fat woman had taken a fancy to keep me by her feeling mad with indignation i suddenly jumped down from the gate with an exclamation not intended for ears polite causing my hostess to jump also and utter a scream for there she was confound her standing just behind me  the saints defend me she exclaimed recovering herself and laughing what made you startle me so  i apologised for the strong expression i had used then added señora i am a young man full of energy and accustomed to take a great deal of exercise every day and i am getting very impatient sitting here basking in the sunshine like a turtle on a bank of mud  why then do you not take a walk she said with kind concern  i said i would gladly do so and thanked her for the permission then she immediately offered to accompany me i protested very ungallantly that i was a fast walker and reminded her that the sun was excessively hot and i should also have liked to add that she was excessively fat she replied that it did not matter so polite a person as myself would know how to accommodate his pace to that of his companion unable to shake her off i started for my walk in a somewhat unamiable mood the stout lady resolutely trudging on at my side perspiring abundantly our path led us down to a little cañada or valley where the ground was moist and abounding with numerous pretty flowers and feathery grasses very refreshing to look at after leaving the parched yellow ground about the estancia house  you seem to be very fond of flowers observed my companion let me help you gather them to whom will you give your nosegay when it is made  señora i replied vexed at her trivial chatter i will give it to the i had almost said to the devil when a piercing scream she uttered suddenly arrested the rude speech on my lips  her fright had been caused by a pretty little snake about eighteen inches long which she had seen gliding away at her feet and no wonder it glided away from her with all the speed it was capable of for how gigantic and deformed a monster that fat woman must have seemed to it the terror of a timid little child at the sight of a hippopotamus robed in flowing bedcurtains and walking erect on its hind legs would perhaps be comparable to the panic possessing the shallow brain of the poor speckled thing when that huge woman came striding over it  first i laughed and then seeing that she was about to throw herself for protection like a mountain of flesh upon me i turned and ran after the snakefor i had observed that it belonged to a harmless species one of the innocuous coronella genusand i was anxious to annoy the woman i captured it in a moment then with the poor frightened creature struggling in my hand and winding itself about my wrist i walked back to her  did you ever see such lovely colours i cried look at the delicate primrose yellow on its neck deepening into vivid crimson on the belly talk of flowers and butterflies and its eyes are bright as two small diamondslook closely at them señora for they are well worth your admiration  but she only turned and fled away screaming at my approach and at last finding that i would not obey her and drop the terrible reptile she left me in a towering rage and went back to the house by herself  after that i continued my walk in peace amongst the flowers but my little speckled captive had served me so well that i would not release it it occurred to me that if i kept it on my person it might serve as a sort of talisman to protect me from the disagreeable attentions of the señora finding that it was a very sly little snakey and like marcos marcó in captivity full of subtle deceit i put it into my hat which when firmly pressed on to my head left no opening for the little arrowy head to insinuate itself through after spending two or three hours botanising in the cañada i returned to the house i was in the kitchen refreshing myself with a bitter maté when my hostess came in beaming with smiles for she had i suppose forgiven me by this time i politely rose and removed my hat unfortunately i had forgotten the snake when out it dropped on the floor then followed screams confusion and scuttling out of the kitchen by madame children and servants after that i was compelled to carry the snake out and give it back its liberty which no doubt tasted very sweet to it after its close confinement on my return to the house one of the servants informed me that the señora was too much offended to sit in the same room with me again so that i was obliged to have my breakfast alone and for the remainder of the time during which i was a prisoner i was avoided by everyone except brass buttonswho appeared indifferent to everything on earth as if i had been a leper or a dangerous lunatic they thought perhaps that i still had other reptiles concealed about my person  of course one always expects to find a cruel unreasoning prejudice against snakes amongst ignorant people but i never knew before to what ridiculous lengths it will carry them the prejudice makes me angry but on this occasion it had a use for it enabled me to pass the day unmolested  in the evening the juez returned and i soon heard him loud in a stormy altercation with his wife perhaps she wanted him to have me decapitated how it ended i cannot say but when i saw him his manner towards me was freezing and he retired without giving me an opportunity of speaking to him  next morning i got up resolved not to be put off any longer something would have to be done or i would know the reason why on stepping out i was very much surprised to see my horse standing saddled at the gate i went into the kitchen and asked brass buttons the only person up what it meant  who knows he returned giving me a maté perhaps the juez desires you to leave the house before he is up  what did he say i demanded  say nothingwhat should he say  but you saddled the horse i suppose  of course who else would do it  were you told to do so by the juez  told why should he tell me  how then am i to know that he wishes me to leave his beautiful house i asked getting angry  the question he returned shrugging his shoulders how do you know when it is going to rain  finding there was nothing more to be got out of the fellow i finishing taking maté lit a cigar and left the house it was a lovely morning without a cloud and the heavy dew sparkled on the grass like drops of rain what a pleasant thing it was to be able to ride forth again free to go where i liked  and so ends my snakestory which is perhaps not very interesting but it is true and therefore has one advantage over all other snakestories told by travellers     chapter xii   before leaving the magistrates estancia i had made up my mind to return by the shortest route and as quickly as possible to montevideo and that morning mounted on a wellrested horse i covered a great deal of ground by twelve oclock when i stopped to rest my horse and get some refreshment at a wayside pulpería i had got over about eight leagues this was travelling at an imprudent pace of course but in the banda orientál it is so easy to pick up a fresh horse that one becomes somewhat reckless my journey that morning had taken me over the eastern portion of the durazno district and i was everywhere charmed with the beauty of the country though it was still very dry the grass on the higher lands being burnt to various shades of yellow and brown now however the summer heats were over for the time was near the end of february the temperature without being oppressive was deliciously warm so that travelling on horseback was delightful i might fill dozens of pages with descriptions of pretty bits of country i passed that day but must plead guilty of an unconquerable aversion to this kind of writing after this candid confession i hope the reader will not quarrel with me for the omission besides anyone who cares for these things and knows how evanescent are the impressions left by word pictures on the mind can sail the seas and gallop round the world to see them all for himself it is not however every wanderer from englandi blush while saying itwho can make himself familiar with the home habits the ways of thought and speech of a distant people bid me discourse of lowly valley lofty height of barren waste shady wood or cooling stream where i have drunk and been refreshed but all these places pleasant or dreary must be in the kingdom called the heart  after getting some information about the country i had to traverse from the pulpero who told me that i would probably reach the river yí before evening i resumed my journey about four oclock in the afternoon i came to an extensive wood of thorntrees of which the pulpero had spoken and in accordance with his instructions i skirted it on the eastern side the trees were not large but there was an engaging wildness about this forest full of the musical chatter of birds which tempted me to alight from my horse and rest for an hour in the shade taking the bit from his mouth to let him feed i threw myself down on the dry grass under a clump of shady thorns and for half an hour watched the sparkling sunlight falling through the foliage overhead and listened to the feathered people that came about me loudly chirping apparently curious to know what object had brought me to their haunts then i began to think of all the people i had recently mixed with the angry magistrate and his fat wifehorrid womanand marcos marcó that shabby rascal rose up before me to pass quickly away and once more i was face to face with that lovely mystery margarita in imagination i put forth my hands to take hers and drew her towards me so as to look more closely into her eyes vainly questioning them as to their pure sapphire hue then i imagined or dreamt that with trembling fingers i unbraided her hair to let it fall like a splendid golden mantle over her mean dress and asked her how she came to possess that garment of glory the sweet grave child lips smiled but returned no answer then a shadowy face seemed to shape itself dimly against the green curtain of foliage and looking over the fair girls shoulder gaze sadly into my eyes it was the face of paquíta ah sweet wife never let the greeneyed monster trouble the peace of your heart know that the practical saxon mind of your husband is puzzling itself over a purely scientific problem that this surpassingly fair child interests me only because her fairness seems to upset all physiological laws i was in fact just sinking to sleep at this moment when the shrill note of a trumpet blown close by and followed by loud shouts from several voices made me spring instantly to my feet a storm of answering shouts came from another quarter of the wood then followed profound silence presently the trumpet sounded again making me feel very much alarmed my first impulse was to spring on to my horse and ride away for dear life but on second thoughts i concluded that it would be safer to remain concealed amongst the trees as by leaving them i should only reveal myself to the robbers or rebels or whatever they were i bridled my horse so as to be ready to run then drew him into a close thicket of darkfoliaged bushes and fastened him there the silence that had fallen on the wood continued and at last unable to bear the suspense longer i began to make my way cautiously revolver in hand towards the point the sounds had proceeded from stealing softly through the bushes and trees where they grew near together i came at length in sight of an open piece of ground about two or three hundred yards wide and overgrown with grass near its border on one side i was amazed to see a group of about a dozen boys their ages ranging from about ten to fifteen all standing perfectly motionless one of them held a trumpet in his hand and they all wore red handkerchiefs or rags tied round their heads suddenly while i crouched amongst the leafage watching them a shrill note sounded from the opposite side of the open space and another troop of boys wearing white on their heads burst from the trees and advanced with loud shouts of vivas and mueras towards the middle of the ground again the red heads sounded their trumpet and went out boldly to meet the newcomers as the two bands approached each other each led by a big boy who turned at intervals and with many wild gestures addressed his followers apparently to encourage them i was amazed to see them all suddenly draw out long knives such as the native horsemen usually wear and rush furiously together in a moment they were mingled together in a desperate fight uttering the most horrible yells their long weapons glittering in the sunshine as they brandished them about with such fury did they fight that in a few moments all the combatants lay stretched out on the grass excepting three boys wearing the red badges one of these bloodthirsty young miscreants then snatched up the trumpet and blew a victorious blast while the other two shrieked an accompaniment of vivas and mueras while they were thus occupied one of the whiteheaded boys struggled to his feet and snatching up a knife charged the three reds with desperate courage had i not been perfectly paralysed with amazement at what i had witnessed i should then have rushed out to aid this boy in his forlorn attempt but in an instant his three foes were on him and dragged him down to the ground two of them then held him fast by the legs and arms the other raised his long knife and was just about to plunge it in the struggling captives breast when uttering a loud yell i sprang up and rushed at them instantly they started up and fled screaming towards the trees in the greatest terror and then most wonderful thing of all the dead boys all came to life and springing to their feet fled from me after the others this brought me to a stand when seeing that one of the boys limped painfully after his companions hopping on one leg i made a sudden dash and captured him before he could reach the shelter of the trees  oh señor do not kill me he pleaded bursting into tears  i have no wish to kill you you unspeakable young miscreant but i think i ought to thrash you i answered for though greatly relieved at the turn things had taken i was excessively annoyed at having experienced all those sensations of bloodcurdling horror for nothing  we were only playing at whites and reds he pleaded  i then made him sit down and tell me all about this singular game  none of the boys lived very near he said some of them came a distance of several leagues and they had selected this locality for their sports on account of its seclusion for they did not like to be found out their game was a mimic war of whites and reds manoeuvres surprises skirmishes throatcutting and all  i pitied the young patriot at the last for he had sprained his ankle badly and could scarcely walk and so assisted him to the spot where his horse was hidden then having helped him to mount and given him a cigarette for which he had the impudence to ask me i laughingly bade him goodbye i went back to look for my own horse after that beginning to feel very much amused at the whole thing but alas my steed was gone the young scoundrels had stolen him to revenge themselves on me i suppose for disturbing them and to relieve me from all doubt in the matter they left two bits of rag one white and the other red attached to the branch i had fastened the bridle to for some time i wandered about the wood and even shouted aloud in the wild hope that the young fiends were not going to carry things so far as to leave me without a horse in that solitary place nothing could i see or hear of them however and as it was getting late and i wasbecoming desperately hungry and thirsty i resolved to go in search of some habitation  on emerging from the forest i found the adjacent plain covered with cattle quietly grazing any attempt to pass through the herd would have been almost certain death as these more than halfwild beasts will always take revenge on their master man when they catch him dismounted in the open as they were coming up from the direction of the river and were slowly grazing past the wood i resolved to wait for them to pass on before leaving my concealment i sat down and tried to be patient but the brutes were in no hurry and went on skirting the wood at a snails pace it was about six oclock before the last stragglers had left and then i ventured out from my hidingplace hungry as a wolf and afraid of being overtaken by night before finding any human habitation i had left the trees half a mile behind me and was walking hurriedly along towards the valley of the yí when passing over a hillock i suddenly found myself in sight of a bull resting on the grass and quietly chewing his cud unfortunately the brute saw me at the same moment and immediately stood up he was i think about three or four years old and a bull of that age is even more dangerous than an older one for he is quite as truculent as the other and far more active there was no refuge of any kind near and i knew very well that to attempt to escape by running would only increase my danger so after gazing at him for a few moments i assumed an easy unconcerned manner and walked on but he was not going to be taken in that way and began to follow me then for the first and i devoutly hope for the last time in my life i was compelled to resort to the gaucho plan and casting myself face downwards on the earth lay there simulating death it is a miserable dangerous expedient but in the circumstances i found myself the only one offering a chance of escape from a very terrible death in a few moments i heard his heavy tramp then felt him sniffing me all over after that he tried unsuccessfully to roll me over in order to study my face i suppose it was horrible to endure the prods he gave me and lie still but after a while he grew quieter and contented himself by simply keeping guard over me occasionally smelling at my head then turning round to smell at my heels probably his theory was if he had one that i had fainted with fear at the sight of him and would recover presently but he was not quite sure at which end of me returning life would first show itself about once in every five or six minutes he seemed to get impatient and then he would paw me with his heavy hoof uttering a low hoarse moaning spattering me with froth from his mouth but as he showed no disposition to leave i at last resolved to try a very bold experiment for my position was becoming unendurable i waited till the brutes head was turned from me then worked my hand cautiously down to my revolver but before i had quite drawn it he noticed the movement and wheeled swiftly round kicking my legs as he did so just as he brought his head round close to mine i discharged the weapon in his face and the sudden explosion so terrified him that he turned tail and fled never pausing in his lumbering gallop till he was out of sight it was a glorious victory and though i could scarcely stand on my legs at first so stiff and bruised did i feel all over i laughed with joy and even sent another bullet whizzing after the retreating monster accompanying the discharge with a wild yell of triumph  after that i proceeded without further interruption on my walk and had i not felt so ravenously hungry and so sore where the bull had trod on me or prodded me with his horns the walk would have been very enjoyable for i was now approaching the yí the ground grew moist and green and flowers abounded many of them new to me and so lovely and fragrant that in my admiration for them i almost forgot my pain the sun went down but no house appeared in sight over the western heavens flamed the brilliant hues of the afterglow and from the long grass came the sad monotonous trill of some night insect troops of hooded gulls flew by me on their way from their feeding grounds to the water uttering their long hoarse laughterlike cries how buoyant and happy they seemed flying with their stomachs full to their rest while i dismounted and supperless dragged painfully on like a gull that had been left behind with a broken wing presently through the purple and saffronhued vapours in the western sky the evening star appeared large and luminous the herald of swiftcoming darkness and thenweary bruised hungry baffled and despondenti sat down to meditate on my forlorn position     chapter xiii   i sat there till it was very dark and the longer i sat the colder and stiffer i grew yet i felt no disposition to walk farther at length a large owl flapping down close to my head gave utterance to a long hiss followed by a sharp clicking sound ending with a sudden loud laughlike cry the nearness of it startled me and looking up i saw a twinkling yellow light gleam for a moment across the wide black plain then disappear a few fireflies were flitting about the grass but i felt sure the gleam just witnessed proceeded from a fire and after vainly trying to catch sight of it again from my seat on the ground i rose and walked on keeping before me a particular star shining directly over the spot where that transient glimmer had appeared presently to my great joy i spied it again in the same place and felt convinced that it was the gleam of firelight shining from the open door or window of some rancho or estancia house with renewed hope and energy i hastened on the light increasing in brightness as i progressed and after half an hours brisk walking i found myself approaching a human dwelling of some kind i could make out a dark mass of trees and bushes a long low house and nearer to me a corral or cattlepen of tall upright posts now however when a refuge seemed so close the fear of the terrible savage dogs kept on most of these cattlebreeding establishments made me hesitate unless i wished to run the risk of being shot it was necessary to shout loudly to make my approach known yet by shouting i would inevitably bring a pack of huge frantic dogs upon me and the horns of the angry bull i had encountered were less terrible to contemplate than the fangs of these powerful truculent brutes i sat down on the ground to consider the position and presently heard the clatter of approaching hoofs immediately afterwards three men rode past me but did not see me for i was crouching down behind some scrubby bushes when the horsemen approached the house the dogs rushed forth to assail them and their loud fierce barking and the wild shouts of some person from the house calling them off were enough to make a dismounted man nervous however now was my only chance and starting up i hurried on towards the noise as i passed the corral the brutes became aware of my approach and instantly turned their attention on me i wildly shouted ave maria then revolver in hand stood awaiting the onset but when they were near enough for me to see that the pack was composed of eight or ten huge yellow mastifflike brutes my courage failed and i fled to the corral where with an agility surpassing that of a wild cat so great was my terror i climbed up a post and placed myself beyond their reach with the dogs furiously barking under me i renewed my shouts of ave mariathe proper thing to do when you approach a strange house in these pious latitudes after some time the men approachedfour of themand asked me who i was and what i did there i gave an account of myself then asked whether it would be safe for me to descend the master of the house took the hint and drove his faithful protectors off after which i came down from my uncomfortable perch  he was a tall wellmade but rather fiercelooking gaucho with keen black eyes and a heavy black beard he seemed suspicious of mea very unusual thing in a natives house and asked me a great many searching questions and finally still with some reluctance in his manner he invited me into the kitchen there i found a big fire blazing merrily on the raised clay hearth in the centre of the large room and seated near it an old greyhaired woman a middleaged tall darkskinned dame in a purple dressmy hosts wife a pale pretty young woman about sixteen years old and a little girl when i sat down my host began once more questioning me but he apologised for doing so saying that my arrival on foot seemed a very extraordinary circumstance i told them how i had lost my horse saddle and poncho in the wood and then related my encounter with the bull they listened to it all with very grave faces but i am sure it was as good as a comedy to them don sinforiano aldaythe owner of the place and my questionermade me take off my coat to exhibit the bruises the bulls hoofs had inflicted on my arms and shoulders he was anxious even after that to know something more about me and so to satisfy him i gave him a brief account of some of my adventures in the country down to my arrest with marcos marcó and how that plausible gentleman had made his escape from the magistrates house that made them all laugh and the three men i had seen arrive and who appeared to be casual visitors became very friendly frequently passing me the rumbottle with which they were provided  after sipping maté and rum for half an hour we settled down to discuss a plentiful supper of roast and boiled beef and mutton with great basins of wellseasoned broth to wash it down i consumed an amazing quantity of meat as much in fact as any gaucho there and to eat as much as one of these men at a sitting is a feat for an englishman to boast about supper done i lit a cigar and leant back against the wall enjoying many delightful sensations all togetherwarmth rest and hunger satisfied and the subtle fragrance of that friend and comforter divine tobacco on the farther side of the room my host was meanwhile talking to the other men in low tones occasional glances in my direction seemed to show that they still harboured some suspicion of me or that they had some grave matters to converse about unsuitable for a stranger to hear  at length alday rose and addressed me señor if you are ready to rest i will now conduct you to another room where you can have some rugs and ponchos to make a bed with  if my presence here is not inconvenient i returned i would rather remain and smoke by the fire  you see señor he said i have arranged to meet some neighbours and friends who are coming here to discuss matters of importance with me i am even now expecting their arrival and the presence of a stranger would scarcely allow us to talk freely over our affairs  since you wish it i will go to any part of the house you may think proper to put me in i returned  i rose not very cheerfully i must say from my comfortable seat before the fire to follow him out when the tramp of galloping horses came to our ears  follow me this wayquick exclaimed my impatient conductor but just as i reached the door about a dozen mounted men dashed up close to us and burst forth in a perfect storm of yells instantly all those who were in the kitchen sprang to their feet uttering loud exclamations and looking greatly excited then came from the mounted men another wild outburst as they all yelled together viva el general santa colomaviva  the other three men then rushed from the kitchen and in excited tones began to ask if anything fresh had happened meanwhile i was left standing at the door by myself the women appeared almost as excited as the men except the girl who had glanced at me with shy compassion in her large dark eyes when i had been roused from my seat by the fire taking advantage of the general excitement i now repaid that kindly look with one of admiration she was a quiet bashful girl her pale face crowned with a profusion of black hair and while she stood there waiting apparently unconcerned by the hubbub outside she looked strangely pretty her homemade cotton gown of limp and scanty material clinging closely to her limbs so as to display her slender graceful form to the best advantage presently seeing me looking at her she came near and touching my arm in passing told me in a whisper to go back to my seat by the fire i gladly obeyed her for my curiosity was now thoroughly aroused and i wished to know the meaning of this outcry which had thrown these phlegmatic gauchos into such a frenzied state of excitement it looked rather like a political rowbut of general santa coloma i had never heard and it seemed curious that a name so seldom mentioned should be the rallying cry of revolutionists  in a few minutes the men all streamed back into the kitchen then the master of the house alday his face on fire with emotion thrust himself into the midst of the crowd  boys are you mad he cried do you not see a stranger here what is the meaning of all this outcry if nothing new has happened  a roar of laughter from the newcomers greeted this outburst after which they raised another yell of viva santa colomal  alday became furious speak madmen he shouted tell me in gods name what has happenedor do you wish to ruin everything with your imprudence  listen alday replied one of the men and know how little we need fear the presence of a stranger santa coloma the hope of uruguay the saviour of his country who will shortly deliver us out of the power of colorado assassins and piratessanta coloma has come he is here in our midst he has seized on el molino del yí and has raised the standard of revolt against the infamous government of montevideo viva santa colomal  alday flung his hat off and falling on his knees remained for some moments in silent prayer his hands clasped before him the others all snatched off their hats and stood silent grouped about him then he stood up and all together joined in a viva which far surpassed in its deafening power their previous performances  my host now appeared to be almost beside himself with excitement  what he cried my general come do you tell me that santa coloma has come oh friends the great god has remembered our suffering country at last he has grown weary of looking on mans injustice the persecutions the bloodshed the cruelties that have almost driven us mad i cannot realise it let me go to my general that these eyes that have watched for his coming may see him and rejoice i cannot wait for daylightthis very night must i ride to el molino that i may see him and touch him with my hands and know that it is not a dream  his words were welcomed with a shout of applause and the other men all immediately announced their intention to accompany him to el molino a small town on the yí some leagues distant  some of the men now went out to catch fresh horses while alday busied himself in bringing out a store of old broadswords and carbines from their concealment in some other part of the house the men talking excitedly together occupied themselves in scouring and sharpening the rusty weapons while the women cooked a fresh supply of meat for the last comers and in the meantime i was permitted to remain unnoticed by the fire smoking peacefully     chapter xiv   the girl i have mentioned whose name was monica and the child called anita were the only persons there besides myself who were not carried away by the warlike enthusiasm of the moment monica silent pale almost apathetic was occupied serving maté to the numerous guests while the child when the shouting and excitement was at its height appeared greatly terrified and clung to aldays wife trembling and crying piteously no notice was taken of the poor little thing and at length she crept away into a corner to conceal herself behind a faggot of wood her hidingplace was close to my seat and after a little coaxing i induced her to leave it and come to me she was a most forlorn little thing with a white thin face and large dark pathetic eyes her mean little cotton frock only reached to her knees and her little legs and feet were bare her age was seven or eight she was an orphan and aldays wife having no children of her own was bringing her up or rather permitting her to grow up under her roof i drew her to me and tried to soothe her tremors and get her to talk little by little she gained confidence and began to reply to my questions then i learnt that she was a little shepherdess although so young and spent most of the time every day in following the flock about on her pony her pony and the girl monica who was some relationcousin the child called herwere the two beings she seemed to have the greatest affection for  and when you slip off how do you get on again i asked  little pony is tame and i never fall off she said sometimes i get off then i climb on again  and what do you do all day longtalk and play  i talk to my doll i take it on the pony when i go with the sheep  is your doll very pretty anita  no answer  will you let me see your doll anita i know i shall like your doll because i like you  she gave me an anxious look evidently doll was a very precious being and had not met with proper appreciation after a little nervous fidgeting she left me and crept out of the room then presently she came back apparently trying to screen something from the vulgar gaze in her scanty little dress it was her wonderful dollthe dear companion of her rambles and rides with fear and trembling she allowed me to take it into my hands it was or consisted of the forefoot of a sheep cut off at the knee on the top of the knee part a little wooden ball wrapped in a white rag represented the head and it was dressed in a piece of red flannela satyrlike doll with one hairy leg and a cloven foot i praised its pleasing countenance its pretty gown and dainty little boots and all i said sounded very precious to anita filling her with emotions of the liveliest pleasure  and do you never play with the dogs and cats and little lambs i asked  not with the dogs and cats when i see a very little lamb asleep i get down and go softly softly and catch it it tries to get away then i put my finger in its mouth and it sucks and sucks then it runs away  and what do you like best to eat  sugar when uncle buys sugar aunt gives me a lump i make doll eat some and bite off one small piece and put it in ponys mouth  which would you rather have anitaa great many lumps of sugar or a beautiful string of beads or a little girl to play with  this question was rather too much for her neglected little brain which had fed itself with such simple fare so i was obliged to put it in various ways and at last when she understood that only one of the three things could be chosen she decided in favour of a little girl to play with  then i asked her if she liked to hear stories this also puzzled her and after some crossquestioning i discovered that she had never heard a story and did not know what it meant  listen anita and i will tell you a story i said have you seen the white mist over the yí in the morninga light white mist that flies away when the sun gets hot  yes she often saw the white mist in the morning she told me  then i will tell you a story about the white mist and a little girl named alma  little alma lived close to the river yí but far far from here beyond the trees and beyond the blue hills for the yí is a very long river she lived with her grandmother and with six uncles all big tall men with long beards and they always talked about wars and cattle and horseracing and a great many other important things that alma could not understand there was no one to talk to alma and for alma to talk to or to play with and when she went out of the house where all the big people were talking she heard the cocks crowing the dogs barking the birds singing the sheep bleating and the trees rustling their leaves over her head and she could not understand one word of all they said at last having no one to play with or talk to she sat down and began to cry now it happened that near the spot where she sat there was an old black woman wearing a red shawl who was gathering sticks for the fire and she asked alma why she cried  because i have no one to talk to and play with said alma then the old black woman drew a long brass pin out of her shawl and pricked almas tongue with it for she made alma hold it out to be pricked  now said the old woman you can go and play and talk with the dogs cats birds and trees for you will understand all they say and they will understand all you say  alma was very glad and ran home as fast as she could to talk to the cat  come cat let us talk and play together she said  oh no said the cat i am very busy watching a little bird so you must go away and play with little niebla down by the river  then the cat ran away among the weeds and left her the dogs also refused to play when she went to them for they had to watch the house and bark at strangers then they also told her to go and play with little niebla down by the river then alma ran out and caught a little duckling a soft little thing that looked like a ball of yellow cotton and said  now little duck let us talk and play  but the duckling only struggled to get away and screamed oh mamma mamma come and take me away from alma  then the old duck came rushing up and said  alma let my child alone and if you want to play go and play with niebla down by the river a nice thing to catch my duckie in your handswhat next i wonder  so she let the duckling go and at last she said yes i will go and play with niebla down by the river  she waited till she saw the white mist and then ran all the way to the yí and stood still on the green bank close by the water with the white mist all round her by and by she saw a beautiful little child come flying towards her in the white mist the child came and stood on the green bank and looked at alma very very pretty she was and she wore a white dresswhiter than milk whiter than foam and all embroidered with purple flowers she had also white silk stockings and scarlet shoes bright as scarlet verbenas her hair was long and fluffy and shone like gold and round her neck she had a string of big gold beads then alma said oh beautiful little girl what is your name to which the little girl answered  niebla  will you talk to me and play with me said alma  oh no said niebla how can i play with a little girl dressed as you are and with bare feet  for you know poor alma only wore a little old frock that came down to her knees and she had no shoes and stockings on then little niebla rose up and floated away away from the bank and down the river and at last when she was quite out of sight in the white mist alma began to cry when it got very hot she went and sat down still crying under the trees there were two very big willowtrees growing near the river by and by the leaves rustled in the wind and the trees began talking to each other and alma understood everything they said  is it going to rain do you think said one tree  yes i think it willsome day said the other  there are no clouds said the first tree  no there are no clouds today but there were some the day before yesterday said the other  have you got any nests in your branches said the first tree  yes one said the other it was made by a little yellow bird and there are five speckled eggs in it  then the first tree said there is little alma sitting in our shade do you know why she is crying neighbour  the other tree answered yes it is because she has no one to play with little niebla by the river refused to play with her because she is not beautifully dressed  then the first tree said ah she ought to go and ask the fox for some pretty clothes to wear the fox always keeps a great store of pretty things in her hole  alma had listened to every word of this conversation she remembered that a fox lived on the hillside not far off for she had often seen it sitting in the sunshine with its little ones playing round it and pulling their mothers tail in fun so alma got up and ran till she found the hole and putting her head down it she cried out fox fox but the fox seemed cross and only answered without coming out go away alma and talk to little niebla i am busy getting dinner for my children and have no time to talk to you now  then alma cried oh fox niebla will not play with me because i have no pretty things to wear oh fox will you give me a nice dress and shoes and stockings and a string of beads  after a little while the fox came out of its hole with a big bundle done up in a red cotton handkerchief and said here are the things alma and i hope they will fit you but you know alma you really ought not to come at this time of day for i am very busy just now cooking the dinneran armadillo roasted and a couple of partridges stewed with rice and a little omelette of turkeys eggs i mean plovers eggs of course i never touch turkeys eggs  alma said she was very sorry to give so much trouble  oh never mind said the fox how is your grandmother  she is very well thank you said alma but she has a bad headache  i am very sorry to hear it said the fox tell her to stick two fresh dockleaves on her temples and to drink a little weak tea made of knotgrass and on no account to go out in the hot sun i should like to go and see her only i do not like the dogs being always about the house give her my best respects and now run home alma and try on the things and when you are passing this way you can bring me back the handkerchief as i always tie my face up in it when i have the toothache  alma thanked the fox very much and ran home as fast as she could and when the bundle was opened she found in it a beautiful white dress embroidered with purple flowers a pair of scarlet shoes silk stockings and a string of great golden beads they all fitted her very well and next day when the white mist was on the yí she dressed herself in her beautiful clothes and went down to the river by and by little niebla came flying along and when she saw alma she came and kissed her and took her by the hand all the morning they played and talked together gathering flowers and running races over the green sward and at last niebla bade her goodbye and flew away for all the white mist was floating off down the river but every day after that alma found her little companion by the yí and was very happy for now she had someone to talk to and to play with  after i had finished the story anita continued gazing into my face with an absorbed expression in her large wistful eyes she seemed half scared half delighted at what she had heard but presently before the little thing had said a word monica who had been directing shy and wondering glances towards us for some time came and taking her by the hand led her away to bed i was getting sleepy then and as the clatter of talk and warlike preparation showed no signs of abating i was glad to be shown into another room where some sheepskins rugs and a couple of ponchos were given to me for a bed  during the night all the men took their departure for in the morning when i went into the kitchen i only found the old woman and aldays wife sipping bitter maté the child they informed me had disappeared from the house an hour before and monica had gone out to look for her aldays wife was highly indignant at the little ones escapade for it was high time for anita to go out with the flock after taking maté i went out and looking towards the yí veiled in a silvery mist i spied monica leading the culprit home by the hand and went to meet them poor little anita her face stained with tears her little legs and feet covered with clay and scratched by sharp reeds in fifty places her dress soaking wet with the heavy mist looked a most pitiful object  where did you find her i asked the girl beginning to fear that i had been the indirect cause of the poor childs misfortunes  down by the river looking for little niebla i knew she would be there when i missed her this morning  how did you know that i asked you did not hear the story i told her  i made her repeat it all to me last night said monica  after that little anita was scolded shaken washed and dried then fed and finally lifted on to the back of her pony and sent to take care of the sheep while undergoing this treatment she maintained a profound silence her little face puckered up into an expression that boded tears they were not for the public however and only after she was on the pony with the reins in her little mites of hands and her back towards us did she give way to her grief and disappointment at having failed to find the beautiful child of the mist  i was astonished to find that she had taken the fantastic little tale invented to amuse her as truth but the poor babe had never read books or heard stories and the fairy tale had been too much for her starved little imagination i remember that once on another occasion i told a pathetic story of a little child lost in a great wilderness to a girl about anitas age and just as unaccustomed to this kind of mental fare next morning her mother informed me that my little listener had spent half the night sobbing and begging to be allowed to go and look for that lost child i had told her about  hearing that alday would not return till evening or till the following day i asked his wife to lend or give me a horse to proceed on my journey this however she could not do then she added very graciously that while all the men were away my presence in the house would be a comfort to her a man always being a great protection the arrangement did not strike me as one very advantageous to myself but as i could not journey very well to montevideo on foot i was compelled to sit still and wait for aldays return  it was dull work talking to those two women in the kitchen they were both great talkers and had evidently come to a tacit agreement to share their one listener fairly between them for first one then the other would speak with a maddening monotony aldays wife had six favourite finesounding wordselements superior division prolongation justification and disproportion one of these she somehow managed to drag into every sentence and sometimes she succeeded in getting in two whenever this happened the achievement made her so proud that she would in the most deliberate coldblooded way repeat the sentence again word for word the strength of the old woman lay in dates not an occurrence did she mention whether it referred to some great public event or to some trivial domestic incident in her own rancho without giving the year the month and the day the duet between these two confounded barrelorgans one grinding out rhetoric the other chronology went on all the morning and often i turned to monica sitting over her sewing in hopes of a different tune from her more melodious instrument but in vain for never a word dropped from those silent lips occasionally her dark luminous eyes were raised for a moment only to sink abashed again when they encountered mine after breakfast i went for a walk along the river where i spent several hours hunting for flowers and fossils and amusing myself as best i could there were legions of duck coot rosy spoonbills and blacknecked swans disporting themselves in the water and i was very thankful that i had no gun with me and so was not tempted to startle them with rude noises and send any of them away to languish wounded amongst the reeds at length after having indulged in a good swim i set out to walk back to the estancia  when still about a mile from the house as i walked on swinging my stick and singing aloud in lightness of heart i passed a clump of willowtrees and looking up saw monica under them watching my approach she was standing perfectly motionless and when i caught sight of her cast her eyes demurely down apparently to contemplate her bare feet which looked very white on the deep green turf in one hand she held a cluster of stalks of the large crimson autumnal lilies which had just begun to blossom my singing ceased suddenly and i stood for some moments gazing admiringly at the shy rustic beauty  what a distance you have walked to gather lilies monica i said approaching her will you give me one of your stalks  they were gathered for the virgin so i cannot give away any of these she replied if you will wait here under the trees i will find one to give you  i agreed to wait for her then placing the cluster she had gathered on the grass she left me before long she returned with a stalk round polished slender like a pipestem and crowned with its cluster of three splendid crimson flowers  when i had sufficiently thanked her and admired it i said what boon are you going to ask from the virgin monica when you offer her these flowerssafety for your lover in the wars  no señor i have no offering to make and no boon to ask they are for my aunt i offered to gather them for her becausei wished to meet you here  to meet me monicawhat for  to ask for a story señor she replied colouring and with a shy glance at my face  ah we have had stories enough i said remember poor anita running away this morning to look for a playmate in the wet mist  she is a child i am a woman  then monica you must have a lover who will be jealous if you listen to stories from a strangers lips in this lonely spot  no person will ever know that i met you here she returnedso bashful yet so persistent  i have forgotten all my stories i said  then señor i will go and find you another ramo of lilies while you think of one to tell me  no i said you must get no more lilies for me look i will give you back these you gave me and saying that i fastened them in her black hair where by contrast they looked very splendid and gave the girl a new grace ah monica they make you look too prettylet me take them out again  but she would not have them taken i will leave you now to think of a story for me she said blushing and turning away  then i took her hands and made her face me listen monica i said do you know that these lilies are full of strange magic see how crimson they are that is the colour of passion for they have been steeped in passion and turn my heart to fire if you bring me any more of them monica i shall tell you a story that will make you tremble with feartremble like the willowleaves and turn pale as the mist over the yí  she smiled at my words it was like a ray of sunlight falling through the foliage on her face then in a voice that was almost a whisper she said what will the story be about señor tell me then i shall know whether to gather lilies for you or not  it will be about a stranger meeting a sweet pale girl standing under the trees her dark eyes cast down and red lilies in her hand and how she asked him for a story but he could speak to her of nothing but love love love  when i finished speaking she gently withdrew her hands from mine and turned away amongst the trees doubtless to fly from me trembling at my words like a frightened young fawn from the hunter  so for a moment i thought but no there lay the lilies gathered for a religious purpose at my feet and there was nothing reproachful in the shy dark eyes when they glanced back for a moment at me for in spite of those warning words she had only gone to find more of those perilous crimson flowers to give me  not then while i waited for her return with palpitating heart but afterwards in calmer moments and when monica had become a pretty picture in the past did i compose the following lines i am not so vain as to believe that they possess any great poetical merit and introduce them principally to let the reader know how to pronounce the pretty name of that oriental river which it still keeps in remembrance of a vanished race      standing silent pale her face was       pale and sweet to see     neath the willows waiting for me       willowlike was she     smiling blushing trembling bashful       maid of yí      willowlike she trembled yet she       never fled from me     but her dovelike eyes were downcast       on the grass to see     white feet standing white thy feet were       maid of yí      stalks of lilies in her hands were       crimson lilies three     placed i in her braids of black hair       they were bright to see     lift thy dark eyes for i love thee       maid of yí     chapter xv   in the evening alday returned with a couple of his friends and as soon as an opportunity offered i took him aside and begged him to let me have a horse to continue my journey to montevideo he answered evasively that the horse i had lost in the neighbouring forest would probably be recovered in the course of two or three days i replied that if he would let me have a horse the one i had lost together with saddle poncho etc could be claimed by him whenever they turned up he then said that he could not very well give me ahorse with saddle and bridle also it looked as if he wanted to keep me in his house for some purpose of his own and this made me all the more determined to leave it immediately in spite of the tender reproachful glances which monica flashed on me from under her long drooping eyelashes i told him that if i could not have a horse i would leave his estancia on foot that rather put him in a corner for in this country where horsestealing and cheating at cards are looked on as venial offenses to let a man leave your estancia on foot is considered a very dishonourable thing he pondered over my declaration for some minutes then after conferring with his friends he promised to provide me with all i required next day i had heard nothing more about the revolution but after supper alday suddenly became very confidential and said that the whole country would be up in arms in the course of a very few days and that it would be highly dangerous for me to attempt travelling by myself to the capital he expatiated on the immense prestige of general santa coloma who had just taken up arms against the colorado party then in power and concluded by saying that my safest plan would be to join the rebels and accompany them on their march to montevideo which would begin almost immediately i replied that i took no interest in the dissensions of the banda orientál and did not wish to compromise myself by joining a military expedition of any kind he shrugged his shoulders and renewing his promise of a horse next day retired to rest  on rising next morning i found that the others were already up the horses were standing saddled at the door and alday pointing out a very fairlooking animal informed me that it had been saddled for me and then added that he and his friends would ride one or two leagues with me to put me on the right road to montevideo he had suddenly become almost too kind but in the simplicity of my heart i believed that he was only making amends for the slight inhospitality of the day before  after partaking of bitter maté i thanked my hostess looked my last into monicas dark sorrowful eyes lifted for one moment to mine and kissed little anitas pathetic face by so doing filling the child with astonishment and causing considerable amusement to the other members of the family after we had ridden about four miles keeping nearly parallel with the river it struck me that we were not going in the right directionthe right one for me at any rate i therefore checked my horse and told my companions that i would not trouble them to ride with me any further  my friend said alday approaching me you will if you leave us now infallibly fall into the hands of some partida who finding you without a passport will take you to el molino or to some other centre though it would make no difference if you had a passport for they would only tear it up and take you all the same in these circumstances it is your safest plan to go with us to el molino where general santa coloma is collecting his forces and you will then be able to explain your position to him  i refuse to go to el molino i said angrily exasperated at his treachery  you will then compel us to take you there he returned  i had no wish to become a prisoner again so soon and seeing that a bold stroke was necessary to keep my liberty i suddenly reined up my horse and drew my revolver my friends i said your road lies inthat direction mine in this i wish you good morning  i had scarcely finished speaking before a blow of a heavy whiphandle descended on my arm below the elbow almost breaking it and sending me off my horse while the revolver went spinning away a dozen yards the blow had been dealt by one of aldays two followers who had just dropped a little to the rear and the rascal certainly showed a marvellous quickness and dexterity in disabling me  wild with rage and pain i scrambled to my feet and drawing my knife threatened to stab the first man who approached me and then in unmeasured language i abused alday for his cowardice and brutality he only smiled and replied that he considered my youth and therefore felt no resentment against me for using such intemperate words  and now my friend he continued after picking up my revolver and remounting his horse let us waste no more time but hasten on to el molino where you can state your case to the general  as i did not wish to be tied on to my horse and carried in that unpleasant and ignominious manner i had to obey climbing into the saddle with some difficulty we set out towards the village of el molino at a swinging gallop the rough motion of the horse i rode increased the pain in my arm till it became intolerable then one of the men mercifully bound it up in a sling after which i was able to travel more comfortably though still suffering a great deal  the day was excessively warm and we did not reach our destination till about three oclock in the afternoon just before entering the town we rode through a little army of gauchos encamped on the adjacent plain some of them were engaged cooking meat others were saddling horses while others in bodies of twenty or thirty were going through cavalry exercises the whole making a scene of wonderful animation very nearly all the men wore the ordinary gaucho costume and those who were exercising carried lances to which were attached little white fluttering bannerets passing through the encampment we clattered into the town composed of about seventy or eighty houses of stone or mud some thatched others with tiled roofs and every house with a large garden attached to it at the official building facing the plaza a guard of ten men armed with carbines was stationed we dismounted and went into the building only to hear that the general had just left the town and was not expected back till the following day  alday spoke to an officer sitting at a table in the room we were shown into addressing him as major he was a thin elderly man with calm grey eyes and a colourless face and looked like a gentleman after hearing a few words from alday he turned to me and said courteously that he was sorry to tell me i should have to remain in el molino till the generals return when i could give an account of myself to him  we do not he said in conclusion wish to compel any foreigner or any oriental even to join our forces but we are naturally suspicious of strangers having already caught two or three spies in the neighbourhood unfortunately you are not provided with a passport and it is best that the general should see you  sir officer i replied by illtreating and detaining an englishman you are doing your cause no good  he answered that he was grieved that his people had found it necessary to treat me roughly for he put it in that mild way everything he said short of liberating me would be done to make my sojourn in el molino pleasant  if it is necessary that the general should see me himself before i can have my liberty pray let these men take me to him at once i said  he has not yet left el molino said an orderly standing in the room  he is at the end of the town at the casa blanca and does not leave till halfpast three  it is nearly that now said the officer consulting his watch take him to the general at once lieutenant alday  i thanked the officer who had looked and spoken so unlike a revolutionary bandit and as soon as i had succeeded in clambering on to my horse we were once more dashing along the main street at a fast gallop we drew up before a large oldlooking stone house at the end of the town standing some distance back from the road and screened from it by a double row of tall lombardy poplars the back of the house was towards the road and passing round to the front after leaving our horses at the gate we entered a spacious patio or yard running along the front of the dwelling was a wide corridor supported by wooden pillars painted white while the whole of the patio was shaded by an immense grapevine this was evidently one of the best houses in the place and coming directly from the glaring sun and the white dusty road the vineshaded patio and corridor looked delightfully cool and inviting a gay company of twelve or fifteen people were gathered under the corridor some sipping maté others sucking grapes and when we came on the scene a young lady was just finishing a song she was singing i at once singled out general santa coloma sitting by the young lady with the guitara tall imposing man with somewhat irregular features and a bronzed weatherbeaten face he was booted and spurred and over his uniform wore a white silk poncho with purple fringe i judged from his countenance that he was not a stern or truculent man as one expects a caudilloa leader of menin the banda orientál to be and remembering that in a few minutes he would be leaving the house i was anxious to push forward and state my case to him the others however prevented me for the general just then happened to be engaged in a vivacious conversation with the young lady sitting by him when i had once looked attentively at this girl i had eyes for no other face there the type was spanish and i have never seen a more perfect face of the kind a wealth of blueblack hair shading the low broad forehead straight nose dark luminous eyes and crimson pouting lips she was tall perfect in her figure as in her face and wore a white dress with a deep red china rose on her bosom for only ornament standing there unnoticed at the end of the corridor i gazed with a kind of fascination on her listening to her light rippling laughter and lively talk watching her graceful gestures her sparkling eyes and damask cheeks flushed with excitement here is a woman i thought with a sighi felt a slight twinge at that disloyal sighi could have worshipped she was pressing the guitar on the general  you have promised to sing one song before you go and i cannot let you off she exclaimed  at length he took the instrument protesting that his voice was a very bad one then sweeping the strings began that fine old spanish song of love and war    cuando suena la trompa guerrera  his voice was uncultivated and somewhat harsh but there was a good deal of fire and expression in the performance and it was rapturously applauded  the moment the song was over he handed her back the guitar and starting up hastily bade the company adieu and turned to go  coming forward i placed myself before him and began to speak  i am pressed for time and cannot listen to you now he said quickly scarcely glancing at me you are a prisonerwounded i see well when i return suddenly he stopped caught hold of my wounded arm and said how did you get hurt tell me quickly  his sharp impatient manner and the sight of twenty people all standing round staring at me quite upset me and i could only stammer out a few unintelligible words feeling that my face was blushing scarlet to the very roots of my hair  let me tell you general said alday advancing  no no said the general he shall speak  the sight of alday so eager to give his version of the affair first restored my anger to me and with that came back the power of speech and the other faculties which i had lost for a moment  sir general all i have to say is this i said i came to this mans house at night a stranger lost on foot for my horse had been stolen from me i asked him for shelter in the belief that at least the one virtue of hospitality still survives in this country he assisted by these two men treacherously disabled me with a blow on my arm and dragged me here a prisoner  my good friend said the general i am extremely sorry that you have been hurt through an excess of zeal on the part of one of my people but i can scarcely regret this incident painful as it seems since it enables me to assure you that one other virtue besides hospitality still survives in the banda orientáli mean gratitude  i do not understand you i said  we were companions in misfortune a very short time ago he returned have you forgotten the service you did me then  i stared at him astonished at his words and while i looked into his face suddenly that scene at the magistrates estancia when i went with the key to let my fellowtraveller out of the stocks and he jumped up and seized my hand flashed on me still i was not quite sure and half whispered tentatively what marcos marcó  yes he returned smiling that was my name at that moment my friends he continued resting a hand on my shoulder and speaking to the others i have met this young englishman before a few days ago when i was on my way hither i was arrested at las cuevas in his company it was by means of his assistance that i succeeded in making my escape he did this good deed believing at the time that he was helping a poor peasant and not expecting any return  i might have reminded him that only after he had given me a solemn assurance that he did not intend attempting to make his escape did i consent to get his legs out of the stocks however as he thought proper to forget that part of the affair i was not going to recall it to him  there were many surprised exclamations from the bystanders and glancing at that beautiful girl who was standing near with the others i found her dark eyes fixed on my face with an expression of tenderness and sympathy in them that sent the blood rushing to my heart  they have hurt you badly i fear said the general addressing me again to continue your journey now would be imprudent let me beg of you to remain where you are in this house till your arm is better then turning to the young lady he said dolores will you and your mother take charge of my young friend till i return and see that his injured arm is attended to  my general you will make us happy by leaving him in our care she replied with a bright smile  he then introduced me as don ricardo simplyfor he did not know my surnameto the lovely señorita dolores zelaya after which he again bade us adieu and hurried away  when he had gone alday advanced hat in hand and gave me back my revolver which i had forgotten all about i took it with my left hand and put it in my pocket he then apologised for having treated me roughlythe major had taught him that wordbut without the faintest trace of servility in his speech or manner and after that he offered me his hand  which will you have i said the hand you have injured or the left hand  he immediately dropped his own hand to his side then bowing said he would wait till i had recovered the use of my right hand turning to go he added with a smile that he hoped the injury would soon heal so that i would be able to wield a sword in my friend santa colomas cause  his manner i thought was a little too independent pray take back your horse now i said as i have no further use for it and accept my thanks for conducting me thus far on my journey  do not mention it he replied with a dignified wave of his hand i am pleased to have been able to render you this small service     chapter xvi   when alday had left us the charming señorita in whose care i was well pleased to find myself led me into a cool spacious room dimly lighted scantily furnished and with a floor of red tiles it was a great relief to drop into a sofa there for i now felt fatigued and suffered great pain from my arm in a few moments i had the señorita her mother doña mercedes and an old servingwoman all round me gently drawing off my coat they subjected my wounded arm to a minute examination their compassionate fingertipsthose of the lovely dolores especiallyfeeling like a soft cooling rain on the swollen inflamed part which had become quite purple  ah how barbarous of them to hurt you like that a friend too of our general exclaimed my beautiful nurse which made me think that i had involuntarily become associated with the right political party in the state  they rubbed the arm with sweet oil while the old servant brought in a bundle of rue from the garden which being bruised in a mortar filled the room with a fresh aromatic smell with this fragrant herb she made a cooling cataplasm having dressed my arm they placed it in a sling then in place of my coat a light indian poncho was brought for me to wear  i think you are feverish said doña mercedes feeling my pulse we must send for the doctorwe have a doctor in our little town a very skilful man  i have little faith in doctors señora i said but great faith in women and grapes if you will give me a cluster from your vine to refresh my blood i promise to be well very soon  dolores laughed lightly and left the room only to return in a few minutes with a dish full of ripe purple clusters they were delicious and did seem to allay the fever i felt which had probably been caused as much by angry passions as by the blow i had received  while i reclined luxuriously sucking my grapes the two ladies sat on each side of me ostensibly fanning themselves but only i think trying to make the air cooler for me very cool and pleasant they made it certainly but the gentle attentions of dolores were at the same time such as might well create a subtler kind of fever in a mans veinsa malady not to be cured by fruit fans or phlebotomy  who would not suffer blows for such compensation as this i said  do not say such a thing exclaimed the señorita with wonderful animation have you not rendered a great service to our dear generalto our beloved country if we had it in our power to give you everything your heart might desire it would be nothing nothing we must be your debtors for ever  i smiled at her extravagant words but they were very sweet to hear none the less  your ardent love of your country is a beautiful sentiment i remarked somewhat indiscreetly but is general santa coloma so necessary to its welfare  she looked offended and did not reply you are a stranger in our country señor and do not quite understand these things said the mother gently dolores must not forget that you know nothing of the cruel wars we have seen and how our enemies have conquered only by bringing in the foreigner to their aid ah señor the bloodshed the proscriptions the infamies which they have brought on this land but there is one man they have never yet succeeded in crushing always from boyhood he has been foremost in the fight defying their bullets and not to be corrupted by their brazilian gold is it strange that he is so much to us who have lost all our relations and have suffered many persecutions being deprived almost of the means of subsistence that hirelings and traitors might be enriched with our property to us in this house he is even more than to others he was my husbands friend and companion in arms he has done us a thousand favours and if he ever succeeds in overthrowing this infamous government he will restore to us all the property we have lost but ai de mi i cannot see deliverance yet  mamita do not say such a thing exclaimed her daughter do you begin to despair now when there is most reason to hope  child what can he do with this handful of illarmed men returned the mother sadly he has bravely raised the standard but the people do not flock to it ah when this revolt is crushed like so many others we poor women will only have to lament for more friends slain and fresh persecutions and here she covered her eyes with her handkerchief  dolores tossed her head back and made a sudden gesture of impatience  do you then expect to see a great army formed before the ink is dry on the generals proclamation when santa coloma was a fugitive without a follower you hoped now when he is with us and actually preparing for a march on the capital you begin to lose hearti cannot understand it  doña mercedes rose without replying and left the room the lovely enthusiast dropped her head on her hand and remained silent taking no notice of me a cloud of sorrow on her countenance  señorita i said it is not necessary for you to remain longer here only tell me before going that you forgive me for it makes me very unhappy to think that i have offended you  she turned to me with a very bright smile and gave me her hand  ah it is for you to forgive me for hastily taking offence at a light word she said i must not allow anything you say in future to spoil my gratitude do you know i think you are one of those who like to laugh at most things señorno let me call you richard and you shall call me dolores for we must remain friends always let us make a compact then it will be impossible for us to quarrel you shall be free to doubt question laugh at everything except one thing onlymy faith in santa coloma  yes i will gladly make that agreement i replied it will be a new kind of paradise and of the fruit of every tree i may eat except of this tree only  she laughed gaily  i will now leave you she said you are suffering pain and are very tired perhaps you will be able to sleep while speaking she brought a second cushion for my head then left me and before long i fell into a refreshing doze  i spent three days of enforced idleness at the casa blanca as the house was called before santa coloma returned and after the rough experience i had undergone during which i had subsisted on a flesh diet untempered by bread or vegetables they were indeed like days spent in paradise to me then the general came back i was sitting alone in the garden when he arrived and coming out to me he greeted me warmly  i greatly feared from my previous experience of your impatience under restraint that you might have left us he said kindly  i could not do that very well yet without a horse to ride on i returned  well i came here just now to say i wish to present you with a horse and saddle the horse is standing at the gate now i believe but if you are only waiting for a horse to leave us i shall have to regret making you this present do not be in a hurry you have yet many years to live in which to accomplish all you wish to do and let us have the pleasure of your company a few days longer doña mercedes and her daughter desire nothing better than to keep you with them  i promised him not to run away immediately a promise which was not hard to make then we went to inspect my horse which proved to be a very fine bay saddled with a dashing native recado  come with me and try him he said i am going to ride out to the cerro solo  the ride proved an extremely pleasant one as i had not mounted a horse for some days and had been longing to spice my idle hours with a little exhilarating motion we went at a swinging gallop over the grassy plain the general all the time discoursing freely of his plans and of the brilliant prospects awaiting all those timelywise individuals who should elect to link their fortunes with his at this early stage of the campaign  the cerro three leagues distant from the village of el molino was a high conical hill standing quite alone and overlooking the country for a vast distance around a few wellmounted men were stationed on the summit keeping watch and after talking with them for a while the general led me to a spot a hundred yards away where there was a large mound of sand and stone up which we made our horses climb with some difficulty while we stood here he pointed out the conspicuous objects on the surface of the surrounding country telling me the names of the estancias rivers distant hills and other things the whole country about us seemed very familiar to him he ceased speaking at length but continued gazing over the wide sunlit prospect with a strange faroff look on his face suddenly dropping the reins on the neck of his horse he stretched out his arms towards the south and began to murmur words which i could not catch while an expression of mingled fury and exultation transformed his face it passed away as suddenly as it came then he dismounted and stooping till his knee touched the ground he kissed the rock before him after which he sat down and quietly invited me to do the same returning to the subject he had talked about during our ride he began openly pressing me to join him in his march to montevideo which he said would begin almost immediately and would infallibly result in a victory after which he would reward me for the incalculable service i had rendered him in assisting him to escape from the juez of las cuevas these tempting offers which would have fired my brain in other circumstancesthe single state i meani felt compelled to decline though i did not state my real reasons for doing so he shrugged his shoulders in the eloquent oriental fashion remarking that it would not surprise him if i altered my resolution in a few days  never i mentally ejaculated  then he recalled our first meeting again spoke of margarita that marvellously beautiful child asking if i had not thought it strange so fair a flower as that should have sprung from the homely stalk of a sweet potato i answered that i had been surprised at first but had ceased to believe that she was a child of batatas or of any of his kin he then offered to tell me margaritas history and i was not surprised to hear that he knew it  i owe you this he said in expiation of the somewhat offensive remarks i addressed to you that day in reference to the girl but you must remember that i was then only marcos marcó a peasant and having some slight knowledge of acting it was only natural that my speech should be as you find it in our common people somewhat dry and ironical  many years ago there lived in this country one basilio de la barca a person of so noble a figure and countenance that to all those who beheld him he became the type of perfect beauty so that a basilio de la barca came to be a proverbial expression in montevidean society when anyone surpassingly handsome was spoken of though he had a gay lighthearted disposition and loved social pleasures he was not spoilt by the admiration his beauty excited simpleminded and modest he remained always though perhaps not capable of any very strong passion for though he won without seeking it the hearts of many fair women he did not marry he might have married some rich woman to improve his position had he been so minded but in this as in everything else in his life basilio appeared to be incapable of doing anything to advance his own fortunes the de la barcas had once possessed great wealth in land in the country and i have heard descended from an ancient noble family of spain during the long disastrous wars this country has suffered when it was conquered in turn by england portugal spain brazil and the argentines the family became impoverished and at last appeared to be dying out the last of the de la barcas was basilio and the evil destiny which had pursued all of that name for so many generations did not spare him his whole life was a series of calamities when young he entered the army but in his first engagement he received a terrible wound which disabled him for life and compelled him to abandon the military career after that he embarked all his little fortune in commerce and was ruined by a dishonest partner at length when he had been reduced to great poverty being then about forty years old he married an old woman out of gratitude for the kindness she had shown to him and with her he went to live on the seacoast several leagues east of cabo santa maria here in a small rancho in a lonely spot called barranca del peregrine and with only a few sheep and cows to subsist on he spent the remainder of his life his wife though old bore him one child a daughter named transita they taught her nothing for in all respects they lived like peasants and had forgotten the use of books the situation was also wild and solitary and they very seldom saw a strange face transita spent her childhood in rambling over the dunes on that lonely coast with only wild flowers birds and the ocean waves for playmates one day her age being then about eleven she was at her usual pastimes her golden hair blowing in the wind her short dress and bare legs wet with the spray chasing the waves as they retired or flying with merry shouts from them as they hurried back towards the shore flinging a cloud of foam over her retreating form when a youth a boy of fifteen rode up and saw her there he was hunting ostriches when losing sight of his companions and finding himself near the ocean he rode down to the shore to watch the tide coming in  yes i was that boy richardyou are quick in making conclusions this he said not in reply to any remark i had made but to my thoughts which he frequently guessed very aptly  the impression this exquisite child made on me it would be impossible to convey in words i had lived much in the capital had been educated in our best college and was accustomed to associate with pretty women i had also crossed the water and had seen all that was most worthy of admiration in the argentine cities and remember that with us a youth of fifteen already knows something of life this child playing with the waves was like nothing i had seen before i regarded her not as a mere human creature she seemed more like some being from i know not what faroff celestial region who had strayed to earth just as a bird of white and azure plumage and unknown to our woods sometimes appears blown hither from a distant tropical country or island filling those who see it with wonder and delight imagine if you can margarita with her shining hair loose to the winds swift and graceful in her motions as the waves she plays with her sapphire eyes sparkling like sunlight on the waters the tender tints of the seashell in her everchanging countenance with a laughter that seems to echo the wild melody of the sandpipers note margarita has inherited the form not the spirit of the child transita she is an exquisite statue endowed with life transita with lines equally graceful and colours just as perfect had caught the spirit of the wind and sunshine and was all freedom motion firea being half human half angelic i saw her only to love her nor was it a common passion she inspired in me i worshipped her and longed to wear her on my bosom but i shrank then and for a long time after from breathing the hot breath of love on so tender and heavenly a blossom i went to her parents and opened my heart to them my family being well known to basilio i obtained his consent to visit their lonely rancho whenever i could and i on my part promised not to speak of love to transita till her sixteenth year three years after i had found transita i was ordered to a distant part of the country for i was already in the army then and fearing that it would not be possible for me to visit them for a long time i persuaded basilio to let me speak to his daughter who was now fourteen she had by this time grown extremely fond of me and she always looked forward with delight to my visits when we would spend days together rambling along the shore or seated on some cliff overlooking the sea talking of the simple things she knew and of that wonderful faraway city life of which she was never tired of hearing when i opened my heart to her she was at first frightened at these new strange emotions i spoke of soon however i was made happy by seeing her fear grow less in one day she ceased to be a child the rich blood mantled her cheeks to leave her the next moment pale and tremulous her tender lips were toying with the rim of the honeyed cup before i left her she had promised me her hand and at parting even clung to me with her beautiful eyes wet with tears  three years passed before i returned to seek her during that time i sent scores of letters to basilio but received no reply twice i was wounded in fight once very seriously i was also a prisoner for several months i made my escape at last and returning to montevideo obtained leave of absence then with heart afire with sweet anticipations i sought that lonely seacoast once more only to find the weeds growing on the spot where basilios rancho had stood in the neighbourhood i learnt that he had died two years before and that after his death the widow had returned to montevideo with transita after long inquiry in that city i discovered that she had not long survived her husband and that a foreign señora had taken transita away no one knew whither her loss cast a great shadow on my life poignant grief cannot endure for ever nor for very long only the memory of grief endures to this memory which cannot fade it is perhaps due that in one respect at least i am not like other men i feel that i am incapable of passion for any woman no not if a new lucrezia borgia were to come my way scattering the fiery seeds of adoration upon all men could they blossom to love in this arid heart since i lost transita i have had one thought one love one religion and it is all told in one wordpatria  years passed i was captain in general oribes army at the siege of my own city one day a lad was captured in our lines and came very near being put to death as a spy he had come out from montevideo and was looking for me he had been sent he said by transita de la barca who was lying ill in the town and desired to speak to me before she died i asked and obtained permission from our general who had a strong personal friendship for me to penetrate into the town this was of course dangerous and more so for me perhaps than it would have been for many of my brother officers for i was very well known to the besieged i succeeded however by persuading the officers of a french sloop of war stationed in the harbour to assist me these foreigners at that time had friendly relations with the officers of both armies and three of them had at one time visited our general to ask him to let them hunt ostriches in the interior he passed them on to me and taking them to my own estancia i entertained them and hunted with them for several days for this hospitality they had expressed themselves very grateful inviting me repeatedly to visit them on board and also saying that they would gladly do me any personal service in the town which they visited constantly i love not the french believing them to be the most vain and egotistical consequently the least chivalrous of mankind but these officers were in my debt and i resolved to ask them to help me under cover of night i went on board their ship i told them my story and asked them to take me on shore with them disguised as one of themselves with some difficulty they consented and i was thus enabled next day to be in montevideo and with my longlost transita i found her lying on her bed emaciated and white as death in the last stage of some fatal pulmonary complaint on the bed with her was a child between two and three years old exceedingly beautiful like her mother for one glance was sufficient to tell me it was transitas child overcome with grief at finding her in this pitiful condition i could only kneel at her side pouring out the last tender tears that have fallen from these eyes we orientals are not tearless men and i have wept since then but only with rage and hatred my last tears of tenderness were shed over unhappy dying transita  briefly she told me her story no letter from me had ever reached basilio it was supposed that i had fallen in battle or that my heart had changed when her mother lay dying in montevideo she was visited by a wealthy argentine lady named romero who had heard of transitas singular beauty and wished to see her merely out of curiosity she was so charmed with the girl that she offered to take her and bring her up as her own daughter to this the mother who was reduced to the greatest poverty and was dying consented gladly transita was in this way taken to buenos ayres where she had masters to instruct her and lived in great splendour the novelty of this life charmed her for a time the pleasures of a large city and the universal admiration her beauty excited occupied her mind and made her happy when she was seventeen the señora romero bestowed her hand on a young man of that city named andrada a wealthy person he was a fashionable man a gambler and a sybarite and having conceived a violent passion for the girl he succeeded in winning over the señora to aid his suit before marrying him transita told him frankly that she felt incapable of great affection for him he cared nothing for that he only wished like the animal he was to possess her for her beauty shortly after marrying her he took her to europe knowing very well that a man with a full purse and whose spirit is a compound of swine and goat finds life pleasanter in paris than in the plata in paris transita lived a gay but an unhappy life her husbands passion for her soon passed away and was succeeded by neglect and insult after three miserable years he abandoned her altogether to live with another woman and then in broken health she returned with her child to her own country when she had been several months in montevideo she heard casually that i was still alive and in the besieging army and anxious to impart her last wishes to a friend had sent for me  could you my friend could any man divine the nature of that dying request transita wished to make  pointing to her child she said do you not see that margarita inherits that fatal gift of beauty which won for me a life of splendour with extreme bitterness of heart and early death soon before i die perhaps there will not be wanting some new señora romero to take charge of her who will at last sell her to some rich cruel man as i was sold for how can her beauty remain long concealed it was with very different views for her that i secretly left paris and returned here during all the miserable years i spent there i thought more and more of my childhood on that lonely coast until when i fell ill i resolved to go back there to spend my last days on that beloved spot where i had been so happy it was my intention to find some peasant family there who would be willing to take margarita and bring her up as a peasants child with no knowledge of her fathers position and of the life men live in towns the siege and my failing health made it impossible for me to carry out that plan i must die here dear friend and never see that lonely coast where we have sat together so often watching the waves but i think only of poor little margarita now who will soon be motherless will you not help me to save her promise me that you will take her away to some distant place where she will be brought up as a peasants child and where her father will never find her if you can promise me this i will resign her to you now and face death without even the sad consolation of seeing her by me to the last  i promised to carry out her wishes and also to see the child as often as circumstances would allow and when she grew up to find her a good husband but i would not deprive her of the child then i told her that if she died margarita would be conveyed to the french ship in the harbour and afterwards to me and that i knew where to place her with goodhearted simple peasants who loved me and would obey my wishes in all things  she was satisfied and i left her to make the necessary arrangements to carry out my plans a few weeks later transita expired and the child was brought to me i then sent her to batatas house where ignorant of the secret of her birth she has been brought up as her mother wished her to be may she never like the unhappy transita fall into the power of a ravening beast in mans shape  amen i exclaimed but surely if this child will be entitled to a fortune some day it will only be right that she should have it  we do not worship gold in this country he replied with us the poor are just as happy as the rich their wants are so few and easily satisfied it would be too much to say that i love the child more than i love anyone else i think only of transitas wishes that for me is the only right in the matter had i failed to carry them out to the letter then i should have suffered a great remorse possibly i may encounter andrada some day and pass my sword through his body that would give me no remorse  after some moments of silence he looked up and said richard you admired and loved that beautiful girl when you first saw her listen if you wish it you shall have her for a wife she is simpleminded ignorant of the world affectionate and where she is told to love she will love batatas people will obey my wishes in everything  i shook my head smiling somewhat sorrowfully when i thought that the events of the last few days had already half obliterated margaritas fair image from my mind this unexpected proposition had moreover forced on me with a startling suddenness the fact that by once performing the act of marriage a man has for ever used up the most glorious privilege of his sexof course i mean in countries where he is only allowed to have one wife it was no longer in my power to say to any woman however charming i might find her be my wife but i did not explain all this to the general  ah you are thinking of conditions said he there will be none  no you have guessed wrongfor once i returned the girl is all you say i have never seen a being more beautiful and i have never heard a more romantic story than the one you have just told me about her birth i can only echo your prayer that she may not suffer as her mother did in name she is not a de la barca and perhaps destiny will spare her on that account  he glanced keenly at me and smiled perhaps you are thinking more of dolores than of margarita just now he said let me warn you of your danger there my young friend she is already promised to another  absurdly unreasonable as it may seem i felt a jealous pang at that information but then of course we are not reasonable beings whatever the philosophers say  i laughed not very gaily i must confess and answered that there was no need to warn me as dolores would never be more to me than a very dear friend  even then i did not tell him that i was a married man for often in the banda orientál i did not quite seem to know how to mix my truth and lies and so preferred to hold my tongue in this instance as subsequent events proved i held it not wisely but too well the open man with no secrets from the world often enough escapes disasters which overtake your very discreet person who acts on the old adage that speech was given to us to conceal our thoughts     chapter xvii   with a horse to travel on and my arm so much better that the sling supporting it was worn rather for ornament than use there was nothing except that promise not to run away immediately to detain me longer in the pleasant retreat of the casa blanca nothing that is had i been a man of guttapercha or castiron being only a creature of clayvery impressionable clay as it happenedi could not persuade myself that i was quite well enough to start on that long ride over a disturbed country besides my absence from montevideo had already lasted so long that a few days more could not make much difference one way or the other thus it came to pass that i still stayed on enjoying the society of my new friends while every day every hour in fact i felt less able to endure the thought of tearing myself away from dolores  much of my time was spent in the pleasant orchard adjoining the house here growing in picturesque irregularity were fifty or sixty old peach nectarine apricot plum and cherry trees their boles double the thickness of a mans thigh they had never been disfigured by the pruners knife or saw and their enormous size and rough bark overgrown with grey lichen gave them an appearance of great antiquity all about the ground tangled together in a pretty confusion flourished many of those dear familiar old world garden flowers that spring up round the white mans dwelling in all temperate regions of the earth here were immemorial wallflowers stocks and marigolds tall hollyhock gay poppy brilliant bachelors button also half hid amongst the grass pansy and forgetmenot the larkspur red white and blue flaunted everywhere and here too was the unforgotten sweetwilliam looking bright and velvety as of yore yet in spite of its brightness and stiff green collar still wearing the old shamefaced expression as if it felt a little ashamed of its own pretty name these flowers were not cultivated but grew spontaneously from the seed they shed year by year on the ground the gardener doing nothing for them beyond keeping the weeds down and bestowing a little water in hot weather the solstitial heats being now over during which european garden flowers cease to bloom for a season they were again in gayest livery to welcome the long second spring of autumn lasting from february to may at the farther end of this wilderness of flowers and fruit trees was an aloe hedge covering a width of twenty to thirty yards with its enormous disorderly stavelike leaves this hedge was like a strip of wild nature placed alongside of a plot of mans improved nature and here like snakes hunted from the open the weeds and wildings which were not permitted to mix with the flowers had taken refuge protected by that rude bastion of spikes the hemlock opened feathery clusters of dark leaves and whitish umbels wherever it could reach up to the sunshine there also grew the nightshade with other solanaceous weeds bearing little clusters of green and purple berries wild oats foxtail grass and nettles the hedge gave them shelter but no moisture so that all these weeds and grasses had a somewhat forlorn and starved appearance climbing up with long stringy stems among the powerful aloes the hedge was also rich in animal life there dwelt mice cavies and elusive little lizards crickets sang all day long under it while in every open space the green epeiras spread their geometric webs being rich in spiders it was a favourite huntingground of those insect desperadoes the masonwasps that flew about loudly buzzing in their splendid gold and scarlet uniform there were also many little shy birds here and my favourite was the wren for in its appearance and its scolding jerky gesticulating ways it is precisely like our housewren though it has a richer and more powerful song than the english bird on the other side of the hedge was the potrero or paddock where a milchcow with two or three horses were kept the manservant whose name was nepomucino presided over orchard and paddock also to some extent over the entire establishment nepomucino was a pure negro a little old roundheaded bleareyed man about five feet four in height the short lumpy wool on his head quite grey slow in speech and movements his old black or chocolatecoloured fingers all crooked stiffjointed and pointing spontaneously in different directions i have never seen anything in the human subject to equal the dignity of nepomucino the profound gravity of his bearing and expression forcibly reminding one of an owl apparently he had come to look upon himself as the sole head and master of the establishment and the sense of responsibility had more than steadied him the negrine propensity to frequent explosions of inconsequent laughter was not of course to be expected in such a soberminded person but he was i think a little too sedate for a black for although his face would shine on warm days like polished ebony it did not smile everyone in the house conspired to keep up the fiction of nepomucinos importance they had in fact conspired so long and so well that it had very nearly ceased to be a fiction everybody addressed him with grave respect not a syllable of his long name was ever omittedwhat the consequences of calling him nepo or cino or cinito the affectionate diminutive would have been i am unable to say since i never had the courage to try the experiment it often amused me to hear doña mercedes calling to him from the house and throwing the whole emphasis on the last syllable in a long piercing crescendo nepomucinoo sometimes when i sat in the orchard he would come and placing himself before me discourse gravely about things in general clipping his words and substituting r for l in the negro fashion which made it hard for me to repress a smile after winding up with a few appropriate moral reflections he would finish with the remark for though i am black on the surface señor my heart is white and then he would impressively lay one of his old crooked fingers on the part where the physiological curiosity was supposed to be he did not like being told to perform menial offices preferring to anticipate all requests of that kind and do whatever was necessary by stealth sometimes i would forget this peculiarity of the old black and tell him that i wanted him to polish my boots he would ignore the request altogether and talk for a few minutes of political matters or on the uncertainty of all things mundane and by and by glancing at my boots would remark incidentally that they required polishing offering somewhat ostentatiously to have them done for me nothing would make him admit that he did these things himself once i tried to amuse dolores by mimicking his speech to her but quickly she silenced me saying that she loved nepomucino too well to allow even her best friend to laugh at him he had been born when blacks were slaves in the service of her family had carried her in his arms when she was an infant and had seen all the male members of the house of zelaya swept away in the wars of reds and whites but in the days of their adversity his faithful doglike affection had never failed them it was beautiful to see her manner towards him if she wanted a rose for her hair or dress she would not pluck it herself or allow me to get it for her but nepomucino must be asked to get it then every day she would find time to sit down in the garden by his side to tell him all the news of the village and of the country at large discuss the position of affairs with him and ask his advice about everything in the house  indoors or out i generally had dolores for a companion and i could certainly not have had a more charming one the civil warthough the little splutter on the yí scarcely deserved that name yetwas her unfailing theme she was never weary of singing her hero santa colomas praiseshis dauntless courage and patience in defeat his strange romantic adventures the innumerable disguises and stratagems he had resorted to when going about in his own country where a price was set on his head ever labouring to infuse fresh valour into his beaten disheartened followers that the governing party had any right to be in power or possessed any virtue of any kind or were in fact anything but an incubus and a curse to the banda orientál she would not for one moment admit to her mind her country always appeared like andromeda bound on her rock and left weeping and desolate to be a prey to the abhorred colorado monster while ever to the deliverance of this lovely being came her glorious perseus swift as the winds of heaven the lightnings of terrible vengeance flashing from his eyes the might of the immortals in his strong right arm often she tried to persuade me to join this romantic adventurer and it was hard very hard to resist her eloquent appeals and perhaps it grew harder every day as the influence of her passionate beauty strengthened itself upon my heart invariably i took refuge in the argument that i was a foreigner that i loved my country with an ardour equal to hers and that by taking arms in the banda orientál i should at once divest myself of all an englishmans rights and privileges she scarcely had patience to listen to this argument it seemed so trivial to her and when she demanded other better reasons i had none to offer i dare not quote to her the words of sulky achilles  the distant trojans never injured me for that argument would have sounded even weaker to her than the former one she had never read homer in any language of course but she wouldhave quickly made me tell her about achilles and when the end came with miserable hector dragged thrice round the walls of besieged troymontevideo was called modern troy she knewthen she would have turned my argument against me and bidden me go and serve the uruguayan president as achilles served hector seeing me silent she would turn indignantly away only for a moment however the bright smile would quickly return and she would exclaim no no richard i shall not forget my promise though i sometimes think you try to make me do so  it was noon the house was quiet for doña mercedes had retired after breakfast to take her unfailing siesta leaving us to our conversation in that spacious cool room where i had first reposed in the house i was lying on the sofa smoking a cigarette dolores seating herself near me with her guitar said now let me play and sing you to sleep with something very soft but the more she played and sang the further was i from unneeded slumber  what not sleeping yet richard she would say with a little laugh after each song  not yet dolores i would reply pretending to get drowsy but my eyes are getting heavy now one more song will send me to the region of dreams sing me that sweet favourite    desde aquel doloroso momento  at length finding that my sleepiness was all pretence she refused to sing any more and presently we drifted once more into the old subject  ah yes she replied to that argument about my nationality which was my only shield i have always been taught to believe foreigners a cold practical calculating kind of peopleso different from us you never seemed to me like a foreigner ah richard why will you make me remember that you are not one of us tell me dear friend if a beautiful woman cried out to you to deliver her from some great misfortune or danger would you stop to ask her nationality before going to her rescue  no dolores you know that if you for instance were in distress or danger i would fly to your side and risk my life to save you  i believe you richard but tell me is it less noble to help a suffering people cruelly oppressed by wicked men who have succeeded by crimes and treachery and foreign aid in climbing into power will you tell me that no englishman has drawn a sword in a cause like that oh friend is not my mothercountry more beautiful and worthy to be helped than any woman has not god given her spiritual eyes that shed tears and look for comfort lips sweeter than any womans lips that cry bitterly every day for deliverance can you look on the blue skies above you and walk on the green grass where the white and purple flowers smile up at you and be deaf and blind to her beauty and to her great need oh no no it is impossible  ah if you were a man dolores what a flame you would kindle in the hearts of your countrymen  yes if i were a man she exclaimed starting to her feet then i should serve my country not with words only then i would strike and bleed for herhow willingly being only a weak woman i would give my hearts blood to win one arm to aid in the sacred cause  she stood before me with flashing eyes her face glowing with enthusiasm then i also rose to my feet and took her hands in mine for i was intoxicated with her loveliness and almost ready to throw all restraints to the winds  dolores i said are not your words extravagant shall i test their sincerity tell me would you give even as much as one kiss with your sweet lips to win a strong arm for your country  she turned crimson and cast her eyes down then quickly recovering herself answered  what do your words mean speak plainly richard  i cannot speak plainer dolores forgive me if i have offended once more your beauty and grace and eloquence have made me forget myself  her hands were moist and trembling in mine still she did not withdraw them no i am not offended she returned in a strangely low tone put me to the test richard do you wish me to understand clearly that for such a favour as that you would join us  i cannot say i replied still endeavouring to be prudent though my heart was on fire and my words when i spoke seemed to choke me but dolores if you would shed your blood to win one strong arm will you think it too much to bestow the favour i spoke of in the hope of winning an arm  she was silent then drawing her closer i touched her lips with mine but who was ever satisfied with that one touch on the lips for which the heart has craved it was like contact with a strange celestial fire that instantly kindled my love to madness again and yet again i kissed her i pressed her lips till they were dry and burned like fire then kissed cheek forehead hair and casting my arms about her strained her to my breast in a long passionate embrace then the violence of the paroxysm was over and with a pang i released her she trembled her face was whiter than alabaster and covering it with her hands she sank down on the sofa i sat down beside her and drew her head down on my breast but we remained silent only our hearts were beating very fast presently she disengaged herself and without bestowing one glance on me rose and left the room  before long i began to blame myself bitterly for this imprudent outburst i dared not hope to continue longer on the old familiar footing so highspirited and sensitive a woman as dolores would not easily be brought to forget or forgive my conduct she had not repelled me she had even tacitly consented to that one first kiss and was therefore partly to blame herself but her extreme pallor her silence and cold manner had plainly shown me that i had wounded her my passion had overcome me and i felt that i had compromised myself for that one first kiss i had all but promised to do a certain thing and not to do it now seemed very dishonourable much as i shrank from joining the blanco rebels i had proposed the thing myself she had silently consented to the stipulation i had taken my kiss and much more and having now had my delirious evanescent joy i could not endure the thought of meanly skulking off without paying the price  i went out full of trouble and paced up and down in the orchard for two or three hours hoping that dolores might come to me there but i saw no more of her that day at dinner doña mercedes was excessively affable showing clearly that she was not in her daughters confidence she informed me simple soul that dolores was suffering from a grievous headache caused by taking a glass of claret at breakfast after eating a slice of watermelon an imprudence against which she did not omit to caution me  lying awake that nightfor the thought that i had pained and offended dolores made it impossible for me to sleepi resolved to join santa coloma immediately that act alone would salve my conscience and i only hoped that it would serve to win back the friendship and esteem of the woman i had learned to love so well i had no sooner determined on taking this step than i began to see so many advantages in it that it seemed strange i had not taken it before but we lose half our opportunities in life through too much caution a few more days of adventure all the pleasanter for being spiced with danger and i would be once more in montevideo with a host of great and grateful friends to start me in some career in the country yes i said to myself becoming enthusiastic once this oppressive scandalous and besotted colorado party is swept with bullet and steel out of the country as of course it will be i shall go to santa coloma to lay down my sword resuming by that act my own nationality and as sole reward of my chivalrous conduct in aiding the rebellion ask for his interest in getting me placed say at the head of some large estancia in the interior there possibly on one of his own establishments i shall be in my element and happy hunting ostriches eating carne con cuero possessing a tropilla of twenty creamcoloured horses for my private use and building up a modest fortune out of hides horns tallow and other native products at break of day i rose and saddled my horse then finding the dignified nepomucino who was the early bird blackbird of the establishment told him to inform his mistress that i was going to spend the day with general santa coloma after taking a maté from the old fellow i mounted and galloped out of the village of molino  arrived at the camp which had been moved to a distance of four or five miles from el molino i found santa coloma just ready to mount his horse to start on an expedition to a small town eight or nine leagues distant he at once asked me to go with him and remarked that he was very much pleased though not surprised at my having changed my mind about joining him we did not return till late in the evening and the whole of the following day was spent in monotonous cavalry exercises i then went to the general and requested permission to visit the casa blanca to bid adieu to my friends there he informed me that he intended going to el molino the next morning himself and would take me with him the first thing he did on our arrival at the village was to send me to the principal storekeeper in the place a man who had faith in the blanco leader and was rapidly disposing of a large stock of goods at a splendid profit receiving in payment sundry slips of paper signed by santa coloma this good fellow who mixed politics with business provided me with a complete and muchneeded outfit which included a broadcloth suit of clothes soft brown hat rather broad in the brim long ridingboots and poncho going back to the official building or headquarters in the plaza i received my sword which did not harmonise very well with the civilian costume i wore but i was no worse off in this respect than fortynine out of every fifty men in our little army  in the afternoon we went together to see the ladies and the general had a very hearty welcome from both of them as i also had from doña mercedes while dolores received me with the utmost indifference expressing no pleasure or surprise at seeing me wearing a sword in the cause which she had professed to have so much at heart this was a sore disappointment and i was also nettled at her treatment of me after dinner over which we sat talking some time the general left us telling me before doing so to join him in the plaza at five oclock next morning i then tried to get an opportunity of speaking to dolores alone but she studiously avoided me and in the evening there were several visitors ladies from the town with three or four officers from the camp and dancing and singing were kept up till towards midnight finding that i could not speak to her and anxious about my appointment at five in the morning i at length retired sorrowful and baffled to my apartment without undressing i threw myself on my bed and being very much fatigued with so much riding about i soon fell asleep when i woke the brilliant light of the moon shining in at open window and door made me fancy it was already daylight and i quickly sprang up i had no means of telling the time except by going into the large livingroom where there was an old eightday clock making my way thither i was amazed to see on entering it dolores in her white dress sitting beside the open window in a dejected attitude she started and rose up when i entered the extreme pallor of her face heightened by contrast with her long ravenblack hair hanging unbound on her shoulders  dolores do i find you here at this hour i exclaimed  yes she returned coldly sitting down again do you think it very strange richard  pardon me for disturbing you i said i came here to find out the time from your clock  it is two oclock is that all you came for did you imagine i could retire to sleep without first knowing what your motive was in returning to this house have you then forgotten everything  i came to her and sat down by the window before speaking no dolores i said had i forgotten you would not have seen me here enlisted in a cause which i looked on only as your cause  ah then you have honoured the casa blanca with this visit not to speak to methat you considered unnecessarybut merely to exhibit yourself wearing a sword  i was stung by the extreme bitterness of her tone you are unjust to me i said since that fatal moment when my passion overcame me i have not ceased thinking of you grieving that i had offended you no i did not come to exhibit my sword which is not worn for ornament i came only to speak to you dolores and you purposely avoided me  not without reason she retorted quickly did i not sit quietly by you after you had acted in that way towards me waiting for you to speakto explain and you were silent well señor i am here now waiting again  this then is what i have to say i replied after what passed i considered myself bound in honour to join your cause dolores what more can i say except to implore your forgiveness believe me dear friend in that moment of passion i forgot everythingforgot that iforgot that your hand was already given to another  given to another what do you mean richard who told you that  general santa coloma  the general what right has he to occupy himself with my affairs this is a matter that concerns myself only and it is presumption on his part to interfere in it  do you speak in that tone of your hero dolores remember that he only warned me of my danger out of pure friendship but his warning was thrown away my unhappy passion the sight of your loveliness your own incautious words were too much for my heart  she dropped her face on her hands and remained silent  i have suffered for my fault and must suffer more will you not say you forgive me dolores i said offering my hand  she took it but continued silent  say dearest friend that you forgive me that we part friends  oh richard must we part then she murmured  yesnow dolores for before you are up i must be on horseback and on my way to join the troops the march to montevideo will probably commence almost immediately  oh i cannot bear it she suddenly exclaimed taking my hands in both hers let me open my heart to you now forgive me richard for being so angry with you but i did not know the general had said such a thing believe me he imagines more than he knows when you took me in your arms and held me against your breast it was a revelation to me i cannot love or give my hand to any other man you are everything in the world to me now richard must you leave me to mingle in this cruel civil strife in which all my dearest friends and relations have perished  she had had her revelation i now had mine and it was an exceedingly bitter one i trembled at the thought of confessing my secret to her now when she had so unmistakably responded to the passion i had insanely revealed  suddenly she raised her dark luminous eyes to mine anger and shame struggling for mastery on her pale face  speak richard she exclaimed your silence at this moment is an insult to me  for gods sake have mercy on me dolores i said i am not freei have a wife  for some moments she sat staring fixedly at me then flinging my hand from her covered her face presently she uncovered it again for shame was overcome and cast out by anger she rose and stood up before me her face very white  you have a wifea wife whose existence you concealed from me till this moment she said now you ask for mercy when your secret has been wrung from you married and you have dared to take me in your arms to excuse yourself afterwards with the plea of passion passiondo you know what it means traitor ah no a breast like yours cannot know any great or generous emotion would you have dared show your face to me again had you been capable of shame even and you judged my heart as shallow as your own and after treating me in that way thought to win my forgiveness and admiration even by parading before me with a sword leave me i can feel nothing but contempt for you go you are a disgrace to the cause you have espoused  i had sat utterly crushed and humiliated not daring even to raise my sight to her face for i felt that my own unspeakable weakness and folly had brought this tempest upon me but there is a limit to patience even in the most submissive mood and when that was overpassed then my anger blazed out all the more hotly for the penitential meekness i had preserved during the whole interview her words from the first had fallen like whipcuts making me writhe with the pain they inflicted but that last taunt stung me beyond endurance i an englishman to be told that i was a disgrace to the blanco cause which i had joined in spite of my better judgment purely out of my romantic devotion to this very woman i too was now upon my feet and there face to face we stood for some moments silent and trembling at length i found my speech  this i cried from the woman who was ready yesterday to shed her hearts blood to win one strong arm for her country i have renounced everything allied myself with abhorred robbers and cutthroats only to learn that her one desire is everything to her her divine beautiful country nothing i wish that a man had spoken those words to me dolores so that i might have put this sword you speak of to one good use before breaking it and flinging it from me like the vile thing it is would to god the earth would open and swallow up this land for ever though i sank down into hell with it for the detestable crime of taking part in its pirate wars  she stood perfectly still gazing at me with widely dilated eyes a new expression coming into her face then when i paused for her to speak expecting only a fresh outburst of scorn and bitterness a strange sorrowful smile flitted over her lips and coming close to me she placed her hand on my shoulder  oh she said what a strength of passion you are capable of forgive me richard for i have forgiven you ah we were made for each other and it can never never be  she dropped her head dejectedly on my shoulder my anger vanished atthose sad words love only remainedlove mingled with profoundest compassion and remorse for the pain i had inflicted supporting her with my arm i tenderly stroked her dark hair and stooping pressed my lips against it  do you love me so much dolores i said enough even to forgive the cruel bitter words i have just spoken oh i was madmad to say such things to you and shall repent it all my life long how cruelly have i wounded you with my love and my anger tell me dearest dolores can you forgive me  yes richard everything is there any word you can speak any deed you can do and i not forgive it does your wife love you like thatcan you love her as you love me how cruel destiny is to us ah my beloved country i was ready to shed my blood for youjust to win one strong arm to fight for you but i did not dream that this would be the sacrifice required of me look it will soon be time for you to gowe cannot sleep now richard sit down here with me and let us spend this last hour together with my hand in yours for we shall never never never meet again  and so sitting there hand in hand we waited for the dawn speaking many sad and tender words to one another and at last when we parted i held her once more unresisting to my breast thinking as she did that our separation would be an eternal one     chapter xviii   about the stirring events of the succeeding days i have little to relate and no reader who has suffered the malady of love in its acutest form will wonder at it during those days i mixed with a crowd of adventurers returned exiles criminals and malcontents every one of them worth studying the daylight hours were passed in cavalry exercises or in long expeditions about the country while every evening beside the camp fire romantic tales enough to fill a volume were told in my hearing but the image of dolores was ever before my mind so that all this crowded period lasting nine or ten days passed before me like a phantasmagoria or an uneasy dream leaving only a very confused impression on my brain i not only grieved for the sorrow i had occasioned her but mourned also that my own heart had so terribly betrayed me so that for the moment the beautiful girl i had persuaded to fly from home and parents promising her my undying affection had ceased to be what she had been so great was this new inconvenient passion the general had offered me a commission in his tatterdemalion gathering but as i had no knowledge of military matters i had prudently declined it only requesting as a special favour that i might be employed constantly on the expeditions he sent out over the surrounding country to beat up recruits seize arms cattle and horses and to depose the little local authorities in the villages putting creatures of his own in their places this request had been granted so that morning noon and night i was generally in the saddle  one evening i was in the camp seated beside a large fire and gloomily staring into the flames when the other men who were occupied playing cards or sipping maté hastily rose to their feet making the salute then i saw the general standing near gazing fixedly at me motioning to the men to resume their cards he sat down by my side  what is the matter with you he said i have noticed that you are like a different person since you joined us do you regret that step  no i answered and then was silent not knowing what more to say  he looked searchingly at me doubtless some suspicion of the truth was in his mind for he had gone to the casa blanca with me and it was scarcely likely that his keen eyes had failed to notice the cold reception dolores gave me on that occasion he did not however touch on that matter  tell me he said at length what can i do for you  i laughed what can you do except to take me to montevideo i replied  why do you say that he returned quickly  we are not merely friends now as we were before i joined you i said you are my general i am simply one of your men  the friendship remains just the same richard let me know frankly what you think of this campaign since you have now suddenly turned the current of the conversation in that direction  there was a slight sting in the concluding words but i had perhaps deserved it since you bid me speak i said i for one feel very much disappointed at the little progress we are making it seems to me that before you are in a position to strike the enthusiasm and courage of your people will have vanished you cannot get anything like a decent army together and the few men you have are badly armed and undisciplined is it not plain that a march to montevideo in these circumstances is impossible that you will be obliged to retire into the remote and difficult places to carry on a guerilla war  no he returned there is to be no guerilla war the colorados made the orientals sick of it when that archtraitor and chief of cutthroats general rivera desolated the banda for ten years we must ride on to montevideo soon as for the character of my force that is a matter it would perhaps be useless to discuss my young friend if i could import a wellequipped and disciplined army from europe to do my fighting i should do so the oriental farmer unable to send to england for a threshingmachine is obliged to go out and gather his wild mares from the plain to tread out his wheat and i in like manner having only a few scattered ranchos to draw my soldiers from must be satisfied to do what i can with them and now tell me are you anxious to see something done at oncea fight for instance in which we might possibly be the losers  yes that would be better than standing still if you are strong the best thing you can do is to show your strength  he laughed richard you were made for an oriental he said only nature at your birth dropped you down in the wrong country you are brave to rashness abhor restraint love women and have a light heart the castilian gravity you have recently assumed is i fancy only a passing mood  your words are highly complimentary and fill me with pride i answered but i scarcely see their connection with the subject of our conversation  there is a connection nevertheless he returned pleasantly though you refuse a commission from me i am so convinced that you are in heart one of us that i will take you into my confidence and tell you something known to only half a dozen trusted individuals here you rightly say that if we have strength we must show it to the country that is what we are now about to do a cavalry force has been sent against us and we shall engage it before two days are over as far as i know the forces will be pretty evenly balanced though our enemies will of course be better armed we shall choose our own ground and should they attack us tired with a long march or if there should be any disaffection amongst them the victory will be ours and after that every blanco sword in the banda will be unsheathed in our cause i need not repeat to you that in the hour of my triumph if it ever comes i shall not forget my debt to you my wish is to bind you body and heart to this oriental country it is however possible that i may suffer defeat and if in two days time we are all scattered to the winds let me advise you what to do do not attempt to return immediately to montevideo as that might be dangerous make your way by minas to the southern coast and when you reach the department of rocha inquire for the little settlement of lomas de rocha a village three leagues west of the lake you will find there a storekeeper one florentino blancoa blanco in heart as well tell him i sent you to him and ask him to procure you an english passport from the capital after which it will be safe for you to travel to montevideo should you ever be identified as a follower of mine you can invent some story to account for your presence in my force when i remember that botanical lecture you once delivered also some other matters i am convinced that you are not devoid of imagination  after giving some further kind advice he bade me good night leaving me with a strangely unpleasant conviction in my mind that we had changed characters for the nonce and that i had bungled as much in my new part as i had formerly done in my old he had been sincerity itself while i picking up the discarded mask had tied it on probably upside down for it made me feel excessively uncomfortable during our interview to make matters worse i was also sure that it had quite failed to hide my countenance and that he knew as well as i knew myself the real cause of the change he had noticed in me  these disagreeable reflections did not trouble me long and then i began to feel considerable excitement at the prospect of a brush with the government troops my thoughts kept me awake most of the night still next morning when the trumpet sounded its shrill réveillé close at hand i rose quickly and in a much more cheerful mood than i had known of late i began to feel that i was getting the better of that insane passion for dolores which had made us both so unhappy and when we were once more in the saddle the castilian gravity to which the general had satirically alluded had pretty well vanished  no expeditions were sent out that day after we had marched about twelve or thirteen miles eastward and nearer to the immense range of the cuchilla grande we encamped and after the midday meal spent the afternoon in cavalry exercises  on the next day happened the great event for which we had been preparing and i am positive that with the wretched material he commanded no man could have done more than santa coloma though alas all his efforts ended in disaster alas i say not because i took even then any very serious interest in oriental politics but because it would have been greatly to my advantage if things had turned out differently besides a great many poor devils who had been an unconscionable time out in the cold would have come into power and the rascally colorados sent away in their turn to eat the bitter bread of proscription the fable of the fox and the flies might here possibly occur to the reader i however preferred to remember luceros fable of the tree called montevideo with the chattering colony in its branches and to look upon myself as one in the majestic bovine army about to besiege the monkeys and punish them for their naughty behaviour  quite early in the morning we had breakfast then every man was ordered to saddle his best horse for every one of us was the owner of three or four steeds i of course saddled the horse the general had given me which had been reserved for important work we mounted and proceeded at a gentle pace through a very wild and broken country still in the direction of the cuchilla about midday scouts came riding in and reported that the enemy were close upon us after halting for half an hour we again proceeded at the same gentle pace till about two oclock when we crossed the cañada de san paulo a deep valley beyond which the plain rose to a height of about one hundred and fifty feet in the cañada we stopped to water our horses and there heard that the enemy were advancing along it at a rapid pace evidently hoping to cut off our supposed retreat towards the cuchilla crossing the little stream of san paulo we began slowly ascending the sloping plain on the farther side till the highest point was gained then turning we saw the enemy numbering about seven hundred men beneath us spread out in a line of extraordinary length up from the valley they came towards us at a brisk trot we were then rapidly disposed in three columns the centre one numbering about two hundred and fifty men the others about two hundred men each i was in one of the outside columns within about four men from the front my fellowsoldiers who had hitherto been very lighthearted and chatty had suddenly become grave and quiet some of them even looking pale and scared on one side of me was an irrepressible scamp of a boy about eighteen years old a dark little fellow with a monkey face and a feeble falsetto voice like a very old woman i watched him take out a small sharp knife and without looking down draw it across the upper part of his surcingle three or four times but this he did evidently only for practice as he did not cut into the hide seeing me watching he grinned mysteriously and made a sign with head and shoulders thrust forward in imitation of a person riding away at full speed after which he restored his knife to its sheath  you intend cutting your surcingle and running away little coward i said  and what are you going to do he returned  fight i said  it is the best thing you can do sir frenchman said he with a grin  listen i said when the fight is over i will look you up to thrash you for your impertinence in calling me a frenchman  after the fight he exclaimed with a funny grimace do you mean next year before that distant time arrives some colorado will fall in love with you andandand  here he explained himself without words by drawing the edge of his hand briskly across his throat then closing his eyes and making gurgling sounds supposed to be uttered by a person undergoing the painful operation of having his throat cut  our colloquy was carried on in whispers but his pantomimic performance drew on us the attention of our neighbours and now he looked round to inform them with a grin and a nod that his oriental wit was getting the victory i was determined not to be put down by him however and tapped my revolver with my hand to call his attention to it  look at this you young miscreant i said do you not know that i and many others in this column have received orders from the general to shoot down every man who attempts to run away  this speech effectually silenced him he turned as pale as his dark skin would let him and looked round like a hunted animal in search of a hole to hide in  on my other hand a grizzlybearded old gaucho in somewhat tattered garments lit a cigarette and oblivious of everything except the stimulating fragrance of the strongest black tobacco expanded his lungs with long inspirations to send forth thereafter clouds of blue smoke into his neighbours faces scattering the soothing perfume over a third portion of the army  santa coloma rose equal to the occasion swiftly riding from column to column he addressed each in turn and using the quaint expressive phraseology of the gauchos which he knew so well poured forth his denunciations of the colorados with a fury and eloquence that brought the blood with a rush to many of his followers pale cheeks they were traitors plunderers assassins he cried they had committed a million crimes but all these things were nothing nothing compared with that one black crime which no other political party had been guilty of by the aid of brazilian gold and brazilian bayonets they had risen to power they were the infamous pensioners of the empire of slaves he compared them to the man who marries a beautiful wife and sells her to some rich person so as to live luxuriously on the wages of his own dishonour the foul stain which they had brought on the honour of the banda orientál could only be washed away with their blood pointing to the advancing troops he said that when those miserable hirelings were scattered like thistledown before the wind the entire country would be with him and the banda orientál after half a century of degradation free at last and for ever from the brazilian curse  waving his sword he galloped back to the front of his column greeted by a storm of vivas  then a great silence fell upon our ranks while up the slope their trumpets sounding merrily trotted the enemy till they had covered about three hundred yards of the ascending ground threatening to close us round in an immense circle when suddenly the order was given to charge and led by santa coloma we thundered down the incline upon them  soldiers reading this plain unvarnished account of an oriental battle might feel inclined to criticise santa colomas tactics for his men were like the arabs horsemen and little else they were moreover armed with lance and broadsword weapons requiring a great deal of space to be used effectively yet considering all the circumstances i am sure that he did the right thing he knew that he was too weak to meet the enemy in the usual way pitting man against man also that if he failed to fight his temporary prestige would vanish like smoke and the rebellion collapse having decided to hazard all and knowing that in a standup fight he would infallibly be beaten his only plan was to show a bold front mass his feeble followers together in columns and hurl them upon the enemy hoping by this means to introduce a panic amongst his opponents and so snatch the victory  a discharge of carbines with which we were received did us no damage i at any rate saw no saddles emptied near me and in a few moments we were dashing through the advancing lines a shout of triumph went up from our men for our cowardly foes were flying before us in all directions on we rode in triumph till we reached the bottom of the hill then we reined up for before us was the stream of san paulo and the few scattered men who had crossed it and were scuttling away like hunted ostriches scarcely seemed worth chasing suddenly with a great shout a large body of colorados came thundering down the hill on our rear and flank and dismay seized upon us the feeble efforts made by some of our officers to bring us round to face them proved unavailing i am utterly unable to give any clear account of what followed immediately after that for we were all friends and foes mixed up for some minutes in the wildest confusion and how i ever got out of it all without a scratch is a mystery to me more than once i was in violent collision with colorado men distinguished from ours by their uniform and several furious blows with sword and lance were aimed at me but somehow i escaped them all i emptied the six chambers of my colts revolver but whether my bullets did any execution or not i cannot pretend to say in the end i found myself surrounded by four of our men who were furiously spurring their horses out of the fight  whip up captain come with us this way shouted one of them who knew me and who always insisted on giving me a title to which i had no right  as we rode away skirting the hill towards the south he assured me that all was lost in proof of which he pointed to scattered bodies of our men flying from the field in all directions yes we were defeated that was plain to see and i needed little encouragement from my fellowrunaways to spur my horse to its utmost speed had the falcon eye of santa coloma rested on me at that moment he might have added to the list of oriental traits he had given me the unenglish faculty of knowing when i was beaten i was quite as anxious i believe to save my skinthroat we say in the banda orientálas any horseman there not even excepting the monkeyfaced boy with the squeaky voice  if the curious reader thirsting for knowledge will consult the uruguayan histories i daresay he will find a more scientific description of the battle of san paulo than i have been able to give my excuse must be that it was the only battlepitched or otherat which i have ever assisted also that my position in the blanco forces was a very humble one altogether i am not overproud of my soldiering performances still as i did no worse than frederick the great of prussia who ran away from his first battle i do not consider that i need blush furiously my companions took our defeat with the usual oriental resignation you see said one in explanation of his mental attitude there must always be one side defeated in every fight for had we gained the day then the colorados would have lost there was in this remark a sound practical philosophy it could not be controverted it burdened our brains with no new thing and it made us all very cheerful for myself i did not care very much but could not help thinking a great deal of dolores who would now have a fresh grief to increase her pain  for a distance of three or four miles we rode at a fast gallop on the slopes of the cuchilla paused to breathe our horses and dismounting stood for some time gazing back over the wide landscape spread out before us at our backs rose the giant green and brown walls of the sierras the range stretching away on either hand in violet and deep blue masses at our feet lay the billowy green and yellow plain vast as ocean and channelled by innumerable streams while one black patch on a slope far away showed us that our foes were camping on the very spot where they had overcome us not a cloud appeared in the immense heavens only low down in the west purple and rosecoloured vapours were beginning to form staining the clear intense whiteblue sky about the sinking sun over all reigned deep silence until suddenly a flock of orange and flamecoloured orioles with black wings swept down on a clump of bushes hard by and poured forth a torrent of wild joyous music a strange performance screaming notes that seemed to scream jubilant gladness to listening heaven and notes abrupt and guttural mingling with others more clear and soulpiercing than ever human lips drew from reed or metal it soon ended up sprang the vocalists like a fountain of fire and fled away to their roost among the hills then silence reigned once more what brilliant hues what gay fantastic music were they indeed birds or the glad winged inhabitants of a mystic region resembling earth but sweeter than earth and never entered by death upon whose threshold i had stumbled by chance then while the last rich flood of sunshine came over the earth from that red everlasting urn resting on the far horizon i could had i been alone have cast myself upon the ground to adore the great god of nature who had given me this precious moment of life for here the religion that languishes in crowded cities or steals shamefaced to hide itself in dim churches flourishes greatly filling the soul with a solemn joy face to face with nature on the vast hills at eventide who does not feel himself near to the unseen      out of his heart god shall not pass     his image stampèd is on every grass  my comrades anxious to get through the cuchilla were already on horseback shouting to me to mount one more lingering glance over that wide prospectwide yet how small a portion of the bandas twenty thousand miles of everlasting verdure watered by innumerable beautiful streams again the thought of dolores swept like a moaning wind over my heart for this rich prize her beautiful country how weakly and with what feeble hands had we striven where now was her hero the glorious deliverer perseus lying perhaps stark and stained with blood on yon darkening moor not yet was the colorado monster overcome rest on thy rock andromeda i sadly murmured then leaping into the saddle galloped away after my retreating comrades already half a mile away down in the shadowy mountain pass     chapter xix   before it had been long dark we had crossed the range and into the department of minas nothing happened till towards midnight when our horses began to be greatly distressed my companions hoped to reach before morning an estancia still many leagues distant where they were known and would be allowed to lie in concealment for a few days till the storm blew over for usually shortly after an outbreak has been put down an indulto or proclamation of pardon is issued after which it is safe for all those who have taken arms against the constituted government to return to their homes for the time we were of course outlaws and liable to have our throats cut at any moment our poor horses at last became incapable even of a trot and dismounting we walked on leading them by the bridles  about midnight we approached a watercourse the upper part of the rio barriga negrablack belly riverand on coming near it the tinkling of a bell attracted our attention it is the usual thing for every man in the banda orientál to have one mare called madrina in his tropilla or herd of geldings the madrina always carries a bell attached to her neck and at night her forefeet are usually hobbled to prevent her wandering far from home for the horses are always very much attached to her and will not leave her  after listening for a few moments we concluded that the sound came from the bell of a madrina and that her forefeet were bound for the tinkle came in violent jerks as from an animal laboriously hopping along proceeding to the spot we found a tropilla of eleven or twelve duncoloured horses feeding near the river driving them very gently towards the bank where a sharp bend in the stream enabled us to corner them we set to work catching fresh horses fortunately they were not very shy of strangers and after we had caught and secured the madrina they gathered whinnying round her and we were not very long in selecting the five bestlooking duns in the herd  my friends i call this stealing i said though at that very moment i was engaged in hastily transferring my saddle to the animal i had secured  that is very interesting information said one of my comrades  a stolen horse will always carry you well said another  if you cannot steal a horse without compunction you have not been properly brought up cried the third  in the banda orientál said the fourth you are not looked upon as an honest man unless you steal  we then crossed the river and broke into a swift gallop which we kept up till morning reaching our destination a little while before sunrise there was here a fine plantation of trees not far from the house surrounded by a deep ditch and a cactus hedge and after we had taken maté and then breakfast at the house where the people received us very kindly we proceeded to conceal our horses and ourselves in the plantation we found a comfortable little grassy hollow partly shaded with the surrounding trees and here we spread our rugs and fatigued with our exertions soon dropped into a deep sleep which lasted pretty well all day it was a pleasant day for me for i had waking intervals during which i experienced that sensation of absolute rest of mind and body which is so exceedingly sweet after a long period of toil and anxiety during my waking intervals i smoked cigarettes and listened to the querulous pipings of a flock of young blackheaded siskins flying about from tree to tree after their parents and asking to be fed  occasionally the long clear cry of the venteveo a lemoncoloured bird with black head and long beak like a kingfisher rang through the foliage or a flock of pecho amarillos olivebrown birds with bright yellow vests would visit the trees and utter their confused chorus of gay notes  i did not think very much about santa coloma probably he had escaped and was once more a wanderer disguised in the humble garments of a peasant but that would be no new experience to him the bitter bread of expatriation had apparently been his usual food and his periodical descents upon the country had so far always ended in disaster he had still an object to live for but when i remembered dolores lamenting her lost cause and vanished peace of mind then in spite of the bright sunshine flecking the grass the soft warm wind fanning my face andwhispering in the foliage overhead and the merrythroated birds that came to visit me a pang was in my heart and tears came to my eyes  when evening came we were all wide awake and sat till a very late hour round the fire we had made in the hollow sipping maté and conversing we were all in a talkative mood that evening and after the ordinary subjects of banda orientál conversation had been exhausted we drifted into matters extraordinarywild creatures of strange appearance and habits apparitions and marvellous adventures  the manner in which the lampalagua captures its prey is very curious said one of the company named rivarola a stout man with an immense fiercelooking black beard and moustache but who was very mildeyed and had a gentle cooing voice  we had all heard of the lampalagua a species of boa found in these countries with a very thick body and extremely sluggish in its motions it preys on the larger rodents and captures them i believe by following them into their burrows where they cannot escape from its jaws by running  i will tell you what i once witnessed for i have never seen a stranger thing continued rivarola riding one day through a forest i saw some distance before me a fox sitting on the grass watching my approach suddenly i saw it spring high up into the air uttering a great scream of terror then fall back upon the earth where it lay for some time growling struggling and biting as if engaged in deadly conflict withsome visible enemy presently it began to move away through the wood but very slowly and still frantically struggling it seemed to be getting exhausted its tail dragged the mouth foamed and the tongue hung out while it still moved on as if drawn by an unseen cord i followed going very close to it but it took no notice of me sometimes it dug its claws into the ground or seized a twig or stalk with its teeth and it would then remain resting for a few moments till the twig gave away when it would roll over many times on the ground loudly yelping but still dragged onwards presently i saw in the direction we were going a huge serpent thick as a mans thigh its head lifted high above the grass and motionless as a serpent of stone its cavernous bloodred mouth was gaping wide and its eyes were fixed on the struggling fox when about twenty yards from the serpent the fox began moving very rapidly over the ground its struggles growing feebler every moment until it seemed to fly through the air and in an instant was in the serpents mouth then the reptile dropped its head and began slowly swallowing its prey  and you actually witnessed this yourself said i  with these eyes he returned indicating the orbs in question by pointing at them with the tube of the matécup he held in his hand this was the only occasion on which i have actually seen the lampalagua take its prey but its manner of doing it is well known to everyone from hearsay you see it draws an animal towards it by means of its power of suction sometimes when the animal attacked is very strong or very far offsay two thousand yardsthe serpent becomes so inflated with the quantity of air inhaled while drawing the victim towards it  that it bursts i suggested  that it is obliged to stop drawing to blow the wind out when this happens the animal finding itself released from the drawing force instantly sets off at full speed vain effort the serpent has no sooner discharged the accumulated wind with a report like a cannon  no no like a musket i have heard it myself interrupted blas aria one of the listeners  like a musket than it once more brings its power of suction to bear and in this manner the contest continues until the victim is finally drawn into the monsters jaws it is well known that the lampalagua is the strongest of all gods creatures and that if a man stripped to the skin engages one and conquers it by sheer muscular strength the serpents power goes into him after which he is invincible  i laughed at this fable and was severely rebuked for my levity  i will tell you the strangest thing that ever befell me said blas aria i happened to be travelling alonefor reasonson the northern frontier i crossed the river yaguaron into brazilian territory and for a whole day rode through a great marshy plain where the reeds were dead and yellow and the water shrunk into muddy pools it was a place to make a man grow weary of life when the sun was going down and i began to despair of getting to the end of this desolation i discovered a low hovel made of mud and thatched with rushes it was about fifteen yards long with only one small door and seemed to be uninhabited for no person answered me when i rode round it shouting aloud i heard a grunting and squealing within and by and by a sow followed by a litter of young pigs came out looked at me then went in again i would have ridden on but my horses were tired besides a great storm with thunder and lightning was coming up and no other shelter appeared in sight i therefore unsaddled loosed my horses to feed and took my gear into the hovel the room i entered was so small that the sow and her young occupied all the floor there was however another room and opening the door which was closed i went into it and found that it was very much larger than the first also that it contained a dirty bed made of skins in one corner while on the floor was a heap of ashes and a black pot there was nothing else except old bones sticks and other rubbish littering the floor afraid of being caught unawares by the owner of this foul den and finding nothing to eat in it i returned to the first room turned the pigs out of doors and sat down on my saddle to wait it was beginning to get dark when a woman bringing in a bundle of sticks suddenly appeared at the door never sirs have i beheld a fouler more hideous object than this person her face was hard dark and rough like the bark of the ñandubuy tree while her hair which covered her head and shoulders in a tangled mass was of a dry earthy colour her body was thick and long yet she looked like a dwarf for she scarcely had any legs only enormous knees and feet and her garments were old ragged horserugs tied round her body with thongs of hide she stared at me out of a pair of small black rat eyes then setting down her bundle asked me what i wanted i told her i was a tired traveller and wanted food and shelter shelter you can have food there is none she said then taking up her sticks she passed to the inner room and secured it with a bolt on the inside she had not inspired me with love and there was little danger of my attempting to intrude on her there it was a black stormy night and very soon the rain began to fall in torrents several times the sow with her young pigs loudly squealing came in for shelter and i was forced to get up and beat them out with my whip at length through the mud partition separating the two rooms i heard the crackling of a fire which the vile woman was lighting and before long through the chinks came the savoury smell of roast meat that surprised me greatly for i had searched the room and failed to find anything to eat in it i concluded that she had brought in the meat under her garments but where she had got it was a mystery at length i began to doze there were many sounds in my ear as of thunder and wind the pigs grunting at the door and the crackling of the fire in the hags room but by and by other sounds seemed to mingle with thesevoices of several persons talking laughing and singing at length i became wide awake and found that these voices proceeded from the next room some person was playing a guitar and singing then others were loudly talking and laughing i tried to peep through the cracks in the door and partition but could not see through them high up in the middle of the wall there was one large crack through which i was sure the interior could be seen so much red firelight streamed through it i placed my saddle against the partition and all my rugs folded small one above the other until i had heaped them as high as my knees standing on my toes on this pile and carefully clinging to the wall with my fingernails i managed to bring my eyes to a level with the crack and peeped through it the room inside was brightly lighted by a big wood fire burning at one end while on the floor a large crimson cloak was spread on which the people i had heard were sitting with some fruit and bottles of wine before them there was the foul hag looking almost as tall sitting as she had appeared when standing she was playing on a guitar and singing a ballad in portuguese before her on the cloak lay a tall wellformed negro woman wearing only a narrow white cloth round her loins and broad silver armlets on her round black arms she was eating a banana and against her knees which were drawn up sat a beautiful girl about fifteen years old with a dark pale face she was dressed in white her arms were bare and round her head she wore a gold band keeping back her black hair which fell unbound on her back before her on his knees on the cloak was an old man with a face brown and wrinkled as a walnut and beard white as thistledown with one of his hands he was holding the girls arm and with the other offering her a glass of wine all this i saw at one glance and then all of them together turned their eyes up at the crack as if they knew that someone was watching them i started back in alarm and fell with a crash to the ground then i heard loud screams of laughter but i dared not attempt to look in on them again i took my rugs to the farther side of the room and sat down to wait for morning the talking and laughter continued for about two hours then it gradually died away the light faded from the chinks and all was dark and silent no person came out and at last overcome with drowsiness i fell asleep it was day when i woke i rose and walked round the hovel and finding a crack in the wall i peered into the hags room it looked just as i had seen it the day before there was the pot and pile of ashes and in the corner the brutish woman lying asleep in her skins after that i got on to my horse and rode away may i never again have such an experience as i had that night  something was then said about witchcraft by the others all looking very solemn  you were very hungry and tired that night i ventured to remark and perhaps after the woman locked her door you went to sleep and dreamed all that about people eating fruit and playing on the guitar  our horses were tired and we were flying for our lives yesterday returned blas contemptuously perhaps it made us dream that we caught five dun horses to carry us  when a person is incredulous it is useless arguing with him said mariano a small dark greyhaired man i will now tell you a strange adventure i had when i was a young man but remember i do not put a blunderbuss to any mans breast to compel him to believe me for what is is and let him that disbelieves shake his head till he shakes it off and it falls to the ground like a cocoanut from the tree  after i got married i sold my horses and taking all my money purchased two oxcarts intending to make my living by carrying freight one cart i drove myself and to drive the other i hired a boy whom i called mula though that was not the name his godfathers gave him but because he was stubborn and sullen as a mule his mother was a poor widow living near me and when she heard about the oxcarts she came to me with her son and said neighbour mariano for your mothers sake take my son and teach him to earn his bread for he is a boy that loves not to do anything so i took mula and paid the widow for his services after each journey when there was no freight to be had i sometimes went to the lagoons to cut rushes and loading the carts with them we would go about the country to sell the rushes to those who required them to thatch their houses mula loved not this work often when we were all day wading up to our thighs in the water cutting the rushes down close to their roots then carrying them in large bundles on our shoulders to land he would cry complaining bitterly of his hard lot sometimes i thrashed him for it angered me to see a poor boy so fastidious then he would curse me and say that some day he would have his revenge when i am dead he often told me my ghost will come to haunt and terrify you for all the blows you have given me this always made me laugh  at last one day while crossing a deep stream swollen with rains my poor mula fell down from his perch on the shaft and was swept away by the current into deep water and drowned well sirs about a year after that event i was out in search of a couple of strayed oxen when night overtook me a long distance from home between me and my house there was a range of hills running down to a deep river so close that there was only a narrow passage to get through and for a long distance there was no other opening when i reached the pass i fell into a narrow path with bushes and trees growing on either side here suddenly the figure of a young man stepped out from the trees and stood before me it was all in whiteponcho chiripà drawers even its boots and wore a broadbrimmed straw hat on its head my horse stood still trembling nor was i less frightened for my hair rose up on my head like bristles on a pigs back and the sweat broke out on my face like raindrops not a word said the figure only itremained standing still with arms folded on its breast preventing me from passing then i cried out in heavens name who are you and what do you want with mariano montes de oca that you bar his path at this speech it laughed then it said what does my old master not know me i am mula did i not often tell you that some day i should return to pay you out for all the thrashings you gave me ah master mariano you see i have kept my word then it began to laugh again may ten thousand curses light on your head i shouted if you wish for my life mula take it and be for ever damned or else let me pass and go back to satan your master and tell him from me to keep a stricter watch on your movements for why should the stench of purgatory be brought to my nostrils before my time and now hateful ghost what more have you got to say to me at this speech the ghost shouted with laughter slapping its thighs and doubling itself up with mirth at last when it was able to speak it said enough of this fooling mariano i did not intend frightening you so much and it is no great matter if i have laughed a little at you now for you have often made me cry i stopped you because i had something important to say go to my mother and tell her you have seen and spoken with me tell her to pay for another mass for my souls repose for after that i shall be out of purgatory if she has no money lend her a few dollars for the mass and i will repay you old man in another world  this it said and vanished i lifted my whip but needed not to strike my horse for not a bird that has wings could fly faster than he now flew with me on his back no path was before me nor did i know where we were going through rushes and through thickets over burrows of wild animals stones rivers marshes we flew as if all the devils that are on the earth and under it were at our heels and when the horse stopped it was at my own door i stayed not to unsaddle him but cutting the surcingle with my knife left him to shake the saddle off then with the bridle i hammered on the door shouting to my wife to open i heard her fumbling for the tinderbox for the love of heaven woman strike no light i cried santa barbara bendita have you seen a ghost she exclaimed opening to me yes i replied rushing in and bolting the door and had you struck a light you would now have been a widow  for thus it is sirs the man who after seeing a ghost is confronted with a light immediately drops down dead  i made no sceptical remarks and did not even shake my head the circumstances of the encounter were described by mariano with such graphic power and minuteness that it was impossible not to believe his story yet some things in it afterwards struck me as somewhat absurd that straw hat for instance and it also seemed strange that a person of mulas disposition should have been so much improved in temper by his sojourn in a warmer place  talking of ghosts said laralde the other manbut proceeded no further for i interrupted him laralde was a short broadshouldered man with bow legs and bushy grey whiskers he was called by his familiars lechuza owl on account of his immense round tawnycoloured eyes which had a tremendous staring power in them  i thought we had had enough of the supernatural by this time  my friend i said pardon me for interrupting you but there will be no sleep for us tonight if we have any more stories about spirits from the other world  talking of ghosts resumed lechuza without noticing my remark and this nettled me so i cut in once more  i protest that we have heard quite enough about them i said this conversation was only to be about rare and curious things now visitors from the other world are very common i put it to you my friendshave you not all seen more ghosts than lampalaguas drawing foxes with their breath  i have seen that once only said rivarola gravely i have often seen ghosts  the others also confessed to having seen more than one ghost apiece  lechuza sat inattentive smoking his cigarette and when we had all done speaking began again  talking of ghosts  nobody interrupted him this time though he seemed to expect it for he made a long deliberate pause  talking of ghosts he repeated staring around him triumphantly i once had an encounter with a strange being that was not a ghost i was a young man thenyoung and full of the fire strength and courage of youthfor what i am now going to relate happened over twenty years ago i had been playing cards at a friends house and left it at midnight to ride to my fathers house a distance of five leagues i had quarrelled that evening and left a loser burning with anger against the man who had cheated and insulted me and with whom i was not allowed to fight vowing vengeance on him i rode away at a fast gallop the night being serene and almost as light as day for the moon was at its full suddenly i saw before me a huge man sitting on a white horse which stood perfectly motionless directly in my path i dashed on till i came near him then shouted aloud out of my path friend lest i ride over you for i was still raging in my heart  seeing that he took no notice of my words i dug my spurs into my horse and hurled myself against him then at the very moment my horse struck his with a tremendous shock i brought down my iron whiphandle with all the force that was in me upon his head the blow rang as if i had struck upon an anvil while at the same moment he without swerving clutched my cloak with both hands i could feel that they were bony hard hands armed with long crooked sharp talons like an eagles which pierced through my cloak into my flesh dropping my whip i seized him by the throat which seemed scaly and hard between my hands and thus locked together in a desperate struggle we swayed this way and that each trying to drag the other from his seat till we came down together with a crash upon the earth in a moment we were disengaged and on our feet quick as lightning flashed out his long sharp weapon and finding i was too late to draw mine i hurled myselfagainst him seizing his armed hand in both mine before he could strike  for a few moments he stood still glaring at me out of a pair of eyes that shone like burning coals then mad with rage he flung me off my feet and whirled me round and round like a ball in a sling and finally cast me from him to a distance of a hundred yards so great was his strength i was launched with tremendous force into the middle of some thorny bushes but had no sooner recovered from the shock than out i burst with a yell of rage and charged him again for you will hardly believe it sirs by some strange chance i had carried away his weapon firmly grasped in my hands it was a heavy twoedged dagger sharp as a needle and while i grasped the hilt i felt the strength and fury of a thousand fightingmen in me as i advanced he retreated before me until seizing the topmost boughs of a great thorny bush he swung his body to one side and wrenched it out of the earth by the roots swinging the bush with the rapidity of a whirlwind round his head he advanced against me and dealt a blow that would have crushed me had it descended on me but it fell too far for i had dodged under it to close with him and delivered a stab with such power that the long weapon was buried to its hilt in his bosom he uttered a deafening yell and at the same moment a torrent of blood spouted forth scalding my face like boiling water and drenching my clothes through to the skin for a moment i was blinded but when i had dashed the blood from my eyes and looked round he had vanished horse and all  then mounting my horse i rode home and told everyone what had happened showing the knife which i still carried in my hand next day all the neighbours gathered at my house and we rode in company to the spot where the fight had taken place there we found the bush torn up by the roots and all the earth about it ploughed up where we had fought the ground was also dyed with blood for several yards round and where it had fallen the grass was withered up to the roots as if scorched with fire we also picked up a cluster of hairslong wiry crooked hairs barbed at the ends like fishhooks also three or four scales like fishscales only rougher and as large as doubloons the spot where the fight took place is now called la cañada del diablo and i have heard that since that day the devil has never appeared corporeally to fight any man in the banda orientál  lechuzas narrative gave great satisfaction i said nothing feeling half stupid with amazement for the man apparently told it in the full conviction that it was true while the other listeners appeared to accept every word of it with the most implicit faith i began to feel very melancholy for evidently they expected something from me now and what to tell them i knew not it went against my conscience to be the only liar amongst these exceedingly veracious orientals and so i could not think of inventing anything  my friends i began at length i am only a young man also a native of a country where marvellous things do not often happen so that i can tell you nothing to equal in interest the stories i have heard i can only relate a little incident which happened to me in my own country before i left it it is trivial perhaps but will lead me to tell you something about londonthat great city you have all heard of  yes we have heard of london it is in england i believe tell us your story about london said blas encouragingly  i was very youngonly fourteen years old i continued flattering myself that my modest introduction had not been ineffective when one evening i came to london from my home it was in january in the middle of winter and the whole country was white with snow  pardon me captain said blas but you have got the cucumber by the wrong end we say that january is in summer  not in my country where the seasons are reversed i said  when i rose next morning it was dark as night for a black fog had fallen upon the city  a black fog exclaimed lechuza  yes a black fog that would last all days and make it darker than night for though the lamps were lighted in the streets they gave no light  demons exclaimed rivarola there is no water in the bucket i must go to the well for some or we shall have none to drink in the night  you might wait till i finish i said  no no captain he returned go on with your story we must not be without water and taking up the bucket he trudged off  finding it was going to be dark all day i continued i determined to go a little distance away not out of london you will understand but about three leagues from my hotel to a great hill where i thought the fog would not be so dark and where there is a palace of glass  a palace of glass repeated lechuza with his immense round eyes fixed sternly on me  yes a palace of glassis there anything so wonderful in that  have you any tobacco in your pouch mariano said blas  pardon captain for speaking but the things you are telling require a cigarette and my pouch is empty  very well sirs perhaps you will now allow me to proceed i said beginning to feel rather vexed at these constant interruptions a palace of glass large enough to hold all the people in this country  the saints assist us your tobacco is dry as ashes mariano exclaimed blas  that is not strange said the other for i have had it three days in my pocket proceed captain a palace of glass large enough to hold all the people in the world and then  no i shall not proceed i returned losing my temper it is plain to see that you do not wish to hear my story still sirs from motives of courtesy you might have disguised your want of interest in what i was about to relate for i have heard it said that the orientals are a polite people  there you are saying too much my friend broke in lechuza remember that we were speaking of actual experiences not inventing tales of black fogs and glass palaces and men walking on their heads and i know not what other marvels  do you know that what i am telling you is untrue i indignantly asked  surely friend you do not consider us such simple persons in the banda orientál as not to know truth from fable  and this from the fellow who had just told us of his tragical encounter with apollyon a yarn which quite put bunyans narrative in the shade it was useless talking my irritation gave place to mirth and stretching myself out on the grass i roared with laughter the more i thought of lechuzas stern rebuke the louder i laughed until i yelled with laughter slapping my thighs and doubling myself up after the manner of marianos hilarious visitor from purgatory my companions never smiled rivarola came back with the bucket of water and after staring at me for some time said if the tears which they say always follow laughter come in the same measure then we shall have to sleep in the wet  this increased my mirth  if the whole country is to be informed of our hidingplace said blas the timid we were putting ourselves to an unnecessary trouble by running away from san paulo  fresh screams of laughter greeted this protest  i once knew a man said mariano who had a most extraordinary laugh you could hear it a league away it was so loud his name was aniceto but we called him el burro on account of his laugh which sounded like the braying of an ass well sirs he one day burst out laughing like the captain here at nothing at all and fell down dead you see the poor man had aneurism of the heart  at this i fairly yelled then feeling quite exhausted i looked apprehensively at lechuza for this important member of the quartet had not yet spoken  with his immense unspeakably serious eyes fixed on me he remarked quietly and this my friends is the man who says it is wrong to steal horses  but i was past shrieking now even this rich specimen of topsyturvy banda orientál morality only evoked a faint gurgling as i rolled about on the grass my sides aching as if i had received a good bruising     chapter xx   day had just dawned when i rose to join mariano at the fire he had already kindled to heat the water for his early maté i did not like the idea of lying there concealed amongst the trees like some hunted animal for an indefinite time moreover i had been advised by santa coloma to proceed directly to the lomas de rocha on the south coast in the event of a defeat and this now seemed to me the best thing to do it had been very pleasant lying there under the greenwood tree while those veracious stories of hags lampalaguas and apparitions had proved highly entertaining but a long spell a whole month perhaps of that kind of life was not to be thought of and if i did not get to rocha now before the rural police were set to catch runaway rebels it would perhaps be impossible to do so later on i determined therefore to go my own way and after drinking bitter maté i caught and saddled the dun horse i really had not deserved the severe censure lechuza had passed on me the previous evening in reference to horsestealing for i had taken the dun with very little more compunction than one is accustomed to feel in england when borrowing an umbrella on a rainy day to all people in all parts of the world a time comes when to appropriate their neighbours goods is held not only justifiable but even meritorious to israelites in egypt englishmen under a cloud in their own moist island and to orientals running away after a fight by keeping the dun over thirty hours in my possession i had acquired a kind of prescriptive right to it and now began to look on it as my very own subsequent experience of his endurance and other good qualities enables me to endorse the oriental saying that a stolen horse carries you well  bidding farewell to my companions in defeat who had certainly not been frightened out of their imaginations i rode forth just when it was beginning to grow light roads and houses i studiously avoided travelling on at an easy gallop which took me about ten miles an hour till noon then i rested at a small rancho where i fed and watered my horse and recruited my own energies with roast beef and bitter maté on again till dark by that time i had covered about forty miles and began to feel both hungry and tired i had passed several ranchos and estancia houses but was shy of seeking entertainment at any of them and so went farther only to fare worse when the brief twilight was darkening to night i came upon a broad carttrack leading i suppose to montevideo from the eastern part of the country and seeing a long low rancho near it which i recognized as a pulperia or store by the flagstaff planted before it i resolved to purchase some refreshment for myself then to ride on a mile or two and spend the night under the starsa safe roof if an airy one tying my horse to the gate i went into the porchlike projection at the end of the rancho which i found divided from the interior by the counter with its usual grating of thick iron bars to protect the treasures of gin rum and comestibles from drunken or quarrelsome customers as soon as i came into the porch i began to regret having alighted at the place for there standing at the counter smoking and drinking were about a dozen very roughlooking men unfortunately for me they had tied their horses under the shadow of a clump of trees some distance from the gate so that i had missed seeing them on my arrival once amongst them however my only plan was to disguise my uneasiness be very polite get my refreshments then make my escape as speedily as possible they stared rather hard at me but returned my salutation courteously then going to a disengaged corner of the counter i rested my left elbow on it and called for bread a box of sardines and a tumbler of wine  if you will join me señores the table is spread said i but they all declined my invitation with thanks and i began to eat my bread and sardines  they appeared to be all persons living in the immediate neighbourhood for they addressed each other familiarly and were conversing about love matters one of them however soon dropped out of the conversation and edging away from the others stood a little space apart leaning against the wall on the side of the porch farthest from me i began to notice this man very particularly for it was plain to see that i had excited his interest in an extraordinary manner and i did not like his scrutiny he was without exception the most murderouslooking villain i have ever had the misfortune to meet that was the deliberate opinion i came to before i formed a closer acquaintance with him he was a broadchested powerfullooking man of medium height his hands he kept concealed under the large cloth poncho he wore and he had on a slouch hat that just allowed his eyes to be seen under the rim they were truculent yellowishgreen eyes that seemed to grow fiery and dim and fiery again by turns yet never for a single instant were they averted from my face his black hair hung to his shoulders and he also had a bristly moustache which did not conceal his brutal mouth nor was there any beard to hide his broad swarthy jowl his jaws were the only part of him that had any motion while he stood there still as a bronze statue watching me at intervals he ground his teeth after which he would slap his lips together two or three times while a slimy froth most sickening to see gathered at the corners of his mouth  gandara you are not drinking said one of the gauchos turning to him he shook his head slightly without speaking or taking his eyes off my face whereupon the man who had spoken smiled and resumed his conversation with the others  the long intense soultrying scrutiny this brutal wretch had subjected me to came to a very sudden end quick as lightning a long broad knife flashed out from its concealment under his poncho and with one catlike bound he was before me the point of his horrid weapon touching my poncho just over the pit of my stomach  do not move rebel he said in a husky voice if you move one hairs breadth that moment you die  the other men all ceased talking and looked on with some interest but did not offer to interfere or make any remark  for one moment i felt as if an electric shock had gone through me and then instantly i was calmnever in fact have i felt more calm and collected than at that terrible moment tis a blessed instinct of selfpreservation which nature has provided us with feeble timid men possess it in common with the strong and brave as weak persecuted wild animals have it as well as those that are fierce and bloodthirsty it is the calm which comes without call when death suddenly and unexpectedly rises up to stare us in the face it tells us that there is one faint chance which a premature attempt to escape or even a slight agitation will destroy  i have no wish to move friend i said but i am curious to know why you attack me  because you are a rebel i have seen you before you are one of santa colomas officers here you shall stand with this knife touching you till you are arrested or else with this knife in you here you shall die  you are making a mistake i said  neighbours said he speaking to the others but without taking his eyes from my face will you tie this man hand and foot while i stand before him to prevent him from drawing any weapon he may have concealed under his poncho  we have not come here to arrest travellers returned one of the men if he is a rebel it is no concern of ours perhaps you are mistaken gandara  no no i am not mistaken he returned he shall not escape i saw him at san paulo with these eyeswhen did they ever deceive me if you refuse to assist me then go one of you to the alcaldes house and tell him to come without delay while i keep guard here  after a little discussion one of the men offered to go and inform the alcalde when he had left i said my friend may i finish my meal i am hungry and had just begun to eat when you drew your knife against me  yes eat he said only keep your hands well up so that i can see them perhaps you have a weapon at your waist  i have not i said for i am an inoffensive person and do not require weapons  tongues were made to lie he returned truly enough if i see you drop your hand lower than the counter i shall rip you up we shall then be able to see whether you digest your food or not  i began to eat and sip my wine still with those brutal eyes on my face and the keen knifepoint touching my poncho there was now a ghastly look of horrible excitement on his face while his teethgrinding performances became more frequent and the slimy froth dropped continually from the corners of his mouth on to his bosom i dared not look at the knife because a terrible impulse to wrest it out of his hands kept rising in me it was almost too strong to be overcome yet i knew that even the slightest attempt to escape would be fatal to me for the fellow was evidently thirsty for my blood and only wanted an excuse to run me through but what i thought if he were to grow tired of waiting and carried away by his murderous instincts to plunge his weapon into me in that case i should die like a dog without having availed myself of my one chance of escape through overcaution these thoughts were maddening still through it all i laboured to observe an outwardly calm demeanour  my supper was done i began to feel strangely weak and nervous my lips grew dry i was intensely thirsty and longed for more wine yet dared not take it for fear that in my excited state even a very moderate amount of alcohol might cloud my brain  how long will it take your friend to return with the alcalde i asked at length  gandara made no reply a long time said one of the other men i for one cannot wait till he comes and after that he took his departure one by one they now began to drop away till only two men besides gandara remained in the porch still that murderous wretch kept before me like a tiger watching its prey or rather like a wild boar gnashing and foaming and ready to rip up its adversary with horrid tusk  at length i made an appeal to him for i began to despair of the alcalde coming to deliver me friend i said if you will allow me to speak i can convince you that you are mistaken i am a foreigner and know nothing about santa coloma  no no he interrupted pressing the knifepoint warningly against my stomach then suddenly withdrawing it as if about to plunge it intome i know you are a rebel if i thought the alcalde were not coming i would run you through at once and cut your throat afterwards it is a virtue to kill a blanco traitor and if you do not go bound hand and foot from here then here you must die what do you dare to say that i did not see you at san paulothat you are not an officer of santa coloma look rebel i will swear on this cross that i saw you there  suiting the action to the word he raised the hilt of the weapon to his lips to kiss the guard which with the handle formed a cross that pious action was the first slip he had made and gave the first opportunity that had come to me during all that terrible interview before he had ceased speaking the conviction that my time had come flashed like lightning through my brain just as his slimy lips kissed the hilt my right hand dropped to my side and grasped the handle of my revolver under my poncho he saw the movement and very quickly recovered the handle of his knife in another second of time he would have driven the blade through me but that second was all i now required straight from my waist and from under my poncho i fired his knife fell ringing on to the floor he swerved then fell back coming to the ground with a heavy thud over his falling body i leaped and almost before he had touched the ground was several yards away then wheeling round i found the other two men rushing out after me  back i shouted covering the foremost of the two with my revolver  they instantly stood still  we are not following you friend said one but only wish to get out of the place  back or i fire i repeated and then they retreated into the porch they had stood by unconcerned while their cutthroat comrade gandara was threatening my life so that i naturally felt angry with them  i sprang upon my horse but instead of riding away at once stood for some minutes by the gate watching the two men they were kneeling by gandara one opening his clothes to look for the wound the other holding a flaring candle over his ashen corpselike face  is he dead i asked  one of the men looked up and answered it appears so  then i returned i make you a present of his carcass  after that digging my spurs into my horse i galloped away  some readers might imagine after what i had related that my sojourn in the purple land had quite brutalised me i am happy to inform them that it was not so whatever a mans individual character may happen to be he has always a strong inclination in him to reply to an attack in the spirit in which it is made he does not call the person who playfully ridicules his foibles a whitened sepulchre or an unspeakable scoundrel and the same principle holds good when it comes to actual physical fighting if a french gentleman were to call me out i daresay i should go to the encounter twirling my moustache bowing down to the ground all smiles and compliments and that i should select my rapier with a pleasant kind of feeling like that experienced by the satirist about to write a brilliant article while picking out a pen with a suitable nib on the other hand if a murderous brute with truculent eyes and gnashing teeth attempts to disembowel me with a butchers knife the instinct of selfpreservation comes out in all its old original ferocity inspiring the heart with such implacable fury that after spilling his blood i could spurn his loathsome carcass with my foot i do not wonder at myself for speaking those savage words that he was past recall seemed certain yet not a shade of regret did i feel at his death joy at the terrible retribution i had been able to inflict on the murderous wretch was the only emotion i experienced when galloping away into the darknesssuch joy that i could have sung and shouted aloud had it not seemed imprudent to indulge in such expression of feeling     chapter xxi   after my terrible adventure i did not rest badly that night albeit i slept on an empty stomach the sardines counting as nothing and under the vast void sky powdered with innumerable stars and when i proceeded next day on my journey gods light as the pious orientals call the first wave of glory with which the rising sun floods the world had never seemed so pleasant to my eyes nor had earth ever looked fresher or lovelier with the grass and bushes everywhere hung with starry lace sparkling with countless dewy gems which the epeiras had woven overnight life seemed very sweet to me on that morning so softening my heart that when i remembered the murderous wretch who had endangered it i almost regretted that he was now probably blind and deaf to natures sweet ministrations  before noon i came to a large thatched house with clumps of shady trees growing near it also surrounded with brushwood fences and sheep and cattle enclosures  the blue smoke curling peacefully up from the chimney and the white gleam of the walls through the shady treesfor this rancho actually boasted a chimney and whitewashed wallslooked exceedingly inviting to my tired eyes how pleasant a good breakfast with a long siesta in the shade after it would be thought i but alas was i not pursued by the awful phantoms of political vengeance uncertain whether to call or not my horse jogged straight on towards the house for a horse always knows when his rider is in doubt and never fails at such times to give his advice it was lucky for me that on this occasion i condescended to take it i will at all events call for a drink of water and see what the people are like i thought and in a few minutes i was standing at the gate apparently an object of great interest to half a dozen children ranging from two to thirteen years old all staring at me with wideopen eyes they had dirty faces the smallest one dirty legs also for he or she wore nothing but a small shirt the next in size had a shirt supplemented with a trouserslike garment reaching to the knees and so on progressively up to the biggest boy who wore the castoff parental toggery and so instead of having too little on was in a sense overdressed i asked this youngster for a can of water to quench my thirst and a stick of fire to light my cigar he ran into the kitchen or livingroom and by and by came out again without either water or fire papita wishes you to come in to drink maté said he  then i dismounted and with the careless air of a blameless nonpolitical person strode into the spacious kitchen where an immense cauldron of fat was boiling over a big fire on the hearth while beside it ladle in hand sat a perspiring greasylooking woman of about thirty she was engaged in skimming the fat and throwing the scum on the fire which made it blaze with a furious joy and loudly cry out in a crackling voice for more and from head to feet she was literally bathed in greasecertainly the most greasy individual i had ever seen it was not easy under the circumstances to tell the colour of her skin but she had fine large juno eyes and her mouth was unmistakably goodhumoured as she smiled when returning my salutation her husband sat on the clay floor against the wall his bare feet stretched straight out before him while across his lap lay an immense surcingle twenty inches broad at least of a pure white untanned hide and on it he was laboriously working a design representing an ostrich hunt with threads of black skin he was a short broadshouldered man with reddishgrey hair stiff bristly whiskers and moustache of the same hue sharp blue eyes and a nose decidedly upturned  he wore a red cotton handkerchief tied on his head a blue check shirt and a shawl wound round his body in place of the chiripà usually worn by native peasants he jerked out his buen dia to me in a short quick barking voice and invited me to sit down  cold water is bad for the constitution at this hour he said we will drink maté  there was such a rough burrlike sound in his speech that i at once concluded he was a foreigner or hailed from some oriental district corresponding to our durham or northumberland  thank you i said a maté is always welcome i am an oriental in that respect if in nothing else for i wished everyone i met to know that i was not a native  right my friend he exclaimed maté is the best thing in this country as for the people they are not worth cursing  how can you say such a thing i returned you are a foreigner i suppose but your wife is surely an oriental  the juno of the greasepot smiled and threw a ladleful of tallow on the fire to make it roar possibly this was meant for applause  he waved his hand deprecatingly the bradawl used for his work in it  true friend she is he replied women like horned cattle are much the same all the world over they have their value wherever you find themamerica europe asia we know it i spoke of men  you scarcely do women justice    la mujer es un angel del cielo  i returned quoting the old spanish song  he barked out a short little laugh  that does very well to sing to a guitar he said  talking of guitars spoke the woman addressing me for the first time while we are waiting for the maté perhaps you will sing us a ballad the guitar is lying just behind you  señora i do not play on it i answered an englishman goes forth into the world without that desire common to people of other nations of making himself agreeable to those he may encounter on his way this is why he does not learn to perform on musical instruments  the little man stared at me then deliberately disencumbering himself of surcingle threads and implements he got up advanced to me and held out his hand  his grave manner almost made me laugh taking his hand in mine i said  what am i to do with this my friend  shake it he replied we are countrymen  we then shook hands very vigorously for some time in silence while his wife looked on with a smile and stirred the fat  woman he said turning to her leave your grease till tomorrow breakfast must be thought of is there any mutton in the house  half a sheeponly she replied  that will do for one meal said he here teofilo run and tell anselmo to catch two pulletsfat ones mind to be plucked at once you may look for half a dozen fresh eggs for your mother to put in the stew and felipe go find cosme and tell him to saddle the roan pony to go to the store at once now wife what is wantedrice sugar vinegar oil raisins pepper saffron salt cloves cummin seed wine brandy  stop one moment i cried if you think it necessary to get provisions enough for an army to give me breakfast i must tell you that i draw the line at brandy i never touch itin this country  he shook hands with me again  you are right he said always stick to the native drink wherever you are even if it is black draught whisky in scotland in the banda orientál rumthats my rule  the place was now in a great commotion the children saddling ponies shouting in pursuit of fugitive chickens and my energetic host ordering his wife about  after the boy was despatched for the things and my horse taken care of we sat for half an hour in the kitchen sipping maté and conversing very agreeably then my host took me out into his garden behind the house to be out of his wifes way while she was engaged cooking breakfast and there he began talking in english  twentyfive years i have been on this continent said he telling me his history eighteen of them in the banda orientál  well you have not forgotten your language i said i suppose you read  read what i would as soon think of wearing trousers no no my friend

children are healthy happy children if a bee stings you in england you clap on fresh dirt to cure the pain here we cure all kinds of pain with dirt if my child is ill i dig up a spadeful of fresh mould and rub it wellbest remedy out im not religious but i remember one miracle the saviour spat on the ground and made mud with the spittle to anoint the eyes of the blind man made him see directly what does that mean common remedyof the country of course he didnt need the clay but followed the custom same as in the other miracles in scotland dirts wickednesshowd they reconcile that with scripture i dont say nature mind i say scripture because the bibles the book they swear by though they didnt write it  i shall think over what you say about children and the best way to rear them i returned i neednt decide in a hurry as i havent any yet  he barked his short laugh and led me back to the house where the arrangements for breakfast were now completed the children took their meal in the kitchen we had ours in a large cool room adjoining it there was a small table laid with a spotless white cloth and real crockery plates and real knives and forks there were also real glass tumblers bottles of spanish wine and snowwhite pan creollo evidently my hostess had made good use of her time she came in immediately after we were seated and i scarcely recognized her for she was not only clean now but goodlooking as well with that rich olive colour on her oval face her black hair well arranged and her dark eyes full of tender loving light she was now wearing a white merino dress with a quaint marooncoloured pattern on it and a white silk kerchief fastened with a gold brooch at her neck it was pleasant to look at her and noticing my admiring glances she blushed when she sat down then laughed the breakfast was excellent roast mutton to begin then a dish of chickens stewed with rice nicely flavoured and coloured with red spanish pimenton a fowl roasted or boiled as we eat them in england is wasted compared with this delicious guiso de potto which one gets in any rancho in the banda orient after the meats we sat for an hour cracking walnuts sipping wine smoking cigarettes and telling amusing stories and i doubt whether there were three happier people in all uruguay that morning than the unscotched scotchman john carrickfergus his undingdonging native wife and their guest who had shot his man on the previous evening  after breakfast i spread my poncho on the dry grass under a tree to sleep the siesta my slumbers lasted a long time and on waking i was surprised to find my host and hostess seated on the grass near me he busy ornamenting his surcingle she with the matécup in her hand and a kettle of hot water beside her she was drying her eyes i fancied when i opened mine  awake at last cried don juan pleasantly come and drink maté wife just been crying you see  she made a sign for him to hold his peace  why not speak of it candelaria he said where is the harm you see my wife thinks you have been in the warsa santa coloma man running away to save his throat  how does she make that out i asked in some confusion and very much surprised  how dont you know women you said nothing about where you had beenprudence that was one thing looked confused when we talked of the revolutionnot a word to say about it more evidence your poncho lying there shows two big cuts in it torn by thorns said i swordcuts said she we were arguing about it when you woke  she guessed rightly i said and i am ashamed of myself for not telling you before but why should your wife cry  woman likewoman like he answered waving his hand always ready to cry over the beaten onethat is the only politics they know  did i not say that woman is an angel from heaven i returned then taking her hand i kissed it this is the first time i have kissed a married womans hand but the husband of such a wife will know better than to be jealous  jealousha ha he laughed it would have made me prouder if you had kissed her cheek  juana nice thing to say exclaimed his wife slapping his hand tenderly  then while we sipped maté i told them the history of my campaign finding it necessary when explaining my motives for joining the rebels to make some slight deviations from the strictest form of truth he agreed that my best plan was to go on to rocha to wait there for a passport before proceeding to montevideo but i was not allowed to leave them that day and while we talked over our maté candelaria deftly repaired the telltale cuts in my poncho  i spent the afternoon making friends with the children who proved to be very intelligent and amusing little beggars telling them some nonsensical stories i invented and listening to their birdsnesting armadillochasing and other adventures then came a late dinner after which the children said their prayers and retired then we smoked and sang songs without an accompaniment and i finished a happy day by sinking to sleep in a soft clean bed  i had announced my intention of leaving at daybreak next morning and when i woke finding it already light i dressed hastily and going out found my horse already saddled standing with three other saddled horses at the gate in the kitchen i found don juan his wife and the two biggest boys having their early maté my host told me that he had been up an hour and was only waiting to wish me a prosperous journey before going out to gather up his cattle he at once wished me goodbye and with his two boys went off leaving me to partake of poached eggs and coffeequite an english breakfast  i then rose and thanked the good señora for her hospitality  one moment she said when i held out my hand and drawing a small silk bag from her bosom she offered it to me my husband has given me permission to present you with this at parting it is only a small gift but while you are in this trouble and away from all your friends it perhaps might be of use to you  i did not wish to take money from her after all the kind treatment i had received and so allowed the purse to lie on my open hand where she had placed it  and if i cannot accept it i began  then you will hurt me very much she replied could you do that after the kind words you spoke yesterday  i could not resist but after putting the purse away took her hand and kissed it  goodbye candelaria i said you have made me love your country and repent every harsh word i have ever spoken against it  her hand remained in mine she stood smiling and did not seem to think the last word had been spoken yet then seeing her there looking so sweet and loving and remembering the words her husband had spoken the day before i stooped and kissed her cheek and lips  adieu my friend and god be with you she said  i think there were tears in her eyes when i left her but i could not see clearly for mine also had suddenly grown dim  and only the day before i had felt amused at the sight of this woman sitting hot and greasy over her work and had called her juno of the greasepot now after an acquaintance of about eighteen hours i had actually kissed hera wife and the mother of six children bidding her adieu with trembling voice and moist eyes i know that i shall never forget those eyes full of sweet pure affection and tender sympathy looking into mine all my life long shall i think of candelaria loving her like a sister could any woman in my own ultracivilised and excessively proper country inspire me with a feeling like that in so short a time i fancy not oh civilisation with your million conventions soul and body withering prudishnesses vain education for the little ones going to church in best black clothes unnatural craving for cleanliness feverish striving after comforts that bring no comfort to the heart are you a mistake altogether candelaria and that genial runaway john carrickfergus make me think so ah yes we are all vainly seeking after happiness in the wrong way it was with us once and ours but we despised it for it was only the old common happiness which nature gives to all her children and we went away from it in search of another grander kind of happiness which some dreamerbacon or anotherassured us we should find we had only to conquer nature find out her secrets make her our obedient slave then the earth would be eden and every man adam and every woman eve we are still marching bravely on conquering nature but how weary and sad we are getting the old joy in life and gaiety of heart have vanished though we do sometimes pause for a few moments in our long forced march to watch the labours of some pale mechanician seeking after perpetual motion and indulge in a little dry cackling laugh at his expense     chapter xxii   after leaving john and candelarias home of liberty and love nothing further worth recording happened till i had nearly reached the desired haven of the lomas de rocha a place which i was after all never destined to see except from a great distance a day unusually brilliant even for this bright climate was drawing to a close it being within about two hours of sunset when i turned out of my way to ascend a hill with a very long ridgelike summit falling away at one end appearing like the last sierra of a range just where it dies down into the level plain only in this instance the range itself did not exist the solitary hill was covered with short tussocks of yellow wiry grass with occasional bushes while near the summit large slabs of sandstone appeared just above the surface looking like gravestones in some old village churchyard with all their inscriptions obliterated by time and weather from this elevation which was about a hundred feet above the plain i wished to survey the country before me for i was tired and hungry so was my horse and i was anxious to find a restingplace before night before me the country stretched away in vast undulations towards the ocean which was not however in sight not the faintest stain of vapour appeared on the immense crystalline dome of heaven while the stillness and transparency of the atmosphere seemed almost preternatural a blue gleam of water southeast of where i stood and many leagues distant i took to be the lake of rocha on the western horizon were faint blue cloudlike masses with pearly peaks they were not clouds however but the sierras of the range weirdly named cuchilla de las animasghosthaunted mountains at length like a person who puts his binocular into his pocket and begins to look about him i recalled my vision from its wanderings over illimitable space to examine the objects close at hand on the slope of the hill sixty yards from my standpoint were some deep green dwarf bushes each bush looking in that still brilliant sunshine as if it had been hewn out of a block of malachite and on the pale purple solanaceous flowers covering them some humblebees were feeding it was the humming of the bees coming distinctly to my ears that first attracted my attention to the bushes for so still was the atmosphere that at that distance apartsixty yardstwo persons might have conversed easily without raising their voices much farther down about two hundred yards from the bushes a harrier hawk stood on the ground tearing at something it had captured feeding in that savage suspicious manner usual with hawks with long pauses between the bites over the harrier hovered a brown milvago hawk a vulturelike bird in its habits that lives by picking up unconsidered trifles envious at the others good fortune or fearing perhaps that not even the crumbs or feathers of the feast were going to be left it was persecuting the harrier by darting down at intervals with an angry cry and aiming a blow with its wing the harrier methodically ducked its head each time its tormentor rushed down at it after which it would tear its prey again in its uncomfortable manner farther away in the depression running along at the foot of the hill meandered a small stream so filled with aquatic grasses and plants that the water was quite concealed its course appearing like a vivid green snake miles long lying there basking in the sunshine at the point of the stream nearest to me an old man was seated on the ground apparently washing himself for he was stooping over a little pool of water while behind him stood his horse with patient drooping head occasionally switching off the flies with its tail a mile farther on stood a dwelling which looked to me like an old estancia house surrounded by large shade trees growing singly or in irregular clumps it was the only house near but after gazing at it for some time i concluded that it was uninhabited for even at that distance i could see plainly that there were no human beings moving about it no horse or other domestic animal near and there were certainly no hedges or enclosures of any description  slowly i went down the hill and to the old man sitting beside the stream i found him engaged in the seemingly difficult operation of disentangling a luxuriant crop of very long hair which had somehowpossibly from long neglectgot itself into great confusion he had dipped his head into the water and with an old comb boasting about seven or eight teeth was laboriously and with infinite patience drawing out the long hairs a very few at a time after saluting him i lit a cigarette and leaning on the neck of my horse watched his efforts for some time with profound interest he toiled away in silence for five or six minutes then dipped his head in the water again and while carefully wringing the wet out he remarked that my horse looked tired  yes i replied so is his rider can you tell me who lives in that estancia  my master he returned laconically  is he a goodhearted manone who will give shelter to a stranger i asked  he took a very long time to answer me then said  he has nothing to say about such matters  an invalid i remarked  another long pause then he shook his head and tapped his forehead significantly after which he resumed his mermaid task  demented said i  he elevated an eyebrow and shrugged his shoulders but said nothing  after a long silence for i was anxious not to irritate him with too much questioning i ventured to remark  well they will not set the dogs on me will they  he grinned and said that it was an establishment without dogs  i paid him for his information with a cigarette which he took very readily and seemed to think smoking a pleasant relief after his disentangling labours  an estancia without dogs and where the master has nothing to saythat sounds strange i remarked tentatively but he puffed on in silence  what is the name of the house i said after remounting my horse  it is a house without a name he replied and after this rather unsatisfactory interview i left him and slowly went on to the estancia  on approaching the house i saw that there had formerly been a large plantation behind it of which only a few dead stumps now remained the ditches that had enclosed them being now nearly obliterated the place was ruinous and overgrown with weeds dismounting i led my horse along a narrow path through a perfect wilderness of wild sunflowers horehound redweed and thornapple up to some poplar trees where there had once been a gate of which only two or three broken posts remained standing in the ground from the old gate the path ran on still through weeds to the door of the house which was partly of stone and partly of red brick with a very steep sloping tiled roof beside the ruined gate leaning against a post with the hot afternoon sun shining on her uncovered head stood a woman in a rustyblack dress she was about twentysix or twentyseven years old and had an unutterably weary desponding expression on her face which was colourless as marble except for the purple stains under her large dark eyes she did not move when i approached her but raised her sorrowful eyes to my face apparently feeling little interest in my arrival  i took off my hat to salute her and said  señora my horse is tired and i am seeking for a restingplace can i have shelter under your roof  yes caballero why not she returned in a voice even more significant of sorrow than her countenance  i thanked her and waited for her to lead the way but she still remained standing before me with eyes cast down and a hesitating troubled look on her face  señora i began if a strangers presence in the house would be inconvenient  no no señor it is not that she interrupted quickly then sinking her voice almost to a whisper she said tell me señor have you come from the department of florida have youhave you been at san paulo  i hesitated a little then answered that i had  on which side she asked quickly with a strange eagerness in her voice  ah señora i returned why do you ask me only a poor traveller who comes for a nights shelter such a question  why perhaps for your good señor remember women are not like menimplacable a shelter you shall have señor but it is best that i should know  you are right i returned forgive me for not answering you at once i was with santa colomathe rebel  she held out her hand to me but before i could take it withdrew it and covering her face began to cry presently recovering herself and turning towards the house she asked me to follow  her gestures and tears had told me eloquently enough that she too belonged to the unhappy blanco party  have you then lost some relation in this fight señora i asked  no señor she replied but if our party had triumphed perhaps deliverance would have come to me ah no i lost my relations long agoall except my father you shall know presently when you see him why our cruel enemies refrained from shedding his blood  by that time we had reached the house there had once been a verandah to it but this had long fallen away leaving the walls doors and windows exposed to sun and rain lichen covered the stone walls while in the crevices and over the tiled roof weeds and grass had flourished but this vegetation had died with the summer heats and was now parched and yellow she led me into a spacious room so dimly lighted from the low door and one small window that it seemed quite dark to me coming from the bright sunlight i stood for a few moments trying to accustom my eyes to the gloom while she advancing to the middle of the apartment bent down and spoke to an aged man seated in a leatherbound easychair  papa she said i have brought in a young mana stranger who has asked for shelter under our roof welcome him papa  then she straightened herself and passing behind the chair stood leaning on it facing me  i wish you good day señor i said advancing with a little hesitation  there before me sat a tall bent old man wasted almost to a skeleton with a grey desolate face and long hair and beard of a silver whiteness he was wrapped in a lightcoloured poncho and wore a black skullcap on his head when i spoke he leant back in his seatand began scanning my face with strangely fierce eager eyes all the time twisting his long thin fingers together in a nervous excited manner  what calixto he exclaimed at length is this the way you come into my presence ha you thought i would not recognise you downdown boy on your knees  i glanced at his daughter standing behind him she was watching my face anxiously and made a slight inclination with her head  taking this as an intimation to obey the old mans commands i went down on my knees and touched my lips to the hand he extended  may god give you grace my son he said with tremulous voice then he continued what did you expect to find your old father blind then i would know you amongst a thousand calixto ah my son my son why have you kept away so long stand my son and let me embrace you  he rose up tottering from his chair and threw his arm about me then after gazing into my face for some moments deliberately kissed me on both cheeks  ha calixto he continued putting his trembling hands upon my shoulders and gazing into my face out of his wild sunken eyes do i need ask where you have been where should a peralta be but in the smoke of the battle in the midst of carnage fighting for the banda orientál i did not complain of your absence calixtodemetria will tell you that i was patient through all these years for i knew you would come back to me at last wearing the laurel wreath of victory and i calixto what have i worn sitting here a crown of nettles yes for a hundred years i have worn ityou are my witness demetria my daughter that i have worn this crown of stingingnettles for a hundred years  he sank back apparently exhausted in his chair and i uttered a sigh of relief thinking the interview was now over but i was mistaken his daughter placed a chair for me at his side sit here señor and talk to my father while i have your horse taken care of she whispered and then quickly glided from the room this was rather hard on me i thought but while whispering those few words she touched my hand lightly and turned her wistful eyes with a grateful look on mine and i was glad for her sake that i had not blundered  presently the old man roused himself again and began talking eagerly asking me a hundred wild questions to which i was compelled to reply still trying to keep up the character of the longlost son just returned victorious from the wars  tell me where you have fought and overcome the enemy he exclaimed raising his voice almost to a scream where have they flown from you like chaff before the windwhere have you trodden them down under your horses hoofsnamename the places and the battles to me calixto  i felt strongly inclined just then to jump up and rush out of the room so trying was this mad conversation to my nerves but i thought of his daughter demetrias white pathetic face and restrained the impulse then in sheer desperation i began to talk madly as himself i thought i would make him sick of warlike subjects everywhere i cried we had defeated slaughtered scattered to the four winds of heaven the infamous colorados from the sea to the brazilian frontier we have been victorious with sword lance and bayonet we have stormed and taken every town from tacuarembó to montevideo every river from the yaguaron to the uruguay had run red with colorado blood in forests and sierras we had hunted them flying like wild beasts from us we had captured them in thousands only to cut their throats crucify them blow them from guns and tear them limb by limb to pieces with wild horses  i was only pouring oil on the blazing fire of his insanity  aha he shouted his eyes sparkling while he wildly clutched my arm with his skinny clawlike hands did i not knowhave i not said it did i not fight for a hundred years wading through blood every day and then at last send you forth to finish the battle and every day our enemies came and shouted in my ears victoryvictory they told me you were dead calixtothat their weapons had pierced you that they had given your flesh to be devoured of wild dogs and i shouted with laughter to hear them i laughed in their faces and clapped my hands and cried out prepare your throats for the sword traitors slaves assassins for a peraltaeven calixto devoured of wild dogsis coming to execute vengeance what will god not leave one strong arm to strike at the tyrants breastone peralta in all this land fly miscreants die wretches he has risen from the gravehe has come back from hell armed with hellfire to burn your towns to ashesto extirpate you utterly from the earth  his thin tremulous voice had risen towards the close of this mad speech to a reedy shriek that rang through the quiet darkening house like the long shrill cry of some waterfowl heard at night in the desolate marshes  then he loosened his hold on my arm and dropped back moaning and shivering into his seat his eyes closed his whole frame trembled and he looked like a person just recovering from an epileptic fit then he seemed to sink to sleep it was now getting quite dark for the sun had been down some time and it was with the greatest relief that i saw doña demetria gliding like a ghost into the room she touched me on the arm and whispered come señor he is asleep now  i followed her out into the fresh air which had never seemed so fresh before then turning to me she hurriedly whispered remember señor that what you have told me is a secret say not one word of it to any other person here     chapter xxiii   she then led me to the kitchen at the end of the house it was one of those roomy oldfashioned kitchens still to be found in a few estancia houses built in colonial times in which the fireplace raised a foot or two above the floor extends the whole width of the room it was large and dimly lighted the walls and rafters black with a centurys smoke and abundantly festooned with sooty cobwebs but a large cheerful fire blazed on the hearth while before it stood a tall gaunt woman engaged in cooking the supper and serving maté this was ramona an old servant on the estancia  there also sat my friend of the tangled tresses which he had evidently succeeded in combing well out for they now hung down quite smooth on his back and as long as a womans hair another person was also seated near the fire whose age might have been anything from twentyfive to fortyfive for he had i think a mixture of indian blood in his veins and one of those smooth dry dark faces that change but little with age he was an undersized wirylooking man with a small intensely black moustache but no whiskers or beard he seemed to be a person of some consequence in the house and when my conductress introduced him to me as don hilario he rose to his feet and received me with a profound bow in spite of his excessive politeness i conceived a feeling of distrust towards him from the moment i saw him and this was because his small watchful eyes were perpetually glancing at my face in a furtive manner only to glance swiftly away again whenever i looked at him for he seemed quite incapable of meeting the gaze of another we drank maté and talked a little but were not a lively party doña demetria though she sat with us scarcely contributed a word to the conversation while the longhaired mansantos by name and the only peon on the establishmentsmoked his cigarette and sipped his maté in absolute silence  bony old ramona at length dished up the supper and carried it out of the kitchen we followed to the large livingroom where i had been before and gathered round a small table for these people though apparently povertystricken ate their meals after the manner of civilised beings at the head of the table sat the fierce old whitehaired man staring at us out of his sunken eyes as we entered half rising from his seat he mentioned to me to take a chair near him then addressing don hilario who sat opposite he said this is my son calixto just returned from the wars where as you know he has greatly distinguished himself  don hilario rose and bowed gravely demetria took the other end of the table while santos and ramona occupied the two remaining seats  i was greatly relieved to find that the old mans mood had changed there were no more wild outbursts like the one i had witnessed earlier in the evening only occasionally he would fix his strange burning eyes on me in a way that made me exceedingly uncomfortable we began the meal with broth which we finished in silence and while we ate don hilarios swift glances incessantly flew from face to face demetria pale and evidently ill at ease keeping her eyes cast down all the time  is there no wine this evening ramona asked the old man in querulous tones when the old woman rose to remove the broth basins  the master has not ordered me to put any on the table she replied with asperity and strongly emphasising the obnoxious word  what does this mean don hilario said the old man turning to his neighbour my son has just returned after a long absence are we to have no wine for an occasion like this  don hilario with a faint smile on his lips drew a key from his pocket and passed it silently to ramona she rose muttering from the table and proceeded to unlock a cupboard from which she took a bottle of wine then going round the table she poured out half a tumblerful for each person excepting herself and santos who to judge from his stolid countenance did not expect any  no no said old peralta give santos wine and pour yourself out a glass also ramona you have both been good faithful friends to me and have nursed calixto in his infancy it is right that you should drink his health and rejoice with us at his return  she obeyed with alacrity and old santos wooden face almost relaxed into a grin when he received his share of the purple fluid i can scarcely call it juice which maketh glad the heart of man  presently old peralta raised his glass and fixed his fierce insane eyes on me calixto my son we will drink your health he said and may the curse of the almighty fall on our enemies may their bodies lie where they fall till the hawks have consumed their flesh and their bones have been trodden into dust by the cattle and may their souls be tormented with everlasting fire  silently they all raised their glasses to their lips but when they set them down again the points of don hilarios black moustache were raised as if by a smile while santos smacked his lips in token of enjoyment  after this ghastly toast nothing more was spoken by anyone at the table in oppressive silence we consumed the roast and boiled meat set before us for i dared not hazard even the most commonplace remark for fear of rousing my volcanic host into a mad eruption when we had finished eating demetria rose and brought her father a cigarette it was the signal that supper was over and immediately afterwards she left the room followed by the two servants don hilario politely offered me a cigarette and lit one for himself for some minutes we smoked in silence until the old man gradually dropped to sleep in his chair after which we rose and went back to the kitchen even that sombre retreat now seemed cheerful after the silence and gloom of the diningroom presently don hilario got up and with many apologies for leaving me explaining that he had been invited to assist at a dance at a neighbouring estancia took himself off soon afterwards though it was only about nine oclock i was shown to a room where a bed had been prepared for me it was a large mustysmelling apartment almost empty there being only my bed and a few tall upright chairs bound with leather and black with age the floor was tiled and the ceiling was covered with a dusty canopy of cobwebs on which flourished a numerous colony of longlegged housespiders i had no disposition to sleep at that early hour and even envied don hilario away enjoying himself with the rocha beauties my door looking out to the front was standing wide open the full moon had just risen and was filling the night with its mystic splendour putting out my candle for the house was now all dark and silent i softly went out for a stroll under a clump of trees not far off i found an old rustic bench and sat down on it for the place was all such a tangled wilderness of great weeds that walking was scarcely practicable and very unpleasant  the old halfruined house in the midst of the dusky desolation began to assume in the moonlight a singularly weird and ghostlike appearance near me on one side was an irregular row of poplartrees and the long dark lines cast from them by the moon fell across a wide open space where the rankgrowing thornapples predominated in the spaces between the broad bands made by the poplartree shadows the foliage appeared of a dim hoary blue starred over with the white blossoms of this nightflowering weed about these flowers several big grey moths were hovering suddenly appearing out of the black shadows and when looked for noiselessly vanishing again in their mysterious ghostlike manner not a sound disturbed the silence except the faint melancholy trill of one small nightsinging cicada from somewhere neara faint aerial voice that seemed to be wandering lost in infinite space rising and floating away in its loneliness while earth listened hushed into preternatural stillness presently a large owl came noiselessly flying by and perching on the topmost boughs of a neighbouring tree began hooting a succession of monotonous notes sounding like the baying of a bloodhound at a vast distance another owl by and by responded from some faroff quarter and the dreary duet was kept up for half an hour whenever one bird ceased his solemn boobooboobooboo i found myself with stilled breath straining my sense to catch the answering notes fearing to stir lest i should lose them a phosphorescent gleam swept by close to my face making me start at its sudden appearance then passed away trailing a line of faint light over the dusky weeds the passing firefly served to remind me that i was not smoking and the thought then occurred to me that a cigar might possibly have the effect of relieving me from the strange indefinable feeling of depression that had come over me i put my hand into my pocket and drew out a cigar and bit the end off but when about to strike a vesta on my matchbox i shuddered and dropped my hand  the very thought of striking a loud exploding match was unendurable to me so strangely nervous did i feel or possibly it was a superstitious mood i had fallen into it seemed to me at that moment that i had somehow drifted into a region of mystery peopled only by unearthly fantastic beings the people i had supped with did not seem like creatures of flesh and blood the small dark countenance of don hilario with its shifty glances and mephistophelian smile demetrias pale sorrowful face and the sunken insane eyes of her old whitehaired fatherwere all about me in the moonlight and amongst the tangled greenery i dared not move i scarcely breathed the very weeds with their pale dusky leaves were like things that had a ghostly life and while i was in this morbid condition of mind with that irrational fear momentarily increasing on me i saw at a distance of about thirty yards a dark object which seemed to move fluttering in an uncertain way towards me i gazed intently on it but it was motionless now and appeared like a black formless shadow within the shade of the trees presently it came again towards me and passing into the clear moonlight revealed a human figure it flitted across the bright space and was lost in the shade of other trees but it still approached a waving fluttering figure advancing and receding but always coming nearer my blood turned cold in my veins i could feel my hair standing up on my head until unable to endure the terrible suspense longer i jumped up from my seat a loud exclamation of terror came from the figure and then i saw that it was demetria i stammered out an apology for frightening her by jumping up and finding that i had recognised her she advanced to me  ah you are not asleep señor said she quietly i saw you from my window come out here more than an hour ago finding you did not return i began to grow anxious and thought that tired with your journey you had fallen asleep out here i came to wake you and to warn you that it is very dangerous to lie sleeping with your face exposed to the full moon  i explained that i had felt restless and disinclined to sleep regretted that i had caused her anxiety and thanked her for her thoughtful kindness  instead of leaving me then she sat quietly down on the bench señor she said if it is your intention to continue your journey tomorrow let me advise you not to do so you can safely remain here for a few days for in this sad house we have no visitors  i told her that acting on santa colomas advice given to me before the fight i was going on to the lomas de rocha to see a person named florentino blanco in that place who would probably be able to procure me a passport from montevideo  how fortunate it is that you have told me this she replied every stranger now entering the lomas is rigorously examined and you could not possibly escape arrest if you went there remain with us señor it is a poor house but we are well disposed towards you tomorrow santos shall go with a letter from you to don florentino who is always ready to serve us and he will do what you wish without seeking you  i thanked her warmly and accepted the offer of a refuge in her house somewhat to my surprise she still remained seated on the bench presently she said  it is natural señor that you should not be glad to remain in a house so triste but there will be no repetition of all you were obliged to endure on first entering it whenever my father sees a young man a stranger to him he receives him as he received you today mistaking him for his son after the first day however he loses all interest in the new face becoming indifferent and forgetting all he has said or imagined  this information relieved me and i remarked that i supposed the loss of his son had been the cause of his malady  you are right let me tell you how it happened she replied for this estancia must seem to you a place unlike all others in the world and it is only natural that a stranger should wish to know the reason of its sad condition i know that i can speak without fear of these things to one who is a friend to santa coloma  and to you i hope señorita i said  thank you señor all my life has been spent here when i was a child my brother went into the army then my mother died and i was left here alone for the siege of montevideo had begun and i could not go there at length my father received a terrible wound in action and was brought here to die as we thought for months he lay on his bed his life trembling in the balance our enemies triumphed at last the siege was over the blanco leaders dead or driven into exile my father had been one of the bravest officers in the blanco forces and could not hope to escape the general persecution they only waited for his recovery to arrest him and convey him to the capital where doubtless he would have been shot while he lay in this precarious condition every wrong and indignity was heaped upon us our horses were seized by the commander of the department our cattle slaughtered or driven off and sold while our house was searched for arms and visited every week by an officer who came to report on my fathers health one reason for this animosity was that calixto my brother had escaped and maintained a guerilla war against the government on the brazilian frontier at length my father recovered so far from his wounds as to be able to creep out for an hour every day leaning on someone for support then two armed men were sent to keep guard here to prevent his escape we were thus living in continual dread when one day an officer came and produced a written order from the comandante he did not read it to me but said it was an order for every person in the rocha department to display a red flag on his house in token of rejoicing at a victory won by the government troops i told him that we did not wish to disobey the comandantes orders but had no red flag in the house to hang up he answered that he had brought one for that purpose with him he unrolled it and fastened it to a pole then climbing to the roof of the house he raised and made it fast there not satisfied with these insults he ordered me to wake my father who was sleeping so that he also might see the flag over his house my father came out leaning on my shoulder and when he had cast up his eyes and seen the red flag he turned and cursed the officer go back he cried to the dog your master and tell him that colonel peralta is still a blanco in spite of your dishonourable flag tell that insolent slave of brazil that when i was disabled i passed my sword on to my son calixto who knows how to use it fighting for his countrys independence the officer who had mounted his horse by this time laughed and tossing the order from the comandancia at our feet bowed derisively and galloped away my father picked up the paper and read these words let there be displayed on every house in this department a red flag in token of joy at the happy tidings of a victory won by the government troops in which that recreant son of the republic the infamous assassin and traitor calixto peralta was slain alas señor loving his son above all things hoping so much from him and enfeebled by long suffering my poor father could not resist this last blow from that cruel moment he was deprived of reason and to that calamity we owe it that he was not put to death and that our enemies ceased to persecute us  demetria shed some tears when telling me this tragical story poor woman she had said little or nothing about herself yet how great and enduring must have been her grief i was deeply moved and taking her hand told her how deeply her sad story had pained me then she rose and bade me good night with a sad smilesad but the first smile that had visited her griefclouded countenance since i had seen her i could well imagine that even the sympathy of a stranger must have seemed sweet to her in that dreary isolation  after she left me i lit my cigar the night had lost its ghostly character and my fantastic superstitions had vanished i was back once more in the world of men and women and could only think of the inhumanity of man to man and of the infinite pain silently endured by many hearts in that purple land the only mystery still unsolved in that ruinous estancia was don hilario who locked up the wine and was called master with bitter irony by ramona and who had thought it necessary to apologise to me for depriving me of his precious company that evening     chapter xxiv   i spent several days with the peraltas at their desolate kineless cattlefarm which was known in the country round simply as estancia or campos de peralta such wearisome days they proved to me and so anxious was i getting about paquíta away in montevideo that i was more than once on the point of giving up waiting for the passport which don florentino had promised to get for me and boldly venture forth without even that figleaf into the open demetrias prudent counsels however prevailed so that my departure was put off from day to day the only pleasure i experienced in the house arose from the belief i entertained that my visit had made an agreeable break in the sad monotonous life of my gentle hostess her tragical story had stirred my heart to a very deep pity and as i grew every day to know her better i began to appreciate and esteem her for her own pure gentle selfsacrificing character notwithstanding the dreary seclusion in which she had lived seeing no society and with only those old servants so primitive in their ways for company there was not the slightest trace of rusticity in her manner that however is not saying much for demetria since in most ladiesmost women i might almost sayof spanish origin thereis a natural grace and dignity of manner one only expects to find in women socially well placed in our own country when we were all together at meals or in the kitchen sipping maté she was invariably silent always with that shadow of some concealed anxiety on her face but when alone with me or when only old santos and ramona were present the cloud would be gone her eyes would lighten up and the rare smile come more frequently to her lips then at times she would become almost animated in conversation listening with lively interest to all i told her about the great world of which she was so ignorant and laughing too at her own ignorance of things known to every townbred child when these pleasant conversations took place in the kitchen the two old servants would sit gazing at the face of their mistress apparently absorbed in admiration they evidently regarded her as the most perfect being that had ever been created and though there was a ludicrous side to their simple idolatry i ceased to wonder at it when i began to know her better they reminded me of two faithful dogs always watching a beloved masters face and showing in their eyes glad or pathetic how they sympathise with all his moods as for old colonel peralta he did nothing to make me uneasy after the first day he never talked to me scarcely even noticing my presence except to salute me in a ceremonious manner when we met at table he would spend his day between his easychair in the house and the rustic bench under the trees where he would sit for hours at a time leaning forward on his stick his preternaturally brilliant eyes watching everything seemingly with a keen intelligent interest but he would not speak he was waiting for his son thinking his fierce thoughts to himself like a bird blown far out over a tumultuous sea and wandering lost his spirit was ranging over that wild and troubled pastthat half a century of fierce passions and bloody warfare in which he had acted a conspicuous part and perhaps it was sometimes even more in the future than the pastthat glorious future when calixto lying far off in some mountain pass or on some swampy plain with the trailing creepers covering his bones should come back victorious from the wars  my conversations with demetria were not frequent and before long they ceased altogether for don hilario who was not in harmony with us was always there polite subdued watchful but not a man that one could take into his heart the more i saw of him the less i liked him and though i am not prejudiced about snakes as the reader already knows believing as i do that ancient tradition has made us very unjust towards these interesting children of our universal mother i can think of no epithet except snaky to describe this man wherever i happened to be about the place he had a way of coming upon me stealing through the weeds on his belly as it were then suddenly appearing unawares before me while something in his manner suggested a subtle coldblooded venomous nature those swift glances of his which perpetually came and went with such bewildering rapidity reminded me not of the immovable stony gaze of the serpents lidless eyes but of the flickering little forked tongue that flickers flickers vanishes and flickers again and is never for one moment at rest who was this man and what did he there why was he though manifestly not loved by anyone absolute master of the estancia he never asked me a question about myself for it was not in his nature to ask questions but he had evidently formed some disagreeable suspicions about me that made him look on me as a possible enemy after i had been a few days in the house he ceased going out and wherever i went he was always ready to accompany me or when i met demetria and began conversing with her there he would be to take part in our conversation  at length the piece of paper so long waited for came from the lomas de rocha and with that sacred document testifying that i was a subject of her britannic majesty queen victoria all fears and hesitation were dismissed from my mind and i prepared to depart for montevideo  the instant don hilario heard that i was about to leave the estancia his manner toward me changed he became in a moment excessively friendly pressing me to prolong my visit also to accept a horse from him as a gift and saying many kind things about the agreeable moments he had spent in my company he completely reversed the old saying about welcome the coming speed the parting guest but i knew very well that he was anxious enough to see the last of me  after supper on the eve of my departure he saddled his horse and rode off to attend a dance or gathering of some kind at a neighbouring estancia for now that he had recovered from his suspicions he was very eager to resume the social pleasures my presence had interfered with  i went out to smoke a cigar amongst the trees it being a very lovely autumnal evening with the light of an unclouded new moon to temper the darkness i was walking up and down in a narrow path amongst the weeds thinking of my approaching meeting with paquíta when old santos came out to me and mysteriously informed me that doña demetria wished to see me he led me through the large room where we always had our meals then through a narrow dimly lighted passage into another room i had not entered before though the rest of the house was now in darkness the old colonel having already retired to bed it was very light here there being about half a dozen candles placed about the room in the centre of the floor with her old face beaming with delighted admiration stood ramona gazing on another person seated on the sofa and on this individual i also gazed silently for some time for though i recognised demetria in her she was so changed that astonishment prevented me from speaking the rusty grub had come forth as a splendid green and gold butterfly she had on a grassgreen silk dress made in a fashion i had never seen before extremely high in the waist puffed out on the shoulders and with enormous bellshaped sleeves reaching to the elbows the whole garment being plentifully trimmed with very fine creamcoloured lace her long thick hair which had hitherto always been worn in heavy plaits on her back was now piled up in great coils on her head and surmounted by a tortoiseshell comb a foot high at least and about fifteen inches broad at the top looking like an immense crest on her head in her ears were curious gold filigree pendants reaching to her bare shoulders she also wore a necklet of halfdoubloons linked together in a chain and heavy gold bracelets on her arms it was extremely quaint possibly this finery had belonged to her grandmother a hundred years ago and i daresay that bright green was not the proper tint for demetrias pallid complexion still i must confess at the risk of being set down as a barbarian in matters of taste that it gave me a shock of pleasure to see her she saw that i was very much surprised and a blush of confusion overspread her face then recovering her usual quiet selfpossessed manner she invited me to sit on the sofa by her i took her hand and complimented her on her appearance she laughed a little shy laugh then said that as i was going to leave her next day she did not wish me to remember her only as a woman in rusty black i replied that i would always remember her not for the colour and fashion of her garments but for her great unmerited misfortunes her virtuous heart and for the kindness she had shown to me my words evidently pleased her and while we sat together conversing pleasantly before us were ramona and santos one standing the other seated both feasting their eyes on their mistress in her brilliant attire their delight was quite open and childlike and gave an additional zest to the pleasure i felt demetria seemed pleased to think she looked well and was more lighthearted than i had seen her before that antique finery which would have been laughable on another woman somehow or other seemed appropriate to her possibly because the strange simplicity and ignorance of the world displayed in her conversation and that gentle dignity of manner natural to her would have prevented her from appearing ridiculous in any costume  at length after we had partaken of maté served by ramona the old servants retired from the room not without many longing lingering glances at their metamorphosed mistress then somehow or other our conversation began to languish demetria becoming constrained in manner while that anxious shadow i had grown so familiar with came again like a cloud over her face thinking that it was time to leave her i rose to go and thanked her for the pleasant evening i had spent and expressed a wish that her future would be brighter than her past had been  thank you richard she returned her eyes cast down and allowing her hand to rest in mine but must you leave me so soonthere is so much i wish to say to you  i will gladly remain and hear it i said sitting down again by her side  my past has been very sad as you say richard but you do not know all and here she put her handkerchief to her eyes there were i noticed several beautiful rings on her fingers and the handkerchief she held to her eyes was a dainty little embroidered thing with a lace border for everything in her makeup was complete and in keeping that evening even the quaint little shoes she wore were embroidered with silver thread and had large rosettes on them after removing the handkerchief from her face she continued silent and with eyes cast down looking very pale and troubled  demetria i said tell me how i can serve you i cannot guess the nature of the trouble you speak of but if it is one i can help you out of speak to me without reserve  perhaps you can help me richard it was of this matter i wished to speak this evening but nowhow can i speak of it  not to one who is your friend demetria i wish you could think that the spirit of your lost brother calixto was here in me for i am as ready to help you as he would have been and i know demetria that you were very dear to him  her face flushed and for a moment her eyes met mine then casting them down again she replied sadly it is impossible i can say no more to you now my heart oppresses me so that my lips refuse to speak tomorrow perhaps  tomorrow morning i leave you and there will be no opportunity of speaking i said don hilario will be here watching you and though he is so much in the house i cannot believe that you trust him  she started at the name of don hilario and cried a little in silence then suddenly she rose and gave me her hand to bid good night you shall know everything tomorrow richard she said then you will know how much i trust you and how little i trust him i cannot speak myself but i can trust santos who knows everything and he shall tell you all  there was a sad wistful look in her eyes when we parted that haunted me for hours afterwards coming into the kitchen i disturbed ramona and santos deep in a whispered consultation they started up looking somewhat confused then when i had lit a cigar and turned to go out they got up and went back to their mistress  while i smoked i pondered over the strange evening i had passed wondering very much what demetrias secret trouble could be the mystery of the green butterfly i called it but it was really all too sad even for a mental joke though a little timely laughter is often the best weapon to meet trouble with sometimes having an effect like that of a gay sunshade suddenly opened in the face of an angry bull unable to solve the riddle i retired to my room to sleep my last sleep under peraltas dreary roof     chapter xxv   about eight oclock next morning i bade the peraltas goodbye and set out on my longdelayed journey still mounted on that dishonestly acquired steed that had served me so well for i had declined the good hilarios offer of a horse though all my toils wanderings and many services to the cause of liberty or whatever people fight for in the banda had not earned me one copper coin it was some comfort to think that candelarias nevertobeforgotten generosity had saved me from being penniless i was in fact returning to paquíta well dressed on a splendid horse and with dollars enough in my pocket to take us comfortably out of the country santos rode out with me ostensibly to put me on the right road to montevideo only i knew of course that he was the bearer of an important communication from demetria when we had ridden about half a league without any approach to the subject on his part in spite of sundry hints i threw out i asked him plainly if he had a message for me  after pondering over the question for as long a time as would be necessary to work out a rather difficult mathematical problem he answered that he had  then said i let me hear it  he grinned do you think he said that it is a thing to be spoken in half a dozen words i have not come all this distance merely to say that the moon came in dry or that yesterday being friday doña demetria tasted no meat it is a long story señor  how many leagues long do you intend it to last all the way to montevideo the longer it is the sooner you ought to begin it  there are things easy to say and there are other things not so easy returned santos but as to saying anything on horseback who could do that  why not  the question said he have you not observed that when liquor is drawn from a caskwine or bitter orangejuice to make orangeade or even rum which is by nature white and clearthat it runs thick when the cask is shaken it is the same with us señor our brain is the cask out of which we draw all the things we say  and the spigot  that is so he struck in pleased with my ready intelligence the mouth is the spigot  i should have thought the nose more like the spigot i replied  no he gravely returned you can make a loud noise with the nose when you snore or blow it in a handkerchief but it has no door of communication with the brain the things that are in the brain flow out by the mouth  very well said i getting impatient call the mouth spigot bunghole or what you like and the nose merely an ornament on the cask the thing is this doña demetria has entrusted you with some liquor to pass on to me now pass it thick or clear  not thick he answered stubbornly  very well clear then i shouted  to give it to you clear i must give it off and not on my horse sitting still and not moving  anxious to have it over without more beating about the bush i reined up my horse jumped off and sat down on the grass without another word he followed my example and after seating himself in a comfortable position deliberately drew out his tobaccopouch and began making a cigarette i could not quarrel with him for this further delay for without the soothing stimulating cigarette an oriental finds it difficult to collect his thoughts leaving him to carry out his instructions in his own laborious fashion i vented my irritation on the grass plucking it up by handfuls  why do you do that he asked with a grin  pluck grass what a question when a person sits down on the grass what is the first thing he does  makes a cigarette he returned  in my country he begins plucking up the grass i said  in the banda orientál we leave the grass for the cattle to eat said he  i at once gave up pulling the grass for it evidently distracted his mind and lighting a cigarette began smoking as placidly as i could  at length he began there is not in all the banda orientál a worse person to express things than myself  you are speaking the truth i said  but what is to be done he continued staring straight before him and giving as little heed to my interruption as a hunter riding at a stiff fence would pay to a remark about the weather when a man cannot get a knife he breaks in two an old pair of sheepshears and with one of the blades makes himself an implement which has to serve him for a knife this is how it is with doña demetria she has no one but her poor santos to speak for her if she had asked me to expose my life in her service that i could easily have done but to speak for her to a man who can read the almanac and knows the names of all the stars in the sky that kills me señor and who knows this better than my mistress who has been intimate with me from her infancy when i often carried her in my arms i can only say this señor when i speak remember my poverty and that my mistress has no instrument except my poor tongue to convey her wishes words has she told me to say to you but my devil of a memory has lost them all what am i to do in this case if i wished to buy my neighbours horse and went to him and said sell me your horse neighbour for i have fallen in love with it and my heart is sick with desire so that i must have it at any price would that not be madness señor yet i must be like that imprudent person i come to you for something and all her expressions which were like rare flowers culled from a garden have been lost by the way therefore i can only say this thing which my mistress desires putting it in my own brute words which are like wild flowers i have myself gathered on the plain that have neither fragrance nor beauty to recommend them  this quaint exordium did not advance matters much but it had the effect of rousing my attention and convincing me that the message entrusted to santos was one of very grave import he had finished his first cigarette and now began slowly making himself a second one but i waited patiently for him to speak my irritation had quite vanished those wild flowers of his were not without beauty and his love and devotion for his unhappy mistress made them smell very sweet  presently he resumed señor you have told my mistress that you are a poor man that you look upon this country life as a free and happy one that above all things you would like to possess an estancia where you could breed cattle and racehorses and hunt ostriches all this she has revolved in her mind and because it is in her power to offer you the things you desire does she now ask you to aid her in her trouble and now señor let me tell you this the peralta property extends all the way to the rocha waters five leagues of land and there is none better in this department it was formerly well stocked there were thousands of cattle and mares for my masters party then ruled in the country the colorados were shut up in montevideo and that cutthroat frutos rivera never came into this part of the cattle only a remnant remains but the land is a fortune for any man and when my old master dies doña demetria inherits all even now it is hers since her father has lost his calabash as you have seen now let me tell you what happened many years ago don hilario was at first a peona poor boy the colonel befriended when he grew up he was made capatas then mayordomo don calixto was killed and the colonel lost his reason then don hilario made himself allpowerful doing what he liked with his master and setting doña demetrias authority aside did he protect the interests of the estancia on the contrary he was one with our enemies and when they came like dogs for our cattle and horses he was behind them this he did to make friends of the reigning party when the blancos had lost everything now he wishes to marry doña demetria to make himself owner of the land don calixto is dead and who is there to bell the cat even now he acts like the only owner he buys and sells and the money is his my mistress is scarcely allowed clothes to wear she has no horse to ride on and is a prisoner in her own house he watches her like a cat watching a bird shut in a room if he suspected her of an intention to make her escape he would murder her he has sworn to her that unless she marries him he will kill her is not this sad señor she asks you to deliver her from this man her words i have forgotten but imagine that you see her before you a suppliant on her knees and that you know what the thing is she asks and see her lips move though you do not hear her words  tell me how i can deliver her i said feeling very much moved at what i had heard  how by carrying her off forciblydo you understand is it not in your power to return in a few days time with two or three friends to do this thing you must come disguised and armed if i am in the way i will do what i can to protect her but you will easily knock me down and stun medo you understand don hilario must not know that we are in the plot from him fear nothing for though he is brave enough to threaten a woman with death before armed men he is like a dog that hears thunder you can then take her to montevideo and conceal her there the rest will be easy don hilario will fail to find her ramona and i will take care of the colonel and when his daughter is out of his sight perhaps he will forget her then señor there will be no trouble about the property for who can resist a legal claim  i do not understand you santos said i if demetria wishes me to do what you say and there is no other way to save her from don hilarios persecutions i will do it i will do anything to serve her and i have no fear of that dog hilario but when i have placed her in concealment who in montevideo where she is without a friend will take up her cause and see that she is not defrauded of her rights i can give her liberty but that will be all  the property will be the same as yours when you marry her said he  i had never suspected that this was coming and was amazed to hear it  will you tell me santos said i that demetria sent you to say this to me does she think that only by marrying her i can deliver her from this robber and save her property  there is of course no other way said he if it could be done by other means would she not have spoken last night and explained everything to you consider señor all this large property will be yours if you do not like this department then she will sell everything for you to buy an estancia elsewhere or to do whatever you wish and i ask you this señor could any man marry a better woman  no said i but santos i cannot marry your mistress  i remembered then sadly enough that i had told her next to nothing about myself seeing me so young wandering homeless about the country she had naturally taken me for a single man and perhaps thinking that i had conceived an affection for her had been driven in her despair to make this proposal poor demetria was there to be no deliverance for her after all  friend said santos dropping the ceremonious señor in his anxiety to serve his mistress never speak without first considering all things there is no woman like her if you do not love her now you will love her when you know her better no good man could help feeling affection for her you saw her last evening in a green silk dress also wearing a tortoiseshell comb and gold ornamentswas she not elegant señor did she not then appear to your eyes a woman suitable for a wife you have been everywhere and have seen many women and perhaps in some distant place you have met one more beautiful than my mistress but consider the life she has led grief has made her pale and thin staining her face with purple under the eyes can laughter and song come out of a heart where fear is another life would change all she would be a flower amongst women  poor old simpleminded santos he had done himself great injustice his love for his mistress had inspired him with an eloquence that went to my heart and poor demetria driven by her weary desolate life and torturing fears to make in vain this unwomanly proposal to a stranger and after all it was not unwomanly for in all countries where they are not abject slaves it is permissible for women in some circumstances to propose marriage even in england it is so where society is like a huge clapham junction with human creatures moving like trucks and carriages on castiron conventional rails which they can only leave at the risk of a destructive collision and a proposal of the kind was never more justifiable than in this case shut away from the sight of men in her dreary seclusion haunted by nameless fears her offer was to bestow her hand along with a large property on a penniless adventurer nor had she done this before she had learnt to love me and to think perhaps that the feeling was returned she had waited too till the very last moment only making her offer when she had despaired of its coming from me this explained the reception of the previous evening the ancient splendid attire which she had worn to win favour in my sight the shy wistful expression of her eyes the hesitation she could not overcome when i had recovered from the first shock of surprise i could only feel the greatest respect and compassion for her bitterly regretting that i had not told her all my past history so that she might have been spared the shame and grief she would now be compelled to endure these sad thoughts passed through my mind while santos expatiated on the advantages of the proposed alliance until i stopped him  say no more i said for i swear to you santos that were it possible i would gladly take demetria for a wife so greatly do i admire and esteem her but i am married look at this it is my wifes portrait and taking from my bosom the miniature which i always wore round my neck i handed it to him  he stared at me in silent astonishment for a few moments then took the portrait into his hand and while he gazed admiringly at it i pondered over what i had heard i could not now think of leaving this poor woman who had offered herself with all her inheritance to me without some attempt to rescue her from her sad position she had given me a refuge when i was in trouble and danger and the appeal she had just made to me accompanied by so convincing a proof of her trust and affection would have gone to the heart of the most coldblooded man in existence to make him in spite of his nature her devoted champion  at length santos handed back the miniature with a sigh such a face as that my eyes have never seen he remarked there is nothing more to be said  there is a great deal more to be said i returned i have thought of an easy plan to help your mistress when you have reported this conversation tell her to remember the offer of assistance made to her last night i said i would be a brother to her and i shall keep my promise you three cannot think of any better scheme to save demetria than this one you have told me but it is after all a very poor scheme full of difficulty and danger to her my plan is a simpler and safer one tell her to come out tonight at midnight after the moon has set to meet me under the trees behind the house i shall be there waiting with a horse for her and will take her away to some safe place of concealment where don hilario will never find her when she is once out of his power it will be time enough to think of some way to turn him out of the estancia and to arrange matters see that she does not fail to meet me and let her take a few clothes and some money if she has any also her jewels for it would not be safe to leave them in the house with don hilario  santos was delighted with my scheme which was so much more practical though less romantic than the one hatched by those three simpleminded conspirators with heart full of hope he was about to leave me when he suddenly exclaimed but señor how will you get a horse and sidesaddle for doña demetria  leave it all to me i said then we separated he to return to his mistress who was no doubt anxiously waiting to know the result of our conversation i to get through the next fifteen hours in the best way i could     chapter xxvi   after leaving santos i rode on to a belt of wood about two miles east of the road and passing through it surveyed the country lying beyond the only habitation near it was a shepherds lonely rancho standing on an open plain of yellow grass over which a scattered flock of sheep and a few horses were grazing i determined to remain in the wood till near noon then proceed to the rancho to get breakfast and commence my search for a horse and sidesaddle in the neighbourhood after unsaddling my horse and tying him to a tree where there were some pickings of grass and herbage about the roots i lit a cigar and made myself comfortable on my rugs in the shade presently i had some visitors in a flock of urracas or magpies as they are called in the vernacular or guira cuckoos a graceful loquacious bird resembling a magpie only with a longer tail and a bold red beak these illmannered birds skulked about in the branches over me all the time i remained in the wood scolding me so incessantly in their intolerably loud angry rattling notes varied occasionally with shrill whistlings and groans that i could scarcely even hear myself think they soon succeeded in bringing all the other birds within hearing distance to the spot to take part in the demonstration it was unreasonable of the cuckoos to say the least of it for it was now long past their breeding season so that parental solicitude could not be pleaded as an excuse for their churlish behaviour the otherstanagers finches tyrantbirds red white blue grey yellow and mixedwere i must own less troublesome for after hopping about for a while screaming chirping and twittering they very sensibly flew away no doubt thinking their friends the cuckoos were making a great deal too much fuss my sole mammalian visitor was an armadillo that came hurrying towards me looking curiously like a little old bentbacked gentleman in a rusty black coat trotting briskly about on some very important business it came to within three yards of my feet then stopped and seemed astonished beyond measure at my presence staring at me with its little bleary blinking eyes and looking more like the shabby old gentleman than ever then it trotted away through the trees but presently returned for a second inspection and after that it kept coming and going till i inadvertently burst out laughing whereupon it scuttled away in great alarm and returned no more i was sorry i had frightened the amusing little beggar for i felt in that exceedingly lighthearted mood when ones merriment is ready to brim over at the slightest provocation yet that very morning poor demetrias appeal had deeply stirred my heart and i was now embarked on a most quixotic and perhaps perilous adventure possibly the very fact of that adventure being before me had produced an exhilarating effect on my mind and made it impossible for me to be sad or even decently composed  after spending a couple of hours in the pleasant shade the blue smoke ascending from the rancho before me gave notice of the approaching breakfast hour so saddling my horse i went to make my morning call the cuckoos hailing my departure with loud mocking shouts and whistling calls meant to inform all their feathered friends that they had at last succeeded in making their haunt too hot for me  at the rancho i was received by a somewhat surlylooking young man with long intensely black hair and moustache and who wore in place of a hat a purple cotton handkerchief tied about his head he did not seem to be overpleased at my visit and invited me rather ungraciously to alight if i thought proper i followed him into the kitchen where his little brownskinned wife was preparing breakfast and i fancied after seeing her that her prettiness was the cause of his inhospitable manner towards a stranger she was singularly pretty with a seductive soft brown skin ripe pouting lips of a rich purplered and when she laughed which happened very frequently her teeth glistened like pearls her crisp black hair hung down unbound and disordered for she looked like a very careless little beauty but when she saw me enter she blushed and tossed her tresses away from her shoulders then carefully felt the pendants dropping from her ears to assure herself that they were safe or possibly to attract my attention to them the frequent glances her laughing dark eyes shot at me soon convinced me that she was one of those charming little wivescharming that is when they are the wives of other peoplewho are not satisfied with a husbands admiration  i had timed my arrival well for the roast lamb over the coals was just assuming a deep golden brown colour and sending out a most delicious fragrance during the repast which followed i amused my auditors and myself by telling a few innocent lies and began by saying that i was on my return to rocha from montevideo  the shepherd remarked suspiciously that i was not on the right road  i answered that i knew it then proceeded to say that i had met with a misfortune on the previous evening which in the end had led me out of the right road i had only been married a few days i continued and at this declaration my host looked relieved while little gipsy suddenly seemed to lose all interest in me  my wife i said set her heart on having a sidesaddle as she is very fond of riding so having business which took me to town i there purchased one for her and was returning with it on a led horsemy wifes horse unfortunatelywhen i stopped last evening to get some refreshment at a pulperia on the road while eating some bread and sausage a tipsy person who happened to be there imprudently began to explode some firecrackers which so terrified the horses tied at the gate that several of them broke loose and escaped my wifes horse with the sidesaddle on him escaped with them then mounting my own horse i started in pursuit but failed to overtake the runaway finally it joined a herd of mares and these becoming terrified fled from me leading me a chase of several leagues till i lost sight of them in the darkness  if your wife resembles mine in disposition friend said he with a somewhat sorrowful smile you would have continued following that runaway animal with the sidesaddle to the end of the world  i can say this i returned gravely without a sidesaddle good or bad i am not going to present myself before her i intend inquiring at every house on my way to the lomas de rocha till i can hear of one for sale  what will you give for one said he becoming interested  that will depend on its condition if it is as good as new i will give the amount it cost and two dollars profit besides  i know of a sidesaddle that cost ten dollars a year ago but it has never been used it belongs to a neighbour three leagues from here and she would sell it i believe  show me the house i said and i will go directly and offer twelve dollars for it  you speak of doña petronas sidesaddle antonio said the little wife she would sell it for what it costperhaps for eight dollars ah pumpkinhead why did you not think to make all that profit then i could have bought slippers and a thousand things  you are never satisfied cleta he returned have you not got slippers to your feet  she tossed up a pretty foot and displayed it cased in rather a shabby little slipper then with a laugh she kicked it off towards him there she exclaimed put it in your bosom and keep itsomething precious and some day when you go to montevideo and wish to appear very grand before all the town wear it on your great toe  who expects reason from a woman said antonio shrugging his shoulders  reason you have no more brains than a muscovy duck antonio you might have made this profit but you never can make money like other men and therefore you will always be poorer than the spiders i have said this before very often and only hope you will not forget it for in future i intend to speak of other things  where would i have got the ten dollars to pay petrona for the saddle he retorted losing his temper  my friend i said if the saddle can be had it is only just that you should have the profit take ten dollars and if you buy it for me i will pay you two more  this proposal pleased him greatly while cleta the volatile clapped her hands with delight while antonio prepared to go to his neighbours after the saddle i went out to a solitary thorntree about fifty yards from the rancho and spreading my poncho in the shade lay down to sleep the siesta  before the shepherd had been long gone i heard a great noise in the house like banging on doors and on copper vessels but took no notice supposing it to proceed from cleta engaged in some unusually noisy domestic operation at length i heard a voice calling to me señor señor  getting up i went to the kitchen but no person was there suddenly a loud knock was given on the door communicating with the second room oh my friend cried cletas voice behind it my ruffian of a husband has locked me incan you let me out do you think  why has he locked you in i asked  the question because he is a brute of course he always does it when he goes out is it not horrible  it only shows how fond he is of you i returned  are you so atrocious as to defend him and i thought you had a heartso handsome too when i saw you i said ah had i married this man what a happy life  thank you for your good opinion i said i am very sorry you are locked in because it prevents me from seeing your pretty face  oh you think it pretty then you must let me out i have put up my hair now and look prettier than when you saw me  you look prettier with it down i answered  ah down it goes again then she exclaimedyes you are right it does look best that way is it not like silk you shall feel it when you liberate me  that i cannot do cleta mine your antonio has taken away the key  oh cruel man he left me no water and i am perishing with thirst what shall i do look i will put my hand under the door for you to feel how hot it is i am consumed with fever and thirst in this oven  presently her little brown hand came out at my feet there being sufficient space between the floor and wood to pass it through i stooped and took it in mine and found it a hot moist little hand with a pulse beating very fast  poor child i said i will pour some water in a plate and pass it to you under the door  oh you are bad to insult me she cried what am i a cat to drink water from a plate i could cry my eyes out here followed soblike sounds besides she suddenly resumed it is fresh air not water i require i am suffocated i cannot breathe oh dear friend save me from fainting force back the door till the bolt slips out  no no cleta it cannot be done  what with your strength i could almost do it myself with my poor little hands open open open before i faint  she had evidently sunk down on the floor sobbing after making that practical suggestion and casting about for burglarious implements to aid me i found the spit and a wedgeshaped piece of hard wood these i inserted just above and below the lock and forcing back the door on its frame i soon had the satisfaction of seeing the bolt slip from the catch  out sprang cleta flushed tearful her hair all in disorder but laughing gleefully at having regained her liberty  oh dear friend i thought you were going to leave me she cried how agitated i amfeel how my heart beats never mind i can now pay that wretch out is not revenge sweet sweet sweet  now cleta i said take three mouthfuls of fresh air and a drink of water then let me lock you in again  she laughed mockingly and shook her hair like a wild young colt  ah you are not seriousdo you not think i know she cried your eyes tell me everything besides you could not shut me up again if you tried here she made a sudden dash at the door but i caught her and held her a close prisoner  let me go monsteroh no not monster dear sweet friend beautiful as themoon sun stars i am dying for fresh air i will come back to the oven before he returns if he caught me out what blows come let us sit under the tree together  that would be disobeying your husband i said trying to look stern  never mind i will confess it all to the priest some day then it will be as if it had never happened such a husbandpoof if you were not a married manare you married what a pity say again am i pretty  say first cleta have you a horse a woman can ride on and if you have one will you sell it to me  oh yes the best horse in the banda orientál they say it is worth six dollarswill you buy it for six dollars no i shall not sell iti shall not tell you that i have a horse till you answer me am i pretty sir stranger  tell me first about the horse then ask me what you like  nothing more will i tell younot a word yes everything listen when antonio comes back ask him to sell you a horse for your wife to ride he will try to sell you one of his own a demon full of faults like his master falsefooted lame in the shoulder a roarer old as the south wind a black piebaldremember offer to buy a roan with a cream nose that is my horse offer him six dollars now say am i pretty  oh beautiful cleta your eyes are stars your mouth is a rosebud sweeter than honey a thousand times  now you talk like a wise man she laughed then holding my hand she led me to the tree and sat down by my side on the poncho  and how old are you little one i asked  fourteenis that very old ah fool to tell my age trulyno woman does that why did i not say thirteen and i have been married six months such a long time i am sure i have green blue yellow grey hairs coming out all over my head by this time and what about my hair sir you never spoke of that did i not let it down for you is it not soft and beautiful tell me sir what about my hair  in truth it is soft and beautiful cleta and covers you like a dark cloud  does it not look i will cover my face with it now i am hidden like the moon in a cloud and now look out comes the moon again i have a great respect for the moon say holy friar am i like the moon  say little sweet lips why do you call me holy friar  say first holy friar am i like the moon  no cleta you are not like the moon though you are both married women you are married to antonio  poor me  and the moon is married to the sun  happy moon to be so far from him  the moon is a quiet wife but you chatter like a paroquet  and am i not able to be quiet also monk look i will be quiet as the moonnot a word not a breath then she threw herself back on the poncho feigning sleep her arms above her head her hair scattered everywhere only a tress or two half shading her flushed face and round heaving bosom that would not be quiet there was just a little mocking smile on her lips just a little gleam of laughing eyes under her drooping lashes for she could not help watching my face for admiration in such an attitude the tempting little witch might have made the tepid blood of an ascetic boil  two or three hours thus flew swiftly by while i listened to her lively prattle which like the larks singing had scarcely a pause in it her attempt at being still and moonlight having ended in a perfect fiasco at length pouting her pretty lips and complaining of her hard lot she said it was time to go back to her prison but all the time i was engaged in forcing back the bolt into its place she chattered without ceasing adieu sun husband of the moon she said adieu sweet sweet friend buyer of sidesaddles they were all lies you toldi know i know you want a horse and sidesaddle to carry off some girl tonight happy she now i must sit in the dark alone alone alone till antonio the atrocious comes to liberate me with his iron keyah fool  before i had been long back under my tree antonio appeared bringing the sidesaddle in triumph on his horse before him after going in to release his wife he came out and invited me to take maté i then mentioned my wish to buy a good horse he was only too willing to sell and in a few minutes his horses were driven up for inspection the black piebald was first offered a very handsome quietlooking animal apparently quite sound the creamnose i noticed was a bony longbodied brute with sleepy eyes and a ewe neck could it be that the little doubledealing witch had intended to deceive me but in a moment i dismissed such a suspicion with the scorn it merited let a woman be as false as she can and able to fool her husband to the top of her bent she is compared with the man who wishes to sell you a horse openness and truth itself i examined the piebald critically walking and trotting him round looked into his mouth then at hoofs and fetlocks beloved of windgalls gazed with fixed attention into his eyes and dealt him a sudden brisk blow on the shoulder  no weak spot will you find señor said antonio the mendacious who was certainly the greatest of the three sinners met together in that place he is my best horse only four years old gentle as a lamb sound as a bell surefooted señor like no other horse and with such an easy pace you can ride him at a gallop with a tumbler of water in your hand and not spill a drop i will give him away to you for ten dollars because you have been generous about the sidesaddle and i am anxious to serve you well  thank you my friend i said your piebald is fifteen years old lame in the shoulders broken in his wind and has more vices than any seven horses in the banda orientál i would not allow my wife to ride such a dangerous brute for as i told you i have not been long married  antonio framed his face to express astonishment and virtue indignant then with the point of his knife he scratched the figure of a cross on the ground and was about to swear solemnly on it that i was egregiously mistaken that his beast was a kind of equine angel ora pegasus at least when i interfered to stop him tell as many lies as you like i said and i will listen to them with the greatest interest but do not swear on the figure of the cross to what is false for then the four or five or six dollars profit you have made on the sidesaddle will scarcely be sufficient to buy you absolution for such a sin  he shrugged his shoulders and restored the sacrilegious knife to its sheath there are my horses he said in an injured tone they are a kind of animal you seem to know a great deal about select one and deceive yourself i have endeavoured to serve you but there are some people who do not know a friend when they see one  i then minutely examined all the other horses and finally finished the farce by leading out the roan creamnose and was pleased to notice the crestfallen expression of my good shepherd  your horses do not suit me i said so i cannot buy one i will however purchase this old cow for it is the only animal here i could trust my wife on you can have seven dollars for itnot one copper more for like the emperor of china i speak once only  he plucked off his purple headgear and scratched his raven head then led me back to the kitchen to consult his wife for señor he said you have by some fatality selected her horse when cleta heard that seven dollars had been offered for the roan she laughed with joy oh antonio he is only worth six dollars yes señor you shall have him and pay the seven dollars to me not to my husband who will say now that i cannot make money and now antonio i have no horse to ride on you can give me the bay with white forefeet  do not imagine such a thing exclaimed her husband  after taking maté i left them to settle their affairs not doubting which would come out best from a trial of skill when i arrived in sight of peraltas trees i unsaddled and picketed my horses then stretched myself out on my rugs after the excitements and pleasures of that day which had robbed me of my siesta i quickly fell into a very sound sleep     chapter xxvii   when i woke i did not remember for some moments where i was feeling about me my hand came in contact with the grass wet with dew it was very dark only low down in the sky a pale gleam of light gave promise as i imagined of coming day then recollection flashed upon me and i sprang up alarmed to my feet only to discover with inexpressible relief that the light i had remarked was in the west not the east and proceeded from the young moon just sinking beneath the horizon saddling my two animals expeditiously i rode to peraltas estancia and on arriving there carefully drew the horses into the shadow of a clump of trees growing on the borders of the ancient wellnigh obliterated foss or ditch i then dropped on to the ground so as to listen better for approaching footsteps and began waiting for demetria it was past midnight not a sound reached me except at intervals the mournful faraway reedy note of the little nocturnal cicada that always seemed to be there lamenting the lost fortunes of the house of peralta for upwards of half an hour i remained lying on the ground growing more anxious every moment and fearing that demetria was going to fail me when i caught a sound like a human whisper listening intently i found that it pronounced my name and proceeded from a clump of tall thornapples some yards from me  who speaks i replied  the tall gaunt form of ramona drew itself up out of the weeds and cautiously approached me she was shaking with nervous excitement and had not ventured to come near without speaking for fear of being mistaken for an enemy and fired at  mother of heaven she exclaimed as well as her chattering teeth would allow her to speak i have been so agitated all the evening oh señor what are we to do now your plan was such a good one when i heard it i knew an angel had flown down and whispered it in your ear and now my mistress will not stir all her things are readyclothes money jewels and for the last hour we have been urging her to come out but nothing will serve she will not see you señor  is don hilario in the house  no he is outcould anything have been better but it is useless she has lost heart and will not come she only sits crying in her room saying that she cannot look on your face again  go and tell her that i am here with the horses waiting for her i said  señor she knows you are here santos watched for you and hastened in to inform her of your arrival now she has sent me out only to say that she cannot meet you that she thanks you for all you have done and begs you to go away and leave her  i was not greatly surprised at demetrias reluctance to meet me at the last moment but was determined not to leave without first seeing her and trying to change her mind securing the horses to a tree i went with ramona to the house stealing in on tiptoe we found demetria in that room where she had received me the evening before in her quaint finery lying on the sofa while old santos stood by her the picture of distress the moment she saw me enter she covered her face with her hands and turned from me yet a glance was sufficient to show that with or without her consent everything had been got ready for her flight on a chair near her lay a pair of saddlebags in which her few belongings had been stowed a mantilla was drawn half over her head and by her side was a large woollen shawl evidently intended to protect her against the night air  santos i said go out to the horses under the trees and wait there for us and you ramona say goodbye now to your mistress then leave us together for by and by she will recover courage and go with me  santos looking immensely relieved and grateful though a little surprised at my confident tone was hurrying out when i pointed to the saddlebags he nodded grinned and snatching them up left the room poor old ramona threw herself on to her knees sobbing and pouring out farewell blessings on her mistress kissing her hands and hair with sorrowful devotion  when she left us i sat down by demetrias side but she would not takeher hands from her face or speak to me and only wept hysterically when i addressed her i succeeded at last in getting one of her hands in mine and then drew her head gently down till it rested on my shoulder when her sobs began to subside i said  tell me dear demetria have you lost faith in me that you fear to trust yourself with me now  no no richard it is not that she faltered but i can never look into your face again if you have any compassion for me you will leave me now  what leave you demetria my sister to that manhow can you imagine such a thing tell me where is don hilariois he coming back tonight  i know nothing he may come back at any moment leave me richard every minute you remain here increases your danger then she attempted to draw away from me but i would not release her  if you fear his returning tonight then it is time for you to come with me i answered  no no no i cannot all is changed now it would kill me with shame to look on your face again  you shall look on it again many times demetria do you think that after coming here to rescue you out of the coils of that serpent i am going to leave you because you are a little timid listen demetria i shall save you from that devil tonight even if i have to carry you out in my arms afterwards we can consider all there is to be done about your father and your property perhaps when the poor colonel is taken out of this sad atmosphere his health his reason even may improve  oh richard are you deceiving me she exclaimed suddenly dropping her hands and gazing full into my face  no i am not deceiving you and now you will lose all fear demetria for you have looked into my face again and have not been changed to stone  she turned crimson in a moment but did not attempt to cover her face again for just then a clatter of hoofs was heard approaching the house  mother of heaven save us she exclaimed in terror it is don hilario  i quickly blew out the one candle burning dimly in the room fear nothing i said when all is quiet after he has gone to his room we will make our escape  she was trembling with apprehension and nestled close to me while we both listened intently and heard don hilario unsaddle his horse then going softly whistling to himself to his room  now he has shut himself up i said and in a few minutes will be asleep when you think of that man whose persecutions have made your life a burden so that you tremble when he approaches you do you not feel glad that i have come to take you away  richard i could go willingly with you tonight but for one thing do you think after what has passed that i could ever face your wife  she will know nothing of what has passed demetria it would be dishonourable in me and a cruel injustice to you to speak to her of it she will welcome you as a dear sister and love you as much as i love you all these doubts and fears troubling you are very unsubstantial and can be blown away like thistledown and now that you have confessed so much to me demetria i wish to confess also the one thing that troubles my heart  what is it richard tell me she said very gently  believe me demetria i never had a suspicion that you loved me your manner did not show it otherwise i should have told you long ago all about my past i only knew you regarded me as a friend and one you could trust if i have been mistaken all along demetria if you have really felt a passion in your heart then i shall have to lament bitterly that i have been the cause of a lasting sorrow to you will you not open your heart more to me and tell me frankly how it is with you  she caressed my hand in silence for a little while and then answered i think you were right richard perhaps i am not capable of passion like some women i felti knew that you were my friend to be near you was like sitting in the shade of a green tree in some hot desolate place i thought it would be pleasant to sit there always and forget the bitter years but richard if you will always be my friendmy brother i shall be more than content and my life will seem different  demetria how happy you have made me come the serpent is sleeping now let us steal away and leave him to his evil dreams god grant that i may return some day to bruise his head with my heel  then wrapping the shawl about her i led her out treading softly and in a few moments we were with santos patiently keeping watch beside the horses  i gladly let him assist demetria to her seat on the sidesaddle for that was perhaps the last personal service he would be able to render her the poor old fellow was crying i believe his utterance was so husky before leaving i gave him on a scrap of paper my address in montevideo and bade him take it to don florentino blanco with a request to write me a letter in the course of the next two or three days to inform me of don hilarios movements we then trotted softly away over the sward and in about half an hour struck the road leading from rocha to montevideo this we followed till daylight scarcely pausing once from our swift gallop and a hundred times during that dark ride over a country utterly unknown to me i blessed the little witch cleta for never was there a more steady surefooted beast than the ugly roan that carried my companion and when we drew rein in the pale morning light he seemed fresh as when we started we then left the highway and rode across country in a northwesterly direction for a distance of eight or nine miles for i was anxious to be far away from public roads and from the prying prating people that use them about eleven oclock that morning we had breakfast at a rancho then rode on again till we came to a forest of scattered thorntrees growing on the slopes of a range of hills it was a wild secluded spot with water and good pasturage for the horses and pleasant shade for ourselves so after unsaddling and turning loose our horses to feed we sat down to rest under a large tree with our backs against its portly trunk from our shady retreat we commanded a splendid view of the country over which we had been riding all the morning extending for many leagues behind us and while i smoked my cigar i talked to my companion calling her attention to the beauty of that wide sunlit prospect  do you know demetria i said when the long winter evenings come and i have plenty of leisure i intend writing a history of my wanderings in the banda oriental and i will call my book the purple land for what more suitable name can one find for a country so stained with the blood of her children you will never read it of course for i shall write it in english and only for the pleasure it will give to my own childrenif i ever have anyat some distant date when their little moral and intellectual stomachs are prepared for other food than milk but you will have a very important place in my narrative demetria for during these last days we have been very much to each other and perhaps the very last chapter will recount this wild ride of ours together flying from that evil genius hilario to some blessed refuge far away beyond the hills and woods and the blue line of the horizon for when we reach the capital i believei thinki know in fact  i hesitated to tell her that it would probably be necessary for me to leave the country immediately but she did not encourage me to go on and glancing round i discovered that she was fast asleep  poor demetria she had been dreadfully nervous all night and almost afraid to stop to rest anywhere but now her fatigue had quite overcome her her position against the tree was uncomfortable and insecure so drawing her head very gently down until it rested on my shoulder and shading her eyes with her mantilla i let her sleep on her face looked strangely worn and pallid in that keen noonday light and gazing on it while she slumbered and remembering all the dark years of grief and anxiety she had endured down to that last pain of which i had been the innocent cause i felt my eyes grow dim with compassion  after sleeping for about two hours she woke with a start and was greatly distressed to learn that i had been supporting her all that time but after that refreshing slumber a change seemed to come over her not only her great fatigue but the tormenting apprehensions had very nearly vanished out of the nettle danger she had plucked the flower safety and now she could rejoice in its possession and was filled with new life and spirits the unaccustomed freedom and exercise with constant change of scene also had an exhilarating effect on mind and body a new colour came into her pale cheeks the purple stains telling of anxious days and sleepless nights faded away she smiled brightly and was full of animation so that on that long journey whether resting in the noonday shade or swiftly cantering over the green turf i could not have had a more agreeable companion than demetria this change in her often made me remember santos pathetic words when he told of the ravages of grief and said that another life would make his mistress a flower amongst women it was a comfort that her affection for me had been indeed nothing but affection but what was i to do with her in the end for i knew that my wife was most anxious to return without further delay to her own country and yet it seemed to me that it would be a hard thing to leave poor demetria behind amongst strangers finding her so improved in spirits i at length ventured to speak to her on the subject at first she was depressed but presently recovering courage she begged to be allowed to go with us to buenos ayres the prospect of being left alone was unendurable to her for in montevideo she had no personal friends while the political friends of her family were all out of the country or living in very close retirement across the water she would be with friends and safe for a season from her dreaded enemy this proposal seemed a very sensible one and relieved my mind very much although it only served to remove my difficulty for a time  in the department of camelones about six leagues from montevideo i found the house of a fellowcountryman named barker who had lived for many years in the country and had a wife and children we arrived in the afternoon at his estancia and seeing that demetria was very much knocked up with our long journey i asked mr barker to give us shelter for the night our host was very kind and pleasant with us asking no disagreeable questions and after a few hours acquaintance which made us quite intimate i took him aside and told him demetrias history whereupon like the goodhearted fellow he was he at once offered to shelter her in his house until matters could be arranged in montevideo an offer which was joyfully accepted     chapter xxviii   i was soon back in montevideo after that when i bade demetria goodbye she appeared reluctant to part with me retaining my hand in hers for an unusual time for the first time in her life probably she was about to be left in the company of entire strangers and for many days past we had been much to each other so that it was only natural she should cling to me a little at parting once more i pressed her hand and exhorted her to be of good courage reminding her that in a very few days all trouble and danger would be over still however she did not release my hand this tender reluctance to lose me was affecting and also flattering but slightly inopportune for i was anxious to be in the saddle and away presently she said glancing down at her rusty habiliments richard if i am to remain concealed here till i go to join you on board then i must meet your wife in these poor garments  oh that is what you are thinking about demetria i exclaimed  at once i called in our kind hostess and when this serious matter was explained to her she immediately offered to go to montevideo to procure the necessary outfit a thing i had thought nothing about but which had evidently been preying on demetrias mind  when i at length reached the little suburban retreat of my aunt by marriage paquíta and i acted for some time like two demented persons so overjoyed were we at meeting after our long separation i had received no letters from her and only two or three of the score i had written had reached their destination so that we had ten thousand questions to ask and answers to make she could never gaze enough at me or finish admiring my bronzed skin and the respectable moustache i had grown while she poor darling looked unusually pale yet withal so beautiful that i marvelled at myself for having after possessing her considered any other woman even passably goodlooking i gave her a circumstantial account of my adventures omitting only a few matters i was in honour bound not to disclose  thus when i told her the story of my sojourn at the estancia peralta i said nothing to betray demetrias confidence nor did i think it necessary to mention the episode of that wicked little sprite cleta with the result that she was pleased at the chivalrous conduct i had displayed throughout the whole of that affair and was ready to take demetria to her heart  i had not been back twentyfour hours in montevideo before a letter from the lomas de rocha storekeeper came to justify my caution in having left demetria at some distance from the town the letter informed me that don hilario had quickly guessed that i had carried off his unhappy masters daughter and that no doubt was left in his mind when he discovered that on the day i left the estancia a person answering to my description in every particular had purchased a horse and sidesaddle and had ridden off towards the estancia in the evening my correspondent warned me that don hilario would be in montevideo even before his letter also that he had discovered something about my connection with the late rebellion and would be sure to place the matter in the hands of the government so as to have me arrested after which he would have little difficulty in compelling demetria to return to the estancia  for a moment this intelligence dismayed me luckily paquíta was out of the house when it came and fearing that she might return and surprise me while i was in that troubled state i rushed out then skulking through back streets and narrow lanes peering cautiously about in fear of encountering the minions of the law i made my escape out of the town my only desire just then was to get away into some place of safety where i would be able to think over the position quietly and if possible devise some plan to defeat don hilario who had been a little too quick for me of many schemes that suggested themselves to my mind while i sat in the shade of a cactus hedge about a mile from town i finally determined in accordance with my old and welltried rule to adopt the boldest one which was to go straight back to montevideo and claim the protection of my country the only trouble was that on my way thither i might be caught and then paquíta would be in terrible distress about me and perhaps demetrias escape would be prevented while i was occupied with these thoughts i saw a closed carriage pass by driven towards the town by a tipsylooking coachman coming out of my hidingplace i managed to stop him and offered him two dollars to drive me to the british consulate the carriage was a private one but the two dollars tempted the man so after securing the fare in advance he allowed me to get in and then i closed the windows leant back on the cushion and was driven rapidly and comfortably to the house of refuge i introduced myself to the consul and told him a story concocted for the occasion a judicious mixture of truth and lies to the effect that i had been unlawfully and forcibly seized and compelled to serve in the blanco army and that having escaped from the rebels and made my way to montevideo i was amazed to hear that the government proposed arresting me he asked me a few questions looked at the passport which he had sent me a few days before then laughing goodhumouredly put on his hat and invited me to accompany him to the war office close by the secretary colonel arocena he informed me was a personal friend of his and if we could see him it would be all right walking by his side i felt quite safe and bold again for i was in a sense walking with my hand resting on the superb mane of the british lion whose roar was not to be provoked with impunity at the war office i was introduced by the consul to his friend colonel arocena a genial old gentleman with a bald head and a cigarette between his lips he listened with some interest and a smile slightly incredulous i thought to the sad story of the illtreatment i had been subjected to at the hands of santa colomas rebellious rascals when i had finished he pushed over a sheet of paper on which he had scrawled a few words to me with the remark here my young friend take this and you will be safe in montevideo we have heard about your doings in florida also in rocha but we do not propose going to war with england on your account  at this speech we all laughed then when i had pocketed the paper which bore the sacred seal of the war office on the margin and requested all persons to refrain from molesting the bearer in his lawful outgoings and incomings we thanked the pleasant old colonel and retired i spent half an hour strolling about with the consul then we separated i had noticed two men in military uniform at some distance from us when we were together and now returning homewards i found that they were following me by and by they overtook me and politely intimated their intention of making me their prisoner i smiled and drawing forth my protection from the war office handed it to them they looked surprised and gave it back with an apology for having molested me then left me to pursue my way in peace  i had of course been very lucky throughout all this adventure still i did not wish to attribute my easy escape entirely to luck for i had i thought contributed a good deal towards it by my promptness in acting and in inventing a plausible story on the spur of the moment  feeling very much elated i strolled along the sunny streets gaily swinging my cane when turning a corner near doña isidoras house i suddenly came face to face with don hilario this unexpected encounter threw us both off our guard he recoiling two or three paces backwardand turning as pale as the nature of his complexion would allow i recovered first from the shock so far i had been able to baffle him and knew moreover many things of which he was ignorant still he was there in the town with me and had to be reckoned with and i quickly resolved to meet him as a friend affecting entire ignorance of his object in coming to montevideo  don hilarioyou here happy the eyes that behold you i exclaimed seizing and shaking his hand pretending to be overjoyed at the meeting  in a moment he recovered his usual selfpossessed manner and when i asked after doña demetria he answered after a moments hesitation that she was in very good health  come don hilario i said we are close to my aunt isidoras house where i am staying and it will give me great pleasure to present you to my wife who will be glad to thank you for your kindness to me at the estancia  your wife don ricardo do you tell me that you are married he exclaimed in amazement thinking probably that i was already the husband of demetria  what did i not tell you before i said ah i remember speaking to doña demetria about it strange that she has not mentioned it to you yes i was married before coming to this countrymy wife is an argentine come with me and you shall see a beautiful woman if that is an inducement  he was without doubt astonished and mystified but he had recovered his mask and was now polite collected watchful  when we entered the house i presented him to doña isidora who happened to be in the way and left her to entertain him i was very glad to do so knowing that he would seize the opportunity to try and discover something from the garrulous old lady and that he would discover nothing since she had not been let into our secrets  i found paquíta lying down in her room having a siesta and while she arrayed herself at my express desire in her best dressa black velvet which set off her matchless beauty better than anything else i told her how i wished her to treat don hilario she knew all about him of course and hated him with all her heart looking on him as a kind of evil genius from whose castle i had carried off the unhappy demetria but i made her understand that our wisest plan was to treat him graciously she readily consented for argentine women can be more charmingly gracious than any other women on the globe and what people do well they like to be called on to do  the subtle caution of our snaky guest did not serve to hide from my watchful eyes that he was very much surprised when he beheld her she placed herself near him and spoke in her sweetest artless manner of the pleasure my return had given her and of the gratitude she had felt towards him and all the people at the estancia peralta for the hospitable treatment i had received there he was as i had foreseen completely carried away by her exquisite beauty and the charm of her manner towards him he was flattered and exerted himself to be agreeable but at the same time he was very much puzzled the baffled expression was more apparent on his face every moment while his restless glances darted here and there about the room yet ever returned like the doomed moth to the candle to those lustrous violet eyes overflowing with hypocritical kindness paquítas acting delighted me and i only hoped that he would long suffer from the effect of the subtle poison she was introducing into his system when he rose to go i was sure that demetrias disappearance was a greater mystery to him than ever and as a parting shot i warmly invited him to come and see us frequently while he remained in the capital even offering him a bed in the house while paquíta not to be behindhand for she had thoroughly entered into the fun of the thing entrusted him with a prettily worded affectionate message to demetria a person whom she already loved and hoped some day to meet  two days after this adventure i heard that don hilario had left montevideo that he had discovered nothing i was positive it was possible however that he had left some person to watch the house and as paquíta was now anxious to get back to her own country i determined to delay our departure no longer  going down to the harbour i found the captain of a small schooner trading between montevideo and buenos ayres and learning that he intended leaving for the last port in three days time i bargained with him to take us and got him also to consent to receive demetria on board at once i then sent a message to mr barker asking him to bring his guest up to town and put her on board the schooner without coming near me two days later early in the morning i heard that she was safe on board and having thus baffled the scoundrel hilario on whose ophidian skull i should have been very pleased to set my heel and having still an idle day before me i went once more to visit the mountain to take from its summit my last view of the purple land where i had spent so many eventful days  when i approached the crest of the great solitary hill i did not gaze admiringly on the magnificent view that opened before me nor did the wind blowing fresh from the beloved atlantic seem to exhilarate me my eyes were cast down and i dragged my feet like one that was weary yet i was not weary but now i began to remember that on a former occasion i had on this mountain spoken many vain and foolish things concerning a people about whose character and history i was then ignorant i also remembered with exceeding bitterness that my visit to this land had been the cause of great and perhaps lasting sorrow to one noble heart  how often said i to myself have i repented of those cruel scornful words i addressed to dolores at our last interview and now once more i come to pluck the berries harsh and crude of repentance and of expiation to humble my insular pride in the dust and unsay all the unjust things i formerly spoke in my haste  it is not an exclusively british characteristic to regard the people of other nationalities with a certain amount of contempt but with us perhaps the feeling is stronger than with others or else expressed with less reserve let me now at last rid myself of this error which is harmless and perhaps even commendable in those who stay at home and also very natural since it is a part of our unreasonable nature to distrust and dislike the things that are far removed and unfamiliar let me at last divest myself of these old english spectacles framed in oak and with lenses of horn to bury them for ever in this mountain which for half a century and upwards has looked down on the struggles of a young and feeble people against foreign aggression and domestic foes and where a few months ago i sang the praises of british civilisation lamenting that it had been planted here and abundantly watered with blood only to be plucked up again and cast into the sea after my rambles in the interior where i carried about in me only a fading remnant of that old timehonoured superstition to prevent the most perfect sympathy between me and the natives i mixed with i cannot say that i am of that opinion now i cannot believe that if this country had been conquered and recolonised by england and all that is crooked in it made straight according to our notions my intercourse with the people would have had the wild delightful flavour i have found in it and if that distinctive flavour cannot be had along with the material prosperity resulting from anglosaxon energy i must breathe the wish that this land may never know such prosperity i do not wish to be murdered no man does yet rather than see the ostrich and deer chased beyond the horizon the flamingo and blacknecked swan slain on the blue lakes and the herdsman sent to twang his romantic guitar in hades as a preliminary to security of person i would prefer to go about prepared at any moment to defend my life against the sudden assaults of the assassin  we do not live by bread alone and british occupation does not give to the heart all the things for which it craves blessings may even become curses when the gigantic power that bestows them on us scares from our midst the shy spirits of beauty and of poesy nor is it solely because it appeals to the poetic feelings in us that this country endears itself to my heart it is the perfect republic the sense of emancipation experienced in it by the wanderer from the old world is indescribably sweet and novel even in our ultracivilised condition at home we do periodically escape back to nature and breathing the fresh mountain air and gazing over vast expanses of ocean and land we find that she is still very much to us it is something more than these bodily sensations we experience when first mingling with our fellowcreatures where all men are absolutely free and equal as here i fancy i hear some wise person exclaiming no no no in name only is your purple land a republic its constitution is a piece of waste paper its government an oligarchy tempered by assassination and revolution true but the knot of ambitious rulers all striving to pluck each other down have no power to make the people miserable theunwritten constitution mightier than the written one is in the heart of every man to make him still a republican and free with a freedom it would be hard to match anywhere else on the globe the bedouin himself is not so free since he accords an almost superstitious reverence and implicit obedience to his sheikh here the lord of many leagues of land and of herds unnumbered sits down to talk with the hired shepherd a poor barefooted fellow in his smoky rancho and no class or caste difference divides them no consciousness of their widely different positions chills the warm current of sympathy between two human hearts how refreshing it is to meet with this perfect freedom of intercourse tempered only by that innate courtesy and native grace of manner peculiar to spanish americans what a change to a person coming from lands with higher and lower classes each with its innumerable hateful subdivisionsto one who aspires not to mingle with the class above him yet who shudders at the slouching carriage and abject demeanour of the class beneath him if this absolute equality is inconsistent with perfect political order i for one should grieve to see such order established moreover it is by no means true that the communities which oftenest startle us with crimes of disorder and violence are morally worse than others a community in which there are not many crimes cannot be morally healthy there were practically no crimes in peru under the inca dynasty it was a marvellous thing for a person to commit an offence in that empire and the reason for this most unnatural state of things was thisthe inca system of government was founded on that most iniquitous and disastrous doctrine that the individual bears the same relation to the state as a child to its parents that its life from the cradle to the grave must be regulated for it by a power it is taught to regard as omniscienta power practically omnipresent and almighty in such a state there could be no individual will no healthy play of passions and consequently no crime what wonder that a system so unspeakably repugnant to a being who feels that his will is a divinity working within him fell to pieces at the first touch of foreign invasion or that it left no vestige of its pernicious existence on the continent it had ruled for the whole state was so to speak putrid even before dissolution and when it fell it mingled with the dust and was forgotten poland before its conquest by russia a country illgoverned and disorderly as the banda orientál did not mingle with dust like that when it fellthe implacable despotism of the czar was unable to crush its fierce spirit its will still survived to gild dreary oppression with hallowed dreams to make it clutch with a fearful joy the dagger concealed in its bosom but i had no need to go away from this green continent to illustrate the truth of what i have said people who talk and write about the disorderly south american republics are fond of pointing to brazil that great peaceful progressive empire as setting an example to be followed an orderly country yes and the people in it steeped to their lips in every abominable vice compared with these emasculated children of the equator the orientals are natures noblemen  i can very well imagine some overrighteous person saying alas poor deluded soul how little importance can we attach to your specious apologies of a peoples lawlessness when your own personal narrative shows that the moral atmosphere you have been breathing has quite corrupted you go back over your own record and you will find that you have according to our notions offended in various ways and on divers occasions and that you are even without the grace to repent of all the evil things you have thought said and done  i have not read many books of philosophy because when i tried to be a philosopher happiness was always breaking in as someone says also because i have loved to study men rather than books but in the little i have read there occurs a passage i remember well and this i shall quote as my answer to anyone who may call me an immoral person because my passions have not always remained in a quiescent state like houndsto quote the simile of a south american poetslumbering at the feet of the huntsman resting against a rock at noon we should regard the perturbations of the mind says spinoza not in the light of vices of human nature but as properties just as pertinent to it as are heat storms thunder and the like to the nature of the atmosphere which phenomena though inconvenient are yet necessary and have fixed causes by means of which we endeavour to understand their nature and the mind has just as much pleasure in seeing them aright as in knowing such things as flatter the senses let me have the phenomena which are inconvenient as well as the things which flatter the senses and the chances are that my life will be a healthier and happier one than that of the person who spends his time on a cloud blushing at natures naughtiness  it is often said that an ideal statea utopia where there is no folly crime or sorrowhas a singular fascination for the mind now when i meet with a falsehood i care not who the great persons who proclaim it may be i do not try to like it or believe it or mimic the fashionable prattle of the world about it i hate all dreams of perpetual peace all wonderful cities of the sun where people consume their joyful monotonous years in mystic contemplations or find their delight like buddhist monks in gazing on the ashes of dead generations of devotees the state is one unnatural unspeakably repugnant the dreamless sleep of the grave is more tolerable to the active healthy mind than such an existence if signor gaudentio di lucca still keeping himself alive by means of his marvellous knowledge of the secrets of nature were to appear before me now on this mountain to inform me that the sacred community he resided with in central africa was no mere dream and should offer to conduct me to it i should decline to go with him i should prefer to remain in the banda orientál even though by so doing i should grow at last to be as bad as any person in it and ready to wade through slaughter to the presidential chair for even in my own country of england which is not so perfect as old peru or the pophars country in central africa i have been long divided from nature and now in this oriental country whose political misdeeds are a scandal alike to pure england and impure brazil i have been reunited to her for this reason i love her with all her faults here like santa coloma i will kneel down and kiss this stone as an infant might kiss the breast that feeds it here fearless of dirt like john carrickfergus i will thrust my hands into the loose brown soil to clasp the hands as it were of dear mother nature after our long separation  farewell beautiful land of sunshine and storm of virtue and of crime may the invaders of the future fare on your soil like those of the past and leave you in the end to your own devices may the chivalrous instinct of santa coloma the passion of dolores the lovingkindness of candelaria still live in your children to brighten their lives with romance and beauty may the blight of our superior civilisation never fall on your wild flowers or the yoke of our progress be laid on your herdsmancareless graceful musicloving as the birdsto make him like the sullen abject peasant of the old world     chapter xxix   the meeting of my fellowtravellers took place next day on board the ship where we three were the only cabin passengers on going down into the little saloon i found demetria waiting for us considerably improved in appearance by her new dress but looking pale and anxious for she probably found this meeting a trying one the two women looked earnestly at each other but demetria to hide her nervousness i suppose had framed her face in the old impassive almost cold expression it had worn when i first knew her and paquíta was repelled by it so after a somewhat lukewarm greeting they sat down and made commonplace remarks two women more unlike each other in appearance character education and disposition it would have been difficult to find still i had hoped they might be friends and felt keenly disappointed at the result of their first meeting after an uncomfortable interval we all rose i was about to proceed to the deck they to their respective cabins when paquíta without any warning of what was coming suddenly burst into tears and threw her arms about demetrias neck  oh dear demetria what a sad life yours has been she exclaimed  that was like her so impulsive and with such a true instinct to make her do the right thing always the other gladly responded to the embrace and i hastily retreated leaving them kissing and mingling their tears  when i got out on deck i found that we were already on our way sails up and a fresh wind sending us swiftly through the dull green water there were five steerage passengers disreputablelooking fellows in ponchos and slouch hats lounging about the deck smoking but when we got outside the harbour and the ship began to toss a little they very soon dropped their cigars and began ignominiously creeping away out of sight of the grinning sailors only one remained a grizzlybearded roughlooking old gaucho who firmly kept his seat at the stern as if determined to see the last of the mount as the pretty city near the foot of magellans hill is called by the english people in this region  to satisfy myself that none of these fellows were sent in pursuit of demetria i asked our italian captain who they were and how long they had been on board and was much relieved to hear that they were fugitivesrebels probablyand had all been concealed for the past three or four days in the ship waiting to get away from montevideo  towards evening it came on very rough the wind veering to the south and blowing half a gale a very favourable wind as it happened to take us across this unlovely silver sea as the poets of the plata insist on calling it with its villainous brickred chopping waves so disagreeable to bad sailors paquíta and demetria suffered agonies so that i was obliged to keep with them a good deal i very imprudently told them not to be alarmed that it was nothingonly seasicknessand i verily believe they both hated me with all their hearts for a little while in consequence fortunately i had anticipated these harrowing scenes and had provided a bottle of champagne for the occasion and after i had consumed two or three glassfuls to encourage them showing how easy this kind of medicine is to take i prevailed on them to drink the remainder at length about ten oclock in the evening they began to suspect that their malady was not going to prove fatal and seeing them so much better i went up to get some fresh air there at the stern still sat the stoical old gaucho looking extremely miserable  good evening old comrade said i will you smoke a cigar  young master you seem to have a good heart he returned shaking his head at the proffered cigar do for gods sake get me a little rum i am dying for something to warm my inside and stop my head from going round like a top but nothing can i get from these jabbering foreign brutes on board  yes why not my old friend said i and going to the master of the boat i succeeded in getting a pint of rum in a bottle  the old fellow clutched it with eager delight and took a long draught ah he said patting first the bottle then his stomach this puts new life into a man will this voyage never end master when i am on horseback i can forget that i am old but these cursed waves remind me that i have lived many years  i lit my cigar and sat down to have a talk with him  ah with you foreigners it is just the sameland or water he continued you can even smokewhat a calm head and quiet stomach you must have but what puzzles me is this señor how you a foreigner come to be travelling with native women now there is that beautiful young señora with the violet eyes who can she be  she is my wife old man said i laughing a little amused at his curiosity  ah you are married thenso young she is beautiful graceful well educated the daughter of wealthy parents no doubt but frail frail señor and some day not a very distant daybut why should i predict sorrow to a gay heart only her face señor is strange to me it does not recall the features of any oriental family i know  that is easily explained i said surprised at his shrewdness she is an argentine not an oriental  ah that explains it he said taking another long pull at the bottle as for the other señora with you i need not ask you who she is  why who is she i returned  a peralta if there ever was one he returned confidently  his reply disturbed me not a little for after all my precautions this old man had perhaps been sent to follow demetria  yes he continued with an evident pride in his knowledge of families and faces which tended to allay my suspicions a peralta and not a madariaga nor a sanchez nor a zelaya nor an ibarra do i not know a peralta when i see one and here he laughed scornfully at the absurdity of such an idea  tell me i said how do you know a peralta  the question he exclaimed you are a frenchman or a german from over the sea and do not understand these things have i borne arms forty years in my countrys service not to know a peralta on earth they are with me if i go to heaven i meet them there and in hell i see them for when have i charged into the hottest of the fight and have not found a peralta there before me but i am speaking of the past señor for now i am also like one that has been left on the field forgottenleft for the vultures and foxes you will no longer find them walking on the earth only where men have rushed together sword in hand you will find their bones ah friend and here overcome with sad memories the ancient warrior took another drink from his bottle  they cannot all be dead said i if as you imagine the señora travelling with me is a peralta  as i imagine he repeated scornfully do i not know what i am talking about young sir they are dead i tell youdead as the past dead as oriental independence and honour did i not ride into the fight at gil de los medanos with the last of the peraltas calixto when he received his baptism of blood fifteen years old señor only fifteen when he galloped into the fight for he had the light heart the brave spirit and the hand swift to strike of a peralta and after the fight our colonel santa coloma who was killed the other day at san paulo embraced the boy before all the troops he is dead señor and with calixto died the house of peralta  you knew santa coloma then i said but you are mistaken he was not killed at san paulo he made his escape  so they saythe ignorant ones he returned but he is dead for he loved his country and all who are of that mind are slain how should he escape  i tell you he is not dead i repeated vexed at his stubborn persistence i also knew him old man and was with him at san paulo  he looked at me for a long time and then took another swig from his bottle  señor this is not a thing i love joking about said he let us talk of other things what i want to know is what is calixtos sister doing here why has she left her country  receiving no reply to this question he went on has she not got property yes a large estancia impoverished ruined if you like but still a very large tract of land when your enemies do not fear you then they cease to persecute a broken old man bereft of reasonsurely they would not trouble him no no she is leaving her country for other reasons yes there is some private plot against her some design perhaps to carry her off or even to destroy her and get possession of her property naturally in such a case she would fly for protection to buenos ayres where there is one with some of her blood in his veins able to protect her person and her property  i was astonished to hear him but his last words were a mystery to me  there is no one in buenos ayres to protect her i said i only will be there as i am here to shield her and if as you think she has an enemy he must reckon with meone who like that calixto you speak of has a hand quick to strike  there spoke the heart of a blanco he exclaimed clutching my arm and then the boat giving a lurch at that moment almost dragging me down in his efforts to steady himself after another sip of rum he went on but who are you young sir if that is not an impertinent question do you possess money influence powerful friends that you take upon yourself the care of this woman is it in your power to baffle and crush her enemy or enemies to protect not only her person but her property which in her absence will become the prey of robbers  and who are you old man i returned unable to give a satisfactory answer to one of his searching questions and why do you ask me these things and who is this powerful person you speak of in buenos ayres with some of her blood in his veins but of whose existence she is ignorant  he shook his head silently then deliberately proceeded to take out and light a cigarette he smoked with a placid enjoyment which made me think that his refusal of my cigar and his bitter complaints about the effects of the ships tossing on him had merely been to get the bottle of rum out of me he was evidently a veteran in more senses than one and now finding that i would tell him no more secrets he refused to answer any questions fearing that i had imprudently told him too much already i finally left him and retired to my bunk  next morning we arrived at buenos ayres and cast anchor about two miles from shore for that was as near the land as we could get presently we were boarded by a custom house officer and for some time longer i was engaged in getting out our luggage and in bargaining with the captain to put us on shore when i had completed these arrangements i was very much surprised to see the cunning old soldier i had talked with the evening before sitting in the custom house boat which was just putting off from the side demetria had been looking on when the old fellow had left the ship and she now came to me looking very excited  richard she said did you notice that man who was a passenger with us and who has just gone off in the boat it is santa coloma  oh absurd i exclaimed i talked with that old man last night for an houran old greybearded gaucho and no more like santa coloma than that sailor  i know i am right she returned the general has visited my father at the estancia and i know him well he is disguised now and has made himself look like a peasant but when he went over the side into the boat he looked full into my face i knew him and started then he smiled for he saw that i had recognised him  the very fact that this commonlooking old man had gone on shore in the custom house boat proved that he was a person of consequence in disguise and i could not doubt that demetria was right i felt excessively annoyed at myself for having failed to penetrate his disguise for something of the old marcos marcó style of speaking might very well have revealed his identity if i had only had my wits about me i was also very much concerned on demetrias account for it seemed that i had missed finding out something for her which would have been to her advantage to know i was ashamed to tell her of that conversation about a relation in buenos ayres but secretly determined to try and find santa coloma to get him to tell me what he knew  after landing we put our small luggage into a fly and were driven to an hotel in calle lima an outoftheway place kept by a german but i knew the house to be a quiet respectable one and very moderate in its charges  about five oclock in the afternoon we were together in the sittingroom on the first floor looking down on the street from the window when a wellappointed carriage with a gentleman and two young ladies in it drew up before the door  oh richard exclaimed paquíta in the greatest excitement it is don pantaleon villaverde with his daughters and they are getting out  who is villaverde i asked  what do you not know he is a judge of first instance and his daughters are my dearest friends is it not strange to meet them like this oh i must see them to ask for papa and mamita and here she began to cry  the waiter came up with a card from the señor villaverde requesting an interview with the señorita peralta  demetria who had been trying to soothe paquítas intense excitement and infuse a little courage into her was too much amazed to speak and in another moment our visitors were in the room paquíta started up tearful and trembling then her two young friends after staring at her for a few moments delivered a screech of astonishment and rushed into her arms and all three were locked together for some time in a triangular embrace  when the excitement of this tempestuous meeting had spent itself señor villaverde who stood looking on with grave impressive face spoke to demetria telling her that his old friend general santa coloma had just informed him of her arrival in buenos ayres and of the hotel where she was staying probably she did not even know who he was he said he was her relation his mother was a peralta a first cousin of her unhappy father colonel peralta he had come to see her with his daughters to invite her to make his house her home during her stay in buenos ayres he also wished to help her with her affairs which his friend the general had informed him were in some confusion he had he concluded many influential friends in the sister city who would be ready to assist him in arranging matters for her  demetria recovering from the nervousness she had experienced on finding that paquítas great friends were her visitors thanked him warmly and accepted his offer of a home and assistance then with a quiet dignity and selfpossession one would hardly expect from a girl coming amongst fashionable people for the first time in her life she greeted her newfound relations and thanked them for their visit  as they insisted on taking demetria away with them at once she left us to make her preparations while paquíta remained conversing with her friends having many questions to ask them she was consumed with anxiety to know how her family and especially her father who made the domestic laws now after so many months regarded her elopement and marriage with me her friends however either knew nothing or would not tell her what they knew  poor demetria she had with no time given her for reflection taken the wise course of at once accepting the offer of her influential and extremely dignified kinsman but it was hard for her to leave her friends at such short notice and when she came back prepared for her departure the separation tried her severely with tears in her eyes she bade paquíta farewell but when she took my hand in hers for some time her trembling lips refused to speak overcoming her emotions by a great effort she at length said addressing her visitors for my escape from a sad and perilous position and for the pleasure of finding myself here amongst relations i am indebted to this young friend who has been a brother to me  señor villaverde listened and bowed towards me but with no softening in his stern calm face while his cold grey eyes seemed to look straight through me at something beyond his manner towards me made me feel a kind of despair for how strong must have been his disapproval of my conduct in running off with his friends daughterhow great his indignation against me when it prevented him from bestowing one smile or one kind word on me to thank me for all i had done for his kinswoman yet this was only the reflected indignation of my fatherinlaw  we went down to the carriage to see them off and then finding myself for a moment by the side of one of the young ladies i tried to find out something for myself pray tell me señorita i said what you know about my fatherinlaw if it is very bad i promise you my wife shall not hear a word of it but it is best that i should know the truth before meeting him  a cloud came over her bright expressive face while she glanced anxiously at paquíta then bending towards me she whispered ah my friend he is implacable i am so sorry for paquítas sake and then with a smile of irrepressible coquetry she added and for yours  the carriage drove away and demetrias eyes looking back at me were filled with tears but in señor villaverdes eyes also glancing back there was an expression that boded ill for my future his feeling was natural perhaps for he was the father of two very pretty girls  implacable and i was now divided from him by no silver or brickcoloured sea by returning i had made myself amenable to the laws i had broken by marrying a girl under age without her fathers consent the person in england who runs away with a ward in chancery is not a greater offender against the law than i was it was now in his power to have me punished to cast me into prison for an indefinite time and if not to crush my spirit he would at least be able to break the heart of his unhappy daughter those wild troubled days in the purple land now seemed to my mind peaceful happy days and the bitter days with no pleasure in them were only now about to begin implacable  suddenly looking up i found paquítas violet eyes full of sad questioning fixed on my face  tell me truly richard what have you heard she asked  i forced a smile and taking her hand assured her that i had heard nothing to cause her any uneasiness come i said let us go in and prepare to leave town tomorrow we will go back to the point we started fromyour fathers estancia for the sooner this meeting you are thinking about so anxiously is over the better will it be for all of us     appendix    history of the banda orientÁl   the country called in this work the purple land was discovered by magellan in the year 1500 and he called the hill or mountain which gives its name to the capital monte vidi he described it as a hatshaped mountain and it is probable that four centuries ago the tall conical hat which is worn to this day by women in south wales was a common form in spain and portugal  in due time settlements were made but the colonists of those days loved gold and adventure above everything and finding neither in the banda they little esteemed it for two centuries it was neglected by its white possessors while the cattle they had imported continued to multiply and returning to a feral life overran the country in amazing numbers  the heroic period in south american history then passed away el dorado the spaniards new jerusalem has changed into a bank of malarious mist and a cloud of mosquitoes amazons giants pigmies      the anthropophagi and men whose heads     do grow beneath their shoulders  when closely looked for turned out to be red indians of a type which varied but little throughout the entire vast continent wanderers from the old world grew weary of seeking the tropics only to sink into flowery graves they turned away sick at heart from the great desolation where the splendid empire of the children of the sun had so lately flourished the accumulated treasures had been squandered the cruel crusades of the paulists against the jesuit missions had ceased for the inhuman slavehunters had utterly destroyed the smiling gardens in the wilderness a remnant of the escaped converts had gone back to a wild life in the woods and the fathers who had done their masters work so well drifted away to mingle in other scenes or die of broken hearts then in the sober eighteenth century when the disillusion was complete spain woke up to the fact that in the temperate part of the continent shared by her with portugal she possessed a new bright little spain worth cultivating about the same time portugal discovered that the acquisition of this pretty country with its lovely lusitanian climate would nicely round off her vast possessions on the south side forthwith these two great colonising powers fell to fighting over the banda where there were no temples of beaten gold or mythical races of men or fountains of everlasting youth the quarrel might have continued to the end of time so languidly was it conducted by both parties had not great events come to swallow up the little ones  at the beginning of the nineteenth century the english invasion burst like a sudden terrible thunderstorm on the country montevideo on the east and buenos ayres on the west side of the sealike river were captured and lost again the storm was soon over but it had the effect of precipitating the revolution of 1810 which presently ended in the loss to spain of all her american possessions these changes brought only fresh wars and calamities to the longsuffering banda the ancient feud between spain and portugal descended to the new brazilian empire and the new argentine confederation and these claimants contended for the country until 1828 when they finally agreed to let it govern itself in its own fashion after thus acquiring its independence the little belgium of the new world cast off its pretty but hated appellation of cisplatina and resumed its old joyous name of banda orientál with light hearts the people then proceeded to divide themselves into two political partieswhites and reds endless struggles for mastery ensued in which the argentines and brazilians forgetting their solemn compact were for ever taking sides but of these wars of crows and pies it would be idle to say more since after going on for threequarters of a century they are not wholly ended yet the rambles and adventures described in the book take us back to the late sixties or early seventies of the last century when the country was still in the condition in which it had remained since the colonial days when the ten years siege of montevideo was not yet a remote event and many of the people one met had had a part in it
