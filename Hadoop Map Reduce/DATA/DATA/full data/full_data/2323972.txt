wide canadian plain all summer had fallen and only a faint breeze stirred the yellowing leaves of the poplars against the glaring blue of the northern sky the edge of the prairie cut in a long straight line above the southern horizon rounded cloudmasses hung soft and white as wool far off the prairie was washed with tints of delicate gray but as it swept in to the foreground the color changed growing in strength to brown and ocher with streaks of silvery brightness where the withered grass caught the light to the east the view was broken for the banks of a creek that wound across the broad level were lined with timberbirches and poplars growing tall in the shelter of the ravine and straggling along its crest their palecolored branches glowed among the early autumn leaves  in a gap between the trees two men stood resting on their axes and rows of logs and branches and piles of chips were scattered about the clearing the men were dressed much alike in shirts that had once been blue but were now faded to an indefinite color old brown overalls and soft felt hats that had fallen out of shape their arms were bare to the elbows the low shirtcollars left their necks exposed showing skin that had weathered like their clothing to the color of the soil standing still they were scarcely distinguishable from their surroundings  harding was thirty years old and tall and strongly built he looked virile and athletic but his figure was marked by signs of strength rather than grace his forehead was broad his eyes between blue and gray and his gaze gravely steady he had a straight nose and a firm mouth and although there was more than a hint of determination in his expression it indicated on the whole a pleasant even a magnetic disposition  devine was five years younger and of lighter build he was the handsomer of the two but he lacked that indefinite something about his companion which attracted more attention  lets quit a few minutes for a smoke suggested devine dropping his ax weve worked pretty hard since noon  he sat down on a log and took out an old corncob pipe when it was filled and lighted he leaned back contentedly against a friendly stump  harding remained standing his hand on the long axhaft his chin slightly lifted and his eyes fixed on the empty plain between him and the horizon there was no sign of life except that a flock of migrating birds were moving south across the sky in a drawnout wedge the wide expanse formed part of what was then the territory of assiniboia and is now the province of saskatchewan as far as one could see the soil was thin alluvial loam interspersed with the stiff gumbo that grows the finest wheat but the plow had not yet broken its surface small towns were springing up along the railroad track but the great plain between the saskatchewan and the assiniboine was for the most part still a waste waiting for the tide of population that had begun to flow  harding was a born pioneer and his expression grew intent as he gazed across the wilderness  what will this prairie be like fred when those poplars are tall enough to cut he said gravely indicating some saplings beside him theres going to be a big change here  thats true and its just what im counting on thats what made me leave old dakota i want to be in on the groundfloor  harding knit his brows and his face had a concentrated look he was not given to talking at large but he had a gift of halfinstinctive prevision as well as practical constructive ability and just then he felt strangely moved it seemed to him that he heard in the distance the march of a great army of new homebuilders moving forward slowly and cautiously as yet he was one of the advance skirmishers though the first scouts had already pushed on and vanished across the skyline into the virgin west  well he said think whats happening ontarios settled and busy with manufactures manitoba and the dakotas except for the sandbelts are filling up the older states are crowded and somebody owns all the soil thats worth working in the middle west england and germany are overflowing and we have roughly seven hundred miles of country here that needs people they must come the pressure behind will force them  but think what that will mean to the price of wheat its bringing only a dollar and a half now we cant raise it at a dollar  it will break the careless harding said but dollar wheat will come the branch railroads will follow the homesteads youll see the elevators dotting the prairie and when weve opened up this great tableland between the american border and the frozen line the wheat will pour into every settlement faster than the cars can haul it out prices will fall until every slack farmer has mortgaged all he owns  then what good will it do if the result is to be only mortgages  oh but i said every slack farmer it will clear out the incompetent improve our methods the oxteam and the grass trail will have to go well have steam gangplows and graded roads well have better machines all round  and afterward  hardings eyes sparkled  afterward then the men with brains and grit who have held onthe fittest who have survivedwill come into such prosperity as few farmers have ever had america with her population leaping up will have less and less wheat to ship england will steadily call for more well have wheat at a price that will pay us well before were through then therell be no more dugouts and logshacks but fine brick homesteads with all the farms fenced and mechanical transport on the roads its coming fred those who live through the struggle will certainly see it  harding laughed and lifted his ax  but enough of that if were to get our homesteads up before the frost comes well have to hustle  the big ax flashed in the sunshine and bit deep into a poplar trunk but when a few more logs had been laid beside the rest the men stopped again for they heard a beat of hoofs coming toward them across the prairie the trees cut off their view of the rider but when he rounded a corner of the bluff and pulled up his horse they saw a young lad picturesquely dressed in a deerskin jacket of indian make decorated with fringed hide and embroidery cord ridingbreeches and polished leggings his slouch hat was pushed back on his head showing a handsome face that had in it a touch of imperiousness  hello he said with a look of somewhat indignant surprise what are you fellows doing here  harding felt amused at the tone of superiority in the youngsters voice yet he had a curious halfconscious feeling that there was something he recognized about the boy it was not that he had met him before but that wellbred air and the clean english intonation were somehow familiar  if you look around you harding smiled you might be able to guess that were cutting down trees  the boy gave an imperious toss of his head  what i meant was that you have no right on this property  no  it belongs to us and logs large enough for building are scarce enough already as a matter of fact were not allowed to cut these ourselves without the colonels permission  havent met him yet said devine dryly whos he  colonel mowbray of allenwood grange  and whos colonel mowbray and wheres allenwood grange  the boy seemed nettled by the twinkle in devines eyes but harding noticed that pride compelled him to hide his feelings  you cant cut this lumber without asking leave besides youre spoiling one of our best coyote covers  kyotes exclaimed devine what do you do with em  the youngster stared at him a moment in disdain  we have a pack of hounds at the grange he then condescended to answer  hunt them well now thats mighty strange id have thought youd find arsenic cheaper then if you were to lie out round the chickenhouse with a gun  the boy cut him short  if you want these logs you must ask for them shall i tell the colonel you are coming to do so  well sonny drawled devine you just run along home and send somebody grownup we might talk to him  as it happens the boy said with great dignity kenwyne is in the bluff i must warn you not to touch a tree until you see him  without another word he turned and rode off  during the conversation harding had been studying him closely the wellbred reserve in his manner which while peremptory was somehow free from arrogance compelled the mans admiration  from the old country he said with a laugh and a bit highhanded but theres sand in him do you know anything about allenwood  not much but i heard the boys talking about it at the railroad store its a settlement of hightoned britishers with more money than sense they play at farming and ride round the country on pedigree horses  the horse the boy rode was certainly a looker harding commented swinging his ax once more  as it sliced out a chip with a ringing thud and another and yet another the boy returned accompanied by a wellmounted older man with a sallow face and very dark eyes and a languidly graceful air the man was plainly dressed but he wore the stamp harding had noticed on the youngster and again there flashed through hardings mind the halfindistinct thought that these people were familiar to him  i understand that you insist upon cutting this timber kenwyne began  yes harding replied and i was surprised when your friend here said it belonged to colonel mowbray  he went too far but it does belong to him in a sense the colonel founded the settlement when very few other people thought of leaving manitoba and he had the usual option of cutting all the wood he wanted on unoccupied land we have always got it here and as we have done all the roadmaking and general improvements in the neighborhood we have come to look upon it as our own  is that your bridge across the creek  yes and its not a bad job i think we had a good deal of trouble digging out the grade in the ravine  well interfering with bridges is not a habit of mine so well let your trail stand but i could make you divert it to the proper road reserve  ah exclaimed kenwyne that sounds significant  precisely this bluff and the section it stands on belong to me the transfer was registered at the land office a week ago  then i think theres nothing more to be said  oh harding responded with a smile you might tell your colonel that when he wants any lumber he may cut it if hell let me know  kenwyne laughed  thanks he said its a generous offer but i cant promise that colonel mowbray will avail himself of your permission i wish you good afternoon  he rode away with his companion and an hour later harding and devine threw their axes on their shoulders and struck out across the prairie the sun had dipped the air was getting cool and on the cleancut western horizon a soft red flush faded beneath a band of vivid green  at the foot of a low rise the men stopped  ill be around the first thing in the morning devine said  then youre not coming to supper  no devine answered reluctantly i guess not ive been over twice this week and hester has enough to do without extra cooking for me  as you wish said harding and they separated in a friendly manner  when he was alone harding went on briskly walking with an elastic step and looking far ahead across the shadowy plain it was a rich land that stretched away before him and a compact block of it belonged to him it was virgin soil his to do with as he liked he thought that he could make good use of it but he had no illusions he knew all about prairie farming and was prepared for a hard struggle  crossing the rise he headed for a glow of light that flickered in the gloom of a small birch bluff and presently stopped at a tent pitched among the trees two big red oxen were grazing by the edge of the bluff a row of birch logs lay among the grass beside a pile of shiplap boards and some more of the boards had been roughly built into a pointed shack in front of this a young girl bent over a fire that burned between two logs all round except where the wood broke the view the wilderness rolled away dim and silent  hester harding looked up with a smile when her brother stopped she resembled him for she had his direct thoughtful glance and fine proportions her face and hands were browned by sun and wind but although she had worked hard from childhood she wore no coarsening stamp of toil her features were good and the plain print dress she had made in her scanty spare time became her  tired craig she asked in a pleasant voice  not quite as fresh as i was at sunup harding smiled we got through a good deal of work today and ill soon be able to make a start with the house well have to rush the framing to get finished before the frost  while they ate their simple supper they talked about his building plans and he answered her questions carefully for hester had keen intelligence and had shared his work and ambitions for the past few years for the most part their life had been hard and frugal until craig reached the age of eighteen he had helped his father to cultivate his patch of wheatsoil in an arid belt of north dakota then the father had died leaving about a thousand dollars besides his land and teams and the lad had courageously taken up the task of supporting his mother and sister two years afterward mrs harding died and craig at the age of twenty set himself to consider the future  during his management of the farm he had made more money than his father had ever made but the land was poor and incapable of much improvement on the other hand dakota was getting settled and homesteads were becoming valuable and craig determined to sell out and invest the money in a larger holding in a thinly populated part of manitoba hester went with him to canada and when the advancing tide of settlement reached their new home craig sold out again getting much more than he had paid for his land and moved west ahead of the army of prairiebreakers which he knew would presently follow him it was a simple plan but it needed courage and resourcefulness he spoke of it to hester when he lighted his pipe after the meal  it was a notion of fathers that one should try to anticipate a big general movement he remarked keep a little in front the pioneers get the pickings he once told me if you follow the main body youll find the land swept bare he had a way of saying things like that i learned a good deal from him  he knew a good deal said hester thoughtfully he was more clever than you are craig but he hadnt your habit of putting his ideas into practise ive sometimes thought he must have lost heart after some big trouble long ago and only made an effort now and then for mothers sake its strange that we know nothing about him except that he came from the old country  craig had often wondered about his father for the man had been somewhat of an enigma to him basil harding had lived like his neighbors who were plain tillers of the soil and he never spoke of his english origin but now and then he showed a breadth of thought and refinement of manner that were not in keeping with his environment mrs harding was the daughter of a michigan farmer a shrewd but gentle woman of practical turn of mind  i wonder craig said how much mother knew  she must have known something once or twice near the end i think she meant to tell us for there was something troubling her but the last stroke came so suddenly and she never spoke hester paused as if lost in painful memories and then went on it was very strange about that money you got  craig nodded when he was twentyone a winnipeg lawyer had turned over to him five thousand dollars on condition that he remain in canada and make no attempt to communicate with his fathers relatives  yes he said and something happened this afternoon that puzzled me  he told hester about his meeting with the men from allenwood  the curious thing about it he added is that as i watched the boy sitting on his fine blooded horse and heard him speak i felt as if id once lived among hightoned english people and could somehow understand what he was thinking but of course i never had a horse like his and we were born in a rough shack on a poor dakota farm can one inherit ones ancestors feelings and memories  its very strange mused hester  harding laughed  well anyway im a farmer he said i stand upon my own feetregardless of ancestors what i am is what i make of myself  he moved off toward the tent  its getting late he called back to her  but for a long time hester sat beside the sinking fire her brother whom she loved and admired differed slightly but noticeably in one or two respects from any of the prairie farmers she had known though it was hard to procure books he had read widely and about other subjects than agriculture odd tricks of thought and speech also suggested the difference but she knew that nobody else except her mother had noticed it for to all intents craig was merely a shrewd hardworking grower of wheat  then the girls face grew gentle as she thought of fred devine he had proved very constant and had several times made what was then a long and adventurous journey to see her now when his father had given him a few hundred dollars he had followed craig and she was ready to marry him as soon as he could make a home for her at present he was living in a dugout in a bank and must harvest his first crop before he could think about a house  when the fire had died down to a few smoldering coals hester got up and looked about her the moon hung large and red above the prairies rim the air was sharp and wonderfully exhilarating behind the tent the birch leaves rustled softly in the bluff and in the distance a coyote howled there was no other sound it was all very still and strangely lonely but the girl felt no shrinking on her mothers side she sprang from a race of pioneers and her true work was to help in the breaking of the wilderness     chapter ii  portents of change   the moon was above the horizon when kenwyne pulled up his horse to a walk opposite allenwood grange the view from this point always appealed to the artist in kenwyne the level plain was broken here by steep sandy rises crowned with jackpines and clumps of poplar and a shallow lake reached out into the open from their feet a short distance back from its shore the grange stood on a gentle slope with a grove of birches that hid the stables and outbuildings straggling up the hill behind  as kenwyne saw it in the moonlight across the glittering water the house was picturesque in the center rose a square unpretentious building of notched logs but from this shiplap additions showing architectural taste stretched out in many wings so that from a distance the homestead with its wooded background had something of the look of an old english manor house it was this which made the colonists of allenwood regard it with affection now it was well lighted and the yellow glow from its windows shone cheerfully across the lake  the foundations of the place had been laid in unsettled times after the hudson bay furtraders had relinquished their control of the trackless west but before the dominion government had established its authority the farmers were then spreading cautiously across the manitoban plain in some fear of the metis halfbreeds and it was considered a bold adventure when the builder of the grange pushed far out into the prairies of the assiniboine he had his troubles but he made his holding good and sold it to colonel mowbray who founded the allenwood settlement  on the whole the colony had succeeded but kenwyne saw that it might become an anachronism in changing times he had noted the advance of the hardbitten homesteaders who were settling wherever the soil was good and who were marked by sternly utilitarian methods and democratic ideas before long allenwood must cast off its aristocratic traditions and compete with these newcomers but kenwyne feared that its founder was not the man to change  as he rode slowly past the lake a man came toward him with a gun and a brace of prairiechickens  hello ralph he said have you forgotten that its council night  im not likely to forget after the rebuke i got for missing the last meeting kenwyne replied do you happen to know what kind of temper the colonel is in broadwood  my opinion is that it might be better gerald mowbray has turned up again and ive noticed that the old man is less serene than usual when his sons about in fact as we have to bear the consequences i wish the fellow would stay away  while broadwood and kenwyne were discussing him on the hillside colonel mowbray sat in his study at the grange talking to the elder of his two sons the room was small and plainly furnished with a map of the territory on the matchboarded wall a plain table on which lay a few bundles of neatly docketed papers and a stove in one corner accountbooks filled a shelf and beneath there was a row of pigeonholes the room had an air of austere simplicity with which colonel mowbrays appearance harmonized  he was tall but spare of flesh with an erect carriage and an autocratic expression his hair was gray his eyes were dark and keen and his mouth was unusually firm but the hollowness of his face and the lines on his forehead showed advancing age he was a man of some ability with simple tastes certain unchangeable convictions and a fiery temper leaving the army with a grievance which he never spoke about and being of too restless a character to stay at home he had founded allenwood for the purpose of settling young englishmen upon the land he demanded that they be well born have means enough to make a fair start and that their character should bear strict investigation though the two latter conditions were not invariably complied with his scheme had prospered mowbray was generous and had taken the sons of several old friends who did not possess the capital required while the discipline he enforced had curbed the wayward for the most part the settlers regarded him with affection as well as respect but he had failed most signally with his own son who now stood rather awkwardly before him  after serving for a year or two in india as an engineer lieutenant gerald mowbray met with an accident which forced him to leave the army he made an unsuccessful start on another career and had of late been engaged upon a government survey of the rugged forestbelt which runs west to the confines of the manitoban plain he was a handsome darkcomplexioned man but looked slacker and less capable than his father  i think five hundred pounds would clear me he said in an apologetic tone if i could pay off these fellows it would be a great relief and id faithfully promise to keep clear of debt in future  it seems to me ive heard something of the kind on previous occasions mowbray returned dryly theres a weak strain in you gerald though i dont know where you got it i suppose a thousand pounds would be better  geralds eyes grew eager but the next moment his face fell for he knew his fathers methods and saw his ironical smile  well he said cautiously i could straighten things out if i had five hundred  with what you got from your mother  gerald winced his mother never refused him even though he knew that it often meant sacrifice on her part  to save our name mowbray said sternly and for that reason only i am going to let you have three hundred pounds but i warn you its the last youll get you may as well know that it is hard to spare this  gerald looked his surprise  i thought  mowbray interrupted him  my affairs are not so prosperous as they seem but i rely on you not to mention the fact now you may go but remembertheres to be no more money thrown away  when gerald closed the door mowbray took down one of his accountbooks and sat still for a long time studying it he had never been rich but he had had enough and as the settlement grew up he had felt justified in selling to newcomers at moderate prices land which he had got as a free grant now however the land was nearly all taken up for a time he bred cattle but this had scarcely paid then the development of the milling industry and the building of elevators rendered wheatgrowing possible and though the grain had to be hauled a long way mowbray made a small profit prices however were falling and land nearer the railroad was coming into cultivation  with a gloomy air mowbray closed the book and went down to preside over the council which was held periodically and as a rule ended in an evening of social amusement  the hall was large and square with matchboarded walls and a pointed roof in an open hearth a log fire burned cheerily although two large windows were opened wide to let in the september air bunches of wheat and oats of unusual growth hung upon the walls suggesting the settlers occupation but it was significant that the grain was surmounted by a row of the heads of prairie antelope as well as moose and caribou from the north they were farmers at allenwood but they were sportsmen first  about a dozen men were sitting round a table when mowbray entered but they rose and waited until he took his place they varied in age from twenty to forty and in their easy manners and natural grace one recognized the stamp of birth evening dress was not the rule at allenwood and while some wore white shirts and city clothes others were attired picturesquely in redlaced blue vests and fringed deerskin their brown faces and athletic figures indicated a healthy life in the open but they had too gallant and careless an air for toilers  a few suggestions for the improvement of the trails were made and discussed and then mowbray turned to kenwyne who had spent the afternoon looking for suitable logs for the bridgestringers  did you and lance find anything mowbray asked  kenwyne was waiting for this opening to make what he felt was an important announcement  we went to the bluff he said what we found was two homesteaders cutting down all the best trees  homesteaders  mowbray frowned and the others looked interested  you warned them off of course  lance did but one of the fellows retorted that the timber was his  impossible mowbray said sharply the nearest preemption is six miles offand thats too close  it appears that the man has just bought the section on our western rangeline he referred me to the land register if i had any doubt im afraid you must take it for granted sir that we are going to have neighbors  never mowbray brought his fist down on the table with a resounding blow we may not be able to turn out these intruders but i decline to consider them neighbors of ours he turned to the others you must see that this is disturbing news we came here to live in accordance with the best english traditions and although we had to put up with some hardships there were compensationsabundant sport space and freedom in a sense the country was ours with its wood and water as far as we cared to ride now every homestead that is built restricts what we have regarded with some justice as our rights we took heavy risks in settling here when people believed it was economically impossible to farm at allenwood  there was a murmur of approval  these fellows will put an end to our running range horses and cattle one man said if many of them come into the district we may have to put down the coyote hounds and ask permission before we course a jackrabbit then they could make us divert our trails to the road reserves  something of that kind may happen kenwyne interposed but the fellow i met seemed inclined to be friendly said hed let our trail stand and we might cut what wood we wanted provided we get his permission  mowbray drew himself up haughtily  although you recognize the lesser drawbacks he said im afraid you miss the most important point i must remind you that this settlement was founded to enable a certain stamp of englishmen to enjoy a life that was becoming more difficult without large means at home a man with simple tastes could find healthy occupation out of doors keep a good horse and get as much shooting as he wanted so long as his farming covered or nearly covered his expenses that was all that was required we have not discouraged the making of money but i must frankly say that this was not our object now i see threats of change we may be brought into contact and perhaps into opposition with men whose motives are different their coming here has to me a sinister meaning  allenwood has been a success said broadwood one cant deny itbut i think we owe a good deal to our having settled in a new and undeveloped country the experiment turned out well because we got the land cheap and wheat was dear now i foresee a sharp fall in prices and it seems to me that we may have to revise our methods to suit the times in future we may find it difficult to live upon our farms unless we work them properly im afraid we cant stand still while canada moves onand im not sure that its a great misfortune  do you admire modern methods somebody asked if you do youd better study what things are coming to in america and england there is not a hired man at allenwood who is not on firstrate terms with his master do you want to underpay and overdrive them or on the other hand to have them making impossible demands and playing the mischief by a harvest strike i agree with our respected leader that we dont want to change  but tell us about these intruders mowbray said to kenwyne what sort of men are they  well first of all theyre workers theres no mistaking that and id judge that they came from the statesdakota perhaps  that is to say theyre hustlers a lad broke in couldnt we buy them out before they get started sir  it would cost us something to buy a section and we would have to work part of it to pay the new taxes then the fellows would probably find out that it was an easy way of getting a good price and we couldnt keep on buying them out we have all the land we want and must be careful whom we allow to join us  i think we should try to keep an open mind kenwyne suggested it might pay us to watch the men and see what they can teach us sooner or later we shall have to improve our farming and we may as well begin it gradually after all its something to gather two bushels of wheat where only one grew  mowbray looked at him sternly  im sorry to see you and broadwood taking this line ralph but ive long suspected that your views were not quite sound frankly im afraid of the thin end of the wedge he turned to the others you will understand that there can be no compromise we shall continue to live as english gentlemen and have nothing to do with the grasping commercialism that is getting a dangerous hold on the older countries i will do my best to keep allenwood free from it while i have the power  whatever my private opinions are i think you know you can rely on my loyal support in all you do for the good of the settlement sir kenwyne replied now that we have the matter before us it might be well if you told us how we are to treat these americans were bound to meet them  i cannot suggest discourtesy since it would be foreign to your character and against our traditions but i do not wish you to become intimate with them  when the meeting broke up an hour later broadwood walked home with kenwyne it was a small and unpretentious house that perched on the hillside beyond the lake but the room the men entered was comfortably furnished a few photographs of officers in uniform the football team of a famous public school and the crew of an oxford racing boat hung on the pineboard walls  we must have a talk said kenwyne i feel that these fellows settling here is important its bound to make a difference i know the type one cant ignore them theyll have to be reckoned with as friends or enemies  in spite of the colonels opinion i believe their influence will be for good what allenwood needs most is waking up broadwood laughed its curious that we should agree on this of course my marriage is supposed to account for my perversion but one can understand mowbrays painful surprise at you your views ought to be sound  what is a sound view  at allenwood its a view that agrees with mowbrays  lets be serious kenwyne replied theres something to be said for his contention after all we have got along pretty well so far  yes but the settlement has never been selfsupporting mowbray got the land for nothing and sold it in parcels as he was entitled to do spending part of the price on improvements from which we all benefit then a number of the boys got drafts from home when they lost a crop we have been living on capital instead of on revenue but the time is coming when this must stop our people at home cant keep on financing us and the land is nearly all taken up  well what follows  allenwood will shortly have to earn its living broadwood answered laughing this will be a shock to some of our friends but even with wheat going down the thing shouldnt prove insuperably difficult  we may have wheat at less than a dollar look at the quantity of good land thats available and the character of the men whore coming in theyll live on revenue in dugouts and fiftydollar shacks and all they dont spend on food will go into new teams and implements they dont expect an easy time and wont get it but well have to meet their competition personally i dont think thats impossible i believe were their equals in brain and muscle  we used to think we were superior broadwood smiled our conservative sentiments will be our greatest difficulty  im afraid well have to get rid of them  mowbray will never throw his traditions overboard  no i see trouble ahead said kenwyne  its an awkward situation ill admit instead of mowbrays leading us well have to carry him along so to speak without his knowing it as hes not a fool the thing may need more tact than were capable of for all that he must remain leader  of course said kenwyne simply he made allenwood we must stick to him  long after broadwood had gone kenwyne stood at the door of his house looking out over the lake there was no wind and the prairie was very silent stretching back in the moonlight to the horizon its loneliness was impressive but kenwyne was not deceived he knew that the tide of population and progress had already passed its boundaries and was flowing fast up every channel following the railroad the rivers and the furtraders trails it would wash away the old landmarks and undermine every barrier that mowbray could raise kenwyne wondered what would happen when allenwood was surrounded by the flood after all it depended upon the settlers whether the inundation proved destructive or fertilizing     chapter iii  at the ford   a few days after the council beatrice colonel mowbrays only daughter sat talking with her mother in the drawingroom at the grange beatrice had returned on the previous evening from a visit to england and it struck her perhaps by contrast with the homes of her mothers friends that the room had a dingy cheerless look the few pieces of good furniture which mowbray had brought with him had suffered during transport and showed signs of age the others sent out from toronto were crudely new rugs and curtains were faded and there were places that had been carefully mended the matchboarded walls looked very bare more than all it struck the girl that her mother seemed listless and worn  mrs mowbray was a gentle reserved woman she was still beautiful but the years she had spent upon the prairie had left their mark on her she had lost her former vivacity and something of her independence of thought and except to those who knew her well her character seemed colorless mowbray was considerate of his wife but there was no room under his roof for two directing wills or more than one set of opinions for all that mrs mowbray wore an air of quiet dignity  beatrice had a trace of her fathers imperious temper she looked very fresh for a life spent largely out of doors had given her a vigorous graceful carriage as well as a fine warm color and had set a sparkle in her deepblue eyes there was a hint of determination about her mouth and her glance was often proud she was just twentytwo and the fashionable english dress set off her gracefully outlined and rather slender figure  as she looked at her mother her face grew thoughtful  you are not looking well mother dear she said  i am not ill mrs mowbray answered in a tired voice it has been a very hot and trying summer and the crop was poor that had its effect upon your father then you have heard that gerald  there was a quick indignant flash in beatrices eyes  yes i know of course i stand up for him to outsiders but im getting ashamed of gerald his debts must have been a heavy tax on father i think that too much has been done for the boys i have nothing to complain of but were not rich and im afraid you have had to suffer  my dear you mustnt question your fathers judgment  beatrice smiled  i suppose not and my criticism would certainly be wasted still you cant expect me to have your patience  she went to one of the long windows in the drawingroom and threw it open wide  how i love the prairie she exclaimed looking out over the vast plain that stretched away to a sky all rose and purple and gold  a tired smile crept into her mothers face  it has its charm she said but after all you have been away at school and have not seen much of it one has to do without so much here and when you have gone through an unvarying round of duties day after day for years seeing only the same few people and hearing the same opinions you find it dreary one longs to meet clever strangers and feel the stir and bustle of life now and then but instead there comes another care or a fresh responsibility you dont realize yet what a bad harvest or a fall in the wheat market means for while the men have their troubles in a settlement like allenwood the heaviest burden falls upon the women  you must have had to give up a good deal to come here beatrice said  i loved your father and i knew that he could not be happy in england was the simple answer  beatrice was silent for a few moments it was the first time she had understood the sacrifice her mother had made and she was moved to sympathy then in the flighty manner of youth she changed the subject  oh i must tell you about dear mr morel catching an alert look in her mothers eyes beatrice laughed then with a quick impulsive movement she crossed the floor took her mothers face between both her hands and kissed it no she answered the question that had not been spoken mr morel is a lovely old man who lives all alone with just his servants at ash garth in a fine old house full of art treasures that seem to have been collected from all over the world and theres a rose garden between the lawn and the river and a big woods all round mr morel is charming and he was particularly kind to me because he and uncle gordon are such great friends  did you see much of him  oh yes and i like him but mother beatrice lowered her voice dramatically theres a mystery in his life im sure of it i asked uncle gordon but if he knew he wouldnt tell then i tried to question mr morel  why beatrice  the girl laughed at her mothers shocked tone  dont worry mother dear he didnt know i was questioning him and i do love a mystery all i learned was that it has something to do with canada whenever i talked about the prairie he looked so sad and once i even thought i saw tears in his eyes  beatrices brows came together in a perplexed frown then she laughed gently  mysteries have a fascination for me she said i like to puzzle them out but i must leave you now for i promised to go see evelyn this afternoon i may not get home until late  half an hour later beatrice was in the saddle riding across the bare sweep of prairie to one of the distant homesteads when she reached the river the stream was turbid and running fast but a narrow trail through the poplars on its bank led to the ford and she urged her horse into it fearlessly on the other side the trail was very faint and a stake upon a rise indicated where the crossing was safe a large grass fire was burning some miles away for a tawny cloud of smoke trailed across the plain  beatrice spent a pleasant hour with her friend and started home alone as dusk was falling the sky was clear and the moon hung some distance above the horizon a cold breeze had sprung up and the grass fire had grown fiercer beatrice could see it stretching toward the river in a long red line and after a while she rode into the smoke it grew thicker and more acrid she could not see her way and her horse was getting frightened when an orange glare leaped up not far away the animal broke into a gallop pulling hard and after some trouble in stopping it beatrice changed her direction she was not afraid of prairie fires which as a rule can be avoided easily but this one would necessitate her making a round  she found it difficult to get out of the smoke and when she reached the river it was at some distance above the stake she could not ride back because the fire was moving up from that direction cutting her off she glanced dubiously at the water it ran fast between steep timbercovered banks she did not think she could get down to it and she knew there was only one safe ford still she could not spend the night upon the wrong bank and the fire was drawing closer all the time worse still her horse was becoming unmanageable she rode upstream for a mile but the river looked deep and the eddies swirled in a forbidding way the bank was abrupt and rotten and beatrice dared not attempt it in front the moon which was getting higher threw a clear light upon the water behind the smoke rolled up thickly to meet her the fire was closing in upon the stream with his nostrils filled with the sting of the smoke the horse reared and threatened to dash over the crumbling bank beatrice realizing her danger turned him back downstream and gave him the rein  she did not hope to reach the fordthere was a wall of impenetrable fire and smoke between her and the stake she could not attempt the river where the bank was so steep and the current so swift  with her own eyes smarting and her breathing difficult beatrice suddenly leaned forward and patted the trembling horse he had not been able to run far with his lungs full of smoke and he had now stopped in a moment of indecision  good boy she coaxed in a voice that was not quite steady go a little farther and then well try the river  hello came out of the darkness and through the acrid haze she saw a man running toward her  she hailed him eagerly but when he reached her she was somewhat disconcerted to notice that he was not as she had expected one of the allenwood settlers  she saw that he was waiting for her to speak  i want to get across and the fire has driven me from the ford she said  where are you going  to the grange  by your leave  he took the bridle and moved along the bank though he had some trouble with the frightened horse when they had gone a few yards he turned toward an awkward slope  is this crossing safe beatrice asked in alarm  its not good he answered quietly i can take you through  beatrice did not know what gave her confidence because the ford looked dangerous but she let him lead the stumbling horse down to the water the next moment the man was wading kneedeep and the stream frothed about the horses legs the current was swift and the smoke was thick and biting but the man went steadily on and they were some distance from the bank when he turned to her  pick up your skirt he said bluntly it gets steeper  beatrice laughed in spite of her danger the man certainly did not waste words  when they were nearly across the moon was suddenly hidden behind a dark cloud and at that moment the horse lost its footing and made a frantic plunge beatrice gasped but her fright was needless for her companion had firm control of the animal and in another few moments they were struggling up the bank  as they left the timber and came out of the smoke into the broad moonlight she told him to stop for the saddle had slipped in climbing the bank then for the first time they saw each other clearly  he was a big man with a quiet brown face and beatrice noticed his start of swift halfconscious admiration as he looked up at her it caused her no embarrassment because she had seen that look on the faces of other men and knew that she was pretty but she failed to estimate the effect of her beauty on a man unaccustomed to her type sitting with easy grace upon the splendid horse she had a curiously patrician air he noticed her fine calm the steadiness of her deepblue eyes and the delicate chiseling of her features indeed he never forgot the picture she made with the poplars for a background and the moonlight on her face  thank you im afraid you got very wet she said i know my way now  you cant ride on he answered the cinch buckles drawn  oh  youd better come on to my place my sister will look after you while i fix it he smiled as he added miss mowbray i presume you may have heard of mecraig harding from the section just outside your line  oh beatrice repeated i didnt know we had neighbors i have been away have you met any of the allenwood people  a sallowfaced man with dark eyes  kenwyne said beatrice hes worth knowing anybody else  there was a lad with him about eighteen riding a gray horse  yes my brother lance  harding laughed softly  thats all he said and our acquaintance didnt go very far  beatrice wondered at his amusement and she gave him a curious glance he was dressed in old brown overalls and she thought he had something of the look of the struggling farmers she had seen in manitoba hardbitten men who had come from the bush of ontario but there was a difference though she could not tell exactly where it lay hardings clothes were old and plain and she could see that he worked with his hands yet there was something about him which suggested a broader mind and more culture than she associated with the rude preemptors then though he was curt his intonation was unusually clean  she asked him a few questions about his farm which he answered pleasantly they were walking side by side along one of the prairie trails and he was leading the horse the breeze had fallen and the night was unusually still broken only by a coyote calling insistently to his mate the wide bare prairie ahead of them lay bathed in moonlight  presently a light twinkled across the plain and beatrice welcomed it because in spite of the precautions she had taken her long skirt was wet and uncomfortable  when they reached the camp they found hester busy cooking at a fire behind her stood a rude board shelter and a tent and farther off the skeleton of a house rose from the grass  beatrice studied hester harding with interest though she found her simply dressed with sleeves rolled back and hands smeared with flour the prairie girl made a favorable impression on her she liked the sensitive grave face and the candid thoughtful look  while the girth was being mended the girls talked beside the fire then harding saddled his own horse and he and beatrice rode off across the prairie when the lights of the grange were visible he turned back and soon afterward beatrice was laughingly relating her adventure to her mother and lance  so it was harding who helped you lance exclaimed i made a rather bad blunder in talking to him the other daytold him he mustnt cut some timber which it seems was his but i must say he was rather decent about it  he looked at his sister curiously and then laughed  on the whole he added as she started up the stairs it might be better not to say anything about your little experience to the colonel im inclined to think it might not please him  beatrice saw that her mother agreed with lance and she was somewhat curious but she went on up to her room without asking any questions  she began to feel interested in harding     chapter iv  the opening of the rift   a week after his meeting with beatrice mowbray harding went out one morning to plow he was in a thoughtful mood but it was characteristic that he did not allow his reflections to interfere with his work his house was unfinished and the nights were getting cold but neither hester nor he placed personal comfort first and there was a strip of land that must be broken before the frost set in  it was a calm morning and bright sunshine poured down upon the grass that ran back growing faintly blue in the distance until it faded into the mellow haze that shut in the wide circle of prairie here and there the smooth expanse was broken by small gleaming ponds and wavy lines of timber picked out in delicate shades of indigo and gray but the foreground was steeped in strong color where the light struck it the withered grass shone like silver elsewhere it was streaked with yellow and cinnamon the long furrows traced across it were a rich chocolatebrown and the turnedback clods had patches of oily brightness on their faces the leaves in a neighboring bluff formed spots of cadmium and even the big breaker plow painted crude green and vermilion did not seem out of place it was a new implement the best that harding could buy and two brawny red oxen hauled it along oxen are economical to feed and have some advantages in the first stages of breaking land but harding meant to change them for clydesdale horses and experiment with mechanical traction he used the old methods where they paid but he believed in progress  as he guided the slowly moving beasts and watched the clods roll back his brown face was grave for he had been troubled during the past seven days when he looked up at beatrice mowbray on the river bank something strange and disturbing had happened to him he was not given to indulgence in romantic sentiment and absorbed as he had been first by the necessity of providing for his sister and himself and afterward by practical ambitions he had seldom spared a thought to women marriage did not attract him he felt no longing for close companionship or domestic comfort indeed he rather liked a certain amount of hardship true his heart had once or twice been mildly stirred by girls he had met they were pretty and likableotherwise he would not have been attracted for his taste was good  in some respects harding was primitive but this perhaps tended to give him a clearer understanding of essential things and he had a vague belief that he would some day meet the woman who was destined to be his true mate what was more he would recognize her when he saw her  and when he had looked up at beatrice in the moonlight standing out clear cut against the somber background of poplars the knowledge that she was the one woman had rushed over him surging through him as strong as the swiftrunning river through which he had brought her but now that the thing had happened he must grapple with a difficult situation he knew his own value and believed that he had abilities which would carry him far toward material success but he also knew his limitations and the strength of the prejudices that would be arrayed against him that he should hope to win this girl of patrician stock was in a sense ludicrous yet he had read courage in her and steadfastness if she loved him she would not count too great any sacrifice she made for his sake but this was only one side of the matter brought up as she had been she might not stand the strain of such a life as his must be for a time a deep tenderness awoke within him he felt that she must be sheltered from all trouble and gently cared for  harding suddenly broke into a grim laugh he was going much too fastthere was no reason to believe that the girl had given him a passing thought  with a call to the oxen he went on with his plowing and the work brought him encouragement it was directly productive next fall the prairie he ripped apart would be covered with ripening grain he had found that no wellguided effort was lost it bore fruit alwaysin his case at the rate of twenty bushels of wheat or fifty bushels of oats to the acre when the seed was wisely sown the harvest followed and harding had steadily enlarged his crop now he had made his boldest venture and he looked forward to the time when his labor should change the empty plain into a fertile field  a jolt of the plow disturbed him and as he looked up the oxen stopped the share had struck hard ground on one side a sinuous line of trail rutted by wheels and beaten firm by hoofs seamed the prairie on the other the furrows ran across and blotted it out it was a road the allenwood settlers used and harding knew well what he was doing when he plowed into it still the land was his and must produce its proper yield of grain while to clear the trail with his implements would entail much useless labor he had no wish to be aggressive but if these people took his action as a challenge the fault would be theirs it was with a quiet determined smile that he called to the oxen and held down the share  at noon he turned the animals loose and going back to camp felt his heart throb as he saw beatrice mowbray talking to hester a team stood near by and the boy he had met in the bluff was stooping down beside a light fourwheeled vehicle beatrice gave harding a smile of recognition and went on talking but her brother came up to him  the pole came loose he explained and i thought you might lend me something to fasten it with  certainly harding said stooping to examine the damaged pole it wont fasten he added its broken between the iron straps and theres not wood enough to bolt them on again  lance frowned  thats a nuisance  i will give you a pole harding said there is some lumber here that will do  he picked up a small birch log as he spoke and throwing it upon two trestles set to work with an ax when he had it about the right size lance interrupted him  thats good enough ill get it smoothed off when the carpenter comes out from the settlement  that is not my plan harding smiled i like to finish a job  he adjusted a plane and beatrice watched him as he ran it along the pole it had not struck her hitherto that one could admire the simple mechanical crafts but she thought there was something fine in the prairie farmers command of the tool she noticed his easy poise as he swung to and fro the rhythmic precision of his movements and the accurate judgment he showed as the thin shavings streamed across his wrist the rough log began to change its form growing through gently tapered lines into symmetry though he had only his eye to guide him beatrice saw that he was skilfully striking the balance between strength and lightness and it was a surprise to find elements of beauty in such a common object as a wagonpole she felt that harding had taught her something when he turned to lance saying  there i guess we can put that in  the irons were soon refitted and while lance harnessed the team beatrice came to harding with a smile  thank you she said its curious that you should help me out of a difficulty twice within a week  harding flushed  if you should happen to meet with another i hope ill be near he returned  you like helping people  he pondered this longer than she thought it deserved  i believe i like straightening things out it jars me to see any one in trouble when theres a way of getting over it and i hate to see effort wasted and tools unfit for work  efficiency is your ideal then  yes i dont know that it ever struck me before but you have hit it all the same efficiency is hard to attain  beatrice looked at him curiously  i dont believe you are really a carpenter she said  unless you have plenty of money when you start breaking prairie you have to be a number of things he answered smiling difficulties keep cropping up and they must be attacked  without previous knowledge or technical training  he gave her a quick appreciative glance  you have a knack of getting at the heart of things he said in his blunt way its not common  beatrice laughed but she felt mildly flattered she liked men to treat her seriously and so few of them did somehow she felt that harding was an unusual man his toilroughened hands and his blunt manner of speech were at variance with the indefinite air of culture and goodbreeding that hovered round him there was strength shown plainly and she felt that he had abilitywhen confronted with a difficult problem he would find the best solution it was interesting to lead him on but she was to find him ready to go much farther than she desired  i hope making the new pole for us wasnt too much trouble she said lightly  it gives me keen pleasure to be of any use to you he said  the color swept into beatrices face for he was looking at her with an intent expression that made it impossible to take his remark lightly she was angry with herself for feeling confused while he looked so cool  that sounds rather cheap she replied with a touch of scorn  my excuse is that its exactly what i felt  composure in difficult circumstances was one of the characteristics of her family yet beatrice felt at a loss harding she thought was not the man to yield to a passing impulse or transgress from unmeaning effrontery but this made the shock worse  lance saved the situation by announcing that the team was ready  as the buggy jolted away across the plain beatrice sat silent she felt indignant humiliated in a sense but thrilled in spite of this the mans tone had been earnest and his gaze steadfast he meant what he said but he had taken an unwarrantable liberty nobody knew anything about him except that he was a working farmer her cheeks burned as she realized that she had perhaps been to blame in treating him too familiarly then her anger began to pass after all it was easy to forgive sincere admiration and he was certainly a fine typestrong and handsome clever with his hands and she thought endowed with unusual mental power there was something flattering in the thought that he had appreciated her for all that he must be given no opportunity for repeating the offense he must be shown that there was a wide gulf between them  lance broke in upon her thoughts  i like that fellow he said its a pity he isnt more of our kind  beatrice pondered harding was not of their kind but she did not feel sure that the difference was wholly in favor of the allenwood settlers this struck her as strange as it was contrary to the opinions she had hitherto held  why she asked carelessly  we might have seen something of him then  cant you do so now if you wish  im not sure it might not please the colonelyou know his opinions  beatrice smiled for she had often heard them dogmatically expressed  after all what is there he could object to about harding she asked  not much in one sense a good deal in another you cant deny that the way one is brought up makes a difference perhaps the worst is that hes frankly out for moneyfarming for dollars  arent we  not now were farming for pleasure but kenwyne and one or two others think therell have to be a change in that respect before long  then well be in the same position as harding wont we  i suppose so lance admitted but the colonel wont see it and i cant say that hes wrong  it seems rather complicated beatrice said dryly  she was surprised to find herself ready to contend for harding and rather than inquire into the cause of this she talked about allenwood affairs until they reached home  harding back at his plowing was thinking of beatrice he knew that he had spoken rashly but he did not regret it she now knew what he thought of her and could decide what course to take he smiled as he imagined her determining that he must be dropped for he believed the mood would soon pass he did not mean to persecute the girl with unwelcome attentions but it would not be easy to shake him off he was tenacious and knew how to wait then the difference between them was after all less wide than she probably imagined harding had kept strictly to his compact not to try to learn anything of his fathers people in england but for all that he believed himself to be the girls equal by birth that however was a point that could not be urged and he had no wish to urge it he was content to stand or fall by his own merits as a man and if beatrice was the girl he thought her she would not let his being a working farmer stand in the way this of course was taking it for granted that he could win her love he was ready to fight against her relatives opposition but even if he had the power he would put no pressure on the girl if he was the man she ought to marry she would know  a breeze got up rounded clouds with silver edges gathered in the west streaking the prairie with patches of indigo shadow and the air grew cooler as the sun sank the big oxen steadily plodded on the dry grass crackled beneath the share as the clods rolled back and by degrees hardings mind grew tranquilas generally happened when he was at work he was doing something worth while in breaking virgin ground in clearing a way for the advancing host that would people the wilderness in roughing out a career for himself whatever his fathers people were his mother sprang from a stern colonizing stock and he heard and thrilled to the call for pioneers  as the sun sank low a man pulled up his horse at the end of the trail and beckoned harding there was something imperious in his attitude as he sat with his hand on his hip watching the farmer haughtily and harding easily guessed that it was colonel mowbray he went on with his furrow and only after he had driven the plow across the grass road did he stop  are you mr harding the owner of this section demanded the head of allenwood  yes  then i must express my surprise that you have broken up our trail  it was necessary i dislike blocking a trail but you can go round by the road  you can see that its soft and boggy in wet weather  five minutes extra ride will take you over gravel soil inside the allenwood range  do you expect us to waste five minutes whenever we come this way  my time is valuable and if i let your trail stand it would cost me a good deal of extra labor i must have a straight unbroken run for my machines  so sooner than throw an implement out of gear while you cross the trail you take this course do you consider it neighborly  harding smiled he remembered that in manitoba any help the nearest farmer could supply had been willingly given at allenwood he had been left alone that did not trouble him but he thought of hester enduring many discomforts in her rude board shack while women surrounded by luxury lived so near  i cant see any reason why i should be neighborly he replied  mowbray glanced at him with a hint of embarrassment  have you any complaint against us  none said harding coolly i only mentioned the matter because you did so  he imagined that mowbray was surprised by his reserve  you may be able to understand the colonel said that its rash for an intruding stranger to set himself against local customs not to speak of the discourtesy of the thing when a new trail is made at allenwood every holder is glad to give all the land thats needed  land doesnt seem to be worth as much to you as it is to me judging from the way you work it every rod of mine must grow something i dont play at farming  mowbray grew red in the face but kept himself in hand  do you wish to criticize our methods he demanded  ive nothing to do with your methods its my business to farm this section as well as it can be done ive no wish to annoy your people but you do not use the trail for hauling on and i cant change my plans because they may interfere with your amusements  very well mowbray answered coldly there is nothing more to be said  he rode away and harding started his oxen it might have been more prudent to make a few concessions and conciliate the colonel but harding could not bring himself to do so it seemed a shabby course it was better that the allenwood settlers should know at the beginning how matters stood and of what type their new neighbor was  from all that harding had learned of colonel mowbray he felt that this stretch of grassland would not be turned into a glowing sea of wheat without more than one conflict between himself and the head of allenwood     chapter v  the spendthrift   kenwyne felt pleasantly languid as he lounged in a basketchair after his evening meal he had been backsetting land since daybreak holding the plow was an occupation almost unknown to the allenwood settlers who left all the rougher work to their hired men kenwyne however was of a practical turn of mind and having invested all his money in his farm he meant to get some return he occasionally enjoyed a run with the coyote hounds or a days shooting when the migrating geese and ducks rested among the sloos but for the most part he stuck steadily to his work and as he bought the latest implements he was considered richer than he really was though thirty he was unmarried an elderly scottish housekeeper looked after him  one of the obstacles to allenwoods progress was that the bachelors outnumbered the married men and the difficulty seemed insuperable the settlers belonged to an exclusive caste and few young englishwomen of education and refinement had shown themselves willing to face the hardships of the prairie life though these were softened at allenwood by many of the amenities of civilization moreover it was known to the rasher youths who occasionally felt tempted by the good looks of the daughters of the soil that colonel mowbray sternly discountenanced anything of the nature of a mésalliance and that the married women would deal even more strictly with the offenders broadwood for example had broken the settlements traditions and he and his canadian wife had suffered  while kenwyne was reading an old newspaper gerald mowbray sauntered in he had a careless genial manner that made him a favorite but there was a hint of weakness in his face and kenwyne had never trusted him it was known that he had been wild and extravagant but at allenwood that was not generally regarded as a grave drawback they were charitable there several of the younger men who now made good settlers had left england at their relatives urgent request after gaining undesirable notoriety  gerald selected a comfortable chair and passed his cigarcase to kenwyne  theyre good he said i had them sent from montreal  no thanks replied kenwyne ive given up such extravagances and stick to the labeled plug i dont want to be officious but it might be better if you did the same  gerald smiled  youre rather a sordid beggar ralph but as thats often a sign of prosperity it makes me hopeful i want you to lend me two hundred pounds  impossible said kenwyne firmly  one hundred and fifty then  equally out of the question all i have is sunk in stock and earmarked for next years operations kenwyne paused and considered he knew the chances were slight that the money would ever be returned yet he respected colonel mowbray and his loyalty extended to the family of the head of allenwood why do you want the money he asked  i suppose ill have to tell you it goes back to indiawhat you might call a debt of honor i borrowed the money in london to square it and thought when i came to canada id be too far away for the london fellow to put undue pressure on me oh i meant to pay sometime when i was ready but the fellow transferred the debt to a man at winnipeg who has sent me a curt demand with an extortionate bill of expenses now i have to pay  i suppose you have been round the settlement  yes but i havent collected much in fact im afraid ill have to pledge my farm  you cant do that our foundation covenant forbids a settler to alienate his land without the consent of a majority in the council subject to the presidents veto your father would certainly use his veto  very true gerald agreed however i dont propose to alienate my landonly to pawn it for a time  its against the spirit of the deed  ive nothing to do with its spirit the covenant should say what it means and it merely states that a settler shall not sell to any person whos not a member of the colony im not going to sell  youre going to do a dangerous thing kenwyne warned him  then the remedy is for you to let me have a thousand dollars gerald said quickly  it is impossible but i will try to raise five hundred i suppose the colonel does not know you have come to me  i rely upon your not letting him know gerald smiled in that ingratiating way that won him many friends im deeply grateful and youre a good sort ralph though in some ways you differ from the rest of us i dont know where you got your tradesmans spirit  it wont be so singular before long kenwyne answered with dry amusement even now broadwood and one or two others  broadwood doesnt count he married a girl of the soil  he loves her and she makes him a good wife  yes but it was a mistake you know our traditions  kenwyne laughed and nodded toward the open window through which they heard the sound of cheerful whistling approaching them along the trail  i suspect thats broadwood now he said  well i must be going i will call for the check tomorrow  gerald left as broadwood entered  i can guess what he wanted he was at my place broadwood said as he took the seat gerald had vacated  ah ill wager he didnt go away emptyhanded kenwyne smiled  perhaps im betraying a confidence in admitting it anyway i felt that one ought to help him for the familys sake lest he get into worse trouble and i could afford the loan since i married ive been making some money but i want to ask you about this harding what kind of fellow is he  i like what ive seen of him why  effie has been talking about his sister seemed to think it was unkind to leave the girl alonein want perhaps of odds and ends a woman could supply i think she has made up her mind to go see her  im not sure that would meet with general approval what did you say  i seldom give my opinion on these matters broadwood answered with a laugh on the whole i think effies right and i suspect that knowing the thing wont please the others gives it a charm after all she hasnt much reason for respecting their prejudices at first they nearly drove us out of allenwood  im glad you didnt go your wife is steadily gaining ground and the others will be glad to copy her after a while  thats my idea well have to work our land have you ever thought what the colonel could do with his big block if he had the capital  and the wish said kenwyne the obstacle is his point of view besides all of it isnt really his mrs mowbray beatrice and the boys have a share of course his taking the lots as one gives him a solid vote in the council and with the veto he has on certain points makes him an absolute ruler  so long as his family support him  can you imagine their doing the contrary  ive thought the colonels position was least secure from an attack within broadwood answered thoughtfully it doesnt follow that a mans family is bound to agree with him geralds a dark horse and one cant predict what hell do except that it will be what suits himself lance is young and headstrong and beatrice has a mind of her own but i really came to ask your opinion about this sketch of a new stable i must buy another team  they discussed the plan for the new building until it grew late and broadwood went home  the following day gerald mowbray left allenwood for winnipeg it was a dismal wet evening when he arrived and winnipeg was not an attractive city at that time there were a few fine stores and offices on main street portage avenue was laid out and handsome buildings were rising here and there but for the most part the frame houses had a dilapidated squalid look rows of pedlers shacks stretched back from the wooden station the streets were unpaved and the churnedup prairie soil lay in sticky clods upon the rude plank sidewalks dripping teams floundered heavily through the mire although the city was beginning to feel the stir of commercial activity the dark corners were devoted to questionable amusements  gerald had supper at his hotel and afterward found the time hang upon his hands the general lounge was badly lighted and its uncovered floor was smeared with gumbo mud from the boots of the wet men who slouched in to the bar the door kept swinging open letting in cold draughts and gerald could find nobody to talk to he had not enough money to pay off his debt but thought he had sufficient to enable him to make some compromise with his creditor and so had determined to see what could be done it was however impossible to spend the dismal evening at the hotel and he knew where excitement might be found at a moderate costthat is if one were cautious and lucky  going out he made his way toward a side street running down to the river and noticed the keen glance an armed northwest policeman gave him as he turned the corner gerald thought it a desirable spot to station the constable  a ramshackle frame house down the street was glaringly illuminated and gerald entering found a number of men and one or two women in two gaudily furnished rooms there was another room at the back where refreshments were dispensed without a license for the most part the men were young brownfaced fellows who had spent the summer on the lonely plains but a few had a hard and sinister look the girls were pretty and stylishly dressed but they had a predatory air  in one corner of the room an exciting poker game seemed to be in progress at the other end a roulette table was surrounded by a crowd of eager players gerald was fond of games of chance and he saw ahead of him a pleasant evening leaning against the bar he was merely an onlooker for a while the glare of light and the air of excitement the eager faces of the players and the click of the balls fascinated him  he had not been drinking heavily yet to his annoyance he felt a trifle unsteady when at last he strolled over to the roulette table his first mistake was to take a fivedollar bill from the wallet which contained the money to pay his debt more than one pair of greedy eyes saw the thick wad of paper currency and from that moment gerald was a marked man in the room                                       in the gray hour preceding daybreak when sick and dizzy gerald stumbled back to his hotel he found that he had only ten dollars remaining of the amount that had been entrusted to him to settle his debt ten dollars would not pay his hotel bill even  he woke about noon his head aching severely he could form no definite idea as to what was best to be done one thing however was certain no one at allenwood must know how he had spent the preceding evening his relatives had no reason for believing his conduct irreproachable but so long as he did not thrust his failings upon their notice they ignored them then the revelation of how he had lost the money given him would no doubt lead to his banishment from allenwood and except for a small allowance from his mothers english property he had no resources the survey he had been engaged upon was abandoned for a time and he could find no other employment he must hold on at allenwood trusting that something would turn up and augmenting his income by the small sums he might win from the younger men at cards first of all however he must call upon his creditor it was a disagreeable task but one that could not be shirked     chapter vi  the mortgage broker   davies sat at his desk sorting a bundle of papers his office a large room in a smart new building was elaborately furnished but the furnishings spelled expense rather than taste the walls were hung with maps of the canadian territories plans of new town sites and photographs of buildings davies was one of a class that was for a time to exercise a farreaching influence on the western prairie his business was to sell the new settlers landwhich was seldom paid for on the spot the agent being willing to take what he could get and leave the balance on mortgage he also lent money to farmers who had suffered from bad seasons or who rashly determined to extend their operations with borrowed capital  interest was then very high and the scratchfarming generally practised was not productive crops on the halfworked soil suffered from drought and blight and often ripened too late to escape the autumn frost yet in spite of these disadvantages the influx of new settlers forced up the price of land as a rule the unfortunate farmer soon became indebted to local storekeepers as well as to the man from whom he had bought his holding when he harvested a good crop he paid off some arrears of interest and perhaps kept a few dollars to go on with but he seldom got out of debt and so toiled on living with stern frugality while the moneylender pocketed his earnings shylock ran no risk since the security was good and he could sell up the defaulter for a time many of the small homesteaders struggled with dire poverty in spite of legislation intended to protect them and it was not until a succession of good harvests and the gradual development of the country enabled them to break the yoke of the usurer that a tide of prosperity flowed across the plains  davies was an unfavorable specimen of his class there were some land and mortgage agents who dealt fairly with their clients and even ran some risk in keeping them on their feet but davies was cunning grasping and pitiless  when gerald entered he gave him a curt nod snapped a rubber band around the papers placed them carefully in a pigeonhole in his desk and then turned to his caller  mr mowbray i expected to see you sooner guess you have come to settle your account  gerald found it hard to keep his temper he had an aristocratic contempt for all traders and had even in canada generally been treated with some deference  in the first place i dont see what you have to do with this debt he began i borrowed from parties in london and im responsible to them  heres my authority davies said handing him a letter whether the lender instructed me to collect the money for him or made other arrangements doesnt matter to you i can give you a receipt that will stand good as soon as you put up the money  unfortunately that is more than i can do  davies did not look surprised  whats your proposition he asked  ill think over yours gerald answered as coolly as he could  davies studied him for a moment or two geralds expression was supercilious but his face did not indicate much strength of character besides the only justification for arrogance that davies recognized was the possession of money  youre the son of colonel mowbray of allenwood arent you your people hold a good piece of land there  you seem to know all about me id better warn you however that you wont find my relatives willing to pay my debts  davies smiled  i could try them they might do something if i stated my claim  this was what gerald had feared and he could not hide his alarm  it will save you trouble if you realize that you wouldnt get a dollar he said hastily  davies was silent for a few moments as a matter of fact he was by no means anxious to be paid allenwood was isolated as yet and the land accordingly not worth much but the homesteads were unusually good and the advance of cultivation and settlement would largely increase their value davies wanted a hold on allenwood which might be turned to advantage later and he now saw an opportunity for getting it young mowbray obviously objected to having his friends learn how he was situated and this would make him easier to manage  well davies said you have some land there havent you whats the acreage township and range  gerald named them and davies made some calculations on a piece of paper before he looked up  if i find this all right in the land register ill cancel your london debt and take a mortgage on your holding he said handing gerald the paper he had been writing on heres an outline of the terms  the interests extortionate  if you think so go round the town and see if you can find anybody wholl be more liberal if not you can come back tomorrow and well fix up the deal  davies felt safe in making the suggestion he did not think gerald had much business ability and trusted to his reluctance to make his embarrassments known besides the mortgage brokers had their hands full and were not all so confident of the rapid advance of settlement as davies was indeed there were men who declared that the country was being opened up too rapidly and predicted a bad setback  gerald left davies office with a faint hope of being able to find a safer way out of the difficulty to give his land in pledge would be a violation of the covenant that bound the allenwood settlers it was an offense that his father and his neighbors could not forgive he shrank from the dangerous course but the day went by without his finding any escape and the next morning he called on davies and the mortgage was signed  while gerald was at winnipeg mrs broadwood startled the settlement at allenwood by calling on hardings sister the visit was prompted by sympathy for the lonely prairie girl but coupled with that mrs broadwood delighted in the feeling that all the allenwood women would disapprove of her course she was small and pretty with plenty of determination and an exuberant cheerfulness which contact with her husbands friends had somewhat toned down and there was about her an air of homely western frankness that was charming  when she reached hardings camp hester sat sewing in the sun the girl made a remarkably pretty picture she thought seated beside a pile of prairie hay with a few purple asters springing up at her feet and behind her a ragged pinetree drooping its branches to the ground and over all the gold of sunshine  you look like a priestess of the sun mrs broadwood greeted her laughing  hester smiled in response  im sitting outside because its rather damp and cold in the shack she said as you see our house isnt finished yet  she rose as she spoke and came forward and mrs broadwood looked at her admiringly hester was tall and naturally dignified and her characteristic expression was grave composure besides her visitor remarked the excellent taste and fit of her simple dress  im sure were going to be friends said mrs broadwood  i hope so hester answered simply  the visitor found a seat in the prairie hay and sinking down in the soft grass she breathed the smell of wild peppermint with delight she noticed the hearth of parallel logs with a big kerosene can used as a washing boiler hanging from a tripod at one end the camp oven the sawing frame and the scented cedar shingles strewn about beside the framework of the house all these things were familiar for she was one of the pioneers  my she exclaimed this is nice makes me feel homesick  it must be a change from allenwood hester answered with a smile  thats why i like it im quite happy there but this is the kind of place where i belong twice before i met my husband i helped make a new home on the plains and this spot reminds me of the last time we fixed camp by stony creek in early summer when the grass was green and all the flowers were out there were rows of the red prairie lilies i never saw so manyand i remember how the new birch leaves used to rustle in the bluff at night thinking of it somehow hurts me she laughed prettily im what tom calls a sentimentalist  so am i said hester so you neednt stop  well i remember everything about the night we put in our stakessally baking bannocks with the smoke going straight up the loaded wagons in a row the tired horses rolling in the grass and the chunk of the boys axes chopping in the bluff though wed been on the trail since sunup there was work for hours bread to bake and clothes to wash and when we went to sleep a horse got his foot in a line and brought the tent down on us it was all hard in those days a hustle from dawn to dark but now when things are different i sometimes want them back but i neednt tell youi guess you know  yes i know said hester perhaps its the work we were born for  she was silent for a few moments looking far out over the prairie then she asked abruptly  what are the allenwood people like  theyre much the same as you and i but they wear more frills and when you rub against those who use the most starch you find them prickly then theyve some quaint notions that walter raleigh or jacques cartier must have brought over but taking them all round theyre a straight clean crowd she looked intently at hester somehow you make me feel that you belong to them  hester smiled mrs broadwood was impulsive and perhaps not always discreet but hester thought her true  i dont understand that she replied though i think my mother was a woman of unusual character she came from the michigan bush my father was english but he had only a small farm and didnt bring us up differently from our neighbors still he had different ideas and bought a good many books craig and i read them all and he would talk to us about them  craigs your brother ive seen him once or twice tell me about him  hester nodded toward the trail that wormed its way across the prairie a girl was riding toward them  beatrice mowbray mrs broadwood said the best of them all at allenwood though sometimes shes not easy to get on with  when beatrice joined them mrs broadwood repeated her suggestion she was frankly curious and hester was not unwilling to talk about her brother indeed she made the story an interesting character sketch and beatrice listened quietly while she told how the lad was left with a patch of arid soil and his mother and sister to provide for hester related how he braved his neighbors disapproval of the innovations which they predicted would lead him to ruin and by tenacity and boldness turned threatened failure into brilliant success then losing herself in her theme she sketched the birth of greater ambitions and the mans realization of his powers beatrices eyes brightened with keen approval she admired strength and daring and hester had drawn a striking picture of her brother  when the visitors rose to go harding appeared he had come he explained for an oxchain clevis  i have another visit to make beatrice said when he had helped her to mount the shortest way is across the ravine and there used to be a trail unless you have plowed it up  no he laughed i mean to improve that one however as its not very good and theres an awkward place ill show you the way down  they left the camp together and harding was not pleased to notice no difference in the girls attitude to him he had not expected her to show embarrassment but he would not have minded a dignified aloofness it looked as if she had not thought it worth while to resent his boldness when they last met for all that it made his heart beat fast to be near her  beatrice glanced toward the darkbrown line of the fall plowing  do you know what our people are saying about you you havent shown much regard for your neighbors feelings  id try to respect their needs  well that is something still the trail was at least convenient and it had stood for a number of years  im afraid some more of the old landmarks will have to go these are changing times  and i suppose theres satisfaction in feeling that you are leading the way  i cant claim that harding answered with a smile as a matter of fact were following a plain trail the furtraders blazed it for us before the railroad came and i dare say your father had broken ground at allenwood when i was learning to harness a team  it doesnt seem to make you diffident now i agree with my friends that theres a good deal to admire in the old order  thats so all thats best in it will stay you cant destroy it in a way its a comforting thought because we cant stand still and progress means a fight  and yet some people believe in throwing away the weapons our fathers have used and proved  harding laughed  when theyre fine steel thats foolish but we might be allowed to rub off the rust and regrind them  beatrice liked his halfhumorous manner which she suspected covered a strong sincerity besides she had asked for his opinions he had not obtruded them she gave him a quick glance of scrutiny as he led her horse down the steep brushencumbered trail into the ravine and she admitted to herself that he improved on acquaintance one got used to his rough clothes and his line of thought which differed so widely from the views held at allenwood  yellow birch leaves shone about them the paletinted stems were streaked with silver by the sinking sun and the ravine was filled with heavy blue shadow there was something strangely exhilarating in the light glowing color and the sharp wind and beatrice felt her senses stirred then she noticed hardings set lips and the concentrated look in his eyes he seemed to be thinking earnestly and perhaps exercising some selfrestraint she suddenly recalled his presumption the last time they were together she had not carried out her plan of avoiding him but she thought it might be better to run no risk  i mustnt take you any farther she said the trail is good up the other side  all right he acquiesced turn out at the big poplar  he stood there in the sunset his rough felt hat in his hand the slanting rays playing through his fair hair watching her until she and her horse coalesced with the blue shadows of the hillside  it would not be easy to win her he knew first there was the life she had led in what a different environment from the rough pioneer one that he had known then there were the prejudices of her relatives to consider she must come to him happily without one regret  harding sighed but his jaws set determinedly he had been taught as a child that the sweetest apples hang on the highest branches they are not easy to reach but once secured they are worth the having     chapter vii  an accident   with the help of men from the railroad settlement harding finished his house and made it weatherproof before the frost struck deep into the soil plowing was now impossible but there was much to be done the inside of the dwelling had to be fitted up and logs were needed for the stables he must build in the spring trees large enough for the purpose were scarce and where coal is unobtainable cutting wood for fuel keeps the settler busy during the rigorous winter harding might have simplified his task by buying sawed lumber but the long railroad haulage made it expensive and he never shrank from labor which led to economy he was not a niggard but he had ambitions and he saw that his money must be made productive if those ambitions were to be gratified  he was coming home one evening with devine bringing a load of wood on his jumpersled it had been a bitter day and the cold got keener as a leaden haze crept up across the plain there was still a curious gray light and objects in the immediate foreground stood out with harsh distinctness the naked branches of the poplars on the edge of the ravine they skirted cut sharply against the sky and the trail which ran straight across the thin snow was marked by a streak of dingy blue the wind was fitful but when it gathered strength the men bent their heads and shivered in their old deerskin jackets  as the oxen plodded on devine looked round at the sled rather anxiously  hadnt you better throw some of these logs off craig he suggested its a heavy load and im afraid theres a blizzard working up we want to get home before it breaks  the oxen can haul them harding replied well get nothing done for the next few days and we have our hands plumb full this winter  i used to think i was a bit of a hustler devine said but you sure have me beat  if im not mistaken well get a lieoff tomorrow harding struck one of the oxen with his mittened hand pull out bright before you freeze  the big animals moved faster and the tired men plodded on silently there is no easy road to wealth on the wheatlands of the west indeed it is only by patient labor and stoic endurance that a competence can be attained devine and his comrade knew this by stern experience and half frozen as they were they braced themselves for the effort of reaching home they must adapt their pace to the oxens and it was not quick enough to keep them warm  as they approached a bluff harding looked up  somebody riding pretty fast he said  a beat of hoofs partly muffled by the snow came down the bitter wind and a few moments later a horseman appeared from behind the trees he was indistinct in the gathering gloom but seemed to be riding furiously and harding drew the oxen out of the trail  one of the allenwood boys young mowbray isnt it said devine  the next moment lance mowbray dashed past them scattering the snow the horse was going at a frantic gallop the riders fur coat had blown open his arms were tense and his hands clenched on the bridle his face was set and he gazed fixedly ahead as if he did not see the men and the sledge  its that wild brute of a range horse harding remarked nearly bucked the boy off the last time he passed my place something in the bluff must have scared him he has the bit in his teeth  looks like it devine agreed young mowbray can ride but im expecting trouble when he makes the timber  they turned and stopped to watch for the allenwood trail ran down the side of the ravine among the trees not far away horse and rider rapidly grew indistinct and vanished over the edge of the hollow then there was a dull thud and the beat of hoofs suddenly broke off the deep silence that followed was ominous  throw the load off and bring the oxen cried harding as he started to run along the trail  he was breathless when he reached the edge of the declivity but he saw nothing when he looked down a blurred network of trunks and branches rose from the shadowy depths with a pale glimmer of snow beneath that was all and there was no sound except the wail of the rising wind plunging straight down through the timber harding made for a bend of the trail where there was a precipitous bank and on reaching it he saw a big dark object lying in the snow some distance beneath him this was the horse its rider could not be far away when he scrambled down he found the boy lying limp and still his fur cap fallen off and his coat torn away from his body his face looked very white his eyes were closed and he did not answer when harding spoke kneeling down he saw that the lad was alive but unconscious nothing could be done until devine arrived  it was a relief when he heard the oxen stumbling through the brush presently devine came running up and after a glance at the boy turned and felt the horse  stone dead whats the matter with mowbray  some ribs broken i suspect said harding bring the sled close up weve got to take him home  they laid lance on the jumper and harding stripped off his own skin coat and wrapped it round the boy  the shocks perhaps the worst thing and he feels cold  both had had some experience of accidents in a country where surgical assistance could seldom be obtained and devine nodded agreement  guess well have trouble in hauling up the grade and getting to allenwood before the blizzard but weve got to make it  the opposite slope was rough and steep and the jumper too wide to pass easily between the trees they had to lift it and help the oxen here and there but they struggled up and then found that their difficulties were not over when they reached the open plain the wind had risen while they were in the hollow and was now blowing the dry snow about it had grown dark and the trail was faint  might be wiser to take him to your homestead devine suggested but theyll be able to look after him better at the grange get a move on the beasts craig weve no time to lose  harding urged the oxen which stepped out briskly with their lighter load but he had some difficulty in guiding them though devine went ahead to keep the trail it was impossible to see any distance and there was no landmark on the bare white level the savage wind buffeted their smarting faces and filled their eyes with snow the cold struck through hardings unprotected body like a knife but he went on stubbornly keeping his eyes on devines halfdistinguishable figure he was sorry for the unconscious youngster but he did not glance at him this was a time when pity was best expressed in action  they had gone about two miles when the blizzard broke upon them in a blinding cloud of snow and the cold suddenly increased though he wore a thick jacket harding felt as if his flesh had changed to ice his hands were numb and his feet seemed dead he knew the risk he ran of being crippled by frostbite but to take his coat back might cost lance his life  they had been struggling forward for a long time when devine stopped and came back  weve been off the trail for the last ten minutes he said guess its got snowed up  it was a bald statement of an alarming situation their only guide had failed them and unless they could soon find shelter all must perish it might perhaps be possible to keep moving for another hour or two and then they would sink down exhausted to freeze yet having faced similar perils and escaped they were not utterly dismayed  the long rise cant be very far off harding said hopefully if we could make it theres a little coulée running down the other side then we ought to see the grange lights when we strike the lake  his voice was scarcely audible through the roar of the icy gale but devine caught a word or two and understood  then he shouted back you want to keep the wind on your left cheek  it was the only guide to the direction of the blast for the snow whirled about them every way at once and sight was useless amid the blinding haze feeling however to some extent remained and although their faces were freezing into dangerous insensibility so long as they kept their course one side was still a little more painful than the other they struggled on urging the jaded oxen and dragging them by their heads where the drifts were deep the snow seemed to thicken as they went they could not see each other a yard or two apart and the power that kept them on their feet was dying out of them both had been working hard since sunrise and weary flesh and blood cannot long endure a furious wind when the thermometer falls to forty or fifty below nothing broke the surface of the plain except the blowing waves of snow that swirled across their course and beat into their faces it seemed impossible that they could keep on hope had almost left them when devine suddenly called out  its surely rising ground  harding imagined by the oxens slower pace and his own labored breathing that his comrade was right but the rise was gradual and extensive they might wander across it without coming near the lake but they could take no precautions and much must be left to chance  get on he said curtly  by the force of the wind which presently met them he thought they had reached the summit somewhere near them a watercourse started and ran down to the lake but the men could not tell which way to turn although they knew that the decision would be momentous one way led to shelter the other to death in the snowy wilds  left and down harding cried at a venture  they trudged on devine a few paces in front picking out the trail and harding urging forward the snowblinded oxen they had not gone more than a few yards when devine suddenly disappeared there was a rush of loosened snow apparently falling into a hollow and then his voice rose hoarse but exultant  weve struck the coulée  he scrambled out and it was comparatively easy to follow the ravine downhill and soon after they left it the surface grew unusually level and no tufts of withered grass broke the snow  looks like the lake said devine well be safe once we hit the other side  harding was nearly frozen and he began to despair of ever reaching the grange but he roused himself from the lethargy into which he was sinking when a faint yellow glimmer shone through the swirling snow it grew brighter more lights appeared and they toiled up to the front of a building with some trouble devine found the door and knocked  it was opened in a few moments by gerald mowbray who stood looking out in surprise  devine briefly explained  if its likely to scare his mother get her out of the way he added we have to bring him in at once send somebody for the oxen and show us where to go  wait a moment and ill meet you said gerald hastening into the house  when he disappeared devine turned to harding  get hold you dont want to shake him but the coats will keep him pretty safe  with some trouble they carried him in passed through a vestibule and came with shuffling steps into a large hall it was well lighted and so warm that harding felt limp and dizzy from the sudden change of temperature his skin burned the blood rushed to his head and he stopped for fear he should drop his burden gerald it seemed had not had time to warn the people in the hall and beatrice rose with a startled cry one or two women sat with white faces as if stupefied by alarm and two or three men got up hurriedly harding indistinctly recognized colonel mowbray among them  be quick get hold of him he called to the nearest  he was replaced by two willing helpers and half dazed and not knowing what to do he slackly followed the others up the middle of the floor all who were not needed stood watching them for they made a striking group as they moved slowly forward carrying what seemed to be a shapeless bundle of snowy furs devine was white from head to foot a bulky figure in his shaggy coat and cap though the bent forms of the other men partly concealed him harding came alone walking unsteadily with the snow falling off him in glistening powder his face haggard and his frostsplit lips covered with congealed blood  as the little group passed on following gerald harding suddenly reeled and clutching at the back of a chair fell into it with a crash after that he was not sure of anything until some one brought him a glass of wine and soon afterward devine came back with gerald  my mother begs you will excuse her but shell thank you before you go he said the colonel hopes to see you shortly but hes busy with lance and were fortunate in having a man who should have been a doctor now if youll come with me ill give you a change of clothes your oxen are in the stable  we cant stay remonstrated harding  its impossible for you to go home  thats true said devine touching hardings arm better get up craig before the snow melts on you  gerald gave them clothes and then saying that he was needed left them alone after they had changed devine found his way to the stable to see if the oxen were any the worse and harding went back to the hall a group of men and women were talking in low voices but no one spoke to him and he sat down in a corner feeling awkward and uncomfortable in his borrowed garments evidently the mowbrays had been entertaining some of their neighbors who to judge by scraps of conversation he overheard thought they would better take their leave but doubted if they could reach home harding knew that he could not do so but he felt averse to accepting mowbrays hospitality and he feared that hester would be anxious about his safety  he was still sitting in the corner when beatrice came up to him  im afraid you have been neglected but you can understand that we are rather upset she said  how is your brother harding asked  better than we thought at first one of our friends has bandaged him there are two ribs broken but he declares he now feels fairly comfortable  im afraid hes exaggerating but its a good sign anyway im glad to hear hes conscious  he was conscious before you brought him home he says he tried to speak to you but you didnt hear him  thats possible harding replied the trail wasnt very goodand we were busy  beatrice gave him a strange look  so one would imagine there was probably no trail at all two of our friends who live half a mile off dont think they can get back its fortunate for us that you and your partner had the strength and courage  what could we do harding asked you wouldnt have expected us to leave him in the bluff  beatrices eyes sparkled and a flush of color crept into her face harding thought she was wonderfully beautiful and feared it was unwise to look at her lest he should make a fool of himself  i cant say that i wouldnt have expected you to give him your coat but that was very fine of you she said you must have known the risk you took when you came in you looked worse than he did  it struck harding as significant that she should have noticed his appearance in the midst of her alarm but it might not mean much after all women were often more observant than men  then i ought to have been ashamed it was the shock we were afraid of you see after a bad accident theres often a collapse and when ones in that state even moderate cold is dangerous  how do you know these things beatrice asked  when you live as we do you learn something about accidents he answered  beatrice gave him a look that thrilled him  i promised lance that i would not stay but a minute she said but i will send mr kenwyne to look after you she added in a lower voice i have not attempted to thank you but you must believe that were very very grateful  hardings eyes followed her across the room and lingered on her when she stopped a moment to speak with one of the neighbors kenwynes voice at his elbow roused him  colonel mowbray expects you to remain here but on the whole i think youd better come with me kenwyne was saying theyre naturally in some confusion and my farm isnt very far i think my team can make it  harding was glad to get away quietly but he left a message that he hoped to call in the morning for his oxen and for news of lance     chapter viii  an unexpected escape   on the morning after the accident colonel mowbray sat at breakfast with his wife and daughter the gale had fallen in the night and although the snow lay deep about the house gerald had already gone out with a hired man to see how the range horses which were left loose in the winter had fared during the storm lance was feverish but there was nothing in his condition to cause anxiety and he was in charge of a man whom some youthful escapade had prevented from obtaining a medical diploma there were one or two others of his kind at allenwood whose careers had been blighted by boyish folly breakfast had been well served for everything went smoothly at the grange in spite of the low temperature outside the room was comfortably warm and the china and the table appointments showed artistic taste  colonel mowbray looked thoughtfully stern  perhaps it was as well kenwyne took the americans home last night he remarked  you asked them to stay beatrice said with more indignation than she cared to show and after what they did  mowbray cut her short  i cannot deny that we are heavily in their debt and i shall take the first opportunity for thanking them in fact if i can make any return in the shape of practical help i shall be glad all the same to have had them here would have meant our putting them on a more intimate footing than might be wise  beatrice smiled but said nothing she respected her father but the thought of his helping such a man as harding was amusing  from what ive heard about mr harding i dont think he would have presumed upon it mrs mowbray replied besides it looks as if we owed lances life to him and his companion and i really dont see why you object to the man of course it was tactless of him to plow up our trail but he was within his rights  mowbray looked at her sharply his wife was generally docile and seldom questioned his decisions but she now and then showed an unexpected firmness  i dont object to him personally for that matter i know very little about him good or bad he said and his tone implied that he was not anxious to learn anything more it is rather what he stands for that i disapprove of  what does he stand for  what foolish people sometimes call progressthe taint of commercialism purely utilitarian ideas in short all ive tried to keep allenwood free from look at england you know how the old friendly relations between landlord and tenant have been overthrown  i wonder whether they were always friendly beatrice interposed  they ought to have been friendly and in most of the instances i can think of they were but what can one expect when a rich tradesman buys up a fine estate and manages it on what he calls business lines this must mean putting the screw of a merciless competition upon the farmer on the other hand you see men with honored names living in extravagant luxury without a thought of their duty to their land gambling on the stock exchangeeven singing in music halls the countrys in a bad way when you read of its old aristocracy opening hat shops  but what are the poor people to do if they have no money beatrice asked  the point is that theyre being ruined by their own folly and the chaotic way things have been allowed to drift but the other side of the pictures worse when one thinks of wealth and poverty jostling each other in the towns oppressive avarice and sullen discontent instead of helpful cooperation the community plundered by trusts industries wrecked by strikes this is what comes of free competition and contempt for authority and the false principle that a man must turn all his talents to the making of money is at the root of it all  it was a favorite hobby of the colonels and mrs mowbray made no remark but beatrice was pleased to see that he had forgotten harding  you would have made a good feudal baron she said with a smile your retainers wouldnt have had many real grievances but you would always have been on the kings side  the first principle of all firm and successful government is that the king can do no wrong  we dont challenge it at allenwood and it really seems to work well beatrice answered lightly and then because mowbray insisted on formal manners she turned to her mother and now with your permission i had better go to lance  when she left them mowbray frowned  theres another matter i want to talk about he said im inclined to think well have to do away with the card tables when the younger people spend the evening with us  but youre fond of a game  yes ill confess that a close game of whist is one of my keenest pleasures and if i finish two or three dollars to the good it adds to the zest for all that one must be consistent and ive grounds for believing there has been too much high play of late the offenders will have to be dealt with if i can find them out  mrs mowbray knew that her husbands first object was the good of the settlement and that he would make any personal sacrifice to secure it  we can have music or get up a dance instead she suggested and added anxiously you dont think that gerald  id have grave suspicions only that he knows what to expect mowbray answered grimly something might be learned from lance but it would not be fair to ask  he wouldnt tell mrs mowbray said stoutly knowing her husbands sense of honor do you think its serious enough to be disturbed about  im afraid so although at the moment i can hardly judge a game of cards in public for strictly moderate points or a small wager on a race can do the boys no harm but as soon as the stake gets large enough to be worth winning for itself it leads to trouble and systematic secret gambling is a dangerous thing as a matter of fact i wont have it at allenwood at present i can do nothing but keep a careful watch  an hour later mrs mowbray was sitting with lance when word was brought her that harding had called  let him come up here if only for a minute lance begged  well but it must not be longer his mother consented  harding bowed to her respectfully when he entered the room then he turned to lance with a smile  glad to see you looking much better than i expected  lance gave him his hand though he winced as he held it out and his mother noticed hardings quick movement to save him a painful effort there was a gentleness that pleased her in the prairie mans face  i dont want to embarrass you but youll understand how i feel about what you did for me said lance i wont forget it  pshaw returned harding we all get into scrapes i wouldnt be here now if other people hadnt dragged me clear of a mowerknife and once out of the way of a locomotive when my team balked in the middle of the track  i dont suppose any of the fellows gave you his clothes with the thermometer at minus forty but i wont say any more on that point was my horse killed  on the spot  lance looked troubled  well it was my own fault he said slowly i was trying a new headstall and i wasnt very careful in linking up the bit  he began to talk about the latest types of harness and listened with obvious interest to hardings views on the subject but after a while his voice grew feeble and his mother interrupted  youll come back and see me when im better wont you he asked eagerly  harding made a vague sign of assent and left the room with mrs mowbray when they reached the hall she stopped him  you did us a great service last nighti can find no adequate way of expressing my gratitude she said  harding saw that she had not spoken out of mere conventional politeness  i think you make too much of it certainly it was fortunate we happened to come along the rest followed but i can understand how you feeli had a good mother  she was pleased by his reply and she had watched him closely while he talked to lance the man was modest and yet quietly sure of himself he had shown no awkwardness and his rather formal deference to herself was flattering she somehow felt that he would not have offered it solely on account of her station  im glad to see your son looking pretty bright harding went on  you roused him he was very listless and heavy until you came  im afraid i talked too much its a way i sometimes have harding smiled then he looked at her directly he asked me to come back  mrs mowbray knew he was shrewd enough to take a hint and that she could without discourtesy prevent his coming still she did not wish to do so she had heard her husbands views to which she generally deferred but she liked harding and he had saved her sons life moreover she had a suspicion that his influence would be good for the boy  i hope you will come whenever it pleases you she said with quiet sincerity  it will please me very much ill make use of the privilege as long as he finds that i amuse him  harding went home with a feeling of halfexultant satisfaction lance for whom he had a rather curious liking had been unmistakably glad to see him and what was more important mrs mowbray was now his friend for all that he knew that tact was needed the colonel while no doubt grateful did not approve of him and he must carefully avoid doing anything that might imply a readiness to take advantage of the slight favor he had been granted harding was not an adventurer and the situation was galling to his pride but he was shrewd and was willing to make some sacrifice if it gave him an opportunity for seeing beatrice  when harding returned a week later he met the girl for a few moments and had to be content with this lance brightened up noticeably when he talked to him and as he was leaving pressed him to come again but the unqualified doctor whom he met in the hall did not seem satisfied with the patients progress  harding waited for a while before he went back he found mrs mowbray alone on his arrival and thought she looked anxious when he asked how lance was getting on  he doesnt seem to improve as quickly as he ought and mr carsons puzzled she said he tells me the injury is not serious enough to account for my boys low condition but he keeps restless and feverish and doesnt sleep then after a moment she added confidentially one could imagine that he has something on his mind  have you any suspicion what it is  no she hesitated that is nothing definite and as he has given me no hint its possible that im mistaken in thinking that he is disturbed but you may go in you seem to cheer him  harding pondered this he had been used to people who expressed their thoughts with frank directness but he saw that mrs mowbray was of a different stamp she was most fastidious yet she had taken him into her confidence as far as her reserve permitted after all there were things which a boy would confess to a man outside his family sooner than to his mother  well he said as meaningly as he thought advisable ill do what i can  on entering the sick room he thought her anxiety was justified lance did not look well although he smiled at his visitor  im glad you came he said its a change to see somebody fresh the boys mean well but they worry me  youd get tired of me if i came oftener harding answered with a laugh  they talked for a few minutes about a sheep dog that had been given to lance and then during a slight pause the boy closed his eyes with a sigh harding looked at him keenly  im told youre not sleeping well he said and you dont look as fit as you ought i guess lying on your back gets monotonous  yes lance answered listlessly then im worried about losing my horse  one feels that kind of thing of course but it wasnt an animal id get attached to hard in the mouth i guess a bad buckjumper and a wicked eye on the whole youre better off without him  perhaps youre right and i meant to sell him id had offers and the warrior blood brings a long price  ah that means you wanted the money  lance was silent for a few moments and then he answered half resentfully  i did  it was obvious to harding that delicacy was required here mrs mowbray was right in her suspicions but if he made a mistake lance would take alarm harding feared however that tact was not much in his line  i am an outsider here he said with blunt directness but perhaps thats a reason why you can talk to me candidly its sometimes embarrassing to tell ones intimate friends about ones troubles why did you want the money  lance flushed and hesitated but he gathered confidence from hardings grave expression  to tell the truth id got myself into an awkward mess  one does now and then ive been fixed that way myself perhaps i can help  no you cant lance said firmly all the same its a relief to take somebody into my confidence well i owed a good deal of money id been playing cards  do you pay debts of that kind at once  of course its a matter of principle though the boys wouldnt have pressed me  id have let them wait said harding but i dont play cards i suppose you borrowed the money from somebody else and he wants it back now the proper person for you to go to is your father  lance colored and hesitated again  i cant he blurted out with evident effort its not because im afraid hed certainly be furiousim not thinking of that theres a reason why it would hit him particularly hard besides you know were far from rich  having learned something about gerald mowbray harding understood the lads reticence indeed he respected his loyalty to his brother  very well if youll tell me what you owe and where you got the money i may suggest something  he had expected lance to refuse but worn by pain and anxious as he was the boy was willing to seize upon any hope of escape he explained his affairs very fully and harding made a note of the amount and of a name that was not unfamiliar to him  when lance finished his story and dropped back among his pillows with a flushed face there was a short silence in the room  harding was not as a rule rashly generous but he liked the boy and lance was beatrices brotherthat in itself was a strong claim on him then mrs mowbray had been gracious to him though he was a stranger and in a sense an intruder she had taken him into her confidence and he felt a deep respect for her there was in his mind however no thought of profiting by the situation indeed he was frankly reluctant to part with money which could be better employed than in paying gambling debts  so you went to davies of winnipega mortgage broker he remarked who told you about him these fellows dont lend to people they know nothing about  a man introduced me lance said awkwardly and harding again suspected gerald  when you signed his note for the sum you wanted how much did you really get  lance smiled ruefully as he told him  you seem to know their tricks he added  some of them harding replied dryly now if youll give me your word that you wont stake a dollar on a horse or card again ill take up this debt but i dont want your promise unless you mean to keep it  lances eyes were eager though his face was red  ive had my lesson it was the first time id really played high and i was a bit excited the room was hot and full of smoke and theyd brought in a good deal of whisky then he pulled himself up but i cant let you do this and i dont see  why im willing to help harding finished for him well ones motives arent always very plain even to oneself stillyou can take it that ive a pretty strong grievance against all mortgage brokers theyve ruined one or two friends of mine and theyre going to make trouble in this country ill give you a few instances  he meant to frighten the lad but there was no need to overstate the truth and his face grew stern as he related how struggling farmers had been squeezed dry and broken in spirit and fortune by the moneylenders remorseless grasp lance was duly impressed and realized how narrow an escape he had had  are you willing to leave the thing entirely to me harding concluded you must understand that youre only changing your creditor  i can trust you lance said with feeling i cant tell you what a relief it is to get out of that fellows hands but i ought to warn you that hes tricky you may have some trouble  harding laughed as he stood up  oh i can deal with him now you go to sleep and dont worry any more  after he left lance lay for a while thinking over the conversation he was puzzled to know what had prompted harding to come to his rescue the allenwood settlers had certainly been none too friendly to the prairie man who was considered an outsider because he believed in work and in progress lance thought that there was no selfish motive in hardings offer what then  he suddenly shook off the thoughts and reaching out to a table by his bedside rang a small handbell there beatrice answered it  i want something to eat he said petulantly not slops this time im tired of them  his sister looked at him in surprise  why you wouldnt touch your lunch  all the more reason i should want something now you ought to be glad im getting better  beatrice laughed  its a very sudden improvement she said mr harding must be a magician what has he done to you  harding knows a lot lance answered somewhat awkwardly then added impulsively in fact i think hes a remarkably fine fellow all round  beatrice opened her eyes wide such an opinion from the son of colonel mowbray was pure heresy but she made no comment she kissed lance lightly on the forehead and tripped off downstairs to order some food for him  somehow she was inclined to agree with her brother in his opinion of the prairie man     chapter ix  a man of affairs   the warmth of the big stove which glowed a dull red in places had melted holes in the frost that obscured the double windows of davies office but icy draughts flowed round the room and the temperature of the passage outside was down to zero from where the stovepipe pierced the wall drops of a black distillate trickled down and the office was filled with the smell of tar and hot iron rents gaped in the pine paneling and the door had shrunk to a remarkably easy fit the building was new pretentious and supposed to be centrally heated but winnipeg was then passing through the transition stage which occurs in the history of most western towns emerging from rude disorder with bold but badly guided striving toward beauty and symmetry civic ambition was poorly seconded by builders skill and the plans of aspiring architects were crudely materialized  from where davies sat he could look into the snowy street the view was far from pleasing the blackened wreck of a burntout store confronted the office block and behind it straggled a row of squalid shacks farther on rose a wall of concrete with rusty iron framing sticking out of it and a mound of cut stone and sawed lumber left as it lay when the frost stopped work encroached upon the plank sidewalk davies however was not engrossed in the view though he had lent money upon some adjacent building lots a survey map of the allenwood district lay on his table and he alternately studied it and gazed out of the window with a thoughtful air  the allenwood soil was good consisting as it did for the most part of stiff black gumbo it was well watered and fairly well wooded and it occupied the center of a fertile belt its position had other natural advantages and the configuration of the country made it probable that with the first railroad extension a line would run past the settlement to the american frontier davies had reason to believe that his view was shared by farseeing railroad directors but whether the line were run or not the allenwood farms would rise in value davies wanted a hold on the settlement and he had to some extent succeeded in getting it he held a mortgage on gerald mowbrays homestead it seemed possible to get the younger brother into his power and he was negotiating with another embarrassed settler on the other hand money was tight just then and davies schemes were hampered by a lack of capital he had written to lance mowbray pressing for some interest that was overdue and when the lad begged for time had curtly summoned him to winnipeg now he was expecting him for the eastbound train had arrived  he heard steps in the passage and looked up with some surprise as two men entered his office their bronzed faces and their cheap skin coats suggested that they worked upon the land but there was something in the expression and bearing of the taller man that contradicted this davies was a judge of character and he read that something as a sense of power  goodmorning gentlemen he said with a suave smile i dont believe i have an appointment with you but im always open for business  my name is harding said the taller man and this is my partner mr devine you were expecting lance mowbray of allenwood ive come instead  davies would have preferred dealing with young mowbray himself this substitute made him feel somewhat uneasy after careful inquiries into mowbrays affairs davies did not expect to get the overdue interest what he wanted was to renew the loan at a higher rate as the price of waiting  harding got down to business at once  mowbray owes you some interest ive come to pay it  davies eyes narrowed  rather a long and expensive journey if that was all that brought you he said with a sneer a check would have done  you seemed to think an interview needful and i dont propose to bear the cost harding answered quietly anyway now that im here ill pay up the principal if we can come to terms  there are no terms to be arranged ill settle the account on receipt of the sum mowbray borrowed and the interest  ill give you what he got said harding coolly  davies pondered a moment the offer had been a shock to him for it suggested that mowbray had found a way of escape that meant that his hold on allenwood would be weakened harding looked shrewd and businesslike there was little possibility of hoodwinking such a man  do you expect me to abandon my rights he asked  im here to look after mowbrays you charged him what you call expenses which you didnt incur guess youll have to prove them if you take the case to court  one has to make inquiries about the security when lending money  as a matter of fact you knew the security was bad mowbray told you that his land was held in trust until he was twentyone what you traded on was his fear of the deal coming to his peoples knowledge i guess his brother gave you all the information you required  davies start indicated that the shot made at a venture had reached its mark he grew angry but he quickly saw that this was no time to lose his temper  its a pretty cool proposition you make he said  its fair and i dont press you to agree stick to your full claim if you like and youll get your interest on what you actually lent but on nothing more until payment of the principal is due then well give you all the trouble we can but your hold on the boy is gone now that you know the moneys ready  davies was forced to recognize that his debtor had escaped him and as it happened he was pressed for money  well he conceded its a small matter after all ill give you a receipt if youll put down the amount  id rather my bank paid this it keeps a record then i want mowbrays note as well as the receipt  harding handed him a check and davies looked at it in surprise  you have made another deduction  certainly you demanded an interview and ive knocked off my fare to winnipeg now wheres the note  davies produced it and then looked at him with an ironical grin  its all straight and i hope youre satisfied a farmer arent you may i suggest that you have mistaken your profession  harding laughed goodnaturedly as he pocketed the papers  i dont know my belief is that a farmer doesnt lose anything by studying business methods  when they reached the street harding turned to devine  ive learned something i wanted to know he said that fellow has a mortgage on gerald mowbrays land hes playing a deep game  i dont see what hes getting after  allenwood its worth plotting for  i guess hed find the colonel a pretty big obstacle anyway its not our business  no harding replied with a thoughtful air as far as i can see at present its not my business now well look up the steamplow man  they found the implement dealer disengaged and spent the afternoon in his store before harding who insisted upon several variations in the standard design finally ordered a steam gangplow the agent was struck by the aptness of many of hardings suggestions about improvements and he invited the men to his hotel for the evening when they parted he frankly admitted that he had picked up some useful hints he also surmised that harding had learned all that was worth knowing about new machines  the two men left winnipeg the next day and devine went to report to hester while harding stopped at the grange to see lance  the boy greeted him eagerly and his eyes glistened with relief when harding handed him the papers  ill square it off every dollar as soon as i can he said in fact i feel so much about it that i cant express myselfif youd been in my place you would understand i see he didnt claim all my note called for how did you beat him down  i knew the man i had to deal with harding smiled what you have to do is to keep clear of debt in future  ive given you my word but i cant get out of debt to you lance looked at him with frank admiration you beat the fellow at his own game he exclaimed  harding held out his hand  i must go now he said i promised to meet kenwyne and broadwood well settle how youre to pay me the next time i come  mrs mowbray was waiting for him in the hall below  i want to thank you she said to him i dont know what you have done to my boy but he is so very much better  harding met the gaze she quietly fixed on him he saw that she knew there was some secret between him and her son but had confidence enough to ask no questions  for one thing he answered lightly ive given him some good advice which i think hell act on  he seems to have a respect for your judgmentand i feel hes not mistaken  thats very kind said harding i hope i shall be able to keep your good opinion though you may find it shaken by and by  mrs mowbray looked at him keenly and then laid her hand gently on his arm  you have helped my boy to get better and whatever may happen that goes a long way she said  when harding left her he felt that in mrs mowbray he would have a staunch ally in his fight for beatrice  he returned to the grange one afternoon about a week later and found beatrice alone lance after his long confinement had gone for his first drive and his mother had accompanied him to see that he kept the robes properly wrapped about him the colonel and gerald were at a neighbors  beatrice gave him her hand cordially  i am glad of this opportunity for seeing you alone because theres something i want to ask of you she said  i shall do anything i can to please you  its really something i want you not to do  ah harding smiled thats often harder  they had entered a room which beatrice and her mother used it was not large and it was scantily furnished but most of the articles it contained though worn and battered were good curtains rugs and chairs were of artistic design and their faded coloring was harmonious by contrast with the rude prairie homesteads he had lived in all that harding saw struck a note of luxurious refinement what was more the room seemed somehow stamped with its occupants character colonel mowbray he knew seldom entered it it was the retreat of the two delicate highbred women he admired he felt it was a privilege to be there the unusual surroundings reacted upon him and emphasized in a curious way his companions grace and charm  for a few moments after they were seated beatrice was silent gazing thoughtfully before her her hair shone where the light touched it and reminded harding of the glitter of a prairie lake on a breezy sunny day her face was in profile its fine chiseling forced up by a faded purple curtain behind her which harmonized agreeably with the strawcolored dress that fell about her figure in graceful lines as it happened beatrice was feeling somewhat embarrassed she had a favor to ask and she shrank with unusual timidity from placing herself in the mans debt she believed that he had saved her brothers life and afterward rendered him some valuable service but he had done this of his own accord and it would be different were he to comply with her request  you have been urging some plans on kenwyne and broadwood she began  you have heard about that however they didnt need urging they agreed with me about the necessity for the thing  its possible there was a touch of haughtiness in beatrices tone ralph kenwyne has always been something of a revolutionary and we know where broadwood gets his ideas  from his wife you cant expect me to condemn them she was brought up as i was and thinks as i do  beatrice saw she was not beginning well and changed her ground  after all thats not an important point i suppose you know my father is bitterly opposed to your plans  i was afraid so its unfortunate  then cant you see that it would be better to give them up  harding felt disturbed but determined he was keenly anxious to please the girl but to yield in this matter would be to act against his principles she did not know what she was asking  no he said i cant see that  do you consider it good taste to encourage our friends to thwart their acknowledged leader  it looks bad as you put it harding replied for all that a leaders business is to lead he cant keep his followers standing still when they want to move on their wishes must be respected despotic authoritys out of date  what is the use of choosing a ruler if he isnt to be obeyed she said haughtily  it sounds logical harding replied but it doesnt always work  beatrice was struggling hard with her wounded pride although on the whole broadminded she had inherited some of the convictions of her caste and being the only daughter of the head of the settlement she had been treated with more deference by the men at allenwood than was perhaps good for her it had cost her an effort to ask a favor from harding but she had not doubted the result and his refusal was a shock that the man who now proved obdurate had boldly shown his admiration for her made it worse yet because she believed her cause was good she determined to disregard her injured feelings  if you persist in your plans it will hurt colonel mowbray and lead to dissention here she argued why must you try to bring in these changes we have done very well as we are  he rose and stood with his hand on a chairback looking steadily at her and she noticed with halfgrudging approval the strength of his figure and the resolution in his quiet brown face  the trouble is that you cant continue as you are allenwoods threatened from outside and im not sure its safe within  is that your business  the cold pride in her tone hurt for it implied that she regarded him as an intruding stranger  in a way yes but well let that drop if i could have pleased you by giving up a personal advantage id have gladly done so but this is a bigger thing it isnt a matter of being content with a smaller crop its letting land that was meant to be worked lie idle wasting useful effort and trying to hold up a state of things that cant last if i give way ill be going back on all i believe in and betraying a trust  beatrice laughed scornfully and saw him wince  i want you to understand whats behind this movement he continued gravely your people cant keep allenwood for a place of amusement much longer and some of those who see this have asked my help ive promised and i cant draw back besides to break new soil and raise good wheat where only the wild grasses grow is the work i was meant for the one thing worth while im able to do id feel mean and ashamed if i held off and let the waste go on  of course it would be too great a sacrifice to make for a prejudiced old man who has nevertheless always placed the good of allenwood first and an inexperienced sentimental girl  harding flushed at the taunt it was very hard to displease her but he would not be justified in giving way and he thought that later when she understood better she would not blame him for being firm moreover his temper was getting short  thats neither kind nor fair he said separate or together your people and i must move on we cant stand still blocking the way and defying nature and the ordered procession of things this land was made for the use of man and he must pay with hard work for all it gives him  i am sorry you take that view but there seems nothing further to be said she rose as she spoke im afraid its impossible that we should agree  he left at once and drove home in a downcast mood no doubt he had disappointed her badly he had not even had the tact to make his refusal graceful she must think him an iconoclastic boor driven by a rude hatred of all that she respected still he had tried to be honest he could not shirk the task he was clearly meant to do the struggle however had tried him hard and he drove with set lips and knitted brows across the great white waste oblivious of the biting cold     chapter x  the casting vote   it was a bitter evening the snow on the crests of the rises glittered like steel the hollows were sharply picked out in blue the frost was pitiless and a strong breeze whipped up clouds of dry snow and drove them in swirls across the plain a half moon harshly bright hung low above the western horizon and the vast stretch of sky that domed in the prairie was sprinkled with stars  harding and devine were on their way to attend a council meeting at the grange wrapped as they were in the thick drivingrobe with their fur caps pulled well down they could not keep warm the cold of the icy haze seemed to sear the skin hardings woolenmittened hand was numbed on the reins and he feared that it was getting frostbitten  its fierce tonight devine remarked do you think therell be a good turnout of the allenwood boys  the cold wont stop them i expect the colonel has sent round to whip them up  i guess youre right do you know now that ive met one or two of them i see something in you and hester thats in them cant tell you what it is but its there and it was plainer in your father what are they like when you get to know them  much the same as the rest of us  the rest of us then you dont claim to be different from the general prairie crowd  harding frowned  i suppose i wouldnt mind being thought the best farmer in the district he said but thats all the distinction i care about  youll get that easy enough youve gone ahead fast craig and youre going farther but you may have some trouble on the way when a man breaks a new trail for himself and leaves other men behind it doesnt make them fond of him  oh i have no delusions on that point to attain success one cannot hope to travel a balmy road  why do you want to rope in the allenwood boys devine asked curiously  the reasons plain you and i might make the steamplow pay but the price is high and we cant do much more alone if you want the best economy in farming you must have cooperation its easier to buy expensive tools if you divide the cost  i see that but have you no other reason you dont feel that youd like to make friends with these people and so to speak have them acknowledge you  no said harding firmly since his talk with beatrice he had felt a curious antagonism to the whole allenwood settlement  it was too cold to talk much and the men drove on in silence until the lights of the grange twinkled out across the plain ten minutes later they entered the big hall and harding cast a quick glance about he noticed the clusters of wheatears and the big mooseheads on the wall the curious eastern weapons and the english sporting guns that glistened beneath them and the fine timbering of the pointed roof he did not think there was another homestead to compare with this between winnipeg and the valleys of british columbia but it was the company that seized his attention it looked as if every man in the settlement were present and they were worth the glance he gave them dressed with picturesque freedom they were for the most part handsome men with powerful frames and pleasant brown faces harding knew they had courage and intelligence yet he felt that there was something lackingsomething hard to define he thought of them as without the striving spirit as too content  one or two gave him a welcoming smile and there was a slight general movement when he sat down mowbray however looked up with some surprise from the head of the long table  after certain favors mr harding has done me it would be singularly inappropriate if i questioned his coming here as my guest on the other hand the presence of any outside person at our council is irregular  may i explain kenwyne said mr harding and his partner came by my invitation to give us some information about matters of which he knows more than any one else they will of course take no other part in the proceedings  mowbray bowed i am satisfied mr harding will understand that a president must show due regard to form  his manner was courteous yet harding was conscious of a subtle antagonism between them to some extent it was personal but its roots struck deeper it was the inevitable hostility between the old school and the new mowbray was a worthy representative of the former fastidiously neat in his dress though his clothes were by no means of the latest cut and sitting very upright he had an air of dignity and command he might be prejudiced but it was obvious that he was neither dull nor weak  we have he said taking up a paper a motion of some importance before us it is proposed that we consider the advisability of cooperating with messrs harding and devine first in the purchase and use of a steamplow second in the organization of a joint creamery and third in opening a sales office in winnipeg or other convenient center for the disposal of stock and general produce  putting down the paper he looked round with an ironical smile  you will observe that the scheme is by no means modest indeed it strikes me as the most revolutionary project that has ever been suggested in this place it is nevertheless my duty to ask those responsible for it to say what they can in its favor  kenwyne rose with a composed expression  briefly the advantages are these with mechanical power we can plow more land than at present and at a reduced cost  that is far from certain mowbray declared we cannot take it for granted these machines go wrong  with your permission i will ask mr harding to give us some figures later we are missing opportunities by being content with rearing only a limited number of beef cattle winnipeg and brandon are growing fast new towns are springing up along the railroad and there will soon be a demand for dairy produce that will counterbalance the rather frequent loss of a wheat crop  it will mean more paid hands and working all the land some one objected  exactly i may add that this is our aim the land must be developed  there was a murmur of disapproval but kenwyne went on  then there is reason to believe that we seldom obtain the prices we ought to get stockbuyers profits and salesmens charges are high and we cant expect these gentry to look after our interests we could best secure these by setting up an agency of our own and hiring trained assistance im afraid we cannot claim to be successful business men  if that claim is ever justified you will have to choose another leader mowbray remarked this settlement was not founded with the object of making money now broadwood  broadwood rose with a smile  we must all agree sir that theres not much danger of the object you mention being realized no doubt there are some to whom this doesnt matter but the rest are confronted with the necessity for making a living and i suspect that one or two have the trouble ive experienced in paying my storekeepers bills  dont be personal some one called out  that strikes me as foolish broadwood retorted one cant help being personal we all know one another we use one anothers horses and borrow one anothers cash and its the necessity for doing the latter that i wish to obviate we all know our neighbors needs and i want to show you how they can be supplied  he had struck the right note with his easy humor but harding saw that mowbray was not pleased  you dont need much one cried amid laughter you got a bumper harvest and cut down your subscription to the hounds  broadwood smiled  i came out of the rut and worked a rash experiment perhaps but it didnt prove so harrowing as i feared and theres some satisfaction in having no debts but my point is that you cant do much without proper implements and i feel that well have to get them the proposal ive the pleasure of seconding shows you how  he sat down and mowbray looked up with a sarcastic smile  broadwoods remarks dont take us much farther he seems careful to avoid practical details now the first thing i notice about this scheme is that it is founded on combination its proposers are right in assuming the necessity for this if their purpose is to secure economical success but such success can be bought at too high a price carry the cooperative idea out to its logical conclusion and a man becomes a machine he must subordinate his private judgment he cannot choose his course all his movements must be regulated by central control then you may get efficiency but you destroy character independence personal responsibility all the finest attributes of human nature you may object that i am exaggerating that nobody wants this the danger is that if you decide to go some distance you may be driven farther than you think then allenwood was founded to encourage individual libertythat settlers here might live a healthy life free from economic pressure on their own land farming it like gentlemen and not with bitter greed enjoying the wind and sunshine finding healthy sport we demand a high standard of conduct but that is all we are bound to one another by community of ideals and traditions and not by the hope of dividends  there was an outbreak of applause then kenwyne rose  the difficulty is that to lead our own lives regardless of changing times and in defiance of commercial principles needs larger means than most of us possess the plain truth is that allenwood has been living upon its capital drawing upon resources that cannot be renewed and we must presently face the reckoning some of us see this clearly and i think the rest are beginning to understand if you have no objections sir i will ask mr harding to give us some figures  harding got up and stood silent for a moment or two conscious that all present were watching him he felt that they were keeping the ring and that the affair had developed into a fight between himself and mowbray harding regretted this because the colonels hostility would make the secret hope he cherished very difficult to realize but he could not act against his convictions he stood for progressblundering progress perhapsand mowbray for the preservation of obsolete ways and means the conflict was inevitable harding might lose the first round but he knew that the result was certain vast insuperable forces were arrayed against his antagonist  to begin with what do you expect to gain by persuading us to join you mowbray asked  a saving of expense and the help of the only neighbors i have at present harding answered my partner and i are ready to go on alone but we cant hope to do much unassisted  opening the papers he had brought he read out particulars of the cost of plowing by horses and by steam then statistics of american and canadian grain production and the fluctuations of prices  where did you get the figures about the mechanical plowing mowbray asked in an ironical tone from the makers  in the first place i afterward checked them by information from farmers who have used the machines  very wise these implements are expensive can you guarantee that they will work satisfactorily  that would be rash i expect a certain amount of trouble  skilled mechanics wages are high do you recommend our keeping a man here in case things go wrong  certainly not if you buy a steamplow you must learn to keep it in order  broadwood picturing the colonel sprawled under an oily engine battling with obstinate bolts laughed aloud  mowbray frowned  granting the accuracy of your statistics he said you seem to have proved the economy of mechanical power when used on a large scale but we are not agreed upon the necessity for such a thing  this was the opening harding had waited for and he seized it quickly  at present wheat is your mainstay how many of you will find it profitable to grow at the current price  not many perhaps mowbray admitted and the disturbed expression of others bore out the statement but is there adequate ground for concluding it will remain at an abnormally low price  it will not remain there for the next few years it will go down steadily  there was a murmur of disagreement and mowbray smiled  i presume you are willing to justify this gloomy forecast he said  ill try answered harding you have seen what one railroad has done for western canada it has opened up the country brought wide tracts of land into cultivation and largely increased the wheat crop that increase will go on and you will presently see rival lines tapping new belts of fertile soil  but do you imply that the grain output of western canada can force down prices a man asked with a scornful laugh we have all europe for a market i imagine theyll use what we can send them in a few big english towns  it was obvious that the question met with approval and harding quietly searched the faces turned toward him he belonged by right of birth to these mens caste but he did not want them to own him he asked their help but he could do without it though they could not dispense with his their supineness irritated him they would not see the truth that was luminously clear he felt a strange compulsion to rouse and dominate them  the canadian output will soon have to be reckoned with he said in the meantime its the effect of a general expansion throughout the world that im counting on what has been done in canada is being done everywhere look abroad and see the american middle west linked up with new railroads grain pouring out to new york and baltimore californian wheat shipments doubling and the walla country in oregon all one grain belt theyre tapping new soil in argentina australia and chile are being exploited wherever they get rain and british irrigation works in egypt and india will have their effect  gerald mowbray spoke for the first time  one feels tempted to inquire where mr harding secured this mass of information he said with a slight curl of his lips  you can get a good deal for a few dollars subscription to new york papers harding answered dryly when the snows deep men with no amusements have time to read but thats beside the question i must now ask you to consider the improvement in transport locomotives are doubling their size and power you have seen the new grain cars the tripleexpansion engine is cutting down ocean freight making distance of no account all countries must compete in the worlds markets with the cheapest grower to survive in the struggle thats coming one must use efficient tools  and what will happen after the markets have been flooded a man asked derisively  then said harding gravely when the slack and careless have been killed off there will be a startling change the farming expansion cant last theres not enough accessible virgin land to draw upon american shipments will fall off the demands of the worlds growing population will overtake the supply those who live through the fight will find riches thrust upon them  we are losing sight of the general produce and dairy scheme mowbray remarked have you anything to tell us on this point  not much winnipeg is growing so is brandon and theyll provide good markets for farming truck but the country that will ask for most is british columbia  rather a long way off somebody commented  wait and see said harding theyre opening new mines and sawmills all over the province columbias aim is industrial not agricultural and most of the land there is rock and forest theyre cut off from the pacific states by the tariff and naturally theyll turn to us across the rockies i foresee our sending general produce west instead of east now although ive taken up too much time will you give me a minute to read some figures  he paused and with an almost involuntary burst of applause they bade him go on the statistics he gave were telling clinching his arguments and when he sat down there was a deep murmur of approval from opponents as well as friends the breadth of his views and his farreaching knowledge appealed to them it was the first time they had heard anything like this at allenwood  after waiting a few moments for silence mowbray turned to devine  have you anything of interest to tell us  well devine said with simple earnestness i was raised at a prairie homestead i began to drive horses soon after i could walk and ever since ive been living on the soil thats how i know that in the long run scratchfarming will never pay with nature up against us we can take no chances when we break new land for shes mighty hard to beat with her dry seasons harvest frost blight and blowing sand weve got to use the best of everything man can invent and if were to stand for a run of bad times get the last cents value for every dollar any machine that wont give you the top output must be scrapped you must get your full return for your labor slouching and inefficiency lead you straight into the hands of the mortgage man  when he sat down mowbray smiled  our visitors have certainly given us food for thought the colonel said i offer them our thanks and should now be glad to hear any fresh opinions  several men spoke some with warmth and some with careless humor  as we dont get much further we will take a vote mowbray suggested i will move the resolution as it stands though this has not been our usual custom you are entitled to a ballot  there was silence for a moment mowbrays views were known and the men shrank from wounding him for he did not bear opposition well for all that with a fastidious sense of honor they disdained the shield of the secret vote  i think we will stick to the show of hands kenwyne replied  very well said mowbray for the motion  harding glancing round the room was surprised and somewhat moved to notice that lances hand went up among the rest the boy had voted against his father so far as harding could judge half the men were in favor of the scheme  against the motion  the hands were raised and mowbray counted them with care  equal for and against he announced i have a casting vote and i think the importance of the matter justifies my using it i declare the motion lost  there was an impressive silence for a few moments then broadwood spoke  although we have decided against going on with the scheme as a body i take it there is nothing to prevent any individuals who wish to do so joining in mr hardings venture  i must leave you to decide how far such action is in good taste or likely to promote the harmony which has been the rule at allenwood now i think we can close the meeting  when the company dispersed harding devine and broadwood drove home with kenwyne the scotch housekeeper opened the door for them and handed kenwyne the mail which had been brought in his absence he tore open a newspaper and turned to the quotations  wheat down sixpence a quarter at liverpool he said it will have its effect in chicago and winnipeg he dropped the paper and took off his fur coat i suppose youre going on with the plan harding  the plows ordered  youre a hustler broadwood laughed but you mustnt make the pace too hot weve been used to going steady what did you think of the meeting  it went better than i expected  wed have had a majority only that they were afraid of the colonel and i dont blame them in a way he made a rather pathetic figure trying to sweep back the tide the old man has courage its a pity he wont see that his is a lost cause  he cant said kenwyne gravely and we must realize that  then are you going to let him ruin you devine asked  i hope not but we all feel that we cant disown our leader broadwood answered i dare say you can understand that we have a hard row to hoe  well the creamery scheme will have to be dropped kenwyne said but therell be plenty of work for the new plow  yes harding replied if all the rest stand out devine and i can keep it busy  how much land do you intend to break  harding told him and kenwyne looked astonished  youre a bold man if its not an impertinence can you finance the thing  it will take every dollar i have  and if you lose the spring rains are sometimes hard enough to uproot the young blades or a summer hailstorm or drought may come and ruin the crop  harding shrugged his shoulder  those things must be considered of course but one never gets very far by standing still and waiting for a disaster that may never occur nothing ventured nothing gained he quoted with a smile     chapter xi  the steam plow   the winter passed quickly harding was kept fully occupied for there was cordwood to be cut there were building logs to be got ready and the fitting up of the new house kept him busy at his carpenters bench he was used to the prairie climate and he set off cheerfully at dawn to work in the snow all day returning at dark halffrozen and stiff from swinging the heavy ax now and then he drove hester to mrs broadwoods or spent an evening with one or two others of the allenwood settlers he went partly for his sisters sake but also because he sometimes met beatrice at his new friends houses and since lance had recovered he no longer had an excuse for visiting the grange mrs mowbray had always been gracious but he knew that the colonel now regarded him as a dangerous person  beatrices manner puzzled him as a rule she was friendly yet he could not flatter himself that he was making much progress and sometimes she was distinctly aloof he might have placed a favorable interpretation upon her reserve but unfortunately it was tinged with what looked very much like hostility harding imagined that she was influenced by her father and he was troubled  there were however days when his homestead rocked beneath the icy blast while the snow lashed the shiplap walls and to venture out involved serious risk the blizzards were often followed by bitter evenings when the prairie lay white and silent in the arctic frost and no furs would protect one against the cold at such times harding sat quietly by the redhot stove sometimes with a notebook in his hand and sometimes merely thinking hard many barriers stood between him and the girl he loved and being essentially practical he considered how he could remove the worst beatrice had been luxuriously brought up and he must have material advantages to offer her although if she were what he believed she would not attach undue importance to them he was ambitious and generally ready to take a risk but now he was staking his all on an abundant crop it could not be done rashly adverse contingencies must be foreseen and guarded against all the precautions that experience dictated must be taken he would be ruined if he lost  the days were lengthening though the frost still held when his steamplow arrived at the railroad settlement no one seemed willing to undertake its transport to allenwood and when a thing was extremely difficult harding believed in doing it himself the machine had been dismantled but some of the enginecastings were massive and the boiler with its large woodburning firebox was of considerable weight it must however be moved at once because the frost might break and the prairie is impassable by loaded vehicles for a few weeks after the thaw as a rule the snowfall is light on the western plains and jumpersleds are not in general use in this instance harding found the long highwheeled wagon suit his purpose best and he carefully strengthened one before he set off to bring home the plow  it was not an easy task the high plain sloped to the railroad in wavelike undulations with sandy crests and timber in the hollows in summer it would hardly have been possible to haul the plow across this belt of broken country but the few inches of beaten snow on the trail simplified the task for all that harding spent several days on the road moving the machine in detachments until he came to the boiler which must be handled in one piece when with the help of several trainmen he got it into his wagon he knew his troubles had begun  leaving the settlement at dawn with devine they camped at sunset by a frozen creek and got a few hours sleep beside a fire until the cold awakened them after this harding lay thinking over the next days work until the sky began to whiten in the east and it was time to get breakfast  they set off in the stinging cold while the crimson sunrise glared across the snow but it was afternoon and the teams were worn out when they approached the ravine a few miles from home this they knew presented their greatest obstacle the frost held sky and air were clear and a nipping wind had risen as they drew near the wavy line of trees that marked the edge of the dip harding was not pleased to notice a group of people he had arranged for two of the allenwood men to meet him with some tackle but he saw that hester beatrice mrs broadwood and several more had accompanied them he was not often selfconscious but when he had anything difficult to do he did not like onlookers they embarrassed him  for all that he felt a keen thrill of pleasure when beatrice with mrs broadwood came toward him when he stopped his team on the edge of the hollow the sides of the ravine were clothed with leafless poplars and the snow shone a soft grayblue in their shadow in places the slope was very steep and the trail with several awkward bends ran down diagonally to the bridge at the bottom shut in by rows of slender trunks except where the ground fell away on its outer edge a thin cloud of steam hung over the jaded horses except for the sparkle in his eyes harding had a very tired look when beatrice stopped beside him  it will not be easy getting down she said  harding smiled  i suppose i deserve some trouble  i really think you do beatrice answered with a laugh i would have stopped you if i could but now the plows here its too late to be disagreeable about itso i dont wish you any difficulty in getting down  its a sensible attitude fight against a thing you dont like but make the best of it when its an accomplished fact  i dont like steamplows at allenwood said beatrice with a flush of color  allenwood is hifalutin mrs broadwood put in theyre trying to run it on ideals  is it necessary to separate ideals from practical efficiency harding asked  they dont often go together beatrice answered scornfully  theres some truth in that but its the fault of human nature you cant blame the machines  the machines are to be admired the girl returned one blames the men who use them with the wrong object  harding smiled but before he could answer broadwood came up with kenwyne to announce that everything was ready  youll have to be careful he warned harding well lock the back wheels before we hook on the tackles will you let the front team loose  no i may want them to swing me round the bends first of all ill take a look at what youve done  he walked down the trail with them and examined the fastenings of a big iron block through which ran a wire rope with a tackle at one end  the clevis is rather small but its the strongest i could find kenwyne said  a little farther on they stopped where the bank fell nearly perpendicularly for some distance below the outer edge of the road  we banked the snow up here and beat it firm he pointed out for all that it would be wise to keep well to the inside  well shift the tackle when i get to the bend above harding replied and went down to the bridge it was rudely built of logs and had no parapet  i found the turn awkward the last time but i see you have made it a bit easier he said well wed better make a start  lance and one or two others joined them when they reached the top harding examined the wagon and harness and beatrice watched him with interest he certainly lived up to his belief in efficiency because she did not think he omitted any precaution he could have taken there was something to admire in him as he quietly moved about beside the horses and the ponderous mass of iron it would not be an easy matter to transport the load to the bottom of the gorge but beatrice felt that he was at his best when confronting a difficulty  the locked wheels wont hold her if anything goes wrong he said keep all the strain you can upon the rope  they hooked it to the back axle and harding cautiously led the team down the incline while devine went to the leading horses heads and the others checked the wagon with the tackle the teams were obviously nervous and the polehorses now and then lifted their haunches to hold back the load although they did not feel much of its weight after some trouble harding got the wagon round the first turning taking the leaders up the side of the ravine in order to do so but the trail ahead was steeper and the big drop not far below they chocked the wheels with logs while they moved the tackle and harding stood for a few moments breathing heavily as he looked down into the gorge he could see the snowy trail wind for a short distance among the trees and then it dipped out of sight beyond a turn it was beaten hard and here and there its surface caught a ray of light and flashed with an icy gleam they were halfway down but the worst was to come  its an ugly bit he cautioned devine hold the leaders in to the side of the hill  they started and as the weight came upon them the blocks screamed and the men began to strain against the drag of the rope foot by foot they let it slip round the smooth trunk of a tree while the women stood watching the tall figure at the polehorses heads the powerful animals braced themselves back slipping a yard or two now and then while harding broke into a run the cloud of steam that hung over them grew thicker as the trees closed in the tackle was running out and those who held it were panting hard but they had rope enough to reach the next bend  then there was a crash and kenwyne reeling backward with those behind him fell heavily into the snow while the broken wire struck the trees a shout from devine came up the hollow and hester clenched her hand as she saw him flung off by a plunging horse and roll down the trail he dropped over the edge but the wagon lurching violently went on and for a few moments harding running fast clung to the near horses head then he let go but instead of jumping clear as the watchers had expected he grasped the side of the wagon as it passed and swung himself up they saw him seize the reins standing upright behind the drivingseat and then the wagon plunged out of sight among the trees  devine scrambling to his feet ran madly after it and vanished and the men who had held the tackle picked themselves up and looked down in dismay there was nothing they could do the disaster must happen before they could possibly reach the scene it seemed impossible that harding could get round the next turn  beatrice cast a quick glance at hester and felt braced by her attitude they were not emotional at allenwood but the prairie girl bore herself with a stoic calm which beatrice had never seen equaled there her fiancé had narrowly escaped with his life her brother was in imminent peril yet her eyes were steady and her pose was firm his danger could not be made light of but the girl evidently had confidence in him beatrice imagined that hester had her brothers swiftness of action nevertheless she could wait and suffer calmly when there was nothing else to be done after all stern courage was part of the girls birthright for she was a daughter of the pioneers  beatrice did not know that her own face was tense and white the accident had been unexpected and unnerving she was shaken by its suddenness and by a dread she could not explain it was no time for analysis of feelings she was watching the trail with desperate concentration wondering whether the wagon and its reckless driver would break out from the trees in a moment they did appearthe team going downhill at a mad gallop harding lashing them with a loop of the reins there is not often a brake on a prairie wagon and as the chain that locked the wheels had obviously broken hardings intention was plain he meant to keep the horses ahead of the iron load that would overturn the wagon and mangle the animals if it overtook them this warranted his furious speed but the trail was narrow and tortuous and with the heavy weight spread over a long wheelbase the wagon was hard to steer beatrice realized this but in spite of her horror she felt a thrill of fierce approval  the man was standing upright now he looked strangely unmoved beatrice supposed this was a delusion but she could see the nerve and judgment with which he guided the team they were passing the spot where the bank fell away the wheels on one side were on its edge beatrice turned dizzy she felt that they must go over and man and horses and wagon be crushed to pulp beneath the heavy load they passed but there was a turn not far off and room was needed to take the curve as they rushed on half hidden by the trees she felt her breath come hard and a contraction in her throat as she wondered whether he could get round if not the load of iron would rush headlong over the fallen horses leaving in its path a mass of mangled flesh and pools of blood to her excited imagination the boiler was no longer a senseless thing it seemed filled with malevolent destructive power she felt she hated it  there was a tense moment then the leading horses plunged from the trees with the poleteam behind them all still on their feet harding had somehow steered them round but the danger was not yet over for the trail shelved to one side and there was an awkward curve near the bridge the wagon seemed to beatrice to be going like the toboggans she had seen on the long slide at montreal it was more difficult to see as it got farther off and the trees were thicker her eyes filled with water from the intensity of her gaze and she feared to waste a moment in wiping them something terrible might happen before she could see again she wanted to shriek and she might have done so only that even in such a moment she remembered what was expected of the mowbray strain horses and wagon were still rushing on then there was a thud and a harsh rattle harding was on the bridge another moment and the mad beat of hoofs slackened and stopped  lance waving his fur cap broke into a harsh triumphant yell and the rest of the allenwood men set up a cheer in the midst of it devine appeared scrambling up the hill through the brush  hes done it hes done it he cried excitedly running up to hester its great she was going like an express freight on a downgrade when he jumped up  hester smiled at him proudly and he turned and started off at top speed down the trail they all followed and crossing the bridge found harding standing by his blowing team the horses coats were foul with sweat and hardings face was badly scratched but he did not seem to know it and except that he was breathless he looked much as usual  this is quite ridiculous mrs broadwood panted with a keen glance at beatrice theres some excuse for hester but i cant see why you and i should go running after a man who doesnt belong to either of us and seems to feel a good deal cooler than we do  beatrice flushed but she did not answer  you were lucky in getting down kenwyne said to harding we thought you were going over the bank  so did i at first harding answered  broadwood and lance made some remarks about the accident and hester watched them with a smile there was a hint of strain in their voices but their manner was very matteroffact she surmised that they wished to forget their relapse into emotional excitement she contented herself with giving her brother a quick expressive look  harding unhooked the broken wire from the back of the wagon  well he said we must set about getting up  the ascending trail had a gentler slope and there was not much risk in climbing it though it cost them heavy labor with the help of a yoke of oxen they got the wagon up and when the top was reached kenwyne came up to harding  you and devine have done enough he said there should be no trouble now well lead the teams home while you take it easy  harding was glad to comply he followed with hester and mrs broadwood because beatrice seemed so evidently trying to avoid him  the girl felt disturbed when she thought that harding could not escape a curious sense of personal loss had intensified her alarm terror of course was natural the other feeling was not to be explained so readily although she disliked some of his opinions she knew that he attracted her his was a magnetic nature he exerted a strong influence over every one but she would not admit that she was in love with him that would be absurd and yet she had been deeply stirred by his danger  lance and devine had lingered in the rear and the little group stopped in the middle of the trail and waited for them then when they moved forward again beatrice and harding were somehow thrown together and she checked the impulse to overtake the others when she saw that she and the prairie man were falling behind to avoid being alone with him would exaggerate his importance  you must have known you were doing a dangerous thing when you got up on the wagon she said  i suppose i did he replied but i saw that i might lose the boiler if it went down the bank the thing cost a good deal of money  you were able to remember that  certainly then there were the teams it would have been a pity to let them be killed  beatrice thought he might have offered a better explanation he had implied that anxiety about the boiler had influenced him more than regard for his horses she felt that she must give him an opportunity for defending himself  i wonder which consideration counted most  he looked at her with amusement and she flushed as she suddenly recalled that he was sometimes very shrewd  well he said the main thing was to get hold of the reinsand i dont know that it matters now  i suppose not beatrice agreed vexed that he did not seem anxious to make the best impression after all breaking land on a large scale must be expensive and i understand that your plans are ambitious  harding glanced across the prairie it ran back to the blue smear of trees on the horizon covered with thin snow and struck a note of utter desolation  yes he said with a gleam in his eyes all this looks lifeless and useless now but i can see it belted with wheat and oats and flax in the fall there will be a difference when the binders move through the grain in rows  in rows  well want a number if all goes well devines land follows my boundary and we must drive our plows in one straight line we begin at the rise yonder and run east to the creek  the boldness of the undertaking appealed to the girl as she glanced across the wide stretch of snow  its a big thing she said  a beginning two men cant do much but more are coming in a year or two the wheat will run as far as you can see and therell be homesteads all along the skyline  they walked on in silence for a moment then he gave her an amused glance  i guess colonel mowbray doesnt like what im doing  he doesnt go so far its to what you are persuading our friends to do that he objects  thats a pity theyll have to follownot because i lead but because necessity drives  youre taking it for granted that it does drive and you must see my fathers point of view  that im encouraging your people to rebel thats not my wish but he cant hold them much longerthe drift of things is against him  beatrices eyes sparkled he thought she looked very charming with her proud air and the color in her face but he must keep his head he was readjusting his opinions about sudden mutual love and he saw that precipitation might cost him too much if he could not have the girl on his own terms he must take her on hers  colonel mowbray founded the settlement beatrice said and it has prospered cant you understand his feelings when he sees his control threatened  the time when one man could hold full command has gone he can be a moral influence and keep the right spirit in his people but he must leave them freedom of action  that is just the trouble its the modern spirit which you are bringing into the settlement that disturbs us we managed to get along very well before we ever heard of mr harding and his steamplow and his wheatbinders and his creameries  she could not keep the slight scorn out of her voice indeed she did not wish to do so but he took it goodnaturedly  do you know what i see he questioned with a smile a time when colonel mowbrayand colonel mowbrays daughter he added teasinglywill look with pride upon the vast acres of allenwood turned from waste grassland into productive fields of wheat and oats and flax when the obsolete horseplow will be scrapped as old iron and the now despised steamplow will be a highly treasured possession of every settler when  never beatrice interrupted emphatically you must understand that my fathers views and yours are as widely different as the polesand my father is the head of allenwood  harding looked down at the haughty face turned up to him and a great longing suddenly surged through him he had never desired her more than at that instant his admiration showed so strongly in his eyes that the blood swept into beatrices face  bee lance called back to them mrs broadwood wants you to verify what im telling her about the collie pup  beatrice loved her brother for the interruption     chapter xii  the enemy within   it was getting late but the allenwood sports club prolonged its sitting at the carlyon homestead the institution had done useful work in promoting good fellowship by means of healthful amusements but recently its management had fallen into the hands of the younger men and the founders contented themselves with an occasional visit to see that all was going well some however were not quite satisfied and mowbray entertained suspicions about the club he was an autocrat but he shrank from spying or attempting to coerce a member into betraying his comrades some allowance must be made for young blood and after all nothing that really needed his interference could go on he felt without his learning about it nevertheless he had a disturbing feeling that an undesirable influence was at work  carlyons room was unusually well furnished and several fine london guns occupied a rack on the matchboarded wall the cost of one would have purchased a dozen of the massachusettsmade weapons which the prairie farmers used the photograph of a horseman in english hunting dress with mfh appended to the autograph was equally suggestive and it was known that carlyons people had sent him to canada with money enough to make a fair start unfortunately he had not realized that success in farming demands care and strenuous work  he sat with a flushed excited face at a rosewood table upon which the cigar ends bottles and glasses scarcely left room for the cards he was eagerly scanning gerald mowbray leaned back in his chair watching him with a smile emslie the third man wore a disturbed frown opposite him markham sat with a heavy vacant air  your lucks changing carlyon gerald said but we must stop at this round markhams half asleepand im not surprised considering what hes drunk and the colonel will wonder where ive been if i stay much longer  carlyon drained his glass  very well he consented with a harsh laugh and a glitter in his eyes as ive a good deal to get back ill double and throw my percheron team in does that take you  markham immediately became alert  i think not go on gerald  gerald put down a card emslie followed with a deepening frown but markham chuckled as he played carlyon started and then with an obvious effort pulled himself together for the next few moments all were quiet and the stillness was emphasized by the patter of the falling cards then carlyon pushed his chair back noisily and looked at the others his face pale and set  i thought it was a certainty there was only one thing i forgot he said in a strained voice  markham leaned forward heavily  fellows who play like you cant afford to forget my boy know better next time let it be a lesson  carlyon glanced at a notebook and took out a wad of bills which he tried to count  sorry but i seem to be five dollars short dont know when youll get it but ill send the horses to the next brandon sales i dare say somebody will help me with my plowing  dont be an ass said gerald throwing in the team was a piece of silly bluff were not going to take advantage of it  emslie nodded agreement and markham drawled  dont want his splayfooted beasts and wont lend him my good clydesdales to spoil count out the bills gerald his hand is shaking  carlyon protested that he was a sportsman and paid his debts but they overruled him  silly thing to do unless youre made markham declared then he turned to gerald whats become of the younger brother never see him now  oh hes reformed on the whole its just as well for theres not room for two gamblers in the family besides the americans seem to have got hold of him they live like methodists  you mean the girl has devilish handsome has a grand way of looking at you ask carlyon he knows  carlyon colored under markhams broadly humorous gaze  miss harding wont trouble herself about lance he said i may add that she doesnt appreciate a graceful compliment  smacked your face suggested markham with a chuckle must be going give me my coat  a newspaper and some letters fell out of a pocket as he put it on and he picked them up  quite forgot met the mailcarrier as i was driving in better look what wheat is doing  carlyon eagerly opened the paper  down again two cents at chicago winnipeg will follow  theres a certain cure said markham thickly all stop plowing if you do nothing long enough must send the market up call it a brilliant idea wonder nobody else thought of it you look sober emslie come and help me into my rig  they went out and a few minutes afterward a furious beat of hoofs and a rattle of wheels rang out across the prairie  i hope he will get home without breaking his neck carlyon said to gerald  oh markham can take care of himself but we have something else to think about now  thats true carlyon agreed with a depressed air i took your advice and told that fellow in the pit to buy wheat but i wish id heard hardings speech at the council before i made the deal now its clear that im dipped pretty deep he picked up the letters that were scattered among the cards and started as he saw the embossed stamp on one of them its from my broker ill soon know the worst  gerald lighting a cigarette watched the tense expression of the boys face as he read the letter and for a few moments nothing was said carlyon looked crushed but geralds position was too serious to allow of his sympathizing much taking advantage of his friends love of excitement he had won a number of small sums at cards but this was of no account against what he owed after a moment carlyon laid a statement of account before him  you can see how much im out  cant you carry it over  impossible carlyon answered dejectedly i didnt actually buy the grain ive got to find the difference besides what would be the use of holding on if wheats still going to drop  its awkward gerald agreed you might get some exemption under the homesteads act but this broker could sell you up would your people do anything  they wont be asked things were not going well with them when i left and i guess they find it hard enough to keep dick at college and provide for the girls they gave me a good start but it was understood that id get nothing more  then the only remedy is to borrow the money here  carlyon laughed  whod lend it to me besides if the colonel knew how i was fixed hed turn me out of the settlement  i know a man in winnipeg who does this kind of business but hed charge you high and want a bond that means hed seize your land in a year or two if you couldnt pay  the other fellow would seize it now carlyon said with eagerness if i could get the money id have time to see what could be done and something might turn up will you introduce me  the matter was arranged before gerald left and two days later they were in winnipeg they found davies willing to do business indeed after making a few difficulties as an excuse for raising the interest he supplied carlyon with the money he needed and when the men left his office he lighted a cigar with a satisfied smile he now held two mortgages on land at allenwood and he thought that he could make good use of them if as he expected the loans were not repaid then it was possible that mowbray might bring him another customer he saw a big profit for himself and trouble for the allenwood settlers when the reckoning came  shortly after geralds visit to winnipeg one of his neighbors returned from england where he had gone to look into matters connected with some property he had recently inherited his absence had been a relief to beatrice and she was especially disturbed to learn that on his arrival he had spent an hour in private talk with her father brand had continually shown strong admiration for her which she by no means reciprocated she did not actually dislike the man but his attentions annoyed her she knew however that he enjoyed colonel mowbrays full approval he came of good family and his character was irreproachable moreover being past forty he had outgrown all youthful rashnesses of rather handsome person and polished manners brand was generally characterized by staid gravity and mowbray considered his views exceptionally sound  beatrice was keenly curious about what he had said to her father she imagined that her mother knew but no hint was given to her and when she met brand it was always in the company of others and there was nothing to be gathered from his manner it was however not often that he displayed his sentiments  the thaw had begun when she walked home from the broadwood farm one afternoon the snow had vanished as if by magic and shallow lagoons glittered among the bleached grass the sky was a brilliant blue and rounded clouds with silver edges rolled across it before the fresh northwest breeze which would blow persistently until summer was done their swift shadows streaked the plain and passed leaving it suffused with light there was a genial softness in the air  beatrice picked her way cautiously toward a straggling bluff for the ponds along its edge had overflowed and the ground was marish on reaching the woods she stopped in a sheltered nook to enjoy the sunshine the birches and poplars were bare but their stems were changing color and the twigs had lost their dry and brittle look the willows in a hollow were stained with vivid hues by the rising sap and there was a flush of green among the grass small purple flowers like crocuses were pushing through the sod from high overhead there fell a harsh clanging cry and the girl looking up saw a flock of brent geese picked out in a wedge against the sky behind came a wedge of mallard and farther off gleaming snowily a flight of sandhill cranes spring was in the air the birds had heard its call and were pressing on toward the polar marshes following the sun beatrice felt a curious stirring of her blood it was half pleasant half painful for while she responded to the gladness that pervaded everything the sunshine kissed she was conscious of a disturbing longing a mysterious discontent she would not try to analyze her feelings but she felt that her life was narrow and somehow incomplete  she was startled presently by a drumming of hoofs and she frowned as brand rode out of the bluff he had seen her and she decided not to try to avoid him by walking on if she must face a crisis it was better to get it over brand got down and turned to her with a smile he looked well in his wide gray hat and his riding dress for the picturesqueness of the fringed deerskin jacket which was then the vogue at allenwood did not detract from his air of dignity his features were regular but his expression was somewhat cold  im glad we have met and ill confess that i expected to find you here in fact i came to look for you he said with a smile  beatrice knew what was coming while she felt that it would be better to meet the situation frankly she nevertheless shrank from doing so  i have seen so little of you since you came home she said partly to defer his declaration that i havent had an opportunity for expressing my sympathy  it was a shock he answered i hadnt seen either of my cousins since they were boys but we were good friends then and i never expected to succeed them their yacht was run down at night and when the steamer got her boat out only the paid hand was left  will you go back to england now to live  i think ill stay at allenwood one gets used to western waysalthough theres a good deal to be said for either course and it doesnt altogether depend on me  beatrice hesitated a moment then  there is some one else to please she asked with charming innocence  brand drew a quick breath as he gazed at the young face so near him she was leaning against a poplar trunk the sun fretting her with gold between the bare branches the wind caressing a few loose strands of hair that were blown across her cheek  i will please the girl i hope to marry he said in a strained voice she loves the prairie and she shall have her choice i think you know beatrice that i have long been waiting for you  beatrice was annoyed to find herself blushing  im sorry she faltered you know i tried to show youyou must see it was difficult  it is not your fault that i wouldnt take a hint he answered quietly but you are very young and i knew that i would never change  you thought i might  i hoped so i was afraid that after the romantic admiration you have had from the boys you might find me too matteroffact and staid but there was a chance that you might get used to that and i made up my mind to be patient  im sorry for your sake that you waited  her glance was gently regretful and he read decision in it but he was a determined man  it seems i havent waited long enough he returned with a faint smile but while you will grow more attractive for a long time yet i have reached my prime and inheriting the english property rather forced my hand after all our life here is bare and monotonousyou would have a wider circle and more scope in the old country  beatrice liked his terseness and in some ways she liked and respected him moreover she was offered a beautiful english country house a position of some influence and friends of taste and rank  you were very considerate she said but im afraid what you wish is impossible  wait he begged i havent said much about myself but i believe i appreciate you better than any of the boys is capable of doing i could carry your wishes further and take more care of you he paused with a grave smile im not a romantic person but i think im trustworthy then it would please your father  ah you have told him  yes and he was good enough to express his full approval  beatrices face was disturbed but she answered frankly  though i know you wont take an unfair advantage of his consent i wish you hadnt gone to him it may make things more difficult for me and now please understand that i cannot marry you  brands lips came together in a straight line he did not have a pleasant look but his voice was unusually suave when he answered  it looks as if i must face my disappointment ill do nothing that might embarrass you all the same i warn you that i shall not despair  you must not think of me beatrice said firmly im very sorry but i want to save you trouble  he quietly picked up his horses bridle  you are going home may i walk with you as far as the trailforks  beatrice could not refuse this and he talked pleasantly about allenwood matters until he left her she went on alone in a thoughtful mood she wished that brand had not made his offer because she knew that her refusal had been a blow and she did not like to think that she had wounded him moreover his quiet persistence might still prove troublesome perhaps it was unfortunate that she could not return his affection for brand had many good qualities and her father approved of him then with a thrill of perplexing emotion she thought of harding in some respects he was too practical and matteroffact but she knew that his character had another side while he worked and planned he had dreams of a splendid future which she thought would be realized he was a visionary as well as a man of affairs virile daring and beneath the surface generous and tender it was curious how she knew so much about him yet she felt that she was right  harding was however barred out so to speak divided from her by conventions and traditions that could not be broken unless indeed love warranted the sacrifice but she would not admit that she loved him he loved her she knew but that was not enough it was all complicated nothing seemed right she no longer noticed the sunshine or the bracing freshness of the wind as she moved on across the plain with downcast eyes  nerving herself for the encounter she told her father that evening and he sat silent for a few moments looking hard at her while she stood by his writing table with an embarrassed air  it seems to me you are very hard to please he said  perhaps i am she answered but i dont like him enough  i suppose thats an adequate reason but i regret it keenly it would have been a relief to know your future was secure as it would have been with brand  beatrice was touched he had not taken the line she expected and she saw that he was anxious  perhaps its better that you should learn the truth he went on for the last few years my affairs have not gone well geralds extravagance has been a heavy drain lance is young and rash and i feel now that the prosperity of allenwood is threatened the american made me realize that in fact the fellow has brought us trouble ever since he came  perhaps it might be wise to take a few of the precautions he recommended beatrice suggested eager to lead him away from the subject of brand  mowbrays eyes flashed with anger  no if we are to be ruined i hope well meet our fate like gentlemenand it may not come to that we have struggled through critical periods before and can make a good fight yet without using detestable means  beatrice was troubled she admired her fathers pride and courage but she had an uncomfortable suspicion that he was leading a forlorn hope unflinching bravery was not the only thing needful one could not face long odds with obsolete weapons  but they are not all detestable she urged you could choose the bestor if you like the least offensive  compromise is dangerously easy when you begin you are apt to go all the way i didnt expect this from you i believed my own family staunch and i must say its a shock to find the tradesmans spirit in my children even lance shows the taint he actually is planning to sell his riding horses and buy some machine that will save a hired mans wages  beatrice smiled  perhaps that is better than following geralds example but you mustnt be unjust you know that none of us would think of thwarting you  she crossed over to the back of his chair and put her arms around him  im sorry you are disappointed about mr brand she said softly but i know youll forgive me  before he could answer she had slipped out of the room she went at once to find her mother  your father would never force you to marry a man you do not care for mrs mowbray assured her so far as that goes you have nothing to fear  what do you mean beatrice asked in alarm  her mothers eyes were anxious and there was a warning in the look she gave the girl  my dear you would not find him compliant if you wished to marry a man he did not approve of  beatrice stooped to flick an imaginary piece of lint off of her skirt she did not want her mother to see her face just then  after all she answered far more confidently than she felt that may never happen     chapter xiii  the traitor   the prairie was bright with sunshine and the boisterous west wind was cut off by a bluff where harding sat amid a litter of dismantled machinery behind him the newly opened birch leaves showed specks of glowing green and a jackrabbit which had put off its winter coat and was now dappled white and gray fed quietly with a watchful eye turned toward the unconscious man in front the vast sweep of grass that flashed with a silvery gleam as it bowed to the wind was broken by the warm chocolate hue of a broad strip of plowing the rows of clods with their polished faces stretched across the foreground and on their outer edge devine dressed in overalls the color of the soil drove a team of big red oxen  harding however was absorbed in the study of several brass rings and coils of packing that had formed the gland of a pump near by stood a giant plow with a row of shares looking out of place among the earth and grass with its glaring paint its ugly boiler and its sooty stack though the work that it had done was obvious something had gone wrong and harding was trying to locate the trouble the delay was embarrassing for he had a wide stretch of land to break and the loss of even an hour was serious there was not a trained mechanic in the neighborhood and if the plow were likely to give him trouble the sooner he learned to master it the better every part of the machine seemed to be perfect yet the steam had gone down on the previous evening and he must find out the reason it was exasperating work  while harding was struggling with the pump beatrice came along the trail through the bluff her companion banff one of lances many dogs had trailed off through the bushes his nose to the ground and she was for the moment alone when she caught sight of harding she stopped irresolutely she felt that it might be wiser to pass on without disturbing him yet something compelled her to wait  she stood watching him he attracted herthat much she admitted but she persuaded herself that it was only because he was interesting to talk to and unlike the other men she knew he said things that made one think  harding was so deep in his machinery problem that he did not see her he was once more fitting the different parts together when banff came bounding out of the bushes with a glad bark and the little gray rabbit scuttled off through the briars  harding turned quickly and beatrice saw his eyes light up  im glad youve come he said emptying a box of tools and turning it upside down that isnt a bad seatand the suns pleasant here  beatrice noticed that he took it for granted that she would remain but after all he had some reason for this for they seldom passed without stopping to speak when they met  has the machine gone wrong she asked sitting down where the sunlight fell upon her  yes pretty badly i cant find out whats the matter i suppose you think its a just punishment for bringing such things to allenwood  she laughed  well you gave our friends some offense when you brought your plow over and broke kenwynes land  i expected that therell no doubt be more remarks when i break the piece of stiff gumbo on lances holding  beatrice looked up sharply  you mean to do that you must know it will cause trouble she said with a frown  im sorry to displease you but this is something that must be done  why must it do you wish lance to offend his father  no but colonel mowbray has no cause for complaint he gave the land to lance on the understanding that he worked it theres no reason why he should object to his using the best implements then lance is your brother and i dont want to see him ruined  beatrice blushed under his frank gaze and because she was annoyed at doing so she flung out a taunt  do you think the only way of escaping ruin is to copy you  harding laughed he loved her in that mood she looked so alluring with a little frown between her brows and just the suspicion of a pout on her lips  you see he explained in a voice that he might have used to an offended child your allenwood friends will have to make a change soon or theyll suffer and their attitude is not logical your father doesnt ask them to cultivate with the spade theyve dropped the oxteams and bought clydesdales theyve given up the single furrow and use the gangplow why not go on to steam after all youre not standing still youre moving forward a little behind the times why not keep abreast of them or push on ahead  it sounds plausible she admitted in a way perhaps youre right but  i know theres much thats fine and graceful in the customs of the past but you cant preserve them without some adaptation were a new nation working in the melting pot all the scum and dross comes to the top and makes an ugly mess but the frothing up clarifies the rest by and by the product will be run out hard true metal  youre an optimist  harding laughed  im talking at random its a weakness of mine  beatrice sat silent a moment looking out over the stretch of brown furrows  do you intend to continue the breaking to where your partner is at work she asked putting her thoughts into words  im going farther back you can see our guidepoles on the top of the last ridge  but isnt it rash to sow so much unless you have a reserve to carry you over a bad harvest suppose the summers dry or we get autumn frost  then said harding grimly therell be a disastrous smash ive no reserve im plowing under every cent i havestaking all upon the chances of the weather  but why do you take such a risk doesnt it daunt you  he saw a gleam of sympathetic approval in her eyes she had courage it was in the blood of those who stood for lost causes suddenly swept off his feet he determined to follow the lead she unconsciously had given him  well he said leaning forward on the big plow ill tell you  he paused with a smile for he saw that the position he accidentally had taken was unfortunate he had associated himself with the machine which in a sense materialized the difference between her people and him he did not change his position instead one hand moved caressingly over the clumsy plow while he spoke  one gets easily nothing thats worth having it must be worked and schemed and fought for i took the risk for you  beatrice started and an indignant flush suffused her face she was alarmed and angry and yet the shock she felt was not surprise he had once given her a plain warning and she had continued to see him her traditions took arms against him old prejudices revived and her pride was wounded but something in her turned traitor and she felt a strange responsive thrill  you do not know what you are saying she said haughtily rising from the toolbox and turning toward a spot of bare ground where the dog was digging energetically here banff then obeying some impulse which she did not understand she added to harding you scarcely know anything about me  when i met you that night at the river and saw your face in the moonlight i knew all that was needful  the answer moved the girl she wondered whether one could fall in love that way but she must end the interview and escape from an embarrassing position  i am sorry our acquaintance has led to this i would have prevented it if i could she said and now goodafternoon  harding straightened up and one hand clenched  stop were going to thrash this matter out  his manner was commanding and beatrice waited although she was not used to obeying  you were angry at first he said you are rather angry now but i did you no wrong  i admit that but i wish this hadnt happened it has spoiled everything  then you liked me as a friend  yes beatrice answered hesitatingly ill be frank you are different from the men i know  then what have you against me as a lover character person manners or opinions  she was silent a moment feeling that she ought to go away in staying she was trifling with danger but after all he had a right to be heard  oh i know your peoples point of view he went on but i think it is not altogether yours in one respect theyre wrong my mother was the daughter of a bush pioneer and in all thats most important im her son but my father belonged to your own rank he was brought up as an english gentleman ill show you the evidence i have of this some day though it makes no difference  it must make a difference beatrice insisted with a surprised look  it can make none for some reason his relatives cast him off and declined to claim me i dont know why and i shall never trouble to find out i tell you this because i think you ought to know it is as craig harding the prairie farmer that i stand or fall my own faults and merits are the only things that count  its a bold claim you make  well he said so far ive been clearing the ground the sure foundation is the bedrock of human nature and we must settle this as man and woman i know what you are i knew when i first saw you and i want you i need you beatrice my love is great enough to master any doubt you may have and to hold you safe from all harm then if all goes well i can give you what you wish and put you where you want to be the woman i marry will have a wider influence than the wife of any man at allenwood a small matter in the real scale of things but with so much against me i must urge all i can he paused and stretched out his hands you are not afraid beatrice it is not too great a venture for you  she stood still with a tense expression struggling against something that drew her toward him prudence training and prejudice urged her to resist and yet she was on the point of yielding  i am afraid she said only one thing could justify such a risk  thats true its what encourages me you couldnt have made me love you as i do unless you were able to give love in return  she was silent knowing that what he said was true  he took a step nearer her and his own face was tense  if you can declare you care nothing at all for me that it would cause you no regret if you never saw me again ill make the best fight i can with my trouble and leave you alone for good you will answer honestly  the color swept into her face for she felt compelled to speak the naked truth  i cant go so far as that she said in a low voice i should feel regret  then the rest will follow why do you hesitate  she smiled for the matter was too serious for trivial embarrassment and she knew the man would force her to deal frankly with plain issues  you seem so sure  i am of myself  the difficulty is that im not an isolated individual but a member of a family and belong to a race that has its code of rules i must think of the shock to my parents and my friends all the pain that any rash act of mine might give to others they may be wrong but what they think i feel in a halfinstinctive way that reasoning cant change i should have to stand upon defense against my subconscious self  i know he said gently but the choice is one that many have to make one must often stand alone its true that i have all to gain and you all to risk but beatrice  he broke off and held out both hands appealingly to her  beatrice  the girl was deeply stirred she had not expected him to plead like this in her world one took things for granted and implied instead of asserting them at allenwood he was spoken of as a rude materialistic iconoclast but she had found him a reckless idealist although he made her feel that instead of being impractical he was dealing with stern realities she would have made the great adventure only that she was not sure of her own heart yet the consequences were too serious for one to risk a mistake  she stood motionless her eyes veiled by her dark lashes and he knew the struggle that was going on within her in his own eyes there was a great yearning but a birthright of the pioneer is patience  im afraid you ask too much she said at last if you like you may think i am not brave enough she raised her eyes to his and winced at the pain she saw there but she went on bravely had things been different i might perhaps have married you but i think our ways are separate and now you must let me go and not speak of this again  he bowed and it struck beatrice that there was a great dignity in his bearing  very well he answered gravely i will not trouble you again unless in one way or another you give me permission  she turned away and he stood still until long after she and the dog had disappeared in the bluff then he roused himself with a laugh  i wont get her this way he said half aloud and picked up some of the fittings of the pump  beatrice went straight to her mother for there was strong confidence between the two  so you refused him mrs mowbray said after listening silently while beatrice was telling her of the interview did you find it hard  yes she answered slowly harder than i thought but it was the only way  if you felt that dear it certainly was so  beatrice looked up in surprise but her mothers face was quietly thoughtful  you cant mean that i did not do right  no theres a heavy penalty for leaving the circle you were born in and breaking caste it would have hurt me to see you suffer as you must have done only the very brave can take that risk  the girl was puzzled her mother agreed with her and yet she had faintly reflected hardings ideas  well beatrice said i shrink from telling father  im not sure that he need know it would disturb him and he might do something that we should regret on the whole i think you had better visit our friends in toronto as you were asked they would be glad to have you for the summer  do you wish me to run away beatrice asked in surprise  it might be better for both harding is not one of us but i think he feels things deeply and his is a stubborn nature in a sense it is your duty to make it as easy as you can for him  beatrice looked at her mother curiously  you seem more concerned about mr harding than i expected  he gave your brother his coat in the blizzard and saved his life mrs mowbray answered that counts for something  the girl hesitated a moment  well ill go to toronto she promised     chapter xiv  a bold scheme   one morning a week or two after his meeting with beatrice harding drove his rattling engine across the plowed land his face was sooty his overalls were stained with grease and now and then a shower of cinders fell about his head behind him devine stood in the midst of a dustcloud regulating the bite of the harrows that tossed about the hard dry clods it was good weather for preparing the seedbed and the men had been busy since sunrise making the most of it spring comes suddenly in the northwest the summer is hot but short and the grain must be sown early if it is to escape the autumn frost  when they reached the edge of the breaking harding stopped the engine and taking a spanner from a box turned to look about the blue sky was flecked with fleecy clouds driving fast before the western breeze the grass had turned a vivid green and was checkered by clusters of crimson lilies the ducks and geese had gone but small birds of glossy black plumage with yellow bars on their wings fluttered round the harrows  looks promising harding said the season has begun well thats fortunate for we have lots to do id go on all night if there was a moon  then im glad there isnt devine replied i want some sleep but this joltings surely rough on the machine i wasnt sure that new locomotive type would work shes too heavy to bang across the furrows with her boiler on board  shell last until i get my money back which is all i want the ropehaulage pattern has its drawbacks but the machine were using wont be on the market long theyll do away with furnace and boiler and drive by gasoline or oil id thought of trying that but they havent got the engine quite right yet  you look ahead devine commented  i have to i must make this farm pay now if youll clear the harrows ill tighten these brasses up  he set to work but while he adjusted the loose bearing devine announced in a whisper  heres the colonel  harding saw mowbray riding toward them and went on with his task beatrice had no doubt told her mother about his proposal and he could imagine the colonels anger if he had heard of it pulling up his horse near the harrows mowbray sat silent watching harding fastidiously neat in dress with long riding gloves and a spotless gray hat he formed a marked contrast to the big greasy man sprinkled with soot from the engine  i regret mr harding that after the service you did my son i should come with a complaint when i visit you  well let the service go ill answer the complaint as far as i can  very well i was disagreeably surprised to learn that you have persuaded my friends to take a course which the majority of our council decided against and to which it is well known that i object  harding felt relieved mowbray did not seem to know of what he had said to beatrice and his grievance did not require very delicate handling harding was too proud to conciliate him and as he could expect nothing but uncompromising opposition he saw no necessity for forbearance  the majority was one a casting vote he said if you are referring to my plowing for some of your people i did not persuade them they saw the advantage of mechanical traction and asked me to bring the engine over  the explanation doesnt take us far its obvious that they couldnt have experimented without your help  i hardly think thats so there are dealers in winnipeg and toronto who would be glad to sell them the machines if three or four combined they could keep an engine busy and the cost wouldnt be prohibitive  our people are not mechanics mowbray said haughtily  im not sure thats a matter for congratulation harding answered with a smile but i never drove a steamplow until a few weeks ago and there seems to be no reason why your friends shouldnt learn you dont claim that theyre less intelligent than i am  your talents run in this direction mowbray retorted with a polished sneer  in a way thats fortunate when youre farming for a profit you want to be able to do a little of everything some of the allenwood boys are pretty good horsebreakers and you approve why managing an engine should be objectionable isnt very plain  it is not my intention to argue these matters with you  then what is it you want me to do  to be content with using these machines on your own land i must ask you to leave allenwood alone  im afraid you ask too much harding replied i cant break off the arrangements now without a loss to your friends and myself and i see no reason why i should do so  do you consider it gentlemanly conduct to prompt men who acknowledge me as their leader to thwart my wishes  hardly so where you have a clear right to forbid anything that might be hurtful to the settlement id be sorry to interfere  mowbrays eyes glinted  do you presume to judge between my people and me  oh no harding answered with good humor thats not my business but i reserve the right to do whats likely to pay me and to make friends with whom i please whether they belong to allenwood or not  mowbray was silent a moment looking down at him with a frown  then theres nothing more to be said your only standard seems to be what is profitable  mowbray rode away and devine laughed  guess the colonel isnt used to back talk craig if he wasnt quite so hightoned hed go home and throw things about what he wants is somebody to stand right up to him youll have him plumb up against you right along where you look at a thing one way he looks at it another its clean impossible that you should agree  im afraid thats so said harding and now well make a start again  the ribbed wheels bit the clods and the engine lurched clumsily across the furrows with the harrows clattering as they tore through the tangled grass roots and scattered the dry soil harding was violently shaken and devine half smothered by the dust that followed them across the breaking it was not a dainty task and the machine was far from picturesque but they were doing better work than the finest horses at allenwood were capable of the sun grew steadily hotter the lower half of hardings body was scorched by the furnace and the perspiration dripped from his forehead upon his greasy overalls but he held on until noon with the steam gradually going down the boiler was of the watertube type and the water about allenwood was alkaline  she must hold up until supper and ill try to wash her out afterward he said  you were at it half last night devine objected  thats the penalty for using new tools they have their tricks and youve got to learn them i dont find you get much without taking trouble  i believe youre fond of trouble devine answered laughing  they went home together for devine often dined with the hardings they had just finished the meal of salt pork and fried potatoes when there was a rattle of wheels hester was putting the desserthot cakes soaked in molassesand coffee on the table but she went to the door  a stranger in a buggy she announced  harding was surprised to see the winnipeg landagent getting down but he greeted him hospitably  come in and have some dinner he invited  davies entered and bowed to hester  no thanks as i didnt know where id be at noon i brought some lunch along but if it wont trouble miss harding ill take some coffee  he sat down and the men lighted their pipes and hester studied the newcomer as she removed the plates he was smartly dressed and had an alert look but while there was nothing particular in his appearance that she could object to she was not prepossessed in his favor davies had already noticed that the room was of a type common to the prairie homesteads its uncovered floor was perhaps cleaner than usual when plowing was going on and the square stove was brightly polished but the room contained no furniture that was not strictly needed there was nothing that suggested luxury and comfort did not seem to be much studied on the other hand he had noticed outside signs of bold enterprise and a prosperity he had not expected to find davies was a judge of such matters and he saw that his host was a man of practical ability  what brought you into our neighborhood harding asked  davies smiled  im always looking for business and i find it pays to keep an eye on my customers some of them have a trick of lighting out when things go wrong and leaving a few rusty implements to settle their debts financing small farmers isnt always profitable  they cant take their land away devine said i guess you dont often lose much in the end  land exclaimed davies ive money locked up in holdings i cant sell and have to pay big taxes on  youll sell them all right by and by but of course you know that harding replied he gave the landagent a shrewd look you have a call or two to make at allenwood and would rather get there in the afternoon  true the boys might find it embarrassing if i showed up just now theyre willing to do business with me and when theyre in winnipeg theyll take a cigar or play a game of pool but asking me to lunch is a different matter he continued smiling but hester who was watching him closely thought there was something sinister in his amusement as he added they stick to the notions they brought from the old country and i dont know that theyll find them pay  i shouldnt imagine all the business youd get at allenwood would have made a trip from winnipeg worth while harding said  thats so davies agreed as if eager to explain id a call in brandon and wanted to look up some customers in the outlying settlements when i got so far i thought id come on and see how this countrys opening up i notice the boys are doing pretty well  you dont mean at allenwood you havent been there yet  no this is my first trip and i expect it will be my last is there much doing yonder  the lands all right they hauled out some fine wheat last fall stocks better than the usual run and theyve the finest light horses ive seen  thats more in their line than farming davies replied you wouldnt call raising horses a business proposition just now  hester thought the men were fencing trying to learn something about each others real opinions craig looked careless but hester was not deceived she knew him well and saw that he was thinking  prices are certainly low but it strikes me you had better keep out of colonel mowbrays way harding said if he suspected that any of the boys had dealings with you hed make trouble and probably insist upon paying you off  davies looked hard at him he was not prepared to admit that he had lent money at allenwood but he could not tell how much harding knew  one seldom objects to being paid a debt has the colonel much money to spare  i dont know i cant claim to be a friend of his  well it doesnt matter as ive nothing to do with him now that im here ill say that id be glad to accommodate you and your partner if you want to extend your operations or hold on for better prices at any time youre putting in a big crop  thanks i dont think well make a deal devine drawled we dont farm for the benefit of another man when i haul my wheat to the elevators i want the money myself and not to turn it over to somebody else wholl leave me a few pennies to go on with  davies took his leave soon afterward and devine and harding went back to the plow they had some trouble in keeping steam and after a little the heavy engine sank into the soft soil as they crossed a hollow where the melting snow had run the ribbed wheels went in deeper as they crushed down the boggy mold and ground up the fence posts the men thrust under them before long they were embedded to the axle and harding turned off the steam  bring the wagon and drop me off a spade as you pass he said ill dig her out while you drive to the bluff and cut the biggest poplar logs you can find  when devine hurried away he sat down and lighted his pipe until he got the spade there was nothing to be done and much to think about to begin with davies visit had turned his attention upon a matter that had already occupied his thoughts and proved it worth consideration the allenwood homesteads were the best in the country the settlement was fortunately located and its inhabitants were people of intelligence their progress had been retarded by customs and opinions out of place on the prairie but they might go a long way if these were abandoned they were farming on the wrong lines and wasting effort but harding did not think this would continue already some among them were pressing for a change harding was ready to work his big farm alone but he looked to allenwood for help that would benefit all  the matter however had a more important side although beatrice had refused him he did not despair she had shown that she did not regard him with complete indifference it was not his personal character but his position and her fathers hostility that stood in the way and these were obstacles that might be overcome he could expect nothing but the colonels stern opposition and he must carefully arm himself for the fight he did not undervalue the power of his antagonist  devine returned and threw him down a spade and for the next hour harding worked steadily digging a trench to the buried wheels and beating its bottom flat when his comrade came back they lined it with the logs he brought and harding started the engine the machine shook and rattled straining and panting under a full head of steam but the wheels churned furiously in the soil and smashed the ends of the logs they bit upon one big piece shot out of the trench and narrowly missed devine who fell among the harrows when he jumped harding stopped the engine as his friend got up  this wont do he said well cut a log into short billets  they packed some split into sections under the wheels and harding restarted the engine  now he said you can shove the rest in as she grinds them down  the wheels spun splintering the timber rising a few inches and sinking again while the big machine shook and tilted in danger of falling over harding standing on the slippery plates opened the throttle wide and after a while the front rose to a threatening height while the logs groaned and cracked  stand clear he cried shes climbing out  the engine straightened itself with a dangerous lurch rolled forward gathering speed and ran out on to firmer ground they had no further trouble and when dusk settled down and the air grew sharp harding drew the fire and blew the water out of the boiler  after all we have done pretty good work today he said ill come back and tend to those tubes as soon as she cools  they went home together and after supper was finished they sat smoking and talking in the kitchen it was now sharply cold outside but the small room was warm and cheerful with the nickeled lamp lighted and a fire in the polished stove  the mortgage man was trying to play you devine remarked he certainly didnt learn much do you reckon he has been lending money to the allenwood boys  i think its very likely  then with their way of farming and wheat going down they wont be able to pay him off  no and he doesnt want them to pay him off harding answered  you mean he wants their farms  yes hell probably get them unless somebody interferes  ah exclaimed devine whos going to interfere  now you have been thinking of something all afternoon  harding smiled  its possible i may see what i can do he admitted  youre a daisy devine exclaimed it wouldnt surprise me if you thought of buying up the canadian pacific all the same i dont see where youre going to get the money what do you think hester  hester laid down her sewing  isnt it too big a thing craig you have a great deal of land now and even if you get a good harvest youd hardly have money enough to sow another crop and leave enough to carry you over a bad season  harding quietly lighted his pipe and there was silence for a few minutes his sister and her fiancé knew him well and had confidence in his ability he had so far made good but the boldness of this last scheme daunted them  farming has two sides he said presently you want to raise the best and biggest crop you can and then you want to handle your money well thats where many good farmers fail bank your surplus and you get market interest but nothing for your knowledge and experience the money ought to be put into new teams and the latest machines and after that into breaking new land if you make a profit on two hundred acres youll increase it by a third when you break a hundred acres more not to mention what you save by working on a larger scale well i see what could be done with a united allenwood where every man worked jointly with the rest but the settlement needs a head  it has one colonel mowbray is not likely to give up his place hester answered  he may not be able to keep it theres another claimantthis fellow davies and hes not a fool i cant tell you yet whether ill make a third it wants thinking over  the others did not reply they agreed that the matter demanded careful thought after a short silence hester changed the subject  i saw mrs broadwood today and she told me that miss mowbray had gone east for the summer as she had spoken about staying at allenwood all the year mrs broadwood was surprised  harding betrayed his interest by an abrupt movement yet he made no answer on the whole the news was encouraging he would miss beatrice but on the other hand it looked as if she had gone away to avoid him and she would not have done so had she been unmoved by what he said to her he regretted that he had driven her away of course he might be mistaken but there was hope in the suspicion he entertained  well he said after a minute or two ill go along and fix that boiler     chapter xv  harvest home   it was a good summer at allenwood for the june rains were prolonged the mornings broke cool and breezy but as a rule at noon the clouds which had sailed eastward singly began to gather in compact banks then would come a roll of thunder and a deluge that might last an hour after which the prairie lay bright in the sunshine until evening fell the grass rippled across the waste in waves of vivid green with flowers tossing beneath the gusts like wreaths of colored foam wild barley raised its spiky heads along the trails and in the hollows the natural hay grew rank and tall no sand blew from the bare ridges to cut the tender grain which shot up apace and belted the prairie with its darker verdure  harding found full scope for his energies he worked late and early in the fierce july heat he had bought heavy horses because he could not reap by steam and he had to build barns and stables of shiplap lumber then there was prairie hay to cut and after stripping the nearer hollows he must drive far across the plain to seek grass long enough in the sloos where the melted snow had run in the spring this brought him into collision with mowbray who came upon him one morning driving a mower through dusty grass which the colonel had marked down for his own perhaps what annoyed the old man most was to see the american using an extra horse and a knife that would cut a wider swath than any at allenwood he thought this a sign of the grasping spirit of the times  mowbray contended that the grass was his because it had long been cut for use at the grange and harding replied that as the land was unoccupied neither had any prescriptive right and the hay could be harvested by the firstcomer when the colonel grew angry harding yielded the point and suggested that the sloos be mown turn about to this mowbray agreed reluctantly because he saw he could not keep in front of a rival who had with perverse unfairness provided himself with better implements  after the hay was gathered hardings new buildings had to be roofed and when the house grew insufferably hot hester baked and cooked and washed in a leanto shed  in the meanwhile the grain was ripening fast and when the riotous northwest wind began to die away the oats turned lemon and silver and the wheat burnished gold the mornings were now sharply cold and as the green sunset faded the air grew wonderfully bracing  harding and devine had been working steadily for fourteen hours a day but they must nerve themselves for a last tense effort after the great crop had been hauled to the elevators there would be time to rest but until this was done the strain both were feeling must be borne the new binders were got out when the ontario harvesters who had been engaged by hardings agents began to arrive bringing with them a chinese cook western harvesters are generously fed and harding would not have his sister overtaxed  soon after he started his harvest beatrice returned from toronto it was late afternoon when she drew near allenwood she was tired with the long journey but she did not object when lance made a round which would take them past hardings farm he said the longer trail was smoother  the sun hung large and red on the horizon the air was clear and the crimson light raked the great field of grain in the foreground the stooked sheaves standing in long ranks cast blue shadows across the yellow stubble farther back the tall wheat ran it seemed right across the plain shining in the sunset like burnished copper above the crimson on the prairies edge the sky was coldly green  at first it was the magnitude of the field and its glow of color that struck the girl harvest scenes were not new to her and indeed she seldom gazed on one without feeling stirred but she had never seen a harvest like this it filled her with a sense of natures bounty and the fruitfulness of the soil but as her eyes grew accustomed to the glaring light she noticed signs of human activity the splendid crop had not sprung up of itself it was the reward of anxious thought and sturdy labor and she began to appreciate the bold confidence of the man who had planted it  along the wall of wheat moved a row of machines marshaled in regular order and drawn by dusty teams she could see by the raw paint that most of them were new and leaning back in her seat she listened to their rhythmic clink noting their even distance and the precision with which the sheaves they flung aside rose in stooks behind them she saw that there was nothing haphazard here the measured beat of this activity showed the firm control of a master mind no effort was wasted action had its destined result and behind this thought she had a halfconscious recognition of mans working in harmony with natures exact but beneficent laws duly complied with they had covered the waste with grain glancing across it the girl felt a curious thrill the primeval curse had proved a blessing seedtime and harvest had not failed and here paid for by the sweat of earnest effort was an abundance of bread  moved as she was she had a practical as well as an imaginative mind and she noted the difference between hardings and the allenwood methods what he had told her was true her friends could not stand against such forces as he directed  its worth looking at lance remarked i wanted you to see it because hardings being talked about just now i cant explain how he has broken so much ground with the means at his command but its a triumph of organization and ability  i suppose father isnt pleased  lance laughed as he flicked up his horses  that hardly expresses it i rather think he regards our friends industry as a dangerous example but hes most of all surprised he fully expected to see harding ruined  just then one of the binders stopped and its driver raised his hand the machines behind swung round him as they came up and fell into line again while he busied himself with his team a few moments later he mounted a big barebacked clydesdale that came at a clumsy gallop through the stubble and passed on down the trail  its harding said beatrice he must have run out of twine  i dont think so lance answered hardings not the man to run out of anything its more likely a bolt has broken and hes going for another hell have duplicates on hand  beatrice did not wish to appear curious about their neighbor but she asked one or two cautious questions as they drove on  well said lance though our experiments are not exactly popular several of us are trying to copy him in a modest way and im glad i let him do some breaking for me by steam the colonel was disagreeable about it but he admitted my right to do as i liked and the result is that i have a crop partly stooked up that will make it easy to pay harding off and leave me some money in hand  what do you mean by paying harding off beatrice asked sharply  lance looked confused  i didnt intend to mention ityoull keep it to yourself id got into a bit of a mess shortly before i was hurt at the ravine and harding paid up the moneylender id gone to in winnipeg whats more he beat the fellow down so that i only had to account for what i actually got  ah said beatrice now i understand your restlessness when you were ill but on what terms did harding lend you the money  he made only one condition that i wouldnt take another bet until i was free again of course i shall insist on paying him interest hardings a remarkably fine fellow and i mean to stick to him  beatrice felt troubled by the keenness of her gratitude she was fond of lance but she knew his weaknesses and she saw that harding had rendered him a great service moreover she thought lances admiration for the man was justified he had turned the lad out of a path that led through quagmires and set him on firm ground his influence would be for good  lance gave her the news of the settlement and when the lights of the grange shone out through the creeping dark everything else was forgotten in the pleasure of reaching home  three weeks later when the thrasher had gone and the stooked sheaves had vanished leaving only the huge straw wheat bins towering above the stubble harding drove to the grange one evening with hester and devine he had not entered the house for several months and felt diffident about the visit but lance had urged him to come the allenwood harvest home was he said a function which everybody in the neighborhood was expected to attend besides they had been fortunate in getting a clergyman from a distant settlement to take the service and he was worth hearing  the days were shortening rapidly and when the party reached the grange a row of lamps were burning in the hall the moose heads had gone and in their place sheaves of grain adorned the walls between the sheaves were festoons of stiff wheat ears and feathery heads of oats warm bronze interspersed with cadmium and silver and garlands of dry blue flax all had been arranged with taste and the new flag that draped the reading desk made a blotch of vivid crimson among the harmonies of softer color a tall silver lamp behind the desk threw its light on the ruddy folds and harding glancing at it felt a certain admiring thrill that symbol was honored at allenwood standing as it did for great traditions and peace and order and justice had followed it to the west but it was not for nothing that the new country had quartered the beaver of industry on its crimson field  he was shown a place with his companions and mowbray gave him a nod of recognition harding felt that the colonel had proclaimed a truce while they met for thanksgiving lance and several others smiled at him as he quietly looked about in search of beatrice whom he could not see the hall was filled with handsome brownskinned men and there was something fine but in a sense exotic in their bearing and in the faces of the women  all rose respectfully when a young man in white surplice and colored hood came in he had a strong cleancut face and carried himself well but his manner was quietly reverent harding felt that these people from the old country knew how things should be done and he had a curious sense of kinship with them it was as if he were taking part in something familiar though this was the first anglican service he had attended  a man at the rather battered grand piano struck a few chords and harding saw beatrice when the opening hymn began she stood a few yards away but her voice reached him plainly it was he recognized singularly sweet and clear though he knew nothing of the training and study that had developed it he could pick it out from the others and as he listened his lips quivered and a mistiness gathered in his eyes harding was not as a rule particularly imaginative or sensitive but he was capable at times of a strange emotional stirring     the sower went forth sowing     the seed in secret slept  he had heard it sung before and it had meant little to him but now he saw how true it was in a stern practical sense     through weeks of faith and patience  well there was need of both when glaring skies withheld all moisture and withering winds swept the dead gray waste this year however the prairie had blossomed under the genial warmth and rain bounty was the note that the tall green wheat had struck but the voice he loved sang on     within an hallowed acre     he sows yet other grain  the emotion he felt grew keener memories awoke and a line from longfellow ran through his mind her mothers voice singing in paradise he heard the hymn grasping its impressive analogy while he thought of the strong brave patient woman who had upheld his easygoing father at his uncongenial task harding knew now what he owed his mother he had indeed known it long but love had quickened all his senses and given him a clearer vision  when the music stopped he set himself to listen with beatrices face seen now and then in delicate profile he saw that psalm and lesson and collect were chosen well and that the order of these peoples prayers with all its aids of taste and music was not a mere artistic formula it was the embroidered sheath that held the shining sword  harding however was not the only one to feel an emotional quickening for there were those at allenwood whose harvest thanksgiving was poignant with regret it reminded them too keenly of the quiet english countryside where autumn mists crept among the stubble of an ancient church with stained glass windows and memorial brasses to those who bore their name of some wellloved now sleeping beneath the sod after all they were exiles and though they had found a good country the old one called to them  mrs mowbrays face was sad and her husband who sat beside her looked unusually stern  beatrice with all the rich imagery of harvest before her eyes and in her ears was thinking of one great wheatfield and of the man who had reclaimed it from the wilderness she had seen him come in and had noticed that he looked worn his figure was somewhat fined down and his face was thin it was a strong face and an attractive one the character it reflected was wholesome there was nothing about the prairie man to suggest the ascetic yet beatrice vaguely realized that strenuous toil and clean ambition had driven the grosser passions out of him  the clergyman walked to the flagdraped pulpit and beatrice tried to collect her wandering thoughts as he read out the text she started for it seemed strangely apposite        he that soweth little shall reap little but he that       soweth plenteously shall reap plenteously  she suspected him of no desire to attack the customs of his congregation for he must be ignorant of the line they took at allenwood but his words were edged with biting truth at first he spoke of the great lonely land they had entered a land that was destined to become one of the worlds granaries and better still a home for the outcast and the poor they the pioneers had a special duty and a privilegeto break the way for the host that should come after them and of them was demanded honest service to sow plenteously to be faithful in the minor thingschoosing the wheat that ripened early and escaped the frost filling the seeder with an open hand sparing no effort and practising good husbandry and withal blazing the trail by marks of high endeavor so that all who followed it could see  then he spoke of the fruitful season and the yield of splendid grain the soil had returned them in full measure what they had sown and he pleaded that of this bounty they should give what they could spare in the old country which they loved there were many poor and now in time of stagnant trade the cities heard the cry of hungry children there was one institution which sowing with generous recklessness sent none away unfed and he begged that they would give something of their surplus  he stopped and hester looked at harding as the closing hymn began showing him the edge of a dollar in her glove  craig she whispered have you any money  he pressed three bits of paper into her hand and noticing the figures on the margin of one she gave him a surprised glance his face was unusually gentle and there was a smile on it she made a sign of approval and softly doubled up the bills as she joined in the singing  five minutes later the congregation went out into the open air and harding heard mowbray press the clergyman to remain  im sorry but as im to preach at poplar on sunday i must make sandhill lake tonight he answered in fact i must get away at once theres no moon and the trail is bad  he climbed into his rig and harding knowing there was a twentymile journey before him with a dangerous ford on the way watched him drive off into the dark with a feeling of admiration when he next heard about the man it was that he had been found in winter returning from a distant indian reservation snowblind and starving with hands and feet frozen  while harding was looking for hester mrs mowbray came up to him  you must stay with the others for our supper and dance she said i have made your sister promise i think we can sink all differences tonight  harding smiled  i cant refuse somehow i feel that the differences arent so great as i once supposed  perhaps thats true mrs mowbray answered thoughtfully though i dare say you and my husband must disagree about the means you use you have after all a good deal in common ones object is the most important thing  she left him as kenwyne came up and went to speak to one of her neighbors  mowbray had called beatrice into his study  count this for me he said giving her a brass tray filled with paper currency and silver coin i promised id send it to the bank and i may as well make out the form before i lock the money up  he went away to get a pen and on coming back he looked surprised when beatrice told him the amount  there must be a mistake he said we have never collected so much before  ive counted it twice beatrice indicated three bills though i think everybody was generous these perhaps explain the difference  consecutive numbers and all fresh from the same person obviously mowbray said and put down the bills bad taste on my part and in a way a breach of confidence but you had seen them and i was surprised then he counted and sealed up the money  the supper was served in a big wooden barn which was afterward cleared for dancing and it was some time before harding had an opportunity for speaking to beatrice she could not avoid him all the evening and she did not wish to do so but she was glad that he met her without embarrassment  ive learned that you got lance out of trouble she said after they had talked a while one way and another hes deeply in your debt  did he tell you harding asked with a slight frown  no that is it slipped out and i took advantage of the indiscretion beatrice looked at him steadily it has made a difference to the boy i imagine he was at a dangerous turning and you set him straight  you must tell nobody else  do you always try to hide your good deeds  i cant claim that theyre numerous harding answered with a smile anyway i had a selfish motive on this occasion you see i enjoy beating a mortgage man  beatrice knew the explanation was inadequate but she was grateful for his reserve he was very generous as she had another proof for she knew who had given the three large bills which had surprised her father there was however nothing more to be said and she chatted about indifferent matters until she was called away  before the gathering broke up harding found himself seated in a corner of the big hall talking quietly to mrs mowbray she was interested in his farming plans and the changes he wanted made and she listened carefully noting how his schemes revealed his character now and then she asked a question and he was surprised at her quick understanding moreover he felt that he had her sympathy so far as she could loyally give it when at length he went away mrs mowbray sat alone for some minutes quietly thinking she could find no opening for hostile criticism the honesty of the mans motives and his obvious ability appealed to her     chapter xvi  the bridge   there had been rain since harvest and the ground was soft when harding and his comrade stood beside their smoking teams on the slope of the ravine pale sunshine streamed down between the leafless trees glistening upon the pools and wet wheelruts that marked the winding trail the grade was steep and the tornup surface was badly adapted for heavy loads harding frowned as he glanced at the double span of foulcoated horses harnessed to a wagon filled with bags of grain they were powerful willing animals and it jarred on him to overdrive them as he had been forced to do besides except for the steep ascent he could have taken his load to the elevators with a single team  i hate to abuse good horses but we must get up he said when he had recovered breath watch out the wagon doesnt run back when we make a start  devine drove a birch log behind the wheels and then ran to the leaders heads and cracked his whip while harding called to the poleteam for a few moments the battering hoofs churned up the sloppy trail and the wagon groaned and shook the horses floundering and slipping without moving it then with a harsh creak the high wheels began to turn and they slowly struggled up the hill harness rattled chain and clevis rang the steam from the toiling animals rose in a thin cloud and white smears streaked their coats as they strained at the collar the men were red in face and panting hard but as they fought the grade they broke into breathless shouts harding was sparing of the whip but this was not a time to be weakly merciful when the load might overpower his teams and running back drag them over the edge nor dare he stop again and subject the animals to the cruel effort of restarting they must get up somehow before their strength gave out  running with hand upon the bridle and splashing in the pools he rushed the horses at the last ascent and then threw himself down with labored breath in the grass  this wont do he panted after a few moments well have to put up five or six bags less and you can figure how many extra loads that will make before we empty the bins then i hate to keep a man and team standing by here when they could be hauling another load  its one of the things a prairie farmer runs up against devine remarked  just so when they cant be put right you have got to make the best of them but this grade can be altered  it might devine agreed with a doubtful air do you think you can persuade the colonel to join you  no but its my duty to try when you have helped frank up you can take the extra team and haul in the cordwood ill be back from the railroad about dark tomorrow  in the meanwhile kenwyne broadwood and lance mowbray stood among the trees about three miles farther down the ravine looking at the trail to allenwood which led along its edge near it the ground fell sharply to the creek but the slope was regular and small trees blazed with the ax at intervals marked a smooth descending line on the opposite side a gully offered an approach to the prairie at an easy gradient  we must have the bridge here but it isnt a job we can manage without assistance said kenwyne i dont want to be disrespectful lance but i hope your father enjoyed his lunch  lance grinned  as a matter of fact he did but unfortunately he read the paper afterwards and the market report seemed to upset him to make things worse i rashly mentioned that it bore out hardings prognostications in consequence i expect youll need all the tact youve got  i wish harding had a little more broadwood remarked i can be meek when its for the good of the settlement but our friends too blunt  if hes blunt today therell be trouble lance replied with a chuckle i imagine the colonels in fighting form here he comes  it was in an unusually thoughtful mood that mowbray rode toward them the steady fall in the price of wheat was sufficient to cause him anxiety but he had further grounds for feeling disturbed there was an unsettling influence at work at allenwood plans were being mooted which he thought originated with harding and worse than all he suspected that his household was not altogether with him gerald certainly showed unexpected sense in denouncing the innovations but mowbray had doubts about beatrice who seemed to be cultivating miss hardings acquaintance and even his wife now and then took the part of the offender besides there were so to speak portents of change in the air and mowbray felt that he was being driven where he did not mean to go he blamed harding for this and thought it was time he put a stop to the fellows encroachments for all that he greeted the waiting men pleasantly when he dismounted  the days are getting colder but its a bracing afternoon he said now perhaps wed better walk over the line of the proposed trail  they took him along the side of the ravine and kenwyne stopping now and then drew his attention to a plan he carried  well need about forty feet of log underpinning at this point and youll see that its provided for he said on the next section theres a good deal of soil to move i have an estimate of the number of wagon loads farther on he stopped again from here to the bridge it will come to only a ton for every three or four yards  mowbray studied the plan and some sheets of figures  you seem to have thought the matter out very carefully he commented  it needed close attention said broadwood  mowbray looked at the men keenly  theres a comprehensiveness about these plans and calculations that i did not expect from you he said dryly to tell the truth im somewhat surprised by them  they did not answer this and kenwyne frowned in warning as he saw lances amused expression  the trail would be useful sir broadwood urged  i think so do you feel competent to make it the scheme is bolder than anything of the kind we have undertaken  we couldnt attempt it alone our idea is to ask for a general levy  mowbray nodded for when they improved the roads at allenwood the settlers were called upon to supply labor or money according to the size of their farms  by making an effort we might get the trail cut and the bridge built before the frost stops us kenwyne said we couldnt finish the grading but the snow would give us a pretty good surface for hauling our wheat over the new crossing would save us nearly three miles on the journey to the railroad and we ought to get a good load up the easier incline without doubling the teams  mowbrays suspicions grew  we have not found the longer distance an insurmountable disadvantage so far why should it trouble you so much now  some of us have bigger crops this year broadwood said  do you think this justifies your taxing your neighbors  no broadwood answered incautiously we expect theyll follow our example and have as much grain as we have next season  i see mowbray frowned you are working for a change the system we have followed so far doesnt satisfy you  but you cannot imagine sir that theres any danger to the settlement in our growing better crops  of course not its the taint of commercialism i object to however let me look at those estimates again  they had now nearly reached the top of the hill on the opposite side and mowbray sitting down on a birch log opened the papers the others looked at one another dubiously as they heard a beat of hoofs and a rattle of wheels  i notice no allowance for unexpected difficulties which are bound to crop up mowbray presently remarked the work will as usually happens prove harder than it looks i do not see how you can finish it before the frost comes  we expect to get it done sir kenwyne replied in fact we ventured to ask mr harding who has helped us to work the scheme out to meet you here he will be able to give you any information  ah  looking up mowbray saw harding coming down the trail and the loaded wagon and the fine clydesdale horses standing among the trees the sight angered him harding had not been ruined by his rash experiment as mowbray had honestly believed would happen on the contrary he had prospered and mowbray suspected him of a wish to flaunt his success in the faces of his less fortunate neighbors it was in a very uncompromising mood that he waited for him to speak  if i can get the help i want from allenwood ill engage to cut this trail on the terms of the estimates harding said if extra labor is required ill provide it you can see the advantages colonel mowbray three miles saved on the journey to the elevators besides doing away with the need for using an extra team on the grade youll save a dollar or two a load on a big crop the difference will be striking the trail will pay for itself in one season  i notice that you confine yourself to the monetary point of view said mowbray  i think not there are other advantages but i wont speak of them now id be glad to explain anything about the work  mowbrays face hardened the intruding fellow had insolently declined to talk over any but the material benefits to be expected it looked as if he attached no importance to his opinions and in one respect mowbray was not mistaken harding had ideas of progress mutual help and good fellowship with which he did not expect the colonel to sympathize  i do not propose to ask any questions mowbray said getting up and giving kenwyne the plans i neednt keep you this work will not be undertaken with my sanction  but it cant be undertaken without it broadwood protested  i agree with you on such matters as a general levy i have power of veto and i must warn you that it will be used  harding turned away somewhat red in face and went back up the trail he recovered his good humor however when he started his horses and walked beside them across the withered grass the prairie was bright with sunshine and the wide outlook was cheering faint wavy lines of trees and glistening ponds checkered the great plain there was not a house or trail of smoke on it it was all raw material ready for him and others to make good use of  presently a buggy appeared over a rise and harding felt a thrill of pleasure as he recognized the team and the driver when beatrice reached him she checked the horses  youre going to the elevators with your grain she said how is it you came by the long bluff  i went round by willow gulch in the ravine  then you went to meet kenwyne and broadwood where the new trail is to cross ive heard something about the matter  i did and im afraid i offended colonel mowbray  so he has stopped the undertaking i expected it  no said harding with a halfhumorous air the trail will be made though i wont be able to begin this season  beatrice looked thoughtful  im sorry about this she said it may cause more trouble why cant you leave us alone  im afraid i am meddlesome but its hard to leave things alone when you know they ought to be done  that sounds egotistical are you never mistaken  often but its generally when i get to planning what id like to do  i dont quite understand  it would certainly be egotistical if i bored you with my crude ideas he answered smiling  never mind that i want to know  well he said sometimes you look about to see how you can alter matters and what plans you can make but when theyre made they wont always work its different when you dont have to look  beatrice had a dim perception of what he meant but she would let him explain his point of view interested her though she knew that she ran some risk in leading him into confidential talk  i dont think you have made it very clear yet  i meant that there are times when you see your work ready laid out its there you didnt plan ityou simply cant mistake it then if you go straight ahead and do the best you can you cant go wrong  but when you dont feel sure when you havent the conviction that it is your task  then he said quietly i think its better to sit tight and wait when the time to act comes you certainly will know  beatrice pondered this because it seemed to apply with some force to herself he had once urged her to take a daring course to assert her freedom at the cost of sacrificing much that she valued though she had courage she had shrunk from the venture because she had not the firm conviction that it was justified she felt drawn to harding indeed she had met no other man whom she liked so well but there was much against him and nothing but deep unquestioning love would warrant her marrying him that she felt such love she would not admit it was better to take the advice he had given her and wait this was the easier for her to do because she believed that he had no suspicion of her real feeling for him  after all she said smiling your responsibility ends with yourself i dont see why you should interfere with other people you can farm your land as you think fit without trying to make us copy you  that sounds all right but when you come to think of it youll see that neither of us can stand alone  we got along pretty well before you came  i dont doubt it the trouble is that what was best a few years ago isnt best now i wish i could make your father realize that  does it follow that hes mistaken because he doesnt agree with you  harding laughed  if i were singular in my way of thinking id be more modest but all over the country farmers are getting ready for the change theres a big expansion in the air and your people cant stand out against it  then i suppose well be crushed and well deserve our fate beatrice smiled at him as she started the horses but at least it will not be from lack of advice     chapter xvii  a heavy blow   snow was drifting around the grange before a bitter wind when mowbray sat in his study with a stern anxious face the light of the lamp on his writing table fell upon a blackedged letter that lay beside a bundle of documents the big stove in a corner glowed a dull red and acrid fumes of burning wood escaped as the icy draughts swept in mowbrays hands and feet were very cold but he sat motionless trying to rally his forces after a crushing blow  the sound of music reached him from the hall where some of his younger neighbors were spending the evening and he frowned when an outbreak of laughter followed the close of a song he had left his guests half an hour before when the mounted mailcarrier had called and he could not force himself to rejoin them yet he must have time to recover from the shock he had received since he left the hall he had been trying to think but he had no control of his mind and was conscious of only a numbing sense of grief and disaster  he looked up as his wife came in her movements were generally quiet and when she sat down her expression was calm  i got away as soon as i could she said i am afraid you have had bad news  very bad godfreys dead  mrs mowbray started godfrey barnett was her husbands cousin he had been the managing director of an oldestablished private bank in which mowbrays relatives were interested and the dividend upon some of the shares formed an important part of the colonels income  im very sorry mrs mowbray said softly godfrey was always a favorite of mine but it must have been sudden you did not know that he was ill  her heart sank as she saw her husbands face turn grim the blow had been heavier than she thought  he said something about not being up to his usual form when he last wrote and alan alludes to a cablegram that should have prepared me but i never got it no doubt it was overlooked he mentions that the strain was almost unbearablethe crisis at the officeand the inquest  the inquest  the colonel took up an english newspaper  its all here alan says theres nothing to add ive been trying to understand it but i cant quite realize it yet the paper and the letter came together i suppose he waited a few days thinking he had cabled  the colonel paused and mrs mowbray gave him a sympathetic glance for she knew what his forced calm cost the mowbrays were stern and quiet under strain  well she said  they found godfrey dead with a bottle of some narcotic beside him the doctor gave evidence that he had prescribed the drug it seems godfrey couldnt sleep and his nerves had gone to bits the man was obviously tactful and saved the situation the verdict was that godfrey had accidentally taken too large a dose  ah you dont think  i dare not thinkhe was my cousin mowbray shivered and pulled himself together now for the sequel you havent heard the worst yet if one can call what follows worse  dont tell me give me the paper  he handed her the journal published in an english country town and she read the long account with a feeling of deep pity it appeared that when news of godfreys death spread there had been a run on the bank barnetts business was for the most part local and struggling shopkeepers farmers small professional men and a number of the country gentry hurried to withdraw their money the firstcomers were paid but the bank soon closed its doors then came the inquest and mrs mowbray wondered how the merciful verdict had been procured it was all very harrowing and when she looked up her eyes were wet  he must have known she said it seems heartless to talk about the financial side of the matter but  it must be talked about and its easier than the other i think i know why the bank came down and perhaps im responsible to some extent when one of the big london amalgamations wanted to absorb barnetts godfrey consulted me i told him i wasnt a business man but so far as my opinion went he ought to refuse  why  barnetts was a small conservative bank godfrey knew his customers he was their financial adviser and often their personal friend the bank would take some risk to carry an honest client over bad times it was easy with the farmers after a poor harvest godfrey could give and take he managed a respected firm like a gentleman in short barnetts was human not a mere moneymaking machine  i can imagine that mrs mowbray responded would it have been different if he had joined the amalgamation  very different barnetts would have become a branch office without power of discretion everything would have had to be done on an unchangeable systemthe last penny exacted no mercy shown a client who might fall a day behind ones knowledge of a customer disregarded in favor of a rule about the security he could offer i warned godfrey that so far as my influence could command it every vote that went with the family shares should be cast against the deal although the amalgamation had given him a plain hint that they meant to secure a footing in the neighborhood whether they came to terms with barnetts or not  mrs mowbray thought his advice to his cousin was characteristic of her husband and in a wide sense she agreed with him he was a lover of fair play and individual liberty but the course godfrey had taken was nevertheless rash barnetts was not strong enough to fight a combination which had practically unlimited capital the struggle had no doubt been gallant but the kindly polished gentleman had been disastrously beaten what was worse mrs mowbray suspected that her husband was now leading a similar forlorn hope at allenwood  i suppose it means a serious loss to us she said  thats certain alan has not had time to investigate matters yet but i gather that my relatives do not mean to shirk their responsibility barnetts of course was limited but the name must be saved if possible and the depositors paid i will tell alan that i strongly agree with this  it was rash and perhaps quixotic but it was typical of the man and mrs mowbray did not object  im sorry for you she said caressingly it will hit you very hard  mowbrays face grew gentler  i fear the heaviest burden will fall on your shoulders we shall have to cut down expenses and theres the future well im thankful you have your small jointure things are going hard against me and i feel very old  its unfortunate that my income is only a life interest the boys  gerald must shift for himself he has had more than his share i dont think we need be anxious about lance the boy seems to have a singularly keen scent for money  but beatrice  beatrice said mowbray must make a good match it shouldnt be difficult with her advantages and now i suppose id better go down i think the effect of this disaster must remain a secret between us  he locked up the papers and shortly afterward stood talking to brand in a quiet corner of the hall  if it wouldnt be an intrusion id like to offer you my sympathy sir brand said the mailcarrier brought me a letter from my english steward  thank you it has been a shock did you deal with barnetts  i understand they have handled the estate accounts for many years  then you will be relieved to hear that its probable all the depositors will be paid  brand made a gesture of expostulation but mowbrays mind had taken a sudden turn  so you havent disposed of your english property he commented  brands glance rested on beatrice who was standing near talking to one of the younger men her eyes sparkled with amusement and there was warm color in her face her pose was light and graceful she seemed filled with eager gaiety and brands expression hardened  no he replied in a meaning tone i may want the place some day perhaps id better warn you that i havent given up hope yet in spite of my rebuff  i wish shed taken you mowbray said frankly it would have been a relief to me but i cannot influence her  glancing back at beatrice brand was seized by a fit of passion he was a strong reserved man who had cared little for womenhe had indeed rather despised them now he had fallen in love at fortytwo and had been swept away hitherto he had generally lived up to a simple code of honor but restraints were breaking down he would have the girl whatever it cost him or her he knew the strength of his position it might be necessary to exercise patience but the odds were on his side  this is a matter i must fight out for myself he said in a hard voice and i mean to win  mowbray looked at him in surprise there was something new and overbearing in the mans expression which the colonel resented but he supposed he must make allowances  you have my good wishes he said but you must understand that thats as far as i can go  he moved away and soon afterward brand joined beatrice  i must congratulate you on your cheerfulness he smiled you seem to cast a ray of brightness about the place tonight it drew me being of a cold nature i felt id like to bask in the genial warmth  beatrice laughed  that sounds stilted one doesnt expect such compliments from you  no brand said with a direct glance im old and sober but you dont know what im capable of when im stirred  im not sure that im curious to tell the truth it costs me rather an effort to be gay tonight somehow theres a feeling of trouble in the air  brand thought she had no knowledge of her fathers misfortuneit was unlikely that mowbray would tell her but she was clever enough to see the other troubles that threatened the grange in common with most of the homesteads at allenwood  so you face it with a laugh he said its a gallant spirit but i dare say the boys make it easier for you trouble doesnt seem to touch them  he looked about the hall noting the careless bearing of the handsome lighthearted young men and the three or four attractive girls their laughter was gay their voices had a spirited ring and the room was filled with warmth and brightness yet he felt the presence of an ominous shadow this afforded him a certain gloomy satisfaction the meanness of which he recognized he knew that he could not win the girl he desired by his personal merits but the troubles he thought were coming might give him his opportunity  beatrice was presently glad of an excuse for dismissing him and when the others had gone she went to her father who was standing moodily by the hearth  you dont look well tonight she said  im not ill  then youre anxious  i must confess that i have something to think about  i know said beatrice things look black just now with the wheat market falling  what do you know about the market mowbray asked in surprise  i read the newspapers and hear the boys talk theyre brave and take it carelessly but one feels  mowbray gave her a keen glance  well what do you feel  that id like to help you in any way i can so far ive taken all you have given me and done nothing in return  you can help he answered slowly it would ease my mind if you married brand  oh she exclaimed not that im sorry but its impossible  he made a gesture of resignation  well i cant force you  beatrice was silent a moment  its hard to refuse the only big thing you have ever asked she said hesitatingly i really want to help and i feel humiliated when i see how little i can do mrs broadwood and hester harding can manage a farm broadwood says he only began to make money after he married she paused seeing mowbrays frown and went on with a forced smile however i can at least cease to be an expense i have cost you a great deal one way and another and now you must give me nothing more  im afraid i may have to cut down your allowance he answered gloomily  thats one thing i can save you she looked at him with diffident eagerness ive been thinking a good deal lately and i see that if wheat keeps getting cheaper it may be serious for us all couldnt we take precautions  what kind of precautions  oh i cant tell you thati dont know enough about farming but perhaps we could make some changes and economies break more land for example  if we lose on what we have broken already how shall we economize by plowing more  it sounds logical but cant you save labor and reduce the average expense by working on a large scale  perhaps but it needs capital  a few new horses and bigger plows wouldnt cost very much we are spending a good deal of money on other things that are not directly useful  mowbray looked at her with an ironical smile and beatrice felt confused she remembered that she had staunchly defended her fathers conservative attitude to harding and now she was persuading him to abandon it  this is a new line for you to take he said i should like to know what has suggested it has mrs broadwood converted you or have you been talking to the americans  i meet mr harding now and then and he generally talks about farming  i suppose you cant avoid the fellow altogether but politeness is all that is required he has a habit of exaggerating the importance of things and he can only look at them from his point of view  beatrice felt guilty her father had not forbidden her speaking to the man he trusted her to remember what was due to her station she could imagine his anger were he to suspect that she had allowed harding to make love to her  kenwyne and broadwood seem to agree with him she urged  theyre rank pessimists you mustnt listen to them try to be as economical as you can but leave these matters alone you dont understand them  she went to her room feeling downcast she had failed to influence him but it was partly her fault that she had been unable to do so she had wasted her time in idle amusements and now she must take the consequences nobody except harding would listen when she wished to talk about things that mattered she felt ashamed of her ignorance and of her utter helplessness but perhaps she might learn she would ask hester harding to teach her     chapter xviii  covering his trail   it was bitterly cold in the logwalled room at the back of the settlement store where gerald mowbray sat by the redhot stove his deerskin jacket and moccasins were much the worse for wear and his face was thin and darkened by the glare of the snow for the past month he had been traveling with a survey party through the rugged forestbelt of northern ontario living in the open in arctic weather until the expedition had fallen back on the lonely settlement to get fresh supplies  all round the rude logshacks small ragged pines battered by the wind and blackened here and there by fire rose from the deep snow that softened the harsh contour of the rocky wilderness this is one of the coldest parts of canada the conifers that roll across it are generally too small for milling and its penetration is remarkably difficult but a silver vein accounted for the presence of a few hardbitten miners occasionally they ran some risk of starving when fresh snow delayed the transport of provisions and it was only at irregular intervals that a mail reached them an indian mailcarrier had however arrived shortly before the survey party and gerald had a letter in his hand and a montreal newspaper lay beside him the letter troubled him he was thankful to be left alone for a few minutes for he had much to think about  hardship and fatigue had no attractions for him but he had grown tired of the monotony of his life at the grange and as qualified surveyors were not plentiful in the wilds the authorities had been glad to obtain the services of an engineer officer though he was only an assistant the pay was good and he had thought it wise to place himself out of his creditors reach unfortunately some of the more persistent had learned where he had gone and the letter contained a curt demand for the settlement of an account gerald could not pay it but the newspaper brought a ray of hope he had speculated with part of the money his father had once given him to pay his debts and the mining shares he bought had turned out worthless now however they were unexpectedly going up it seemed that the company had at last tapped a vein of promising ore if he could hold out he might be able to liquidate his most pressing debts but this creditors demand was peremptory and he could not see how he was to gain time he wished the men whose harsh voices reached him from the store would stop talking they were rough choppers of whose society he had grown very tired and the taciturn surveyor was not a much better companion  the surveyor came in before gerald found a solution of his difficulties he was a big gaunt man throwing off his ragged furs he sat down in a broken chair and lighted his pipe  thermometers at minus fifty but we must pull out at sunup he remarked now as i have to run my cornerline as ordered and the grub weve been able to get wont last long i cant take all the boys and hunt for that belt of farming land  supposititious isnt it gerald suggested weve seen nothing to indicate there being any soil up here that one could get a plowshare into still the authorities have rather liberal ideas of what could be called cultivatable land  thats so the surveyor agreed where i was raised they used to say that a bushman can get a crop wherever he can fire the seed among the rocks with a shotgun anyway the breeds and the indians talk about a good strip of alluvial bottom and weve got to find out something about it before we go back  it will be difficult to haul the stores and camp truck if you divide the gang  sure but heres my plan the surveyor opened a rather sketchy map i take the sleds and follow the two sides of the triangle ill give you the base and two packers marching light by compass youll join me where the baseline meets the side but youll do no prospecting survey unless you strike the alluvial bottom  what about provisions  you can carry enough to see you through the cache i made in advance is within a few marches of where we meet  it was not a task that appealed to gerald it would be necessary to cross a trackless wilderness which only a few of the hudson bay halfbreeds knew anything about he must sleep in the snow with an insufficient camp outfit and live on cutdown rations with the risk of starving if anything delayed him because the weight he could transport without a sledge was limited  he would have refused to undertake the journey only that a halfformed plan flashed into his mind  suppose i miss you he suggested  well said the surveyor dryly that might mean trouble you should get there first but i cant stop long if youre late because weve got to make the railroad while the grub holds out anyhow i could leave you rations for two or three marches in a cache and by hustling you should catch up  gerald agreed to this and soon afterward he went to sleep on the floor it was early in the evening but he knew that the next eight or nine days work would try him hard  it was dark when the storekeeper wakened him and after a hasty breakfast he went out with the surveyor dawn was breaking and there was an ashy grayness in the east but the sky was barred with clouds the black pines were slowly growing into shape against the faint glimmer of the snow the cold was piercing and gerald shivered while the surveyor gave him a few last directions then he slung his heavy pack upon his shoulders and set off down the unpaved street there were lights in the log shacks and once or twice somebody greeted him but after a few minutes the settlement faded behind and he and his companions were alone among the tangled firs no sound but the crunch of snow beneath their big shoes broke the heavy silence the small trees slanting drunkenly were dim and indistinct and the solitude was impressive  geralds lips were firmly set as he pushed ahead theoretically his task was simple he had only to keep a fixed course and he must cut the surveyors line of march but in practise there were difficulties it is not easy to travel straight in a rugged country where one is continually forced aside by natural obstacles nor can one correctly allow for all the divergences this however was not what troubled gerald for the plan he had worked out since the previous night did not include his meeting the surveyor it was the smallness of the quantity of provisions his party could transport that he was anxious about because he meant to make a much longer march than his superior had directed  his companions were strong stolid bushmen whose business it was to carry the provisions and camp outfit they knew nothing about trigonometry but they were at home in the wilds and gerald was glad the weather threatened to prove cloudy he did not want them to check his course by the sun properly it was northwest and he marched in that direction until it was unlikely that anybody from the settlement would strike his trail then he headed two points farther west and seeing that the packers made no remark presently diverged another point  traveling was comparatively easy all day wind and fire had thinned the bush cleaning out dead trees and undergrowth and the snow lay smooth upon the outcropping rock here and there they struck a frozen creek which offered a level road and when dark came they had made an excellent march gerald was glad of this because all the food he could save now would be badly needed before the journey was finished for all that he felt anxious as he sat beside the campfire after his frugal supper  a bank of snow kept off the stinging wind there was fortunately no lack of fuel and sitting close to the pile of snapping branches the men were fairly warm but the dark pines were wailing mournfully and thick gloom encroached upon the narrow ring of light the eddying smoke leaped out of it and vanished with startling suddenness geralds shoulders ached from the weight of his pack and the back of one leg was sore he must be careful of it because he had a long way to go and men were sometimes lamed by snowshoe trouble  the two packers sat for the most part smoking silently gerald now and then gave them a pleasant word but he did not wish their relations to become friendly as it was not advisable that they should ask him questions about the march indeed he shrank from thinking of it as he listened to the savage wind in the pinetops and glanced at the surrounding darkness the wilderness is daunting in winter even to those who know it best but gerald with his gamblers instincts was willing to take a risk if he went home with the surveyor ruin awaited him  for a time he sat drowsily enjoying the rest and warmth and then lying down on a layer of sprucetwigs he went to sleep but the cold wakened him one of the packers got up grumbling and threw more branches on the fire and gerald went to sleep again  starting shortly before daylight they were met by blinding snow but they struggled on all day across a rocky elevation the snow clogged their eyelashes and lashed their tingling cheeks until the pain was nearly unbearable still that was better than feeling them sink into dangerous insensibility they must go on while progress was possible the loss of a day or two might prove fatal and there was a chance of their getting worse weather  it overtook them two days later when they sat shivering in camp with the snow flying past their heads and an icy blizzard snapping rotten branches from the buffeted trees twigs hurtled about their ears the woods was filled with a roar like the sea the smoke was blinding to lee of the fire and its heat could hardly reach them a yard to windward gerald drank a quart of nearly boiling black tea but he could not keep warm there was no feeling in his feet and his hands were too numbed to button his ragged coat which had fallen open when he tried to smoke his pipe was frozen and as he crouched beneath the snowbank he wondered dully whether he should change his plans and face the worst his creditors could do  by altering his course northerly when he resumed the march he might still strike the surveyors line but after another day or two it would be too late still he thought of his fathers fury and the shares that were bound to rise if he were disowned he must fall back upon surveying for a livelihood it was unthinkable that he should spend the winter in the icy wilds and the summer in portaging canoes over rocky hills and dragging the measuring chain through mosquito haunted bush he could not see how he was to avoid exposure when davies claimed his loan but something might turn up and he was sanguine enough to be content if he could put off the day of reckoning  the blizzard continued the next morning and no one could leave camp indeed gerald imagined that death would have struck down the strongest of them in an hour but the wind fell at night and when dawn broke they set out again in arctic frost one could make good progress in the calm air though the glitter was blinding when the sun climbed the cloudless sky as they followed a winding stream then a lake offered a smooth path and they had made a good march when dark fell  in the night it grew cloudy and the temperature rose and when they started at daybreak they were hindered by loose fresh snow at noon they stopped exhausted after covering a few miles and the next day the going was not much better for they were forced to flounder through a tangle of blowndown trees it was only here and there that the pines and spruces could find sufficient moisture among the rocks and they died and fell across each other in a dry summer  on the seventh day after leaving the settlement the three men plodded wearily through thin forest as the gloomy evening closed in their shoulders were sore from the packstraps the backs of their legs ached with swinging the big snowshoes and all were hungry and moody provisions were getting low and they had been compelled to cut down rations now the cold was arctic and a lowering steelgray sky showed between the whitened tops of the trees the packers had been anxiously looking for blazemarks all afternoon and gerald knowing they would not find them felt his courage sink he was numb with cold and he dully wondered whether he had taken too great a risk  presently one of the men who had been searching some distance to the right joined his comrade they spoke together and then turned back to meet gerald  say boss isnt it time we struck the boys tracks one asked  yes said gerald recognizing that much depended on how he handled the situation we should have picked them up this morning  the men were silent for a moment  looks as if wed got off our line one of them then said resolutely how were you heading  northwest magnetic  no sir you were a piece to the west of that  you think so  the man laughed harshly  sure i was raised among the timber guess ive broken too many trails not to know where im going  well said gerald in a confidential tone i didnt mention it before because i didnt want to make you uneasy but im afraid this compass is unreliable it hasnt been swiveling as it ought oil frozen on the cap perhaps or the card warped against the glass i tried to adjust it once or twice but my fingers were too cold he held it out awkwardly for them to examine and it dropped from his mittens clutching at it he lost his balance and crushed the compass beneath the wooden bow of his shoe  then he stepped back with an exclamation and the packer dropping on his knees groped in the snow until he brought out the compass with its case badly bent  youve fixed her for good this time theres an old log where she fell he said and he and his comrade waited in gloomy silence while gerald watched them  they did not suspect him the thing had passed for an accident but gerald felt daunted by the deadly cold and silence of the bush his companions faces were indistinct and their figures had lost their sharpness they looked shaggy and scarcely human in their ragged skincoats  one of the packers suddenly threw down his load  were going to camp right here and talk this thing out he said and taking off his net shoe began to scrape up the snow  half an hour later they sat beside a snapping fire eating morsels of salt pork and flinty bannocks out of a fryingpan with a black pannikin of tea between them the smoke went straight up now and then a mass of snow fell from the bending needles with a soft thud though there was scarcely a breath of wind  i reckon weve been going about westnorthwest since we left the settlement one of the men said to gerald where does that put you  some way to the south of where i meant to be twenty degrees off our line is a big angle you can see how it lengthens the base weve been working along while mccarthy makes his two sides that means weve lost most of our advantage in cutting across the corner then we were held up once or twice and well probably be behind instead of ahead of him at the intersection of the lines tell me the distances you think we have made  after some argument they agreed upon them and gerald drew a rude triangle in the snow though its base stopped short of joining one side  if youre right about course and distance our positions somewhere here he said indicating the end of the broken line  this placed the responsibility for any mistake upon his companions but one of them had a suggestion  if we head a few points north well certainly cut mccarthys track  yes but wed be behind him and he cant wait  then if we stick to the line were on well join  if we run it far enough but well have to go a long way first its difficult to catch a man whos marching as fast as you are when you have to converge at a small angle upon his track  this was obvious as they looked at the diagram  what are you going to do about it one of the packers asked  gerald hesitated because his plan might daunt them moreover he must be careful not to rouse their suspicion  we want food first of all and well have to sacrifice a day or two in finding the cache to do so well cut mccarthys line this wont be hard if hes blazed it  youll follow him after you find the grub  no said gerald i dont think so he cant leave us much and wed probably use it all before we caught him up the best thing we can do is to strike nearly north for the hudson bay post we might get there before the food runs out  there was silence for a few moments and he waited for the others to speak for he had carefully ascertained the position of the factory before he left the settlement if they missed the remote outpost or did not get there soon enough they could not escape starvation  well said the first packer i guess thats our only plan but well certainly have to hustle better get to sleep now therell be a moon in the early morning and well pull out then  gerald made a sign of agreement his companions had taken the direction of affairs into their own hands and he was glad to leave it to them it relieved him of responsibility and they were not likely to blunder where error would be fatal when they reached the factory he must find an excuse for remaining until mccarthy arrived at the settlements and reported the party missing it would be mentioned in the papers a relief expedition might be despatched and geralds creditors would wait until the uncertainty about his fate was dissipated he meant to delay his reappearance as long as possible but he knew there was a possibility of its never being made one took many chances in the frozen north     chapter xix  the blizzard   six weeks had passed since gerald broke his compass with head lowered against the driving snow he plodded slowly across the plain behind a team of exhausted dogs a hudson bay halfbreed lashed the animals for the sledge was running heavily and with the provisions all consumed the party must reach shelter before night there was no wood in the empty waste the men were savage with hunger and a merciless wind drove the snow into their faces though scarcely able to drag himself along gerald pushed the back of the sledge and the two packers followed each carrying a heavy bundle of skins to ease the load upon the dogs the white men had tried to persuade their guide to make a cache of his freight but he had refused he had served the hudson bay from his youth in the grim desolation of the north and he proudly stated that he had never lost a skin gerald finding argument useless would have tried a bribe only unfortunately he had nothing to offer  he had reached the factory scarcely able to walk from snowshoe lameness and one of the packers had a frozen foot the scottish agent who was short of stores had not welcomed them effusively it was however impossible to turn them away he promised them shelter but he declined to supply them with provisions to continue their journey they might stay he said though they must put up with meager fare and when fresh stores arrived from the railroad he would see what could be done  the delay suited gerald he limped contentedly about the rude loghouse for some time but when he and the packer recovered they found that they were expected to take part in the work of the post when the weather permitted gerald was despatched long distances with a halfbreed to collect skins from the indian trappers and when snowladen gales screamed about the loghouse and it might have been fatal to venture out of sight of it he was employed in hauling cordwood from the clearing  at last some dogteams arrived with stores and the agent seizing the opportunity of sending out a load of furs gave his guests just food enough to carry them to the settlements and let them go with a halfbreed the journey proved arduous for during most of it they struggled through tangled forest filled with fallen pines and when at length they reached the plains an icy wind met them in the teeth now however they were near the end and gerald stumbling along pinched with the bitter cold speculated dully about the news awaiting him  his creditors could have done nothing until they learned what had become of him that was something gained and there was a probability of his being able to pay them off the shares he owned were going up there would be developments when the new shaft tapped the main body of the ore the tip he had got from a safe quarter when he made the purchase was to be trusted after all mining companies were not run solely for the benefit of outside investors and the directors were no doubt waiting for an opportune moment for taking the public into their confidence about their longdelayed success the last newspaper gerald had read however indicated that some information had leaked out and he hoped that an announcement which would send up the price had been made while he was in the wilds  the lashing snow gained in fury when gerald looked up the dogs were half hidden in the cloud of swirling tossing flakes beyond them lay a narrow strip of livid white dead level unbroken by bush or tuft of grass there was however no boundary to this contracted space for it extended before them as they went on as it had done without a change since the march began at dawn gerald felt that he was making no progress and was with pain and difficulty merely holding his ground the halfbreed struggled forward beside the dogs white from head to foot but gerald could not see the packers and felt incapable of looking for them snow filled his eyes and lashed his numbed cheeks his lips were bleeding and his hands and his feet felt wooden with the icy cold lowering his head against the blast he stumbled on pushing the back of the sledge and seeking refuge from bodily suffering in confused thought  after all he had no hope of getting free from debt the most he could expect was to pay off the men who pressed him hardest but that would be enough for a time gerald could not face a crisis boldly he preferred to put off the evil day trusting vaguely in his luck looking back he saw that he might have escaped had he practised some selfdenial and told the truth to his father and his friends instead he had made light of his embarrassments and borrowed from one man to pay another to make things worse he had gambled and speculated with part of the borrowed sums in the hope that success would enable him to meet his obligations money had to be found but gerald would not realize that for the man who does not possess it the only safe plan is to work sometimes he won but more often he lost and the winnipeg mortgage broker watched his futile struggles knowing that they would only lead him into worse difficulties  then gerald began to wonder whether the halfbreed who had nothing to guide him could find the settlement it seemed impossible that he could steer a straight course across the trackless waste when he could see scarcely fifty yards ahead they might have wandered far off their line though so far as one could judge the savage wind had blown steadily in front it was a question of vital importance but gerald was growing indifferent his brain got numb and his body was losing even the sense of pain the only thing he realized plainly was that he could not keep on his feet much longer  at last when it was getting dark there was a cry from the halfbreed and one of the packers stumbled past he shouted exultantly the dogs swerved off their course and gerald felt the sledge move faster the snow got firm beneath his feet and he knew they had struck a trail it must lead to the settlement which could not be far ahead half an hour later a faint yellow glow appeared the wornout dogs broke into a run dim squares of houses loomed out of the snow and lights blinked here and there they were obviously moving up a street and when they stopped where a blaze of light fell upon them gerald leaned drunkenly upon the sledge the journey was over but he was scarcely capable of the effort that would take him out of the deadly cold  he saw the halfbreed unharnessing the dogs and pulling himself together he struggled up a few steps crossed a veranda with wooden pillars and stumbled into a glaring room it was filled with tobacco smoke and the smell of hot iron and its rank atmosphere was almost unbreathable gerald began to choke and his head swam as he made his way to the nearest chair the place as he vaguely realized was a hotel and the packers had already entered because he heard their voices though he could not see them there was a stove in the middle of the room and a group of men stood about it asking questions some one spoke to him but he did not understand what the fellow said reeling across the room he grasped the chair and fell into it heavily  exhausted as he was it was some time before he recovered from the shock caused by the change of temperature some one helped him to throw off his furs which were getting wet and to free him of his big snowshoes his sensations were acutely painful but his head was getting clear and after a while he followed a man into a colder room where food was set before him he ate greedily and feeling better afterward he went back to the other room and asked for a newspaper  he turned to the financial reports but he could not see the print well for he was still somewhat dizzy and the light was trying the figures danced before him in a blur and when he found his shares mentioned it cost him some trouble to make out the price then he let the paper drop and sat still for some minutes with a sense of confused indignation the shares had gone up but only a few points the rogues in the ring were keeping information back until weak holders were forced to sell it was a swindle on the public and what was more it meant ruin to him the shares would be taken from him before they rose because he could not hope to hide his return from his creditors  the safe arrival of his party would soon be reported in the newspapers and to disappear again would result in his being regarded as a defaulter and a statement of his debts being sent to the grange he had borne all the hardship and danger for nothing he was no nearer escaping from his troubles than he had been when he broke his compass in the wilds  there was however one hope left he must see davies in winnipeg the fellow was clever and might think of something particularly as it was to his interest to keep gerald on his feet he thought he could count on davies support until the loan on mortgage fell due his thoughts carried him no farther he was dazed by fatigue and the shock of disappointment  after vacantly smoking for a while gerald went off to bed his room was singularly comfortless but a hot iron pipe ran through it and it struck him as luxurious by contrast with the camps in the snowy waste ten minutes after he lay down he was sound asleep  the snow had stopped the next morning and reaching the railroad after a long and very cold drive he arrived in winnipeg the following day and went straight to davies office  the broker looked up with a curious expression as gerald came in  this is a surprise he said we thought you were lost in the timber belt  it ought to be a relief gerald answered sitting down  davies looked amused  oh so far as my business interests go it doesnt make much difference i have good security for what you owe me  but i suspect youre not quite ready to prove your claim to my farm  for a few moments davies studied geralds face he wondered how much he knew about his plans concerning allenwood and what was more important whether he might try to thwart them young mowbray was not a fool and these people from the old country had a strong sense of caste they stood by one another and were capable of making some sacrifice to protect their common interests against an outsider if mowbray had such feelings he would need careful handling but davies was more inclined to think him a degenerate who placed his own safety before any other consideration  i dont want to prove it yet it will be time enough when the mortgage falls due but what has this to do with things  the trouble is that you may not be able to wait said gerald coolly if you will read this letter you will understand though im not sure it will be a surprise to you  he gave davies the letter demanding payment of his debt and the broker saw that he was shrewder than he thought as a matter of fact davies had been in communication with the other creditors  well he remarked you certainly seem to be awkwardly fixed  i am but i suspect the situations as awkward for you this leads me to think youll see the necessity for helping me out of the hole if these fellows come down on me their first move will be to try to seize my land and youll have to produce your mortgage this will make trouble at allenwood  davies pondered though he had long been scheming for a hold on allenwood his position was not very strong yet he had spent a good deal of money over his plans and although he was sure of getting it back if he were forced into premature action he would fail in the object he aimed at it might accordingly be worth while to spend a further sum on the other hand money was getting scarce with him wheat was falling trade was slack and land in which he had invested his capital was difficult to sell still it was undesirable to spoil a promising scheme for the sake of avoiding a moderate risk  i understand your fathers unable to pay the debt for you he said  yes hed probably disown me if he heard of it i dont expect this to interest you but some of his neighbors have money and when they saw the settlement was threatened theyd raise a fund to buy you out you might of course make them wait but if they were ready to find the cash youd have to give up your mortgages when they fell due  if these men are so rich why dont you ask them to lend you the money  because ive bled them as much as they will stand and theyd think the matter serious enough to hold a council about this would have the result ive just indicated i think you see now that you had better help me to settle my most pressing claims  davies regarded him with a grim smile  it strikes me that your talents were wasted in the army you might have made your mark in my business if youd gone into it before you took to betting thats your weak spot a gambler never makes good  perhaps but what about the loan  your name wouldnt be worth five cents on paper said davies dryly however if you could get somebody with means to endorse it i might be able to discount it for you the rate would be high  men who wouldnt lend me money would be shy of giving me their signature  thats so but theres the chance that they might not be called upon to make good youll have to persuade them that things are sure to change for the better in say three months can you do so i must have a solid man  gerald sat quiet for a while with knitted brows he had been frank with davies because frankness would serve him best but he understood that the fellow wanted the signature of one of the allenwood farmers because this would strengthen his grasp on the settlement gerald saw ruin and disgrace ahead but by taking a worse risk than any he had yet run he might put off the disaster for three months procrastination and a curious belief that things could not come to the very worst were his besetting weaknesses he shrank from the consequences that might result but he could see no other way of escape and he looked up with a strained expression  all right i will get you a name that you can take i shall have to go to allenwood  davies had been watching him keenly  very well he said sign this and look in again when you have got your friends signature  three days later gerald was back in the brokers office  can you negotiate it now he asked nervously producing the paper  yes said davies the names good enough i know harding  after deducting a high rate of interest he gave gerald the money and then locked the note away with a look of great satisfaction  hardings name was forged and davies knew it     chapter xx  a severe test   winter ended suddenly as it generally does on the plains and rain and sunshine melted the snow from the withered grass then the northwest wind awoke and rioting across the wide levels dried the spongy sod while goose and crane and duck beating their northward way sailed down on tired wings to rest a while among the sloos for a week or two when no team could have hauled a load over the boggy trails harding was busy mending harness and getting ready his implements the machines were numerous and expensive but he had been forced to put off their adjustment because it is risky to handle cold iron in the canadian frost he had been unusually silent and preoccupied of late but hester knowing his habits asked no questions when he was ready craig would tell her what was in his mind and in the meantime she had matters of her own to think about all the work that could be done went forward with regular precision and in spite of hardings reserve there was mutual confidence between the two hester was quietly happy but she was conscious of some regret  in a few more months she must leave her brothers house and transfer to another the care and thought she had given him she knew he would miss her and now and then she wondered anxiously whether any other woman could understand and help him as she had done craig had faults and he needed indulging  then too he sometimes gave people a wrong impression she had heard him called hard although in reality generous and often compassionate his clear understanding of practical things made him impatient of incompetence and stupidity he needed a wider outlook and more toleration for people who could not see what was luminously plain to him life was not such a simple matter with cleancut rules and duties as craig supposed grasping its main issues firmly he did not perceive that they merged into one another through a fine gradation of varying tones and shades  rather late one night hester sat sewing while harding was busy at his writing table his pipe which had gone out lying upon the papers he had left the homestead before it was light that morning to set his steamplow to work though nobody at allenwood had taken a team from the stable yet devine had told her of the trouble they had encountered how the soft soil clogged the moldboards and the wheels sank and the coulters crashed against patches of unthawed ground this however had not stopped harding there was work to be done and he must get about it in the best way he could at supper time he came home in very greasy overalls looking tired but as soon as the meal was finished he took out some papers and now at last he laid down his pen and sat with knitted brows and clenched hand  come back craig hester called softly  he started threw the papers into a drawer and looked at his watch  i thought id give them half an hour and ive been all evening he said feeling for his pipe now well have a talk i told fred to order all the dressed lumber he wanted and id meet the bill the house he thought of putting up wasnt half big enough in a year or two hed have had to build again then we want the stuff to season and theres no time to lose if its to be ready for you when the harvests in  hester blushed prettily  you have given us a good deal already craig we would have been satisfied with the smaller homestead  shucks returned harding i dont give what i cant afford you and fred have helped to put me where i am and id have felt mean if i hadnt given you a good start off when im going to spend money recklessly on another plan now that all i need for the summers paid for ive been doing some figuring  ah you think of buying some of the allenwood land  yes he said gravely it will be a strain but nows the time when the falling markets will scare off buyers i hate to see things go to pieces and they want a man to show them how the settlement should be run they have to choose between me and the mortgage broker it will cost me a tough fight to beat him but i think i see my way  but what about colonel mowbray  hes the trouble i surely dont know what to do with him but i guess hell have to be satisfied with moral authority i might leave him that  hester felt sorry for the colonel he was autocratic and arbitrary his ways were obsolete and he had no place in a land that was beginning to throb with modern activity she saw the pathetic side of his position and after all the man was of a finer type than the feverish money makers his ideals were high though his way of realizing them was out of date  craig she said it may be better for allenwood that you should take control but youre running a big risk and somehow your plan looks rather pitiless youre not really hard  she paused and harding smiled  im as i was made and to watch allenwood going to ruin is more than i can stand for it would be worse to let the moneylender sell it out to small farmers under a new mortgage and grind them down until they and the land were starved broadwood and one or two more will help me all they can but they havent the money or the grip to run the place alone  and you feel that you can do it well perhaps you can but it sounds rash you are very sure of yourself craig  how can i explain he said with a half amused half puzzled air the feelings not vanity i have a conviction that this is my job and now that i begin to see my way i have to put it through im not swaggering about my abilitiesthere are smarter men in many ways at allenwood my strong point is this i can see how things are going and feel the drift of forces i didnt set in motion and cant control all i do is to fall into line and let them carry me forward instead of standing against the stream the world demands a higher standard of economical efficiency in using the best tools and the latest methods im obeying the call  what was it that first fixed your thoughts on allenwood she asked  beatrice mowbray im going to marry her if i make good  you have no doubts about that either  oh yes i have plenty i know what im up against but human natures strongest in the end she likes me as a man  hester understood him she was to marry a man of her own station which would save her many perplexities but craig respecting no standard but personal merit would have married above or beneath him with equal boldness it was not because he was ambitious but because he loved her that he had chosen beatrice mowbray yet hester was anxious on his account  its a big risk she said the girl is dainty and fastidious theres nothing coarse in you but you have no outward polish perhaps the tastes you have inherited may make things easier  well sometimes i have a curious feeling about these allenwood people i seem to understand them i find myself talking as they do there was something kenwyne said the other night about an english custom and i seemed to know all about it though id never heard of the thing before  he got up and knocked out his pipe  all that doesnt matter he said whimsically whats important now is that its late and i must have steam up on the plow by daybreak  for the next week harding was very busy and then coming back to the house one afternoon for some enginepacking he found beatrice alone in their plain livingroom she noticed the quick gleam of pleasure in his eyes and was conscious of a response to it but she was very calm as she explained that hester had gone to saddle a horse on which she meant to ride with her to mrs broadwoods  that should give us ten minutes harding said theres something i once promised to show you and i may not have a better chance  unlocking a drawer he took out a small rosewood box finely inlaid  this was my fathers hester has never seen it i found it among his things  it is beautiful  harding opened the box and handed her a photograph  that is my mother he said  beatrice studied it with interest the face was of peasant type with irregular features and a worn look beatrice thought the woman could not have been beautiful and must have led a laborious life but she was struck by the strength and patience the face expressed  harding next took out a small prayerbook in a finely tooled binding of faded leather and gave it to her open the first leaf bore a date and a line of writing in delicate slanted letters to basil from his mother  my fathers name was basil harding explained and taking up another photograph he placed it with its back beside the inscription in the book it was autographed janet harding  i imagine it was sent to him with the book perhaps when he was at school harding resumed you will note that the hand is the same  this was obvious the writing had a distinctive character and beatrice examined the faded portrait carefully it was full length and showed a lady in oldfashioned dress with an unmistakable stamp of dignity and elegance the face had grown very faint but on holding it to the light she thought she could perceive an elusive likeness to hester harding  this lady must have been your grandmother she remarked  yes said harding i have another picture which seems to make the chain complete  he took it from the box and beckoned beatrice to the window before he gave it to her for the photograph was very indistinct still the front of an english country house built in the georgian style could be made out with a few figures on the broad steps to the terrace in the center stood the lady whose portrait beatrice had seen though she was recognizable rather by her figure and fine carriage than her features she had her hand upon the shoulder of a boy in eton dress  that said harding was my father  beatrice signified by a movement of her head that she had heard for she was strongly interested in the background of the picture the wide lawn with its conventionally cut border of shrubbery stretched beyond the oldfashioned house until it ended at the edge of a lake across which rounded masses of trees rolled up the side of a hill all this was familiar it reminded her of summer afternoons in england two or three years ago surely she had walked along that terrace then she could remember the gleaming water the solid dark contour of the beechwood on the hill and the calm beauty of the sunlit landscape that she glimpsed between massive scattered oaks then she started as she distinguished the tower of a church in the faded distance its spires rising among the tall beechtrees  but this is certainly ash garth she cried  i never heard its name harding answered quietly  beatrice sat down with the photograph in her hand her curiosity was strongly roused and she had a half disturbing sense of satisfaction  it looks as if your father had lived there she said  yes i think it must have been his home  but the owner of ash garth is basil morel it is a beautiful place you come down from the bleak moorland into a valley through which a river winds and the house stands among the beechwoods at the foot of the hill  the picture shows something of the kind agreed harding watching her with a reserved smile  beatrice hesitated  perhaps i could find out what became of your fathers people and where they are now  i dont want to know i have shown you these things in confidence id rather not have them talked about  but you must see what they might mean to you beatrice exclaimed in surprise  he moved from the window and stood facing her with an air of pride  they mean nothing at all to me my father was obviously an exile disowned by his english relatives if he had done anything to deserve this i dont want to learn it but i cant think thats so it was more likely a family quarrel anyway im quite content to leave my relatives alone besides i promised something of the kind  he told her about the money he had received and she listened with keen interest  but did he never tell you anything about his english life  no said harding im not sure that my mother knew though hester thinks she meant to tell us something in her last illness my father was a reserved man i think he felt his banishment and it took the heart out of him he was not a good farmer not the stuff the pioneers are made of and i believe he only worked his land for my mothers sake while it was she who really managed things until i grew up she was a brave determined woman and kept him on his feet  beatrice was silent for a few moments the man loved her and although she would not admit that she loved him it was satisfactory to feel that he really belonged to her own rank this explained several traits of his that had puzzled her it was however unfortunate that he held such decided views and she felt impelled to combat them  but you need ask nothing from the people except that they should acknowledge you she urged think of the difference this would make to you and hester it would give you standing and position  hester is going to marry a man who loves her for herself and the only position i value i have made what would i gain by raking up a painful story the only relatives im proud to claim are my mothers in michigan and theyre plain rugged folks  there was something in his attitude that appealed to beatrice he had no false ambitions he was content to be judged on his own meritsa severe test for all that she set some value upon good birth and it was distasteful to see that he denied the advantages of his descent then she grew embarrassed as she recognized that what really troubled her was his indifference to the opinion of her relatives he must know that he had a means of disarming her fathers keenest prejudice but he would not use it  i understand that hester knows nothing about these portraits she said  no ive never mentioned them it could do no good  then why have you told me  well he answered gravely i thought you ought to know  i have no claim upon the secrets you keep from your sister  harding was silent and beatrice felt annoyed after all she understood why he had told her and she recognized that he had acted honestly in doing so still if he really loved her she felt he should not let pride stand in the way of removing every obstacle to get her  hester came in and announced that the horses were ready and soon afterward she and beatrice were riding together across the prairie while harding went doggedly back to his work     chapter xxi  the day of reckoning   as the spring advanced business men in winnipeg and the new western towns began to feel an increasing financial pressure money was tight and the price of wheat upon which the prosperity of the country depended steadily fell it was the beginning of a sharp setback a characteristic feature of the sanguine west during which all overdrafts on the natural resources of the prairie must be met the resources are large but their development is slow depending as it does upon the patient labor of the men who drive the plow while those who live upon the farmer are eager to get rich  the tide of industrial progress is often irregular there are pauses of varying length and sometimes recoils when reckless traders find their ventures stranded and in danger of being wrecked before the next impulse of the flood can float them on they borrow and buy too freely trafficking produce not yet grown building stores and offices in excess of the countrys needs a time comes when this is apparent speculation ceases credit fails and the new cities must wait until expanding agriculture overtakes them in the meanwhile the fulfilment of obligations is demanded and as often happens cannot be made  davies suffered among the rest he had foreseen a setback but it proved more severe than he expected he had bought land he could not sell had cooperated in erecting buildings which stood empty and had made loans to men unable to repay them  one morning he sat in his office gloomily reading a newspaper which made a bold attempt to deal optimistically with the depressing situation among other news there was a report of a meeting of the shareholders in a mining company and this davies studied with interest it was what is termed an extraordinary meeting called to consider the course to be adopted in consequence of the engineers failing to reach the ore after sinking a costly shaft and davies glancing at another column noted that the shares had sharply fallen gerald mowbray had speculated in this stock and davies was then expecting a call from him  instead of mowbray carlyon came in the boy looked anxious but he was calm  i suppose you know what ive come about he began  yes youre behind with your interest  carlyons ease of manner was perhaps overdone but he hid his feelings pluckily  then as i cant pay what are you going to do i must know now when youre farming you have to look ahead  im going to sell you up when the mortgage falls in you have some time yet  cant you renew the loan upon any terms  no said davies truthfully i would if i could i have to meet my engagements and moneys scarce  carlyon got up turning an unlighted cigar in nervous fingers but there was a smile in his eyes that showed he could face ruin with dignity  then if thats your last word i neednt waste your time and it wouldnt be fair to blame you for my foolishness i dare say i can find a job as teamster it seems the only thing thats left  you have grit im sorry i cant keep you on your feet davies answered with more feeling than carlyon had expected  thanks mowbrays waiting outside ill send him in  davies looked up when the door opened a few moments later geralds careless manner had gone he showed obvious signs of strain indeed there was something in his face that hinted at desperation davies was not surprised at this after a curt greeting he took up the newspaper  i expect you have seen the report of the companys meeting  i have said gerald it doesnt leave much to the imagination at last the directors have treated us with brutal frankness ive filled up my proxy in favor of appointing a committee to investigate  it cant do much good the fellows can investigate until theyre tired but they cant find ore that does not exist  it would be some comfort if they found out anything that would put the rogues who deluded us into jail gerald answered savagely  davies smiled in a meaning way  rather too drastic a proceeding he gave the other a direct glance people who play a crooked game shouldnt appeal to the law  the blood crept into geralds face and he wondered with dire misgivings what the man meant and how much he knew he had counted on a report from the mining engineer that would send up the value of his shares and had rested on this his last hope of escaping from a serious danger instead he had learned that the mine was barren it was a crushing blow for he must find a large sum of money at once the consequences would be disastrous if he failed  well he said the most important point is that my shares are worth next to nothing and ive very little expectation of their ever going up i dont suppose youd take them as security for a loan at a quarter of their face value  i would not davies answered firmly  very well my note falls due in a few days what are you going to do  present it for payment  gerald looked at him keenly to see if he meant it but he could read in the brokers imperturbable face nothing to lead him to doubt this he tried to pull himself together and failed gerald had not inherited the stern moral courage of the mowbray stock  you cant afford to let me drop he pleaded in a hoarse voice as soon as you take away your support the brutes ive borrowed from will come down on me like wolves and to protect your interests youll have to enforce your mortgage rights i neednt point out that this will spoil your plans youre not ready to make your grab at allenwood yet  davies heard him unmoved he was comparing his attitude with that of the ruined lad he had just dismissed carlyon was of course a fool who deserved his fate but his pluck had roused the moneylenders sympathy he did not mean to let it make him merciful but he had some human feeling and it inspired him with contempt for mowbray the fellow was clever enough to see that davies plans were directed against his relatives and friends but this had not prevented his falling in with them for the sake of a temporary advantage his pride was a sham he forgot it when it threatened to cost him something moreover he had not been straight with davies in several ways he had a rogues heart but was without the rogues usual nerve  i often have to change my plans davies said calmly just now im short of money and must get some in anyway theres no secret about the mortgage it had to be registered  of course but i dont suppose anybody knows about it for all that people dont spend their time turning up these records  it would be a wise precaution when they dealt with you davies answered pointedly  gerald did not resent the taunt  but you cant get your money for the note he urged its impossible for me to meet it now  or later i guess well ill have to fall back on the endorser hes a solid man  a look of terror sprang into geralds face  you cant do that  why not  well gerald faltered he never expected hed have to pay the note  thats his affair he ought to have known you better  gerald roused himself for a last effort  renew it on any terms you like ill agree to whatever you demand i have some influence at allenwood and can get you other customers youll find it worth while to have my help  davies smiled scornfully  you cant be trusted youd sell your friends and that means youd sell me if you thought it would pay im willing to take a risk when i back a sport but one cant call you that you have had your run and lost and now you must put up the stakes he took a pen from the rack and opened a book there doesnt seem to be anything more to be said goodmorning  gerald left with despair in his heart and when he had gone davies took the note from his safe and examined the signature on the back with a thoughtful air after all though money was tight he might retain his hold on allenwood if he played his cards cleverly  during the afternoon carlyon and gerald took the westbound train and the next evening gerald reached the grange there had been a hard rain all day and he was wet after the long drive but he went straight to the study where his father was occupied it was not dark outside yet but the room was shadowy and heavy rain beat against its walls mowbray sat at a table by the window apparently lost in thought for although there were some papers in front of him the light was too dim to read he glanced up with a frown when his son came in  if you had thought it worth while to let me know you were going to winnipeg i could have given you an errand he said and added dryly one would imagine that these trips are beyond your means  gerald was conscious of some shame and of pity for his father whom he must humble but his fears for his own safety outweighed everything else  i want you to listen sir theres something you must know  very well said mowbray it is not good news your voice tells me that  it was a desperately hard confession and mowbray sat strangely still a rigid shadowy figure against the fading window until the story was finished then he turned to his son who had drawn back as far as possible into the gloom  you cur there was intense bitterness in his tone i cant trust myself to speak of what i feel and i know to my sorrow how little it would affect you but having done this thing why do you slink home to bring disgrace on your mother and sister could you not hide your shame across the frontier  it was a relief to gerald that he could at least answer this  if you will think for a moment sir you will see the reason i dont want to hide here but its plain that for all our sakes i must meet this note if its dishonored the holder will come to you and although i might escape to the boundary you would be forced to find the money gerald hesitated before he added it would be the only way to save the family honor  stop cried mowbray our honor is a subject you have lost all right to speak about  for a moment or two he struggled to preserve his selfcontrol and then went on in a stern cold voice  still there is some reason in what you urge it shows the selfish cunning that has been your ruin  let me finish sir gerald begged hoarsely the note must be met if i take it up on presentation the matter ends there but you can see the consequences if its dishonored  they include your arrest and imprisonment its unthinkable that your mother and sister should be branded with this taint mowbray clenched his hand the trouble is that i cannot find the money you have already brought me to ruin  there was silence for the next minute and the lashing of the rain on the shiplap boards sounded harshly distinct  gerald saw a possible way of escape but desperate as he was he hesitated about taking it it meant sacrificing his sister but the way seemed safe his father would stick at nothing that might save the family honor  theres brand he suggested knowing it was the meanest thing he had ever done of course one would rather not tell an outsider but he can keep a secret and might help  ah mowbray exclaimed sharply as if he saw a ray of hope then he paused and asked with harsh abruptness whose name did you use on the note  hardings  mowbray lost his selfcontrol half rising in his chair he glared at his son  its the last straw he said striking the table furiously how the lowbred fellow will triumph over us  he cant gerald pointed out cunningly using his strongest argument in an appeal to his fathers prejudice he will know nothing about the note if i can take it up when due  mowbray sank back in his chair crushed with shame  it must be managed somehow he said in a faltering voice nowgo and for both of our sakes keep out of my way  gerald left him without a word and mowbray sat alone in the darkness feeling old and broken as he grappled with the bitterest grief he had known there had of course been one or two of the mowbrays who had led wild and reckless lives but gerald was the first to bring actual disgrace upon the respected name the colonel could have borne his extravagance and forgiven a certain amount of dissipation but it humbled him to the dust to realize that his son was a thief and a coward     chapter xxii  the price of honor   it was very quiet in the drawingroom of the grange where mrs mowbray sat with an exhausted look as if she had made an effort that had cost her much she had just finished speaking and was watching beatrice whose face was white and strained  but what has gerald done i think i have a right to know the girl broke out  he wrote somebody elses name on the back of a promise to pay some money which meant that the other man who really knew nothing about it guaranteed that the payment would be made  but that is forgery beatrice cried aghast  yes said mrs mowbray with a shudder im afraid its forgery of a very serious kind because it enabled him to obtain a good deal of money which he could not otherwise have got  oh how dreadful beatrice impulsively crossed the floor and kneeling down beside her mother put her arm round her i know how you must feel it and now i can understand fathers troubled look he has been very quiet and stern since gerald came home  your father has more trouble than you know perhaps id better tell you about it as you must grasp the situation you heard that godfrey barnett was dead but you dont know that he died ruined by the failure of the bank  ah all our money was in barnetts wasnt it  yes said mrs mowbray it has all gone  she stopped in distress the task of influencing the girl to take a course she must shrink from was painful to her but she had promised her husband and must go on with it there was no other way and it was in accordance with her traditions that the threatened honor of the family should come before her daughters inclinations  now you can see why its impossible for your father to save gerald by paying the money it explains why he has been forced to ask help from brand  beatrice drew back from her as if overwhelmed  blow after blow how has he borne it all and yet he is very brave  you are his daughter said mrs mowbray meaningly though she felt that what she was doing was cruel you must be brave too i think you see how you can make things easier for him  oh the girl drew a quick breath then she rose with a hot face burning with fierce rebellion the fault is geralds and he must suffer for it why should i he has always brought us trouble everything has been given up for the sake of the boys dont i know how you have had to deny yourself because of their extravagance its unjust not even my father has the right to ask this sacrifice from me  gerald cannot suffer alone if he is arrested for forgery it will crush your father and be a stain on lances name as long as he lives lance has been very steady since his accident and i dare not think of his being thrown back into his reckless ways then the disgrace will reflect even more seriously on youa girl is condemned for the sins of her relatives i do not speak of myself because the worst that could happen to me was to learn that my son had done this thing  beatrices mood changed suddenly her high color faded and she made a hopeless gesture  its true i feel as if i were in a trap and could not get out its horrible  she sank down again by her mothers side and struggled for composure  let us face the matter quietly she said brand is our friend he cannot be so ungenerous as to ask a price for his help  he is a hard man and very determined  yes i know i have been afraid of him he made me feel he was waiting until his opportunity came but for all that i cant believe  mrs mowbray gave her a glance of compassionate sympathy  even if brand does not claim his reward we know what would persuade him to do us the great service your father must ask can we take this favor from him and then deny him what he longs for there is nobody else who can help us and our need is pressing  but i am not asking the favor beatrice urged in desperation the debt is not mine it would be different if i were in geralds place  you must see that you are using a false argument mrs mowbray answered gently a girl cannot separate herself in this way from her father and brother the family responsibilities are hers it may sound very harsh but you cannot repudiate the liability gerald has incurred when he did wrong he made us all accountable  beatrice could not deny this she had been taught that the family was not a group but a unit and its honor indivisible and she had always been made to feel that it was her duty to reflect credit upon her name it was a comfortable doctrine when things went well when things went wrong however it became very cruel seeing no hope at all she fell into mute despair and it was some time before she could rouse herself at last she got up with a quietly resolute expression  well she said slowly as if it cost her a great effort i must try not to disgrace you by any foolish weakness since this is our debt i must pay it one understands that women have often done such things it seems as if all the burdens were laid on our shouldersand men call us weak she paused a moment and then asked in a dead indifferent voice whose name did gerald forge  i dont know your father didnt tell me i thought he tried to avoid it  moving calmly to the door beatrice was surprised to find gerald waiting in the passage outside she gave him a steady look her face was white and hard and there was scorn in her eyes gerald drew back almost as if she had struck him  you have been talking to mother he asked awkwardly  yes she said and you know what we talked about so far as anything i can do may count you are safe that of course was all you wanted to know  she saw keen relief in his face  after all he urged brand is a very good fellow and has many advantages to offer  she turned upon him with burning indignation  dont be a hypocrite you know it would not have mattered if he had been the meanest rogue in canadaso long as you got free  she swept past him and left him standing in the passage with a downcast air  seeking refuge in her room she locked the door and tried to think she must face the situation and not let futile anger and horror overcome her growing calm after a time she began to wonder why the prospect of marrying brand was so repugnant he belonged to her own station they had much in common and in a way she liked him then she had long known that she would be expected to make a good match and brand had kept his beautiful english house waiting for her his wife would have the position and social influence beatrice had been taught to value but these things seemed worthless now  she looked out through the open window at the prairie it had grown green with the rain though clumps of bleached grass still checkered it with silvery gray red lilies were opening here and there and as she gazed the blue shadow of a cloud swept across the plain and vanished leaving it bright with sunshine its vastness and the sense of freedom it conveyed appealed to the girl there was a charm in the wide horizon one never felt cramped upon the plains she loved the spacious land and did not want to live in england  but this was a deceptive argument brand would stay at allenwood if she wished indeed she knew that he would make many a sacrifice to please her if she married him she must look for a better reason  it was not hard to find for in this crisis she must be honest with herself the blood crept to her face as she realized that she could not marry brand because she loved some one else now that such love was hopeless and must be overcome the disturbing truth was plain she had fenced with and tried to deny it but when it was too late it had beaten her  by way of relief she tried to occupy her mind with another thought her father had been reluctant to tell whose name gerald had forged beatrice knew that her brother would choose a man of wealth otherwise the name would have no weight and she did not think he had fixed on brand her fathers reticence made her feel that it must be harding beatrice thought her father unjust and foolish harding would not take a shabby advantage of his position he was generous but unfortunately no help could come from him she could not tell her lover that her brother was a thief besides this was a secret that must be carefully hidden from everybody outside the family brand she reflected with a shudder of repugnance would soon belong to it there was no help anywhere  beatrice leaned against the windowframe her head buried in her arms the soft air from the prairie swept over her caressingly the hot sunshine bathed her but her heart was black with despondency she was in a trapa trap set by her own brotherand no escape was possible  she threw her head up with a sudden resolve at least she would make the sacrifice bravely without murmur as befitted the daughter of the house of mowbray  her mood changing again as quickly she threw herself across the bed and burst into a fit of passionate sobbing  and while she lay there worn with crying her father sat in his study talking to brand he related with candor what had happened making no attempt to hide the ugliest facts and brand grasped at the opportunity opened for him he recognized that it would give him a strong claim on mowbrays gratitude it might be mean to take advantage of it but he had waited a long time for beatrice and might lose her altogether if he let this chance slip  you have my sympathy sir he said suavely it must have been a great shock but i am glad you have taken me into your confidence because i can be of help you can repay me whenever you find you can do so without trouble  mowbray gave a sigh of great relief  thank you brand you cannot understand how you have eased my mind i know of no one else who would or could have done so much  the colonel sank back in his chair and brand noticed how worn he looked the younger man was conscious of a slight feeling of pity but he could not afford to indulge it he must strike while the iron was hot  now that things are going so hard for you in a financial way it would be some satisfaction to feel that your daughters future was safe he said  mowbray was silent a moment then he answered slowly  yes i wish indeed that she could see her way to marry you  i will speak plainly i have been waiting patiently but so far as i can judge i have gained nothing by this im afraid i may lose all if i wait much longer beatrice likes me we agree on many points our tastes are similar and i think theres every reason to hope she could be happy with me i could give her all that a girl brought up as she has been could desire  do you suggest that i should urge her to marry you mowbray asked with some asperity  brand hesitated he knew that he was doing an unchivalrous thing but the passion he hitherto had kept in check mastered him  well he said i suppose that is what i really meant  mowbray looked at him in haughty surprise  you know i cannot refuse you but i hardly expected you to take this line it might have been better if you had relied upon my gratitude and my daughters recognition of the service you have done us we are not in the habit of forgetting our debts  the trouble is that i cannot afford to take a risk there is some danger of beatrices becoming estranged from me i would not press you if i saw any strong reason why she should not be happy as my wife but i know of none and i feel that this is my last chance  then you mean to insist upon your claim  very reluctantly sir  mowbray was silent for a moment or two and then he looked up with a strained expression  you place me in a helpless position you make me and my family your debtors and then he broke off abruptly did you mean to hint there was some particular danger of my daughters becoming estranged from you  since you force me to be candid i believe she is attracted by another man perhaps i ought to say interested in him i cannot suspect any attachment yet but i am afraid  who is he  brand hesitated a moment before answering  i cannot give you his name because i may be mistaken still he is a man you would strongly disapprove of  there was suspicion in mowbrays eyes and his face hardened  what you hint at surprises me brand but i cannot compliment you upon your conduct tonight however as beatrice is the most interested person it is i think only right that she should be allowed to speak  he rang and the servant who promptly answered was sent for beatrice when the door opened a few moments afterward mowbray was surprised to see not his daughter but the maid  miss mowbray is ill she announced and begs you to excuse her  the maid withdrew and mowbray frowned  when must my daughter pay this debt he asked  when is the forged note due  i understand that the winnipeg fellow will bring it to me here on friday night  then there are two days yet i will leave miss mowbray free until friday night in the meantime i shall expect you to use your influence with her he hesitated a moment feeling that he might not be taking the right line i must urge you again sir to consider he finished that it will be only for your daughters good in every way to marry me  when he left mowbray sat motionless in his chair for a long while looking out over the prairie but seeing nothing in front of him then with an effort he roused himself after all he tried to believe it would not be so bad for the girl she was young she might yet learn to love brand even though she married him under compulsion as for harding mowbray dismissed the thought he had no fear that his daughter would so far forget her station the pride of caste had been drilled into her too strongly     chapter xxiii  a woman intervenes   the following afternoon beatrice rode moodily across the plain after another talk with her mother she had passed a sleepless night and spent the morning wandering restlessly to and fro it was horribly degrading to her to feel that brand had bought her but it was true and it destroyed the hope that time might reconcile her to her lot she could not forgive him that but after all it was only part of an intolerable situation  on a long gradual rise her horse began to slacken speed and she pulled up when she reached the top sitting still for a time she vacantly looked about the hill commanded a wide view she could see the prairie roll back changing as it receded from vivid green to faint ethereal blue on the far horizon white clouds swept across the sky streaking the plain with shadows there was something exhilarating in the picture but beatrice felt that she hated it for its mocking suggestion of space and freedom there was no freedom at allenwood she was to be sold into shameful bondage  a gray streak of smoke that moved across the waste caught her eye it was harding harrowing by steam or perhaps bedding down his seedwheat with the landpacker beatrice thought of him with a poignant sense of regret he loved her and she had deceived herself in thinking she could not love him she had been bound by foolish traditions and had not had the courage to break loose it was too late now and she must pay the penalty of her cowardice she longed to call harding to her help he was strong enough to save her but the family disgrace must be kept secret there was no way out she seemed to be turning round and round in a narrow cage and beating herself vainly against the bars  as she started her horse she saw in the distance the broadwood homestead rising a blur of gray buildings and she rode toward it she needed sympathy and her mother had nothing but resignation to urge effie broadwood was kind and fond of her it would be some comfort to tell her that she was in troublethough of course she could not go into particulars  mrs broadwood at once noticed the girls troubled face and knew that something had gone wrong she led beatrice into her plain little sittingroom and made her comfortable on a sofa then sitting down beside her she took her hand affectionately  now dear she said we can have a quiet talk i know that something is troubling you  beatrice was moved by her unaffected sympathy she had friends at allenwood but she could not go to them they would think her rather to be envied than pitied but this warmhearted unconventional woman would understand she longed to take her into her confidence and although this was impossible the numbing despair in her heart began to melt  i cant tell you much buti suppose i shall be married soon  mrs broadwood looked keenly interested  is it an allenwood man  brand i must tell him definitely tomorrow evening  ah mrs broadwood exclaimed there was a pathetic note in the girls voice that touched her but if you dont want the man you have only to let him know  i wish it were as easy as that beatrice answered hopelessly  mrs broadwood was silent for a few moments but her fingers clasped the small hand under them with a comforting pressure  i think i understand your father and mother are on his side but if youd hate to have him for a husband you must not sacrifice yourself  but i must said beatrice desperately and her forced calm suddenly broke down her companions gentleness had destroyed it and now a reaction from the strain she had borne had begun no she added in a broken voice theres no way out ive been trying to find one and i cant  she buried her face in one of the pillows and broke into choking sobs it was weak she felt and not what was to be expected from a mowbray but there was comfort in the bitter tears for a while mrs broadwood let her cry but when she began to soothe her beatrice roused herself she could not remember afterward what she said but her confused excuses for her emotion and her fragmentary half confidences left a disturbing impression on mrs broadwoods mind  beatrice rode home feeling slightly comforted though she was no nearer a solution of her difficulties she had of course been very weak and perhaps had said more than was wise but she had not betrayed her brother and effie broadwood was a true friend beatrice was justified in thinking so for mrs broadwood was to prove a better friend than she suspected  when the girl had gone mrs broadwood spent some time in thinking over what she had heard although she had keen intelligence there were points that puzzled her she had been given several clues but they broke off before they led her far then she decided that something might be learned by tactfully questioning her husband and she went about her work until he came home in the evening she let him finish his supper and light his pipe before she began  the mowbrays are in trouble just now arent they tom  i dare say they certainly have their difficulties why  beatrice rode over this afternoon and she had something on her mind what do you thinks the matter  for one thing the colonel must have lost a good deal since wheat began to go down then i heard something about the failure of an english bank lance once told me the family had shares in it i expect the stoppage made a difference in their income  that doesnt quite account for it do you know of anything else  gerald may have been giving them trouble again i know he has borrowed a good deal of money which hed find it difficult to pay and im afraid hes been mortgaging his land  this confirmed some of mrs broadwoods suspicions but the matter was still far from clear  the colonel would be very mad about the mortgage she said still its geralds land and he can do what he likes with it  not altogether hes bound by the settlement covenant and as his father gave him the land he ought to respect his opinions mowbrays convinced that to let in strangers would be hurtful to allenwood  while feeling sure that gerald was the cause of the mowbrays troubles mrs broadwood did not think that beatrice would marry a man she did not care for in order to benefit the settlement there must be another reason  suppose gerald had already mortgaged his farm and wanted some more money how would he borrow it  hed find it hard as he has no security to offer broadwood answered with a smile i dont know much about these matters and dont want to know anything more but i believe the usual plan is something like this you give the lender a note an engagement to pay in well say three months and get somebody to endorse it his putting down his name makes him liable for the amount and if the lender was satisfied about him hed give you the money at once and take off as much interest as he could  but whod guarantee gerald in that way  i dont know i certainly would not  he would have to be a man who was known to have money she persisted  i suppose so it would naturally make the transaction easier but its not our business to pry into the mowbrays affairs  oh no said mrs broadwood still i was sorry for beatrice and it made me curious  she changed the subject and after a time took up a book as an excuse for silence she wanted to think because she now felt sure that geralds financial difficulties accounted for the pressure that was being put upon beatrice the girl was being forced to marry brand because he would supply the money to save her brother from disgrace mrs broadwood felt that it must be disgrace and not an ordinary debt there would however be no great difficulty if he had given some one a note for the man who endorsed it must have known that he might be called upon to pay but suppose he had not heard about the transaction at all mrs broadwood dropped her book for she saw that she had guessed the riddle gerald had not asked the man to guarantee him he had forged his name taking this for granted made everything plain  then she began to wonder whose name gerald had forged it could not be his fathers for mowbray was known to be far from rich the only man with much money at allenwood was brand but mrs broadwood thought it could not be brand because she knew mowbrays pride and believed that in spite of his anxiety to keep the matter quiet he would not force his daughter to marry a man his son had robbed admitting this she must look for some one else then it dawned upon her that the man was harding  what did you say broadwood asked looking up from his paper  i was thinking his wife replied spose i must have thought aloud anyway it wouldnt interest you hows wheat going  down said broadwood and there was silence again  mrs broadwood saw what she could do she admitted that she might make a deplorable mess of things if she were mistaken but the need was serious enough to justify some risk she had courage and she was fond of beatrice  the next afternoon she drove across the prairie to the spot where she thought harding was at work she found him busy with his engine at the end of a wide belt of plowing which the land packer had rolled down hard and smooth  craig she called pulling up her horse i want you a minute  he came to the step of the buckboard dressed in greasy overalls with an oil smear on his hand but she felt that he was to be trusted as she gave him an approving glance she liked his level look and his steady eyes there was force in his quiet face he was the type of man she admired swift in action free from what she called meanness and determined indeed she felt inclined to hesitate as she thought of his resolute character it would be easy to set him in motion but once that was done he could not be stopped and there might be startling developments it was rather like firing the train to a mine and there was a disturbing possibility that she might after all be wrong in her surmises  but she gathered up her courage and she knew that there was no time to be wasted  craig she said do you want beatrice mowbray  he started and his brown face flushed  i want her more than anything else in the world  mrs broadwood gave him a quick approving nod  do you know how she feels about you  no i only know what i hope  well said mrs broadwood thoughtfully i believe shed rather take you than brand  brand  i expect shell be engaged to him tonight unless you act mrs broadwood checked him as he was about to speak this is your chance craig youll never get another half as good listen quietly for a few minutes  he stood very still without asking a question until she had finished  i guess youre right he said with set jaws and i know the man who holds the note if beatrice is to give brand her answer tonight it means that davies is coming here to squeeze the colonel and if his trains on time he ought to make the grange in about three hours  and youll be there to meet him  harding smiled  when im wanted i like to be on hand and i guess im wanted pretty badly now  you certainly are i suppose you see what you must do  if theres a note out with my name on it it has got to be taken up you can leave the thing to me i meet my obligations  mrs broadwood saw that he had found a more effective way of dealing with the situation than had yet occurred to her  craig she exclaimed with frank admiration youre a wonder  he held out his hand with a twinkle of rather grim amusement  anyway i have to thank you for putting me on the track and im not going to forget it now i have several matters to fix up before i start for the grange  she touched the horse with the whip and he stepped back  good luck she called you deserve it     chapter xxiv  a great triumph   it was getting dark when brand reached the grange he found beatrice in the hall for she had not heard his arrival in time to get away she met him calmly but after a word of greeting she did not speak and he hesitated  well he said with an effort i have come for your answer  isnt it too soon she asked you havent carried out your part of the bargain yet  brand frowned in embarrassment  you are very bitter but i dare say it must be hard for you to see my conduct in a favorable light  im afraid its impossible  beatrice moved toward the broad stairway  my father is waiting for you in the library she said  taking this for a dismissal brand joined mowbray in his study he was sorry that the lamp was lighted because he felt disturbed and the colonels constrained manner did not set him at ease for all that they forced themselves to talk about matters of no importance until davies was shown in  i came to see your son but i meant to ask for an interview with you before i left the moneylender said to mowbray and then glanced at brand i imagine that our business had better  mr brand is acquainted with it and i prefer him to remain my son has informed me that you hold a note of his no doubt you have brought it with you  you propose to pay it for him  certainly said mowbray with a trace of haughtiness since he was foolish enough to give you such a document it must be met  davies felt surprised but he took out the paper he had not expected it to be met and as he stood with it in his hand hesitating he was strangely irritated by mowbrays smile then he put the note on the table and after examining it mowbray gave it to brand who made a sign indicating that he was satisfied  yes he said it seems to be in order then he turned to davies well keep this paper ill give you a check  presently davies picked up the note when he spoke he addressed mowbray ill give you the note canceled in return for payment of half the amount the rest to stand against a purchase i want to make  you can have it all i have no wish to defer payment and i dont understand what your purchases have to do with me  ill explain one of your young neighbors is giving up his farm he hasnt broken much land and the buildings are small the place ought to go cheap and im open to buy it then theres a section of vacant land and im willing to pay a small sum for an option of taking it up at a fixed price in a years time  mowbray looked at him in cold surprise  to begin with i cannot sell you my neighbors property nor can i give you an option on the vacant lot  in a sense thats true but you can fix things as i want it if you like your word goes a long way in these matters  i see no reason why i should use my influence in your favor  its impossible brand interposed bluntly we are very careful whom we let in at allenwood  in short you mean to keep me out davies suggested with an ugly smile  take it for granted that we cannot sell you the land you want  very well said davies i must try to convince you that you had better indulge me he fingered the note i have not parted with this document yet it seems to me that theres something unusual about mr hardings signature  as a rule both brand and mowbray were capable of selfcontrol but the attack was so unexpected that they showed their alarm it had not occurred to them that the moneylender might suspect the forgery indeed there was terror in the colonels face before he recovered himself and brands grew angrily red  you scoundrel what do you mean he cried  only that im not sure mr harding would know his own writing if i showed it to him  mowbray motioned brand to be silent and for a few moments both sat still feeling overwhelmed brand saw that it was now out of his power to protect his companion and the colonel realized that the sacrifice of his daughter might prove useless he was in the moneylenders hands and to comply with his exactions would not end them the honor of the mowbrays was at the rascals mercy  there was a knock at the door  mr harding a servant announced  i cant see him at present said mowbray with a start as he heard a quick resolute step in the passage  before he finished speaking harding entered  this must look like an intrusion and youll have to excuse my not waiting your leave he said the fact is i was determined to get in  so it seems mowbray answered since you have succeeded may i ask if you came here by this gentlemans request  why no harding looked at davies with a twinkle i guess my turning up is a surprise to him  davies crestfallen air bore this out but he waited silently and for a moment or two neither brand nor mowbray spoke the colonel to his astonishment was conscious of some relief after all he would rather fall into hardings hands than the moneylenders  perhaps you will explain the object of your visit mowbray said when the silence threatened to become awkward  certainly though it ought to be plain mr davies holds a note with my name on it which i understand mr gerald mowbray cannot meet he leaned forward and took the note its due today  baffled rage shone in davies eyes  you admit your liability he cried indignantly  of course my names here i dont go back on my obligations  mowbray looked at him with dull astonishment and brand whose wits were clearer with reluctant admiration he thought the farmer was playing his part well but davies would not give in yet  am i to understand that you acknowledge this as your signature he asked in a calmer tone  do you mean to tell me that you doubted it harding returned you havent the reputation of being a fool would you have lent money on a note you suspected was forged  davies saw the game was up brand was mowbrays friend and harding was an obviously hostile witness unless he were very careful he might lay himself open to a charge of conspiracy and he was powerless to attack mowbray so long as harding acknowledged his signature  well resumed harding taking out his wallet i guess ill keep this paper and give you a check  brand saw his last hope vanishing  stop a minute he interposed youre taking too much for granted in concluding that gerald cannot pay the debt is his in the first place and with the help of a friend he is able to find the money  mowbray looked up with a curious expression in which there was relief and shame though he would have forced his daughter into a marriage she shrank from the necessity for doing so had preyed upon his mind and he seized the chance of freeing himself of his debt to brand he did not stop to reason but acted on the vague feeling that harding whom he had distrusted would prove an easier creditor  gerald cannot pay this note he said firmly  brand turned to him in surprise but he saw that mowbray was not to be moved and he understood what had prompted the colonels sudden change brand had not played a straight game and he had lost at the last moment the prairie man had beaten him all that he could do now was to bear his defeat with dignity  very well sir he answered getting up since i cannot be of service i will leave you to arrange matters with these gentlemen  mowbray went to the door with him and closing it behind them laid his hand on brands arm  you pressed me hard but you were willing to help when i needed it badly i shall remember that with gratitude  i wish you could forget the rest but its too much to hope brand replied and when mowbray went back into the room he walked moodily down the passage  reaching the hall he found beatrice waiting there she had seen davies come in and had heard of hardings arrival and she now wondered with tense anxiety what was going on she could form no conclusion and could not ask gerald because he had carefully kept out of her way looking up at brands step she felt her heart beat with returning hope for his lips were set and his brows knit he had rather the air of a man who had received a heavy blow than that of a rejoicing lover something unexpected had happened to humble him and set her free  well he said with an effort i have lost you still i want you to believe that i loved you  beatrice was trembling from the shock of relief but she knew that it would be cruel to show what she felt  i never doubted that she answered quietly but you took the wrong way  there was no other available now that i have lost perhaps you will forgive me im going to england in a week or two i havent the courage to stay here  im sorry she said but to go away may be best  brand left her and she leaned against the big newelpost and tried to keep calm the thing she dreaded most was not to happen in some miraculous way she was free she wondered with keen anxiety what her father and harding were talking about davies she knew had left the house a few moments after brand  as a matter of fact the moneylender was promptly dismissed with a check for the full amount of the note and when mowbray returned after closing the door behind him harding laid the note on the table  this is yours sir he said with a smile you may destroy it  mine mowbray showed his surprise you meanyou he stumbled over the words you admit your responsibility he finally ended  of course  harding picked up the note tore it across twice and threw the pieces into the open fire  theres an end of that he smiled since it bore my signature i dont know that i have any claim but you can pay me when you like i wont press you  mowbray did not answer for a moment he felt overcome and could not collect his thoughts his prejudices against harding were strong but they were in a sense impersonal it was not the man he objected to but what he stood for the fellows generosity humbled him  im afraid i have done nothing to warrant this great kindness he said awkwardly am i to understand that you offer it to me without conditions asking nothing in return  no not altogether i guess i might choose a better time but i feel that you should know what i want im going to ask a favor i suppose you no longer think of compelling miss mowbray to marry brand  you can take it that i do not but what is this to you  well harding said with a slight unsteadiness in his voice i want to ask you if you will give her to me  mowbray straightened himself in his chair  so you too mean to make terms when you know i cannot refuse  no harding answered shortly i make none if you had insisted on miss mowbrays marrying brand i might have had something to say all i ask is that you give her a free choice if she uses it to take somebody else i wont complain  that is remarkably generous mowbray conceded  well let that go perhaps my request is something of a shock but i want you to hear me out if things go well with me this year i can give my wife every comfort you have at allenwood and she can lead the life she likes bestexcept that i cant leave the prairie then there is nothing that need separate your daughter from you many of her friends are mine theyll welcome me into the settlement i did not go to them they came to me  mowbray knew this was true his own younger son firmly believed in harding kenwyne who had fastidious tastes was his friend there were others mowbray could think of and all were men of character and standing  may i ask how long you have entertained these views about my daughter  since the first time i saw her and that was very soon after i came to this neighborhood i knew as soon as she spoke to me that i would never marry any one else  mowbray studied him he had not suspected harding of romantic tendencies but the man was obviously serious  has she any reason to suspect your feelings he asked  the best of reasons i have told her on more than one occasion still i cant claim that she approves of me  had harding made his proposal earlier it would not have been entertained for a moment but mowbray had suffered during the last few days he had found that it cost him more than he had expected to disregard his daughters inclinations and he shrank from doing so again then he owed much to harding who had behaved with somewhat surprising good taste after all if beatrice were fond of himmowbray stopped here feeling that the matter must be settled at once he determined to confront the girl with harding and learn the truth  i hope to give you an answer in a few minutes he said and left the room  somewhat to his surprise mrs mowbray agreed to his plan and when he went back to his study he and harding waited until beatrice entered she was highly strung but calm though a trace of color crept into her face as she glanced at harding  gerald is safe mowbray told her mr harding who has acted very generously has ensured that now he asks that i should allow you to marry him  beatrice look startled her face grew deadwhite and her expression strained  after what he has learned about us he is very rash but this is not generosity  mowbray stopped harding who would have spoken  i see that i did not make his meaning clear he merely asks that i withdraw my objections and not that i try to influence your decision i am willing to do the former but you must make your choice  beatrice gave harding a swift grateful look  i am sorry i misunderstood i should have known you better she said in a very low voice  then she was silent for a moment with downcast eyes and the two men waited tensely when she looked up her eyes glistened with tears but behind the tears there shone a great happiness  it is not hard to decide she murmured reaching her hand out timidly toward harding  he grasped it eagerly and mowbray forced himself to smile in spite of the colonels prejudices he felt that his daughters quiet confidence in the prairie man was justified  i sincerely wish you well he said he laid one hand on hardings arm and there was a tremor in his voice as he continued we have not agreed on many points but i have learned that you can be trusted i am glad to remember it now  thank you sir said harding i know the value of what you have given me  after a few more words mowbray let them go and when they sat together on the large black settle in a corner of the hall the girl was conscious of a calm tenderness for her lover that was stronger than anything she had yet felt  craig she said softly i wasnt brave enough when you first urged me but the hesitation i then felt has gone and i am ashamed of it i know that i am safe with you  thank you for that he answered and his face grew compassionate but you look very tired and distressed  i am tiredbut im happy a faint flush tinted her cheeks and she smiled shyly the last few days have been very trying craig and when there seemed to be no way out then i knew that i wanted you now i am still half dazed my escape seems so wonderful  i know harding said gently i was sorry for you all it must have been hard for your father but one can see his point of view you must forget about it dear i am starting for winnipeg tomorrow and may be there a week you will have time to get used to things before i come back  you are very considerate and even kinder than i thought  he smiled into her eyes  i am going to leave you now because i feel that i ought to but you know i want to stay  he lifted the hand she gave him and kissed it tenderly then a swift flood surged through him  beatrice he breathed oh beatrice you dont know what it means to me  the little fingers were nearly crushed in his strong grasp but he released them quickly and turned away  goodby dear he said  beatrice let him go but her look was strangely tender and her heart beat fast he had shown a fine unselfishness and a tact that was perhaps remarkable she had no hesitation about him now     chapter xxv  the rebuff   harding spent a busy week in winnipeg carrying out a scheme he had agreed upon with broadwood kenwyne and one or two others though he feared it would again bring him into conflict with colonel mowbray he regretted this but he could not allow it to influence him allenwood in which he now had a strong interest must not be allowed to suffer because of the colonels oldfashioned opinions harding saw what ought to be done and he felt that to leave it undone in order to save himself trouble would be weak and in a sense treacherous to those who now looked to him for a lead he could not act against his convictions he must do what he thought best and take the consequences  the storekeepers and implement dealers in the small settlements had many bad debts and their charges were proportionately high but harding did not see why he and his friends should pay for the defaulters expensive machines were needed and new wheat was being produced which would resist drought and ripen soon enough to escape the autumn frost but local dealers were unable or perhaps too careless to obtain the seed then harding saw that a time was coming when mixed farming produce which he called truck would be in strong demand and it was his custom to anticipate a need kenwyne and the others recognized the desirability of this and had agreed to open a joint agency in winnipeg harding was not sure that the expense could be recouped for a time but he believed the undertaking would pay in the end  after finding a suitable office he called on a number of business men and the flourmillers who were then beginning what was to become the leading industry of the city he wanted to learn their views about the kind of wheat best suited to their use and to enter into direct relations with them on the whole he succeeded better than he had hoped and had now only to appoint an agent two or three suitable men had offered their services and it was difficult to decide  he was thinking over the matter in the newly opened office when gerald came in the mowbray black sheep seemed to feel no embarrassment in meeting him for his manner was inclined to be patronizing sitting down he lighted a cigarette  this is a new venture i dont know that it will meet with general approval at allenwood he remarked  one mustnt expect too much harding answered i guess the people who object now will come round by and by  i wonder how long you think it will be before my father falls into line said gerald with a careless laugh everything considered i rather admire your pluck  harding let this pass it was not a tactful allusion to his engagement to beatrice and he was annoyed by geralds manner he had not expected much gratitude but the fellow did not even seem to realize that harding had saved him from jail  i suppose you know i have been turned out of allenwood gerald resumed  harding admitted that he had been told so  since then ive heard from the government people that theyre not likely to want me for the new survey as a matter of fact im not sorry the last man i went into the woods with was a sour exacting brute  theyve got to be hard it isnt easy to run a line through a rough country  nobody knows that better than i do gerald replied with feeling well ive been here a week and cant find any congenial occupation  you dont look worried about it  gerald laughed  oh im not as a rule despondent and i knew that i could as a last resort fall back on you this explains my call i believe you want an agent to manage your office  hardings expression indicated ironical amusement  do you think what you have just told me is a recommendation for the job  it seems to prove my need of it  but not your suitability im not looking for a man whom nobody else will have  gerald looked at him in astonishment though he had not given the matter much thought he had imagined that harding would be glad to do him a favor for his sisters sake it was something of a shock to be refused and the manner of the refusal was mortifying the fellow was a coarser brute than he had thought but gerald did not mean to let his resentment run away with him  i have a few useful qualifications he said some of the bigger implement dealers and the heads of the milling firms are men of taste and education its possible they might rather deal with me than with a drummer fellow or a raw farmer fresh from the soil  im fresh from the soil but i guess i could run this end of the business harding returned  gerald saw that he had blundered but he did not feel beaten yet  perhaps id better mention that i spoke to kenwyne and broadwood and they were willing that i should have the agency  thats so i have a letter from kenwyne who says hed like to give you a lift but leaves me to decide  then his wishes ought to count you must see that your position at allenwood wont be easy it will need some tact to make it comfortable and your giving me the post would go a long distance in your favor you cant afford to disregard our peoples feelings until youve made your footing good  can i not hardings patience was exhausted have i ever tried to gain your friends favor by indulging any of their crank notions if necessary ill put my plans through in spite of the crowd he checked himself but this has nothing to do with the matter youre not the man i want  may i inquire what kind of a man you do want  first of all one i can trust  gerald colored but he got up with some dignity and moved toward the door  you may regret your decision he said threateningly  harding sat silent until the door closed and then he went over to the window and looked out at the narrow street with a frown he was angry but he did not think he had been too severe it was plain that he might have made things easier for himself by falling in with geralds suggestion the fellow was a favorite at allenwood where his last offense was known only to one or two people harding had no doubt that mowbray would have appreciated his giving his son another chance and beatrice would have thought it generous for all that the business of the settlement could not be done by wastrels and harding felt that he could not secure a personal advantage by a breach of trust  geralds feelings about the matter were far from pleasant returning to his secondclass hotel he endeavored to solace them with a drink before he sat down in the untidy lounge to consider he had been grossly insulted but he persuaded himself that this did not trouble him most the worst was that harding was a coarse lowbred brute and was unfortunately going to marry beatrice gerald had not hesitated about sacrificing his sister to save himself but it was easy for him now to feel that she was making a grave mistake it was perhaps curious that he had preserved a keen sense of family pride and a belief that people of his station must keep up their dignity but he was honest as far as he went he knew that he had by no means lived up to his creed but while some allowances must be made for men this did not apply to women it was essential that they should remember what was due to their birth and rank on no account should a wellbred girl marry beneath her  he went to the bar for another drink and afterward became convinced that beatrices marriage to harding could only end in disaster it must therefore be prevented he could not see how this was to be done but chance might provide a means  in the meanwhile he was confronted by the stern necessity for earning his living taking up a newspaper he studied the advertisements but unfortunately there seemed to be no demand for people with refined tastes and polite accomplishments in canada farm teamsters were wanted and shovel hands for a branch railroad but these occupations did not appeal to gerald a clerk was required at a new hotel well that was more in his line and he set off to interview the proprietor after a few curt questions the man dismissed him and gerald spent the next day or two moodily walking about the town until it occurred to him that he had better see what davies could do the fellow who knew the worst of him owed him something he felt much less bitter against the moneylender who had helped to ruin him than he did against harding whom he had injured  davies was disengaged when gerald entered  so youre up against it he remarked your friends at allenwood have no use for you  it looks like that otherwise i wouldnt have come here  i see theyre opening an office in this city  hardings in charge i dont get on with him  well perhaps thats natural davies was keen enough to notice the rancor in geralds tone he was afraid his plans about allenwood might have to be abandoned but if he were able to go on with them harding would prove his most dangerous opponent  i guess mr harding talked pretty straight to you he suggested  he took an unfair advantage of my position  so you thought youd strike me for a job i guess you know youre not worth much  gerald winced at this but he could not resent it his father had disowned him and except for a surreptitious gift from his mother he had no resources  its plain that i cant insist upon good terms he replied i quite expected you to see it  davies considered he did not suspect mowbray of any fondness for steady work and he thought his services as a clerk would be dear at five dollars a week but the fellow was shrewd and plausible and had what davies called tone wellbroughtup young englishmen and a few americans of the same stamp were coming into manitoba looking for land and mowbray who understood these people might act as a decoy then he knew all about allenwood and this knowledge might be useful later on the whole davies thought he would take the risk of employing him  well he said ill make you an offer  it was not an advantageous one for gerald but after some objections he accepted it and the next day reluctantly set to work his occupation however proved less unpleasant than he had feared and at the end of a few weeks davies thought he had acted wisely mowbray was intelligent and unscrupulous his judgment was good and davies began to take him into his confidence  harding in the meanwhile appointed an agent and went home he hired a horse at the railroad settlement and the first of the allenwood farmsteads were rising above the edge of the plain when a mounted figure appeared near a bluff that the trail skirted the figure was small and distant but it cut sharp against the evening light and hardings heart beat fast as he recognized it touching his horse with the quirt he rode on at a gallop and pulled up near beatrice with an exultant gleam in his eyes  this is very kind he cried  she looked at him shyly with some color in her face  didnt you expect me to meet you how far have you ridden at that furious pace  since i saw you quite a way back the horse wouldnt come fast enough  she smiled at him  if you are not in a great hurry to get home lets walk as far as the ridge she suggested  harding springing down held out his hand and when she slipped from the saddle he caught her in his arms and held her fast while he kissed her beatrice was not demonstrative but he felt her arms tighten about his neck and the soft pressure of her cheek upon his face and it gave him a thrill of triumph now he realized all that he had won  for a long while they did not speak then beatrice freed herself with a soft laugh and they walked on across the prairie but harding would not release one little hand which he clung to as they climbed the trail together  the red sunset burned in front of them with the edge of the plain cutting against it in a hard straight line above the lurid glow the wide arch of sky shone a vivid green and the great sweep of grass ran forward steeped in deepening shades of blue there was something mysteriously impressive in the half light and the riot of color  what a glorious evening beatrice could not help exclaiming i am glad i shall not have to leave the prairie  the crimson flush on the skyline merged into rose and magenta and mauve  it is lighted up in your honor harding said  you have a pretty imagination but i fear the gray days are more in keeping with the life ive led it was often rather dreary at the grange and i felt that i was objectlessdrifting on without a purpose she smiled at harding you cant understand the feeling  no he said all my life ive had too much to do one gets selfcentered through thinking only of ones work it may be better to stop now and then and look about  it depends upon what you see if your surroundings never change you come to know them too well and begin to think that nothing different is possible it makes one narrow we may both need patience craig before we learn to understand each others point of view  harding realized the truth of this they looked at many things differently and there were points on which their convictions were opposed  she gave the strong hand that held hers a slight pressure of caress  i wonder what would have happened if i hadnt been driven out of my way by the grass fire that night she questioned womanlike  nothing would have been different i was bound to meet you sooner or later  she laughed contentedly and they walked on in silence for a while harding felt that he ought to tell her about gerald but he hesitated  tell me what you have been doing in winnipeg she said as if she had divined his thoughts  he explained his business there carefully and beatrice was pleased that he took her interest and comprehension for granted  gerald wanted me to make him our agent and i refused he ended  she was conscious of disappointment though she appreciated his candor  im afraid he will find things hard of course its his own fault but that wont make his difficulties lighter couldnt you have taken the risk of giving him another chance  no said harding i wanted to help him for your sake but i couldnt give him the post you see i was acting for others as well as for myself he hesitated before he added i felt that we must have the best man we could get  and you could get more reliable men than my brother unfortunately its true but the others were willing kenwyne told me so  he looked at her in surprise for there was a faint hardness in her voice  i dont think they quite understood how important the matter is anyway they left it to me and i felt forced to do what seemed best for all  well she said as if puzzled gerald certainly wronged you  that didnt count not the wrong you mean the greatest injury he could have done me would have been in giving you to brand however it was not this but his unfitness for our work that made me refuse him  he had blundered and beatrice felt hurt she could have forgiven him for bitterly resenting geralds attempt to separate them but he seemed to consider that comparatively unimportant there was a hard strain in him perhaps her father had been right in thinking him too deeply imbued with the commercial spirit  he helped her to the saddle and the misunderstanding was forgotten as they rode in confidential talk across the shadowy plain until the lights of the grange twinkled out ahead harding left her at the forking of the trail but he was thoughtful as he trotted home alone he must exercise care and tact in future beatrice was proud and he feared that he had not altogether won her yet     chapter xxvi  drought   the wheat was growing tall and changing to a darker shade when the wind swept through it it undulated like the waves of a vast green sea rippling silver and white where the light played on the bending blades  harding lay among the dusty grass in a dry sloo and hester sat beside him in the blue shadow of the big hay wagon since six oclock that morning harding and devine had been mowing prairie hay they had stopped long enough to eat the lunch hester had brought them and now devine had returned to his work and sat jolting in the drivingseat of a big machine as he guided three powerful horses along the edge of the grass it went down in dry rows ready for gathering before the glistening knife and a haze of dust and a cloud of flies followed the team across the sloo hardings horses stood switching their tails in the sunshine that flooded the plain with a dazzling glare  it was rough on fred that you wouldnt let him finish his pipe harding said  he went obediently hester answered with a smile i wanted to talk to you  i suspected something of the kind but i cant see why you must stop me now  you are away at daybreak and come home late  very well said harding resignedly but ive got to clean up this sloo by dark  then youre not going to the grange you havent been since sunday  beatrice understands that im busy  thats fortunate its not nice to feel neglected cant you take your mind off your farming for a little while craig  its my job whats more sticking to it seems the best way of making things easier for beatrice im an outsider at allenwood and have got to justify my unorthodox notions by success i havent much polish and im not a good talker but i can grow wheatand luckily that comes into the scheme  it may perhaps when are you to be married craig  i dont know beatrice puts it off i had hoped it might be after harvest but nothings settled yet  then you ought to be firm and insist upon fixing the wedding soon  i wish i could but why  because it might be better not to leave beatrice among her friends too long  harding looked surprised  since the colonels given in and geralds gone i dont think there is anybody who would try to turn her against me  no agreed hester her parents would be angry if she broke her engagement now that they have accepted you you can count on their support even if theyre not quite satisfied with the match the trouble is that you and they belong to very different schools theyll try to make the best of you but beatrice will see how hard they find it  hurrying on the wedding wont help much  it might beatrice will try to accept her husbands views and shell probably find it easier than she thinks but at present all she sees and hears will remind her of the changes she will have to make things you do will not seem right some of your ideas will jar then the other women will let her see that they feel sorry for her and think shes throwing herself away shell deny it but it will hurt  perhaps thats true said harding but talking of the wedding raises another question i want a better house and when i build i may as well locate at allenwood  then you are still determined on getting control there  i dont want control but i may have to take it harding answered the settlement will fall to bits if its left alone and i suspect that im the only man who can hold it up im glad you have talked to me what youve said makes it clear that ive not time to lose now however this hay must be cut  he led his team into the grass when hester went away but although he worked hard until dark fell his mind was busy with many things beside the clattering machine  a few days later he had occasion to visit winnipeg and after some talk with his agent there he asked him  do you know how davies is fixed just now jackson  i dont know much about him personally but men in his line of business are feeling the setback theyve bought options on land theres no demand for and cant collect accounts farmers with money seem to have stopped coming in and the small homesteaders are going broke doesnt seem to be any money in the country and credits played out  then it ought to be a good time to pick up land cheap and i want you to find a broker wholl ask davies what hell take for two or three mortgages he holds on allenwood my names not to be mentioned you must get a man who can handle the matter cautiously  i know one but if you dont mind my asking could you put a deal of that kind through  i must said harding it will be a strain but the crops coming on well and i ought to have a surplus after harvest  isnt the dry weather hurting you  not yet we can stand for another week or two if the winds not too bad anyhow you can find out whether davies is inclined to trade  when harding went out into the street he was met by a cloud of swirling dust he wiped the grit from his eyes and brushed it off his clothes with an annoyance that was not accounted for by the slight discomfort it caused him the sun was fiercely hot the glare trying and the plank sidewalks and the fronts of the wooden stores had begun to crack sand and cement from halffinished buildings were blowing down the street and when harding stopped to watch a sprinkler at work on a lawn at the corner of an avenue where frame houses stood among small trees the glistening shower vanished as it fell there were fissures in the hard soil and the grass looked burnt but it was the curious hard brightness of the sky and the way the few white clouds swept across it that gave harding food for thought  the soil of the western prairie freezes deep and thawing slowly retains moisture for the wheat plant for some time but the june rain had been unusually light moreover the plains rise in three or four tablelands as they run toward the rockies and the strength of the northwest wind increases with their elevation it was blowing fresh in the low red river basin but it would be blowing harder farther west where there are broken sandy belts after a period of dry weather the sand drives across the levels with disastrous consequences to any crops in the neighborhood this however was a danger that could not be guarded against  the next day jackson reported about the mortgages  davies was keen on business and offered my man improved preemptions in a dozen different townships he said pressed him to go out and take a look at them but when he heard the buyer wanted an allenwood location he wouldnt trade  what do you gather from that  the thing seems pretty plain and what ive found out since yesterday agrees with my conclusions davies is pressed for money but he means to hold on to allenwood as long as he can a good harvest would help him because hed then be able to get in some money from his customers  a good harvest would help us all but theres not much hope of it unless the weather changes in the meanwhile well let the matter drop because i dont want to give the fellow a hint about my plans  nearing home on the following evening harding pulled up his horse on the edge of the wheat as he saw devine coming to meet him  whats the weather been like he asked getting down from the rig  bad said devine gloomily hot and blowing hard  harding looked about as they crossed a stretch of grass that had turned white and dry the sunset was red and angry but above the horizon the sky was a hard dark blue that threatened wind everything was very still now but the men knew the breeze would rise again soon after daybreak they said nothing for a time after they stopped beside the wheat  the soil was thinly covered with sand and the tall blades had a yellow shriveled look while the stems were bent and limp harding gathered a few and examined them they were scored with fine lines as if they had been cut by a sharp file  not serious yet but the grain wont stand for much more of this  thats so devine agreed the sand hasnt got far in but i guess it will work right through unless we have a change if not therell be trouble for both of us this fall  sure said harding curtly bring the horse fred and well drive on to the rise  they presently alighted where the plain merged into a belt of broken country dotted with clumps of scrub birch and poplar it rolled in ridges and hollows but the harsh grass which thinly covered its surface had shriveled and left bare banks of sand which lay about the slopes in fantastic shapes as they had drifted harding stooped and took up a handful it was hot and felt gritty the broken ground ran on as far as he could see and the short stunted trees looked as if they had been scorched glowing red in the dying sunset the desolate landscape had a strangely sinister effect  the stuffs as hard and sharp as steel he said throwing down the sand theres enough of it to wipe out all the crops between allenwood and the frontier if the drought lasts  what we want is a good big thunderstorm this blamed sandbelts a trouble we never reckoned on  no said harding i took a look at it when i was picking my location but there was plenty of grass and the brush was strong and green guess theyd had more rain the last two or three years i figured out things pretty carefullyand now the only setback i didnt allow for is going to pull me up well we must hope for a change of weather theres nothing else to be done  he turned away with a gloomy face and they walked back to the rig harding had early seen that beatrice would not be an easy prize it was not enough entrancing as it was to dream over her beauty her fastidious daintiness in manners and thought her patrician calm and the shy tenderness she now and then showed for him the passionate thrill her voice and glance brought himspurred him ratherto action first of all he must work and fight for her and he had found a keen pleasure in the struggle one by one he had pulled down the barriers between them but now when victory seemed secure an obstacle he could not overcome had suddenly risen all his strength of mind and body counted for nothing against the weather beatrice could not marry a ruined man it was unthinkable that he should drag her down to the grinding care and drudgery that formed the lot of a broken farmers wife he was helpless and could only wait and hope for rain  when he had finished his work the next evening he drove over to the grange feeling depressed and tired for he had begun at four oclock that morning it was very hot a fiery wind still blew across the plain although the sun had set and beatrice was sitting on the veranda with her mother and mowbray they had a languid air and the prairie which had turned a lifeless gray looked strangely dreary as it ran back into the gathering dark  not much hope of a change mowbray remarked  beatrice gave harding a sympathetic glance and unconsciously he set his lips tight she looked cool and somehow ethereal in her thin white dress and her eyes were gentle it was horrible to think that he might have to give her up but he knew it might come to this  youre tired im afraid you have been working too hard beatrice said gently  the weather accounts for it not the work he answered its depressing to feel that all youve done may lead to nothing  very true mowbray assented youre fortunate if this is the first time you have been troubled by the feeling many of us have got used to it but one must go on  its hard to fight a losing battle sir  it is said mowbray grimly that it really does not matter in the end whether you lose or not so long as youre on the right side doesnt seem to give one much consolation but your crop strikes me as looking better than ours  i plowed deep the subsoil holds the moisture of course with horsetraction  harding hesitated but mowbray smiled  i cant deny that your machines have their advantages the colonel said theyd be useful if you could keep them in their place as servants the danger is that theyll become your masters when you have bought them you must make them pay and that puts you under the yoke of an iron thing that demands to be handled with the sternest economy the balance sheets the only standard it leaves youand you have to make some sacrifices if you mean to come out on the credit side your finer feelings and selfrespect often have to go  im not sure they need go but in a way youre right you must strike a balance or the machines that cost so much will break you for all that its useful as a test the result of bad work shows when you come to the reckoning i cant see that to avoid waste must be demoralizing  it isnt the harm begins when you set too high a value on economical efficiency  harding did not answer and there was silence for a time mrs mowbray had a headache from the heat and beatrice felt limp she noticed the slackness of hardings pose and felt sorry for him he differed from her father and she could not think he was always right but he was honest indeed it was his strong sincerity that had first attracted her she liked his strength and boldness the athletic symmetry of his form had its effect but what struck her most was his freedom from what the canadians contemptuously called meanness beatrice was fastidiously refined in some respects and she thought of him as clean unconsciously she forgave him much for this because he jarred upon her now and then her fathers oldfashioned ideals were touched with a grace that her lover could not even admire but watching him as he sat in the fading light she felt that he was trustworthy  mosquitos began to invade the veranda and mrs mowbray was driven into the house the colonel presently followed her and beatrice leaving her chair cuddled down beside harding on the steps  craig she said youre quiet tonight  this dry weather makes one think and then theres the difference between your father and myself he wants to be just but theres a natural antagonism between us that cant be got over  it isnt personal dear  no said harding were antagonistic types the trouble is that you must often think as he doesand i wouldnt have you different  thats dear of you craig but even if we dont agree always what does it matter i like you because youre so candid and honest you would never hide anything you thought or did from me  they sat there in the gathering gloom an early owl ventured out and hooted from his sheltered treetop a chorus of frogs down in the lake sent back an indignant reply a honeysuckle vine that climbed over the veranda flaunted its perfumed blossoms to the hot night air luring pollenbearers  to harding the worries of the day were for the moment forgotten a great peace filled him and over the girl as she felt his strong arm around her there rested a deep satisfying sense of security and trust     chapter xxvii  the adventuress   before the wheat had suffered serious damage a few thunder showers broke upon the plain and harding and his neighbors took courage the crop was not out of danger indeed a weeks dry weather would undo the good the scanty rain had done but ruin which had seemed imminent was at least delayed then harding got news from his agent that necessitated his return to winnipeg and mrs mowbray and beatrice who wished to visit the millinery stores arranged to accompany him  it was hot and dry when they reached the city but harding was of sanguine temperament and being relieved from fear of immediate disaster proceeded with his plans for the consolidation of allenwood he could not carry them far because even if he secured an abundant harvest which was at present doubtful he would have some difficulty in raising capital enough to outbid his rival acting cautiously with jacksons help however he found two men who had lent davies money and were now frankly alarmed by the general fall in values one indeed was willing to transfer his interest to harding on certain terms which the latter could not accept  he was thinking over these matters one morning when to his surprise he saw brand crossing the street toward him they had not met since the evening of their encounter with davies at the grange and harding was sensible of some constraint brand was a reserved man whom he had neither understood nor liked but he had thought him honorable until he learned the price he had demanded for helping mowbray  there was no embarrassment in brands manner he looked as cool and inscrutable as usual  im rather glad we have met he said  i thought you had gone back to the old country harding replied  no i find it harder to sell my farm than i imagined the settlement covenants the trouble and i dont feel inclined to give the land away i want a talk with you will you come to my hotel  harding agreed and a few minutes later they sat down in a quiet corner of the hotel lounge  hows your campaign against the moneylender progressing brand began abruptly  then you know something about it  im not a fool ive been watching the game with interest for some time i have a reason for asking you can be frank with me  harding knew when to trust a man and in spite of what had happened he trusted brand when he had given him a short explanation brand seemed satisfied  very well now i have something to say my prejudices are against you theyre on mowbrays side but im beginning to see that his position is untenable it seems i cant get a fair price for my farm and after spending some happy years on it i have a sentimental affection for the place dont know that id care to see it fall into the hands of some raw english lad whose inexperience would be a danger to allenwood the drift of all this iswill you work the land for me if we can make a satisfactory arrangement  harding hesitated  i dont know that i could take a favor  from me dont make a mistake im not acting out of any personal regard for you on the whole id rather see you in control of allenwood than a mortgage broker thats all  thanks on that understanding we might come to terms  then theres another matter managing my farm wont help you much and i feel that i owe something to the settlement if it looks as if the moneylender would be too strong for you and youre short of funds you can write to me i can afford to spend something on allenwoods defense  they talked it over and when harding left the hotel he had promised in case of necessity to ask brands help moreover although he had not expected this he felt some sympathy and a half reluctant liking for his beaten rival  during the same day davies had a confidential talk with gerald  do you know that your mother and sister are in town with harding he asked  yes but i havent seen them yet  rather not meet harding are you pleased that the mans going to marry your sister  im not gerald answered curtly  he stopped writing and frowned at the book in which he was making an entry he felt very bitter against harding who had insulted him but he was moved by a deeper and less selfish feeling it jarred upon his sense of fitness that his sister should marry a lowbred fellow with whom he was convinced she could not live happily beatrice had lost her head but she was a mowbray and would recover her senses then she would rue the mistake she had made she might resent geralds interference and would no doubt suffer for a time if he succeeded in separating her from her lover but men as he knew got over an irregular passion and he had no reason to believe that women were different  she will marry him unless something is done davies resumed cunningly  what is that to you  well i think you can guess my hand his marrying your sister would give harding some standing at allenwood and hes already got more influence there than suits me the fellows dangerous i hear hes been getting at one or two of the men who backed me but well quit fencing do you want to stop this match  although he had fallen very low gerald felt the humiliation of allowing davies to meddle with the mowbray affairs but he overcame his repugnance because the man might be of help  yes he answered shortly but i dont see how it can be stopped  you knew coral stanton in your more prosperous days didnt you  gerald admitted it miss stanton described herself as a clairvoyante but although there were then in the western cities ladies of her profession who confined themselves to forecasting the changes of the markets and fortunetelling the term had to some extent become conventionalized and conveyed another meaning coral had arrived in winnipeg with a thirdrate opera company which she left after a quarrel with the managers wife and although it was known that gambling for high stakes went on in her consulting rooms she had for a time avoided trouble with the civic authorities the girl was of adventurous turn of mind and was marked by an elfish love of mischief  i cant see what my knowing coral has to do with the matter gerald replied  then ill have to explain things have been going wrong with her since the ontario lumber man was doped in her rooms the police have given her warning and i guess she wouldnt stick at much if she saw a chance of earning a hundred dollars easily  what dyou suggest that she should do  if youll listen for a few minutes ill tell you  davies chuckled as he unfolded a plan that appealed to his broad sense of humor but gerald frowned although likely to result to her ultimate benefit the plot was in the first place directed against his sister it was repugnant in several ways but he thought it would work for beatrice like his mother had puritanical views besides he could think of nothing else  well he said will you talk to coral  certainly not davies answered cautiously thats your part of the business ill put up the money  the following day harding was lunching with beatrice and her mother at their hotel when the waitress brought him a note beatrice sitting next to him noticed that it was addressed in a womans hand and was heavily scented indeed there was something she disliked in the insidious perfume she watched harding as he opened the envelope and saw that what he read disturbed him this struck her as curious but she did not see the note he thrust it into his pocket and began to talk about something of no importance  beatrice thought over the incident during the afternoon but by evening she had banished it from her mind after dinner they sat in the big rotunda of the hotel harding was unusually quiet but beatrice scarcely noticed it for she was interested in watching the people who sauntered in and out through the revolving glass door they were of many different types wiry brownfaced plainsmen silent graveeyed fellows from the forest belt smart bank clerks and traders mechanics and a few women one or two seemed to be needy adventurers but they came and went among the rest though it was obvious that they could not be staying at the hotel  beatrices attention was suddenly attracted by a girl who came in she was handsome dressed in the extreme of fashion and marked by a certain rakish boldness that was not unbecoming beatrice was struck by the darkness of her hair and the brilliance of her color until she saw that something was due to art then she noticed a man smile at another as he indicated the girl and two more turn and look after her when she passed thereupon beatrice grew pitiful ashamed and angry for she could not tell which of the feelings predominated and she wondered why the hotel people had not prevented the girls entrance she was pleased to see that harding was talking to a man who had joined him and had noticed nothing  her life at the grange had been somewhat austere and her relatives were oldfashioned people of high character who condemned what they called modern laxity for all that the adventuress roused her curiosity and she watched her as she moved about the room she drew near them and beatrice thought her eyes rested strangely on harding for a moment a strong scent floated about herthe same that had perfumed the note beatrice was startled but she tried to persuade herself that she was mistaken the adventuress passed on but when hardings companion left him she came up at once and gave him an inviting smile he looked at her in surprise but there was some color in his face it was unthinkable that he should know the girl but she stopped beside him  craig she cooed you dont pretend that youve forgotten me  harding looked at her coldly  i have never seen you before in my life he said emphatically  coral laughed and beatrice noticed the music in her voice  aw come off she exclaimed what you giving us guess youve been getting rich and turned respectable  harding cast a quick glance round beatrice and mrs mowbray sat near and it would be difficult to defend himself to either the girl had made an unfortunate mistake or perhaps expected to find him an easy victim now he began to understand the note the blood filled his face and he looked guilty in his embarrassment and anger for he saw that he was helpless the hotel people would not interfere and to repulse the woman rudely or run away from her was likely to attract the attention he wished to avoid  you have mistaken me for somebody else he replied uneasily  she gave him a coquettish smile  well i guess youre craig harding unless youve changed your name as well as your character i reckoned youd come back to me when i heard you were in town you ought to feel proud i came to look for you when you didnt answer my note  there was something seductive and graceful in her mocking courtesy but harding lost his temper  ive had enough you dont know me and if you try to play this fool game ill have you fired out  that to an old friendand a lady she exclaimed youve surely lost the pretty manners that made me love you  harding turned in desperation and started to the door but she followed putting her hand on his shoulder and some of the bystanders laughed beatrice quivering with the shock hated them for their amusement even if he were innocent harding had placed himself in a horribly humiliating position but she could not think him innocent all she had seen and heard condemned him  harding shook off the girls hand and perhaps alarmed by the look he gave her she left him and soon afterward disappeared but when he returned to the table beatrice and her mother had gone he was getting cool again but he felt crushed for no defense seemed possible he could only offer a blunt denial which in the face of appearances could hardly be believed  he left the hotel and spent an hour walking about the city trying to think what he must do when he returned a bellboy brought him word that mrs mowbray wished to see him in the drawingroom harding went up and found the room unoccupied except by beatrice and her mother the girls face was white but it was stern and she had her fathers immovable look rising as he came in she stood very straight holding out a little box  this is yours she said i must give it back to you you will understand what that means  harding took the box containing the ring he had given her and steadily met her accusing eyes though he could see no hope for him in them  i suppose theres no use in my saying that its all a mistake or a wicked plot  no im afraid the evidence against you is too strong she hesitated a moment and he thought he saw some sign of relenting craig she begged in a broken voice do go ii believed in you  you have no reason to doubt me now  he turned to mrs mowbray  cant you be persuaded i give you my solemn word  dont beatrice interrupted dont make it worse  im sorry i must agree with my daughters decision until i see more reason to change it than i can hope for at present mrs mowbray replied it would be better if you left us we return tomorrow  her tone was final and with a last glance at beatrice harding went out dejectedly     chapter xxviii  fire and hail   on the morning after her return from winnipeg beatrice sat in her fathers study with mowbray facing her across the table he looked thoughtful but not so shocked and indignant as she had expected  so you are determined to throw harding over  yes beatrice said in a strained voice it seems impossible to do anything else  a broken engagements a serious matter we mowbrays keep our word i hope youre quite sure of your ground  what i heard left no room for doubt  did you hear the mans defense  i refused to listen said beatrice coldly that he should try to excuse himself only made it worse  im not sure thats very logical ill confess that harding and i seldom agree but one must be fair  does that mean that one ought to be lenient beatrice asked with an angry sparkle in her eyes  mowbray was conscious of some embarrassment his ideas upon the subject were not sharply defined but if it had not been his daughter who questioned him he could have expressed them better beatrice ought to have left her parents to deal with a delicate matter like this but instead she had boldly taken it into her own hands he had tried to bring up his children well but the becoming modesty which characterized young women in his youth had gone  no he answered not exactly lenient but the thing may not be so bad as you thinkand one must make allowances then a broken engagement reflects upon both parties even if one of them has an unquestionable grievance it proves that that person acted very rashly in making a promise in the first instance  yes said beatrice that is my misfortune i was rash and easily deceived i made the bargain in confiding ignorance without reserve while the man kept a good deal back  but your mother tells me that he declared he had never seen the woman and harding is not a liar  i used to think so but it looks as if i were mistaken beatrice answered bitterly as she turned away  leaving him she found a quiet spot in the shadow of a bluff and sat down to grapple with her pain it had hurt more than she had thought possible to cast off harding and she could bear her trouble only by calling pride to her aid there was she told herself much about the man that had from the first offended her but she had made light of it believing him steadfast and honorable now she knew she had been deceived she had been ready to throw away all the privileges of her station she had disregarded her friends opinionand this was her reward the man for whom she would have made the sacrifice was gross and corrupt but nobody should guess that she found it strangely hard to forget him  lance came upon her there at the edge of the woods but her head was buried in her arms and she did not see him the boy turned at once and went to have a talk with his father his expression was very resolute when he entered mowbrays study  what are you going to do about bees trouble sir he asked abruptly  his father gave him an amused smile  i havent decided he said have you anything useful to suggest  i feel that you ought to put it right  can you tell me how  no of course its a delicate matter but you have a wider knowledge and experience  umh the colonel grunted why do you conclude that your sisters wrong  i know the man hes not the kind she thinks  your mother saw the woman and heard what she said  theres been a mistake lance persisted ive a suspicion that somebody may have put her up to it  made a plot to blacken harding you mean rather farfetched isnt it whom do you suspect  lance turned red for his fathers tone was sarcastic and he thought of gerald but he could not drop a hint against his brother  i dont know yet but im going to find out  when you have found out you can tell me mowbray answered and gave the boy an approving smile youre quite right in standing by your friend and you certainly owe harding something if you can prove him better than we think nobody will be more pleased than i  lance had to be satisfied with this he did not know how to set about his investigations but he determined to visit winnipeg as soon as he could  for the next week or two there was quietness at the grange the dry weather held and boisterous winds swept the sunburned plain the sod cracked the wheat was shriveling and although in public men and women made a brave pretense of cheerfulness in private they brooded over the ruin that threatened them to make things worse three or four days a week heavy clouds that raced across the sky all morning gathered in solid banks at noon and then as if in mockery broke up and drove away few of the settlers had much reserve capital and the low prices obtained for the last crop had strained their finances but harding was perhaps threatened most  he had as had been his custom boldly trusted to the earth all he had won by previous effort and this year it looked as if the soil would refuse its due return still his taking such a risk was only partly due to the prompting of his sanguine temperament while he had hope of winning beatrice he must stake his all on the chance of gaining influence and wealth he had lost her but after a few black days during which he had thought of abandoning the struggle and letting things drift he quietly resumed his work what he had begun must be finished even if it brought no advantage to himself the disaster that seemed unavoidable braced him to sterner effort but when dusk settled down he stood in the dim light and brooded over his withering wheat being what he was a man of constructive genius it cut deep that he must watch the grain that had cost so much thought and toil go to waste but the red band on the prairies edge and the luminous green above it held only a menace  one day harding drove with devine to a distant farm and they set out on the return journey late in the afternoon it was very hot for the wind had died away and deep stillness brooded over the lifeless plain the gophers that made their burrows in the trail had lost their usual briskness and sat up on their haunches until the wheels were almost upon them the prairiechickens the horses disturbed would not rise but ran a few yards and sank down in the parched grass the sky was leaden and the prairie glimmered a curious livid white hardings skin prickled and he was conscious of a black depression and a headache  if this only meant rain he exclaimed dejectedly but ive given up hope  somethings surely coming devine replied glancing at a great bank of cloud that had changed its color to an oily black if this weather holds for another week the crop will be wiped out but somehow i cant believe well all go broke  harding had once thought as his comrade did but now his optimistic courage had deserted him the future was very dark he meant to fight on but defeat seemed certain it would be easier to bear because he had already lost what he valued most  presently the wagon wheels sank in yielding sand and that roused him  our hauling costs us high with these loose trails id counted on cutting more straw with the crop this year and using it to bind the road but now we may not have any grain to send out  the plan was characteristic of him though his dejection was not as a rule straw has no value in a newly opened country and not much is cut with the grain the tall stubble being burned off but harding had seen a use for the waste material in improving the means of transport  well said devine wed better hustle the team wont stand for a storm  harding urged the horses and as the wheels ran out on firm ground the pace grew faster and a distant bluff began to rise from the waste when they were a mile or two from the woods there was a rumble of thunder and the light grew dim the dark sky seemed descending to meet the earth the bluff grew indistinct but the burned grass still retained its ghostly whiteness then the temperature suddenly fell and when a puff of cold wind touched his face harding used the whip he knew what was going to happen  throwing up their heads in alarm as a pale flash glimmered across the trail the team broke into a gallop while the light wagon rocked and swung as the wheels jolted over hummocks and smashed through scrubby brush harding did not think he could hold the horses in the open when the storm broke and he did not wish to be hurled across the rugged prairie behind a bolting team springing down when they reached the trees he and devine locked the wheels and then stood waiting at the horses heads all was now very still again but a gray haze was closing in now and then leaves stirred and rustled and once or twice a dry twig came down the faint crackle it made jarred on the mens tingling nerves  harding found it difficult to keep still he slowly filled his pipe for the sake of occupation the match he struck burned steadily but its pale flame was suddenly lost in a dazzling glare as the lightning fell in an unbroken fork from overhead to a corner of the bluff then the pipe dropped and was trodden on as the men swayed to and fro using all their strength to hold the plunging team it was only for a moment they heard the battering hoofs for a deafening crash that rolled across the heavens drowned all other sound and as it died away the trees began to moan a few large drops of rain fell and then as the men watched it gathering a faint hope the rain turned to hail a savage wind struck the bluff the air got icy cold and the hail changed from fine grains to ragged lumps harding could hear it roar among the trees between the peals of thunder until the scream of wind and the groan of bending branches joined in and formed a wild tumult of sound  though the men stood to lee of the woods the hail found them out bruising their faces and cutting their wet hands even their bodies afterward felt as if they had been beaten it raked the bluff like riflefire cutting twigs and shredding leaves and the wild wind swept the wreckage far to leeward light branches were flying and harding was struck but his grapple with the maddened horses demanded all his thought the lightning leaped about them and blazed through the woods silhouetting bending trees and the horses tense wet bodies before it vanished and left what seemed to be black darkness behind  then when the men were getting exhausted the thunder grew fainter and the bitter wind died away there was a strange perplexing stillness in the heavy gloom until the cloudranks parted and a ray of silver light broke through the grass steamed as the beam moved across it and suddenly the bluff was warm and bright and they could see the havoc that had been made  torn branches hung from the poplars slender birchtwigs lay in heaps and banks of hail now changing fast to water stretched out into the wet sparkling plain  hardings face was very stern as he picked up a handful of the icy pieces  with a strong wind behind it this stuff would cut like a knife he said well it has saved our putting the binders into the grain  devine made a sign of gloomy agreement there was no hope left the crop they had expected much from was destroyed  they clambered into the wagon and drove for some time before the first farmstead began to lift above the edge of the plain in the meanwhile the hail that glistened in the grass tussocks melted away and only a few dark clouds drifting to the east marred the tranquillity of the summer evening the men were silent but devine understood why his comrade drove so hard holding straight across dry sloos where the tall grass crackled about the wheels and over billowy rises where the horses feet sank deep in sand he was anxious to learn the worst and devine feared that it would prove very bad  at last they crossed a higher ridge and harding looking down saw his homestead lying warm in the evening light he had often watched it rise out of the prairie with a stirring of his blood it was his much of it had been built by his own labor and he had won from the desolate waste the broad stretch of fertile soil that rolled away behind it but he now gazed at it with a frown as the buildings grew into shape dark patches of summer fallow broke the gray sweep of grass and then the neutral green of alfalfa and clover running in regular oblongs appeared behind extending right across the background lay the wheat a smear of indefinite color darker than the plain that was all they could see of it at that distance they were going fast but harding lashed the horses in his impatience  devine however looked more closely about and it struck him that the ground had dried with remarkable rapidity indeed if he had not felt the hail he could hardly have believed the plain had been wet for all that not venturing to hope for fear of meeting a heavier shock he said nothing to his comrade and presently they dipped into a hollow they could not see across the ridge in front and harding urged his horses savagely when they came to the ascent the animals coats were foul spume dripped from the bits and their sides were white where the traces slapped but they breasted the hill pluckily the men were grim and highly strung braced to meet the worst to harding it meant ruin and the downfall of all his plans to devine his wedding put off it might be some years before he made good and he feared that he could no longer count on his comrades help if harding were forced to give up his farm he might leave the prairie  at last when the suspense was telling upon both they reached the summit and harding stood up to see better  why the ground has not been wet he exclaimed unbelieving the hail has not touched us  it was true the fire and the ragged ice had passed over that belt of prairie and left its wake of ruin farther on still though the wheat was none the worse it was none the better it stood as when they had seen it last limp from drought and cut by blowing sand disaster was only suspended not removed but there was hope  things dont look half so bad as they might said harding cheerfully i dont deserve it i got savage and bitter and bitterness is a bad substitute for grit now ill brace up and face the future the way a man ought     chapter xxix  a brave heart   three days passed and still no rain fell to save the withering grain on the evening of the fourth day beatrice was walking home alone from one of the neighboring farms she was lost in painful thought and scarcely noticed where she was until she passed a clump of prominent trees which she knew was at the edge of hardings place then she stopped and looked about her  the sun had dipped but an angry orange glow flushed the wide horizon and the sky overhead was a cold dark blue the great sweep of grain caught the fading light and beatrice knew enough about farming to see how it had suffered she could not look at it unmoved the sight was pitiful the wheat had cost long and patient labor and she knew with what hope and ambition the man who had sown it had worked it was only after years of strenuous toil careful thought and stern economy that he had been able to break the broad belt of prairie and in doing so he had boldly staked his all now it looked as if he had lost and she was grieved to see so much effort thrown away  harding had transgressed but the work he did was good and beatrice began to wonder how far that might atone for his lack of principle human character was mixed men might be true in many ways and yet fall victims to a besetting sin but it was a sin beatrice could not forgive harding had sought the other woman while he professed his love for her in beatrice pride fastidiousness and puritanical convictions converged  letting her eyes travel farther along the grain she started as she saw him he had not noticed her for he stood looking at his crop his figure was outlined against the last of the light and his pose was slack and stamped with dejection it was obvious that he thought himself alone for harding was not the man to betray his troubles  beatrices heart suddenly filled with pity he must be very hard hit and she believed that it was not the loss of fortune he felt most everything had gone against him one could not refuse a man compassion because his sin had found him out  to her surprise she felt that she must speak to him she did not know what she meant to say but half hesitating she moved forward harding looked round at her step and the fading glow struck upon his face  it was brown and thin and marked by a great physical weariness the toil he had borne since the thaw came and the suspense he had suffered had set their stamp on him he looked fined down his face had an ascetic cast  beatrice caught her breath by some strange inward power she grasped the truth this man had done no wrong there was no deceit in him what she had believed of him was impossible all that she had seen and heard condemned him there was no weak point in the evidence of his guilt but she trusted the prompting of her heart calm judgment and logical reasoning had no place in this matter she had wronged him and how she must have hurt him  she held out both her hands and there were tears in her eyes  craig she said ive come back i couldnt stay away  harding could not speak he took her into his armsand suddenly the earth seemed to be giving way under his feet his brain reeled and a great blackness settled down over him  why youre ill beatrice exclaimed oh i have brought you to this  the anguish in her cry cut through him as he was losing consciousness and he pulled himself together  no he smiled im not ill but you must give me a moment to realize that i really have you again  they walked back the few paces to the trail an old log lay beside it half buried in grass and wild flowers and here they sat together in the cool stillness of the dusk until the darkness came down and hovered round them out of the early night sky one star shone down on them like a blessing  for the time being it was nothing to them that the prairie sod was cracked and parched and that the destroying wind would rise again at dawn                                       on the way back to the grange beatrice brought up the subject which she felt must be talked of and then dropped for good  how dreadfully mistaken i was aboutthe girl she said hesitatingly  how did you find it out  i havent really found out anything im afraid i cant explain i suddenly saw the truth and wondered why i had been blind  do you mean  i mean that i should never have left you craig dear i know that you never saw that girl before in your lifebut i did not know it until i saw you standing there in the wheat this evening  harding dropped the hand he was holding and caught her to him  dear was all he said  can you explain what happened in winnipeg she asked as they walked on again  no im puzzled but for your sake i shall not rest until ive cleared myself then with a sudden shock he remembered the wheat they had left but i was forgettingi may be a ruined man  and i the daughter of another beatrice answered with a smile that could make no difference craig and were not ruined yet still because i was hard and unjust at first i should like you to remember that i came to you when you were in trouble and didnt ask whether you were innocent or not  ill remember it said harding as long as i live  when they reached the house mowbray and his wife were sitting on the veranda and lance came down the steps to meet them with his hand held out neither spoke but harding was touched by the sincerity of his welcome  beatrice ran up the steps to her mother and harding after a word of greeting turned away he felt that until he had cleared himself it would be more becoming in him to keep away from the colonel and mrs mowbray  the next morning mowbray called beatrice into his study  i am glad that your confidence in harding has returned he said you must however understand that the situation is still awkward  yes craig and i talked it over last night  you talked this matter over mowbray exclaimed  of course said beatrice calmly its of some importance to me are you surprised  i must admit that i am when i was young a wellbroughtup girl would hardly have ventured to mention such subjects to her mother much less discuss them with her lover  beatrice smiled at him  im afraid your feelings must get many a rude jar in these degenerate times still you know things are changing  thats true said mowbray ive had cause to realize it of late for example your brother lance goes off to winnipeg on some mysterious business without consulting me and only tells me in a casual manner that he may have to go again respect for parents is not a characteristic of your generation but i want to speak about harding  he talked very kindly and shrewdly and when beatrice left him she sought her favorite place in the shadow of a nearby bluff to think over what he had said  there was less wind for the next two days and driving sand no longer raked the grain from early morning dingy clouds rolled up slowly from the west and though not a drop of rain fell the distance grew blurred the horses on the range were restless and galloped furiously now and then the gophers scurried up and down the trails men at work grew impatient over trifling obstacles and often stopped to watch the clouds these rolled on and vanished in the east while many an anxious farmer wondered when the last would rise from the horizon and leave the pitiless sky uncovered again thirsty wild creatures stirred in the shadow of the bluffs and rustled through the withered grass beside the driedup creeks leaves fluttered and hung still again with a strange limpness their under sides exposed it was as if the sunscorched waste and all that lived on it were panting for the rain and still the clouds that never broke rolled slowly on  at dusk on the second evening beatrice and harding walked across the prairie speaking in low voices anxious and yet serene  what are you thinking of craig beatrice asked presently  of the weather harding answered wondering if these clouds will break or clear away again it looks as if our future hung upon the chance of a storm if it doesnt come theres a long uphill fight before us and i hate to think of what you may have to bear  im not afraid said beatrice if i stayed at allenwood i should not escape perhaps i have missed something by getting through life too easily i really dont think im much weaker or less capable than effie broadwood and shes not cast down  harding kissed the hand he held  a brave heart like yours carries one a long way but training and experience are needed grit alone is not much use when youre up against a thing you dont know how to do  it helps you to learn am i so very stupid dont you see dear that i want to prove that i can be useful  to carry heavy pails bake and mend old overalls that would be an unthinkable waste of fine material its your business to be your beautiful and gracious self a refining influence a light in the home  beatrice laughed  im afraid when you think about me you lose your usual sense i should be as useful if i were made of painted wax and youd get tired of your goddess some day and want to break me up im alive you know i want to be in the midst of the strife i hear the bugles call  harding kissed her tenderly  im afraid well have to fall in with the firing line but it will be my business to shield you from harm he said  its a good fight she answered with sparkling eyes you have taught me that the flag goes steadily forward with the pioneers in the van there are great alkali barrens rocks and muskegs to be overcome arid plains to be watered forests cleared the waste places to be made fruitful thats why we have painted the beaver of industry in the field but we have our campfollowersand i might have been oneuseless idlers grafters and dishonest contractors who rob the fighting men  when weve broken the wilderness well have time to deal with them but im afraid many a pioneer will go down before we march much farther  ah said beatrice softly but whether the fight is hard or not you must teach me to do my part  she stopped holding out her hands with an excited cry  the rain craig the rain  her hands felt wet something drummed upon her broad straw hat and the dust leaped up from the grass then the quick patter ceased and there was stillness again it lasted for several minutes while both stood tense and still scarcely venturing to hope then there was a roar in the distance and a puff of cool wind and harding touching the girls arm hurried her forward  its coming he said hoarsely coming in earnest  oh lets stay cried beatrice i want to feel its true  harding laughed but led her on and presently they met the advancing rain it beat wonderfully refreshing on their hot faces and soon beatrices thin dress was soaked steam rose from the parched earth there was a hothouse smell a dull roar and a rustle among the beaten grass and the fading light was shut off by a curtain of falling water alternating between happy laughter and silence during which their thankfulness became too deep for speech they hurried toward hardings farm and beatrice threw her arms round hesters neck when she met her at the door  oh she cried our troubles are over the rain the rain     chapter xxx  the inheritance   the rain lasted several days and saved the crops the wheat although somewhat damaged was ripening fast  as lance drove home from one of his mysterious absences from the grange he looked out over the rippling fields with a sense of thankfulness in his boyish heart harding was not to be ruined after all the rain had saved his fortune and in lances pocket there was a paper that would clear his name  beatrice met him on the steps but he brushed past her with a smile and hurried to his fathers study where he knew he would find the colonel  ive been away several times and now i must tell you why sir he said you will remember that ive declared my belief in harding all along  ive no doubt he feels properly grateful mowbray remarked  im grateful to him and now i have some satisfaction in being able to prove his innocence read this  he gave his father a note and mowbray read it aloud  i hereby declare that craig harding of allenwood is a stranger to me i met him for the first and only time at the rideau hotel winnipeg and i regret that i then claimed his acquaintance  it sounds conclusive i see its signed coral stanton clairvoyante may i ask how you came to meet this lady and get the document  both things needed some tact sir lance answered with a grin  so i should imagine rather a delicate business for one so young you must have seen that your motives were liable to be misunderstood  lance colored  i had to take the risk as a matter of fact things threatened to become embarrassing at first however i got the statement  what did you give for it  a hundred dollars what miss stanton was promised  then she was hired to act a part but what made her willing to betray her employers  they deserved it lance answered in a curious tone it seems she got into difficulties with the police and had to leave the town the clairvoyante business was only a blind and somebody was robbed after gambling at her rooms the men who made the plot took a shabby advantage of the situation  do you know their names  yes said lance hesitatingly if you dont mind sir id rather not mention them  mowbray looked at him keenly and then made a sign of stern agreement  perhaps thats best he was silent for a few moments grappling with this new pain that seared him to the heart so gerald had sunk to this leave the paper here and send beatrice to me he said slowly  lance was glad to escape he found beatrice with her mother and she and mrs mowbray went at once to the colonels study  your brother took some trouble to get this for you mowbray said handing her the statement which she read in silence  i will thank lance but this note really makes no difference she declared  thats hard to understand  i had craigs word if i had doubted him would i have believed this woman but theres another matter i want to speak of craig didnt want me to but he gave me permission  taking out the photographs harding had shown her she handed them to mowbray mrs mowbray looking over his shoulder uttered an exclamation the colonel too was startled  thats ash garth with janet harding on the steps where did you get them what does it mean  instead of answering the girl glanced at her mother  i think its quite plain mrs mowbray said beatrice is engaged to basil hardings son  why was i not told before mowbray asked excitedly hes as well born as you are cant you see how it alters things  craig declares it makes no differenceand im beginning to agree with him  thats absurd mowbray exclaimed false pride mistaken sentiment we know the advantage of springing from a good stock now i understand why i sometimes felt a curious sympathy with harding even when i hated his opinions  you gave us no reason to suspect it beatrice answered with a smile do you know his fathers history  yes but i dont know that i ought to tell it without his sons permission  then well wait said beatrice craig will be here soon  harding came in a few minutes afterward and mowbray giving him a friendly greeting handed him the letter lance had brought and the photographs  your father was a comrade of mine the colonel said we were both stationed at an outpost in northern india  then you may be able to tell me something about his early life replied harding quietly its a subject he never spoke of  i can do so are you willing that beatrice and her mother should hear  yes i dont wish to hide anything from them  very well your father was an infantry captain and well thought of in his regiment his worst faults were a quick temper and a rash impulsiveness but he suffered for them before coming to india he married beneath him a girl of some beauty but no education his relatives strongly opposed the match and there was a quarrel with them  after a time basil was ordered to a station where there was some european society and his wife was out of her element there the other women of the post objected to her and openly insulted her basil had one quarrel after another on her behalf and finally after an unusually stormy scene with the artillery major basil sent in his papers  his relatives refused to receive him they cut off his allowance but he clung to his wife until she died a couple years later then he came to canada and vanished  his mother died and one by one the others followedall except basil morel his mothers brother  ah beatrice interrupted  the colonel glanced at her a moment and then went on  morel had a very strong affection for basilhe was his namesake and only nephew feeling that they had been too hard on him morel traced basil in canada wrote him a long letter and enclosed a draft for a thousand pounds as part of back allowances basil wrote a brief and bitter note in answer then deposited the money in a winnipeg bank to be given to his son after his death on condition that the son never question where it came from this son was by the second wife there were no children by the first  well basil died the bank reported to morel that the money had been paid to the son and thenthe old man living alone at ash garth was getting very lonely he had time to brood over the injustice done basil and before he died he wanted to make it up to basils son but the son had completely disappeared he had left dakota and gone to manitoba from there all trace of him had vanished morel is now a broken old man but because basil and i were comrades he confides many things to me and i know that deep down in his heart there is still a hope that he will live long enough to find basils son  the colonels voice was husky and he paused a moment before he said  with your permission mr harding i should like to send him a cable  harding nodded assent  beatrice was crying softly  now i understand why mr morel always looked so sad when i talked of the prairie she said brokenly mother you must have known she added as an afterthought  yes but i didnt feel that it was my secret dear mrs mowbray answered gently  at the colonels request harding told them of his early life and then he and beatrice drove across the prairie to tell the story to hester beatrice felt that it was the girls right to know  harvest came and although the crop was lighter than he had hoped harding saw that he would have a satisfactory margin it was not so with most of his neighbors and when the strain of forced effort slackened and the smoke of the thrasher no longer streaked the stubble there were anxious hearts at allenwood even the buoyant courage of the younger men began to sink hitherto they had carelessly borne their private troubles but now they felt that the settlement was in danger those who had never taken thought before asked what must be done and nobody could tell them harding and his friends had a surprise to spring on their neighbors and on davies as well but they waited until the time was ripe  then one evening mowbray rode over to kenwynes homestead  you and broadwood have opposed me but i have never doubted your sincerity he said in fact since brand has gone i feel id rather trust you and harding than the boys who have given me their thoughtless support we are threatened with grave trouble  we must try to justify your belief in us sir said kenwyne what is the trouble  carlyon webster and shepstone came to me and confessed that they have mortgaged their farms to make things worse i have a letter from the man in winnipeg they borrowed from informing me that he would seize geralds land unless a large sum is paid you must see that this means disaster to allenwood  mowbray looked harassed and worn and kenwyne felt sorry for him  i suggest that you let the fellow produce his mortgages and receive him at a council meeting the matters of interest to everybody  then you have some scheme mowbray asked eagerly  as its farreaching wed rather put it before the council im half afraid we cant expect your approval until you know everything but you should be able to command a majority if we dont convince you  i can do nothing to save the settlement mowbray said with dignity and i dare not refuse to let others try even if their ways are not mine well leave it at that ill call the meeting  it was a calm clear evening when all the allenwood settlers assembled in the hall at the grange the days were getting shorter and a lamp or two was lighted but outside the last of the sunset glowed in a red band along the prairies rim mowbray sat at the head of the table harding broadwood kenwyne and lance were close together the rest scattered about the spacious room some half hidden in the shadow some where the partial illumination touched them all were silent and expectant they felt it would prove a memorable night for allenwood  there was a rattle of wheels outside and soon afterward davies was shown in he was smartly dressed in wellcut city clothes and his aggressive selfconscious air contrasted with the easy grace of the brownfaced men in shooting jackets and fringed deerskin  i came here expecting a private interview he said to mowbray i do not understand why im asked to meet these gentlemen most of whom i have not the pleasure of knowing  i cannot tell what you expected mowbray answered haughtily your business is however of interest to us all and to state it now will save some time because nothing can be done until our council is informed of it  davies glance wandered round the room as if in search of somebody but he did not notice harding who was in the shadow  very well he said undoing a bundle of documents i hold mortgages on land and property belonging to gerald mowbray carlyon webster and shepstone he read out particulars of the sums lent and interest due and then put the papers on the table you are at liberty to examine them  carlyon turned to mowbray with a flushed face  they cant be contested sir speaking for the others as well as myself i must say that we feel our position and are very sorry that we have brought this trouble upon you and our friends  harding moved forward and picked up the mortgages and davies showed his surprise after examining the documents carefully harding passed them to broadwood who looked over them in a silence that was accentuated by the rattle of a loose blind as puffs of wind swept into the room  all right broadwood said and handed a sheet of paper to each of the debtors  will you agree to these terms yes or no he asked  one of the young men laughed hoarsely as if from unexpected relief another made a glad sign of assent and carlyons eyes were bright as he turned to broadwood  agree he exclaimed we never hoped for such a chance as this  broadwood put one of the papers in front of mowbray  they consent sir wed like your sanction  i cannot give it unreservedly but as i cannot suggest anything better i must not refuse mowbray addressed davies as the farms were mortgaged against the provisions of our settlement covenant i believe your claim might be disputed but i wont urge that point the money was borrowed and must be paid  with your permission sir harding took the big inkstand and placed it before davies write a formal discharge for these debts and ill give you a check  davies face was hot with baffled fury but he asked in a sneering tone  will the bank make it good  heres their letter said harding dryly  davies glanced at the letter and threw it down then he pulled himself together  it seems he said to mowbray that you have made some arrangement to finance these gentlemen and they have agreed but mr gerald mowbray owes a much larger sum and i have his word that he is unable to pay he left the matter in my hands and before going any further i should like to suggest that we might arrive at some understanding  mowbray cut him short  we can make no terms with you if that is what is meant my son owes you money you must take what you are entitled to  but the debt is his he must decide  he has decided harding said quietly heres a telegram from him answering a letter of mine which he probably got after you left he agrees to transfer the mortgaged property to his father and another on terms that dont concern you read it  ah cried davies hoarse with anger mowbray has gone back on me i was a fool to trust him  colonel mowbray flushed but did not answer and harding turned to davies  this has nothing to do with our business write your receipts including gerald mowbrays debt and take your money  davies did so and carefully examined the check harding gave him then he got up and made mowbray an ironical bow one of the men opened the door and he went out surlily  there was a general movement and a murmur throughout the room expressing relief and a slackening of tension  its a satisfaction to see the last of the fellow one man said voicing the feelings of all the settlement has escaped a danger but we must be careful not to let it fall into another may i inquire about the agreement which mr harding has made with our friends  harding explained that they were to farm their land under his instructions paying a moderate rate of interest a fixed sum was to be set aside every year to redeem the loan so that in time the debtors would again acquire possession and any surplus would belong to them  mr hardings position is now very strong the man contended he can if he wishes dictate to the rest of us and i think we ought to know his plans and how he expects to profit  there was deep silence when harding got upon his feet and glanced round the room a few of the men were obviously suspicious and one or two hostile but some looked willing to give him fair play and some quietly confident in him  to begin with i expect no direct profit from allenwood he said the advantage i shall gain will be the keeping down of my working expenses by your cooperation with better trails well need fewer teams to bring out supplies and haul in our grain and we can avoid using two halfempty wagons when one will take both loads we can buy and sell on joint lines saving all round and can use the latest and biggest machines singly we cannot afford them combined we can buy and what is more keep the implements employed but we can work out details later you have reached a turningpoint tonight those of you with private means if there are any such may continue to farm as a pastime but for the man who must live by his farming it is serious work there is a time of low prices before us that will weed out the slack but with care and effort we can hold out until the flood of prosperity which is coming sweeps our difficulties away we must perfect our methods fall in with modern practise and study economy that i have now some power here is true i ask your help and value it but if needful i can do without it i and several more are going on working together on the best plan we can find as we have begun  a murmur of applause greeted the close of the speech for hardings blunt candor had gained him the respect of his antagonists and strengthened the loyalty of his friends  then mowbray leaned forward holding up his hand  we have heard mr hardings intentions declared with the straightforwardness one expects from him and it must be clear to all that he has freed allenwood from a peril he paused and his voice was strained as he resumed for a while we prospered here and i like to think i led you well but the times began to change without our recognizing it i cannot change but you must for you are young the future lies before you i am old and i feel my age tonight the burden of rule gets heavy i want to lay it down you must choose another leader who understands these times and i think you see where a wise choice lies  for a moment nobody spoke and then a unanimous cry of protest broke out it rang with feeling and when it died away man after man urged mowbray to keep control  he listened with a faint smile  i am honored by this mark of confidence he said quietly but if i consent you must give me the helper i need and you must follow him with the loyalty you have always shown me to some extent we shall counterbalance extremes in each other which may be for the good of all because i have much to learn from the present and my helper something from the past i could not ask you to obey an outsider but the man i choose will soon become a member of my family i nominate mr harding who has saved the settlement  there were cries of agreement that swelled into a storm of satisfaction and harding said a few words in a voice that shook this was a turn of affairs he had not expected and he was moved by mowbrays confidence and the number of friends he had made  then the council broke up and when the last had gone mowbray joined his wife on the veranda where he sat looking with tired eyes toward the pale red glow on the skyline left by the setting sun the prairie was formless and shadowy but darkness had not quite closed in  i feel that all this is symbolical my dear he said my day is over but the night has not yet come though it will not be by the way i would have chosen i may still see allenwood safe and prosperous  mrs mowbray took his hand caressingly  you have led the boys well and taught them much they will not forget it you never shrank from a sacrifice that was for their goodand i know the cost of the one you have made tonight  i knew i could trust to your sympathy you havent failed me yet he said gently i wonder why gerald broke away from the rascal at last i may be wrong but id like to believe that when the time came he found he could not betray his friends that his heart spoke and a trace of the honor we tried to teach him awoke to life  i think youre right mrs mowbray answered i am sure there is hope for him  then she turned and her eyes rested on the dark figures of beatrice and harding who had left the house and were walking slowly across the plain moving side by side with love and confidence in their hearts they looked toward the east where the dawn would rise   the end     john fox jrs stories of the kentucky mountains  may be had wherever books are sold ask for grosset and dunlaps list
