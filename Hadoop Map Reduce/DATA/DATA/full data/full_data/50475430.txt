in a line issued under the general title the second rover boys series for young americans  as noted in some volumes of the first series this line was started years ago with the publication of the rover boys at school on the ocean and in the jungle in which i introduced my readers to dick tom and sam rover and their relatives and friends the twenty volumes of the first series related the doings of these three rover boys while attending putnam hall military academy brill college and while on numerous outings  having finished their education the three young men established themselves in business and became married dick rover was blessed with a son and a daughter as was also his brother sam while tom became the proud father of a pair of the liveliest kind of twin boys  from their home in new york city the young rovers were sent to a boarding school as related in the first volume of the second series entitled the rover boys at colby hall from that institution of learning the scene was shifted to snowshoe island where the lads spent a midwinter outing then they rejoined their fellowcadets and had some strenuous doings while under canvas after that in a volume entitled the rover boys on a hunt i related how they uncovered the mystery surrounding a strange house in the woods and following this came a trip to texas and oklahoma where in the land of luck the boys aided dick rover in his efforts to locate some valuable oil wells  in the present volume the scene is shifted back to colby hall and then to a ranch in the west where some remarkable happenings await our young heroes  from reports received i am assured that the sale of this line of books has now passed the three million mark this is as astonishing as it is gratifying i sincerely trust that the reading of the volumes will do all of the boys and girls good                                 affectionately and sincerely yours                                                    edward stratemeyer     contents

line up fellows no crowding ahead in this contest  here jack give me some elbow room if you want me to do any real snowball throwing cried fred rover  all the elbow room you want returned his cousin gayly  remember the prize shouted andy rover to the cadets who were stringing themselves out in a ragged line the first fellow to throw a snowball over the top of the barn gets a sock doughnut  for gracious sake what do you call a sock doughnut demanded phil franklin another cadet as he paused in the act of rounding up a snowball he was making  a sock doughnut is one with a big hole in it answered andy with a grin  then my socks must be all of the doughnut variety put in one of the cadets dolefully they are always full of holes  never mind the socks now cried randy rover lets see who can put the first snowball over the barn  it was late in the afternoon of a day in january and a number of the cadets of colby hall had been amusing themselves in the snow which covered the ground to a depth of nearly a foot they had started in to snowballing each other but had then grown more serious and had built several snow forts and likewise two or three snowmen which later they had taken great sport in knocking apart then some one had suggested that they try their skill at seeing who could throw the highest and farthest and this had led to the present contest  well mark off a line about a hundred feet from the main barn jack rover had announced and then well see who can throw highest over the roof  the four rovers were accompanied by half a dozen of their chums and six or eight others and at the word from jack the snowballs began to fly at a lively rate a few landing on the roof of the big barn and the majority hitting the side  say look out that you dont break a window warned gif garrison if you do youll have an account to settle with captain dale  here she goes yelled dan soppinger and let fly with so much strength that the snowball sailed up to the very ridgepole of the barn and disappeared on the other side  hurrah dan draws first blood shouted jack  huh dan didnt throw over the barn he just slid over it snickered randy  jack was hard at work making a small and perfectly round ball now taking careful aim he let fly with all his might  there she goes fair and square he announced with pardonable pride as the snowball cleared the top of the barn by several feet and disappeared beyond  the snowball had scarcely been thrown when two other balls thrown by fred and another cadet went sailing over the barn then those in the contest seemed to acquire better skill and soon nearly every one of them was topping the barn with the missiles  phew some hot work ill say panted will hendry usually called fatty because he was the stoutest boy in the school  this exercise will do you good fatty returned fred you need to reduce  if fatty keeps on hell be eating colby hall poor announced spouter powell  huh i dont eat any more than any of you grumbled fatty fact is i hold myself down  gee listen to that will you exclaimed andy fatty says he holds himself down and this morning i saw him storing away three helpings of sausages and about steen dozen buckwheat cakes  nothing of the kind i didnt have a bit more than you had growled hendry he broke off suddenly hello whats up now  hi hi whats the meaning o this cried a voice from around one end of the big barn and a man dressed in overalls and a heavy cap and carrying a broom appeared  hello there bob nixon cried jack whats wrong  therell be a whole lot wrong if you fellows keep on throwing those snowballs much farther answered bob nixon who was a chauffeur for the hall and who did all sorts of odd jobs in the winter time  did we hit you questioned phil franklin  you sure didon the back and on my hand answered nixon  we didnt know anybody was around on that side of the barn announced andy  i dont suppose you did but never mind me what i want to know is do you fellows intend to smash all the glass in those hotbed frames out yonder  great salt mackerel ejaculated fred i forgot those hotbed frames were there  why the glass is out of em anyway isnt it questioned gif  it was out but theyve been setting some of em in again getting ready for some early stuff youve sent those snowballs up to within ten or fifteen feet of where the frames are located  gosh its a good thing you told us of this burst out fatty hendry we might have had a nice lot of glassware to pay for  not you fatty grinned andy you never even hit the top of the barn if you break any glass it will be in some of those basement windows  come on up to the other end of the barn suggested gif then the snowballs will fly right out into the open field and do no harm  well i dont care where you throw em as long as you dont get into mischief answered bob nixon and disappeared into the barn  after that the cadets continued to throw over the structure for some time but then they gradually lost interest and as the short winter day was coming rapidly to an end some hurried into the hall to do a little extra school work before the bell should ring for supper  well what next questioned fred rover when he and his three cousins and gif phil and spouter found themselves left alone  ive got a great scheme for tonight if you fellows will help announced randy he and his twin brother were always ready for a joke  what is it questioned jack quickly  this snow is just soft enough for rolling some big balls as we found out this afternoon answered his cousin whats the matter with making a whole lot of big snowballs and placing em in some of the bedrooms tonight  gee thats the talk cried his twin merrily id like to place a couple in codfishs room  he certainly deserves em added fred hes getting to be just as big a sneak as he ever was all of our kindness to him seems to have been useless  and i thought he was going to turn over a new leaf declared jack i wonder if some of the other fellows havent been teasing him and that has made him go back to his old tricks  i know one person id like to treat to some big snowballs broke out fred thats professor duke  oh say id like to square up with him myself burst out andy gee he certainly did have it in for us yesterday  professor duke is certainly a sour onemuch worse than asa lemm ever dared to be came from gif  i was thinking of duke when i mentioned it said randy you know he has his room in our building instead of with the other professors in colonel colbys residence  we dont want to get in bad with the colonel remarked fred seriously  oh i think we can fix it so that nobody will know who did it returned his cousin  the matter was talked over for several minutes and then having agreed on their plan for more fun the rover boys and their chums set to work rolling a number of snowballs which were two feet or more in diameter these they placed close to the school building at a point where there was a series of fireescapes leading down from the upper halls of the institution  we can let down the ladder just as soon as were ready to turn the trick announced randy i dont believe anybody will notice it for it will be dark and so cold that most everybody will be indoors  weve got to be on our guard to make certain that codfish or duke or somebody else doesnt spot us said spouter powell of course it wouldnt hurt if some of the regular fellows found us out because theyd keep it to themselves  it must be confessed that the rover boys were rather preoccupied in mind during supper that evening in fact andy grew so thoughtless that he salted some eggs he was eating three times so that when he finally came to his senses the food had to be pushed aside this happened just as professor snopper duke was passing and the new teacher eyed the young cadet suspiciously  what is the matter with that omelet rover he demanded in his highpitched nervous tone of voice  nothing the matter with it sir answered andy only i somehow forgot and salted it too much  really returned snopper duke sarcastically is that the way you waste food  no sir it was only a mistake answered andy meekly  you ought to be made to eat that omelet continued the professor severely dont let such a thing happen again and then with his eyes rolling around among the other cadets to see if anything else might be wrong he passed slowly down among the tables of the mess hall  oh isnt he a perfect little lamb murmured randy so awfully tenderhearted  somebody ought to wring his neck grumbled his twin  just the same andy youd better be careful how you handle the saltshaker after this put in jack  after the meal the rovers and their chums mingled with the other cadets and informed two or three of what was in the wind and as a consequence there was quite some excitement noticeable when a little later the crowd with the exception of randy slipped out of the school building by a side door randy ran upstairs to appear presently on the lower landing of the fireescape here was suspended a heavy iron ladder in such a fashion that it could be easily shoved out so that one end would drop to the ground  soon the crowd of cadets appeared in the snow below him and then with a warning to them to get out of the way randy let down the ladder and then came down himself  all clear upstairs he announced not a soul in sight  one of us ought to stay on guard up there to give warning in case its necessary announced spouter  well suppose you go up returned jack  id just as soon help with the snowballs returned spouter but if you want me to go ill do so and a moment later he disappeared up the ladder and into the school building through a window which had been thrown open  the cadets on the ground found it no easy task to raise the big snowballs up the ladder they tried it first with nothing but their hands but soon found they could do much better by dumping a snowball into a big overcoat and then hauling it up by the sleeves and the tail of the garment they worked as rapidly as possible and soon had eight of the snowballs raised to the platform of the fireescape  how about it everything clear questioned randy as he came into the corridor where spouter was on guard  all clear so far was the reply a few of the fellows are in their rooms but no one that we are going to bother  then lets get those snowballs inside and distribute em  in a few minutes the snowballs were gotten inside the building and then two were rolled and pushed over to the room occupied by henry stowell a cadet commonly called codfish on account of the broadness of his mouth luck was with them for the door was unlocked so that they had little trouble in rolling the snowballs inside where they were placed one on either side of the single bed the cadet occupied  after this the cadets rolled several of the balls to various other rooms one being placed in the tub of a bathroom  ive saved the biggest of the snowballs whispered randy thats the one we must place in professor dukes room  the professors room was around in another corridor and to get to this the cadets had to roll the big snowball directly past the top of the broad stairs leading to the hall below they had the snowball in a position right at the head of the stairs when spouter who was leaning over the upper railing on guard gave a sudden hiss of warning  somebody coming he announced in a whisper and unless im mistaken its professor duke  gosh i hope he doesnt catch us returned gif garrison maybe we had better run for it  here he comes right for the stairs put in jack as he saw the familiar form pass a light in the lower hall  the cadets did not know just what to do and while they paused to consider professor duke started up the long straight stairs he was evidently in deep thought and did not look above him  run fellows run whispered andy excitedly and then as the others started away he attempted to follow but the floor was wet from the melting snow and down he came flat on his back both feet hitting the big snowball squarely  the movement was sufficient to send the snowball directly to the edge of the top step here as andy scrambled to his feet it hovered for a moment then began to slide down the stairs gathering speed from step to step  hi hi what is this those above heard snopper duke ejaculate and the next instant the teacher set up a yell of alarm as the big snowball hit him in the stomach and hurled him to one side then the snowball passed on down the stairs slid across the lower hallway and shot directly through the open door leading to colonel colbys private office     chapter ii  something about the rover boys   gee weve done it now  the snowball knocked professor duke over  hi stop that what do you mean who did that came in smothered tones from snopper duke who now sat on one of the lower steps of the stairs holding both hands over the spot where the big snowball had struck him  gosh it struck him all right whispered gif garrison  yes and it went across the hallway into colonel colbys office gasped andy who had scrambled to his feet and given a glance downward  skip for it put in his twin brother quickly we mustnt be caught at this  the warning was not needed for all of the cadets were already scrambling through the corridor and away from the stairs as rapidly as possible they came to a halt in front of room 18 that which jack occupied  skip inside and pretend to be reading or studying said the oldest of the rover boys  i think we had better go to our own rooms said gif to phil and spouter and remember mum is the word he added for the benefit of the others  therell be some fun sooner or later believe me remarked fred andy why did you push that snowball downstairs on top of old duke  i didnt do it on purpose i slipped was the answer but come before they start to investigate and then he slipped into jacks room followed by his cousins  and here let me pause for a moment to tell something about the rover boys and how it was that they came to be at colby hall my old readers will not need this introduction and therefore i shall not feel hurt if they skip my words on the subject  in the first volume of this line entitled the rover boys at school i introduced three brothers dick tom and sam rover and told how they were sent to putnam hall military academy where they made a number of chums including a cadet named lawrence colby  passing through putnam hall successfully the three brothers next attended brill college and then went into business in new york city where they organized the rover company with offices on wall street  during their school days the rover brothers had fallen in with three very nice girls dora stanhope and her cousins nellie and grace laning the three young couples became married and settled down in connecting houses on riverside drive new york city  about a year following their marriage dick and his wife dora became the parents of a son who was named john and this son was followed by a daughter martha the boy jack as he was usually called was a sturdy youth with many of the independent qualities which had made his father so successful  shortly after the birth of jack tom rover and his wife nellie came forward with a great surprise in the form of a pair of lively twin boys one of whom was named anderson and the other randolph andy and randy as they were invariably called were exceedingly active lads in that particular being a second edition of their funloving father tom  about the time toms twins came upon the scene sam rover and his wife grace became the parents of a little girl called mary then a year later the girl was followed by a boy who was christened fred  residing side by side the younger generation of rover boys as well as their sisters were brought up very much as one large family at first they were sent to private schools in the metropolis but the boys led by andy and randy showed such an aptitude for fun and horseplay that their parents were compelled to hold a consultation  well have to send those kids to some strict boarding schoolsome military academy said dick rover  i guess thats right his brother tom had answered although how my wife is going to get along without having the twins around is more than i know  at that time lawrence colby the rovers former putnam hall chum was at the head of a military academy called colby hall to this institution jack fred and the twins were sent and what they did upon their arrival there is told in detail in the first volume of my second series entitled the rover boys at colby hall  the military school was located about half a mile from the town of haven point on clearwater lake at the head of the lake was the rick rack river running down from the hills and forests beyond the school consisted of a large stone building facing the river and close by was a smaller building occupied by colonel colby and his family and some of the professors and at a short distance were a gymnasium a boathouse and likewise bathing pavilions  on arriving at colby hall the younger rovers found several of their friends awaiting them including dick powell usually called spouter because of his occasional desire to make long speeches and gifford garrison spouter and gif were the sons of songbird powell and fred garrison men who in their boyhood days had been close chums of the older rovers while at putnam hall the rovers made a number of other friends and likewise a few enemies many of whom will be heard of later  as mentioned colby hall was located about half a mile beyond haven point and on the opposite side of the town was clearwater hall a boarding school for girls during a panic in a motion picture house the rover boys became acquainted with several girls from clearwater hall including ruth stevenson may powell alice strobell and annie larkins they discovered that may was spouter powells cousin and the whole crowd of young people soon became friends later on mary and martha rover became pupils at the girls school  ruth stevenson had an old uncle barney and one day while out hunting the rover boys did the old man a great service for this he invited them to spend some winter holidays with him which they did as related in another volume called the rover boys on snowshoe island  on this island the boys met two of their former enemies nappy martell and slugger brown as well as asa lemm a discharged teacher of colby hall the rovers exposed a plot against old uncle barney and caused the hunters enemies to leave snowshoe island in disgust  some of the boys hoped they had seen the last of nappy and slugger but jack was doubtful and how those two unworthies turned up again to cause more trouble is related in the book entitled the rover boys under canvas  this was at the time of the annual encampment and at an election of officers jack was made captain of company c and fred made first lieutenant  while the rover boys were at colby hall the great war in europe opened when the call for army volunteers came dick rover and his brother sam lost no time in enlisting and as soon as he could get away tom rover followed and the three fathers of the boys went into the trenches in europe to do their duty for uncle sam  during the following winter at colby hall gif garrison received a letter from an uncle stating that he and his chums might use a bungalow up in the woods gif at once invited the rover boys and spouter to become his guests and what a glorious time the lads had is related in a volume entitled the rover boys on a hunt  the return of the older rovers from europe at the conclusion of the great war in which they had served gallantly brought something of a surprise dick rover had saved the life of a man from texas and in return had been given the deed to some property located between texas and oklahoma and said to be in a region containing oil he decided to go to texas and oklahoma to investigate and the four boys begged to go along how they went to the oil fields and what stirring adventures they had there are related in detail in the volume preceding this called the rover boys in the land of luck  here they fell in again with nappy martell slugger brown and another goodfornothing lad named gabe werner and also with a man named carson davenport who did his best to do dick rover great harm davenport and some of his cohorts were finally placed under arrest as a result of this gabe werners father took hold of some wells that were being sunk by the davenport crowd but in the end he and the martells and the browns lost a great deal of their money so that they were left almost penniless  its a terrible blow for those three families said dick rover when this occurred it will make mr werner quite a poor man  well i dont particularly wish them any hard luck remarked andy just the same i guess nappy slugger and gabe got what was coming to them  before going down to texas and oklahoma the rover boys while along the rick rack river during a violent storm had succeeded in rescuing a man and his son who were caught between some rocks and a drifting tree in the middle of the swiftly flowing stream  the man john franklin was exceedingly thankful for what had been done for him and so was his son philip it developed later that the franklins owned a tract of land in texas and when it was discovered that the tract inherited by dick rover from the soldier in france was practically worthless jacks father made an arrangement to work the franklin place on shares two oil wells were bored and both of these paid handsomely making the rovers richer than ever and also placing a substantial amount in the bank to john franklins account  do you know i can scarcely believe its true phil franklin had said to the rover boys why my father will have more money than he ever dreamed of  were as glad as you are phil jack had answered glad on your account as well as our own now maybe you can go to colby hall with us  say that would be immense phil had returned with pleasure and that fall he had joined the crowd at the military academy and soon made for himself a host of friends  gee i never thought going to school could be so nice declared phil franklin to the rover boys one day i always considered going to school a hardship but this is bangup in every way  i guess you havent made any enemies yet phil remarked fred dont forget that nappy martell slugger brown and gabe werner all hailed from here  ive met only one fellow that i dont like returned phil franklin thats a fellow who came in the day i did a big tall lanky chap named lester bangs  oh you mean brassy bangs broke in randy i know that fellow only too well i had quite a setto with him one day in the gym  for a new cadet hes certainly pretty forward answered jack im glad he isnt a member of my company if he was i think id have to call him down more than once  i guess colby hall is bound to have its bullies andy had remarked on hearing this no sooner do we get rid of one group than another appears they seem to grow like weeds  during the fall there had been the usual football season at the military academy and the boys had acquitted themselves quite creditably winning seven games out of twelve then had come the brief christmas holidays and following this the lads had settled down once more into the grind resolved to do their best at their lessons but of course they were only boys and they had to have their fun and occasionally the fun went a little too far and brought forth rather disastrous results as we have just seen     chapter iii  what the sneak told   i certainly didnt think that snowball would go down the stairs so easily remarked andy when he and the other rovers were alone  keep quiet warned jack who had remained at the partlyopened door i want to hear what takes place  this is outrageous simply outrageous they heard in snopper dukes highpitched voice how dared you roll such a snowball down these stairs and how came you to get that snowball up there anyway  excuse me professor but i dont know what youre talking about answered another voice and at this jack gave a slight start for he recognized the words as coming from brassy bangs  what is that you do not know anything about the big snowball that just came hurtling down these stairs stormed professor duke  no sir i just reached the top of the stairs answered brassy bangs i came out of my room not ten seconds ago  what do you know about this stowell went on the professor who had now come slowly to the top of the stairs followed by professor grawson who had come out of colonel colbys private office where he had been looking over some reports when the big snowball had landed with a thump against the desk at which he had been seated  me what do you mean stammered the youth who was known to the cadets as codfish and who had always been more or less of a sneak  somebody just rolled a big snowball down the stairs it struck me and nearly knocked me flat returned the irate teacher  yes and it rolled all the way into the private office added professor grawson  i dont know anything about any snowballs said codfish i noticed the floor was all wet and i wondered what it meant  i saw some fellows rushing around the corner came from brassy bangs  who were they demanded snopper duke  i dont know  which way did they go  that way and brassy pointed out the direction  by this time the two professors had reached the top of the stairs and grawson was looking at the water marks on the polished floor  here is where they brought that big snowball in he remarked pointing to the track that led to one of the windows they must have brought it up on the fireescape  here are several other tracks i think we had better follow them returned snopper duke quickly  the track leading to the bathroom was most in evidence and the two professors quickly discovered the big snowball resting in the bathtub  evidently they put this here to have some more fun with announced professor grawson grimly well it wont do much harm here ill turn on a little hot water and it will soon melt and run off and he turned on the faucet as he spoke  from the bathroom the two professors followed by codfish and brassy followed the water trail into a room occupied by several students who were particularly uppish and whom the rovers did not like and here some more of the snowballs were found  here is another trail announced professor duke and in a moment more had thrown open the door leading to stowells bedroom  here what does this mean stammered codfish as after the light had been turned on he and the others saw the two big snowballs resting on either side of the bed  stowell you must have had something to do with this cried snopper duke savagely  no sir not at all sir answered the sneak in a trembling voice i dont know a thing about it  where did you come from just now  ii came up the back stairs i was just coming through the corridor when i heard the noise and came to see what it meant  the back stairs eh put in professor grawson what were you doing on the back stairs this time in the evening  ii was down in the kitchen and now codfish grew pale  and what called you to the kitchen  ii was hungry and so i asked one of the servants for something to eat and now codfish was fairly whining  humph didnt you have any supper  yes sir but i wasnt feeling extra well just then and i didnt eat very much and that made me hungry afterwards and oh say i guess i can tell you something about those snowballs and codfishs face lit up suddenly  what do you know  when i was passing through the little entryway that leads into the kitchen i happened to glance out of the window and i saw four or five fellows down at the foot of the fireescape  what were they doing  when i looked at them they were just talking among themselves i only looked for a moment because i was in a hurry to get to the kitchen and get back again  did you recognize any of the cadets  at this direct question codfish hesitated and showed that he felt far from comfortable  i dont like to tell on anybody he whined if i do that theyll be sure to lick me later oni know they will  you tell me who they were and ill see to it that they do not harm you put in professor duke quickly  i only saw two of the fellows real plainly answered stowell they were standing in the light from one of the windows  and who were they tell me i want no nonsense now and snopper duke caught the sneak firmly by the shoulder  ouch please dont hurt me cried codfish in added alarm  then answer me  the two fellows i recognized were captain jack rover and his cousin lieutenant fred rover  you didnt know the others put in professor grawson  no sir i didnt see them well enough they were all in the shadows  ill investigate this cried professor duke stowell you come with me  oh please dont make me come cried the sneak theyll almost kill me if they find i gave them away  they shant touch you  oh i know what theyll do moaned codfish he had not forgotten how the rover boys had sided with him on more than one perilous occasion and it scared him half to death to think what they might do when they discovered how meanly he was acting  but there was no help for it and codfish was marched along between the two professors with brassy and a number of other cadets who had been attracted by the noise and the talk following  meanwhile the four rover boys had listened to as much of the conversation as they could catch  they went into codfishs roomthey are following the trail of the water on the floor announced jack  some of the other fellows are coming out and coming upstairs announced fred let us go out too and see what happens  maybe theyll accuse codfish of this remarked randy with a grin  the four rovers had just come out in the corridor and been joined by gif phil and spouter when they found themselves suddenly confronted by professor duke with professor grawson and poor codfish directly behind him  so this is your work is it demanded snopper duke glaring angrily at jack and fred in turn  to what do you refer professor asked jack as calmly as he could  you know well enough captain rover it is useless for you to deny it stormed the angry teacher you and your cousins here are responsible for bringing those big snowballs into the school  who says so questioned fred at the same time he gave codfish a look that made the sneak want to hide himself  never mind who says so we know it to be a fact stormed snopper duke will you kindly let me know what you mean by such outrageous conduct  is it so very outrageous professor to bring a few snowballs into the school questioned randy innocently  weve often brought snow into the school put in andy we used to use it for making a sort of homemade icecreamwith milk and sugar and a little flavoring you know  colonel colby or captain dale never ordered us to leave the snow outdoors added fred and at this there was a snicker from among a number of the cadets who were gathered  i will not listen to such nonsense stormed snopper duke you four brought those snowballs into this school and some of you kicked that snowball down the stairs on top of me he added glaring at them  i want to say right now professor duke that that big snowball went downstairs by accident answered andy feeling that there was no help for it and that he must make a clean breast of the matter we were rolling it down the corridor when all at once i slipped in a puddle of water and both my feet struck the snowball and sent it on its way down the stairs but we didnt mean to send it down i can give you my word on that  i dont believe it stormed snopper duke  im telling you the truth sir  perhaps rover didnt mean to send the snowball downstairs put in professor grawson mildly as a general thing he sided with the cadets and they had little difficulty in getting along with him  mr grawson i was the one to suffer through this outrageous trick fumed snopper duke and you will kindly permit me to handle the affair these four cadets are guilty and must be punished  i agree it is more your affair than mine mr duke returned the other teacher but dont you think it would be wise to let the matter rest until colonel colby comes back from the city  not at all not at all these young rascals must be taken in hand and at once otherwise our authority in this institution will go to pieces  at this moment there was a movement among the students who had collected in the corridor and gif and spouter stepped forward  excuse me professor duke said gif but i had as much to do with bringing those snowballs upstairs as anybody  and so did i added spouter  and i was in on the deal too came from phil franklin as he too stepped forward  what all of you demanded snopper duke eyeing them coldly  i can assure you we meant no great harm continued spouter we were only going to have a little fun among ourselves and with our fellowcadetsthat is mostly he added somewhat lamely as he remembered what had been said about placing some of the snowballs in the teachers room  were any others implicated in this despicable piece of business demanded professor duke looking around at the assembled cadets answer me at once  there was no reply to this the cadets simply looking at each other questioningly  were all here sir said jack there were no others and he and his cousins gave their chums a warm look to show they appreciated their coming forward to take a share of the blame  seven of you eh was the teachers sour comment a fine piece of business truly he thought for a moment come with me all of you and well see what damage has been done down in the office  the assembled cadets made a passageway and through this filed the rovers and their chums with professor duke following close on their heels professor grawson remained behind to talk to stowell  theyll kill me for thisi know they will whined codfish and now he was on the verge of tears  i dont think the rovers will touch you stowelli dont think theyre that class of boys answered professor grawson come ill go to your room with you and help you throw those snowballs out of the window he had not forgotten that he had been a schoolboy himself once and he had small sympathy for such a sneak as henry stowell  down in colonel colbys private office it was found that the big snowball had done little damage outside of wetting a couple of the rugs what was left of the snowball had been gathered up by pud hicks the janitors assistant and now he was mopping up the floor  ill take the rugs and dry em in the laundry said hicks i think theyll be all right by morning  you cadets remain here until i return said professor duke when hicks was ready to depart and then he went outside and in the hallway held a whispered conversation with the janitors assistant  i guess were in for it said jack to his cousins and his chums  what do you suppose theyll do with us questioned phil  im sure i dont know  in a few minutes snopper duke returned and there was a grin of satisfaction in his eyes as he faced the cadets  you will all follow me he declared and ill show you what can be done in this school to cadets who act as outrageously as you have acted come march and he led the way out of the private office     chapter iv  prisoners   in one of the wings of the school building there was located a room about twelve feet square with one window which was barred and this as my old readers know was known officially as the school guardroom or prison jack and fred had once been prisoners in this guardroom on a charge that was afterwards proved to be false  gee i wonder if hes going to take us to the guardroom whispered the youngest of the rovers  i dont see how he can crowd seven of us into that small room answered randy why its only got one cot in it  professor duke led the way through the corridor and up the broad stairs in the meanwhile professor grawson had ordered the other cadets to their rooms so there was no one at hand to witness what was taking place  arriving on the second floor snopper duke led the way into another corridor and then up a somewhat narrow stairway leading to the third floor  hello i wonder where hes going to take us now questioned fred in wonder  this is certainly a new wrinkle declared gif  the third floor was but dimly lit until the professor turned on more light then he turned into a little side corridor at the end of which was located a long narrow room which during the previous year had been used by some of the hired help but which was now unoccupied  you will remain in this room until i have a chance to communicate with colonel colby said professor duke as he marched the cadets in and remember i want no cutting up here i want you to remain perfectly quiet  how long shall we have to stay here questioned jack  that will depend on what colonel colby has to say about it was the sharp answer  do you expect us to stay here all night demanded randy  you will have to stay here unless colonel colby gets back from the city and i think that hardly likely tonight answered the teacher now remember no noise and no horseplay or ill do something that you wont forget in a hurry and with this admonition he walked out of the room closing and locking the door after him  listen cried fred as all of the others started to talk at once and going to the door he listened intently and so did the others and they heard snopper duke pass through the little corridor and down the stairs  hes gone all right enough remarked phil franklin  well what do you know about this anyhow cried gif  i think hes treating us like a lot of children declared andy angrily  i dont believe he has any right to keep us out of our regular rooms came from his brother  well anyway he took the right answered jack grimly and what is more he seems to have the best of us  he wont have if we break down that door  i dont think youll have an easy job of it breaking down that door put in spouter i happened to notice that there was not only a regular lock on it but also a top bolt youd have to smash the whole door to get out but it certainly is a despicable piece of business spouter continued and at the first opportunity we have well have to lay the whole case before colonel colby im sure when he has verified our report and gone into the various merits of the case he will make a finding that will be in accordance with  gee spouter can spout even if he is a prisoner burst out randy better get up on a chair spouter and make a regular speech about it he continued grinning  this is a new experience for me remarked phil with a smile i never thought i was going to be put in jail  you can hardly call it being put in jail phil answered jack in a military academy it is quite common for a cadet when he has broken the rules and regulations to be placed in the guardhouse just the same as he is placed in the guardhouse in the regular army  i thought maybe theyd make us do what they call police duty said the boy from texas one fellow told me that while he was in the training camp he overstepped the regulations and they made him peel potatoes until he was sick and tired of seeing them  well they do that too put in fred you might have to do something like that if we were at the annual encampment but while the school session is on all they do is to lock you up  the boys found that the long narrow room contained two double beds and two cots as well as a couple of bureaus several stools and a table at one end was a small bathroom and a clothing closet there were three small windows in a row all looking out on the snowcovered fields behind the school  well weve got a place to sleep anyhow announced jack although three of us will have to sleep in one of the beds  not much in the way of covering remarked gif who had been making an investigation just one thin blanket on each bed and that radiator is not letting out heat enough to warm a cat he added as he placed his hand on the one small radiator of which the long bedroom boasted  never mind we can keep on our uniforms if we want to declared randy and who knows but what colonel colby may come back at any minute and then im almost certain that hell let us go back to our own rooms  he will unless old duke cooks up some dreadful story against us came from his brother you can bet hell make out as black a case against us as he can  yes but i think professor grawson will have something to say too said jack and he has always been a very fairminded man  i dont see why colonel colby took on such a man as snopper duke declared spouter hes every bit as bad as asa lemm was  but youve got to hand it to him for being a very well educated man said jack and he certainly knows how to teach when hes in the humor for it  i dont think a man who is as harshminded as he is ought to be a teacher was gifs comment he cant get a cadet to do his best if hes forever nagging at him now if i was a teacher id do my best to gain my pupils confidence  there was a pause and presently andy began to chuckle  say he certainly did look funny when that big snowball hit him in the stomach and nearly knocked him over he cried  how could you see that when you were on your back questioned fred  oh i managed to flop over and look down the stairs just in time he was some sight believe me its a wonder he didnt go over backward to the floor below i dont know what saved him he must have grabbed the banisters just in time  you cant really blame him for being mad i think maybe id be mad myself said gif however lets drop that what are we going to do go to bed  i dont see that there is anything else to do answered jack  ive got to do something to keep warm declared andy and suddenly turned a somersault over one of the beds then he began to box with his brother and the two spun around from one end of the room to the other  here you stop that warned fred you know what duke said you keep on and hell put us down in the cellar or some other worse place  after this the seven cadets became more quiet and sitting as close as possible to the little radiator which gave forth only a mite of warmth they discussed the situation for half an hour longer  thats another one against codfish declared randy im sure hes guilty  well he had some reason for saying what he did said jack he had to clear his own skirts after they found those two big snowballs in his room  just the same jack you know well enough hardly any other fellow in the school would have squealed cried randy codfish always was a sneak and i guess he always will be no matter what some of the other fellows do for him  say look here i thought you fellows told me that captain dale was in charge of this school whenever colonel colby was absent burst out phil suddenly  thats true answered jack he was in charge all the time the colonel was in the regular army  then why didnt professor duke put this up to the captain  because captain dale is away on a little vacation announced gif he wont be back until some time next week  and where did colonel colby go  they said he had gone to the city answered fred but i dont know what they mean by that they may mean boston or new york or some smaller place  the radiator is growing stone cold declared gif who had his hands on it  whatll you bet old duke didnt turn the heat off broke in andy quickly it would be just like him to do it  i guess about the only thing we can do is to go to bed announced jack  well you had better do it with your uniform on then said spouter because im not going to bed with the windows closed and its going to be beautifully cold by and by  all of the cadets had been accustomed to sleeping with the windows of their bedrooms open but they had also been accustomed to plenty of bed clothing and knew they would probably suffer with the scant quantity of quilts now provided  however they had to make the best of it and in the end did little else but take off their shoes and coats and then wrap themselves in the blankets as best they could of course there was some horseplay in which even phil franklin indulged but on the whole the cadets kept rather quiet for they did not want to make matters worse than they were  the last time randy and i were home our dad laid down the law good and plenty announced andy so weve got to do something towards toeing the mark  im afraid brassy bangs and a lot of the other fellows will have the laugh on us for this remarked fred as he turned in  oh well you cant have fun without paying the piper once in a while was jacks comment  it grew colder during the night and on rising to cut off some of the air that was blowing over him fred noticed that it had begun to snow the fine hard particles were drifting into the room and he called the attention of some of the others to this  i dont care let it snow in if it wants to grumbled randy sleepily  but some of the others demurred to this and presently one of the windows was closed entirely and the others left open only a few inches  gee talk about greenlands icy mountains exclaimed gif on arising a little after seven oclock some coldness if you ask me  you said it declared jack as he got up and walked across the floor to where the radiator was located cold as ice he announced  did you leave it turned on questioned randy quickly  i certainly did  then old duke must intend to freeze us out exclaimed fred what do you know about that  i know its a mean piece of business answered andy gee why we might all catch our death of cold  having washed themselves the cadets lost no time in donning the clothing they had taken off on retiring then they continued to walk around the narrow room in order to keep their blood in circulation it was now about eight oclock and they wondered if they would get any breakfast  a hot cup of cocoa or coffee wouldnt go bad remarked spouter not to say anything about ham and eggs hot muffins or a few other things on the side  yum yum dont mention them groaned andy i feel hollow clean down to my shoes i didnt have any too much supper and i was depending on having a few crackers i had in my closet  and i left an apple on my bureau declared phil  and i had two doughnuts stored away to take to bed with me came from fred  the boys heard the cadets below assembling for roll call and the short morning parade and then heard them march into the mess room of the hall for breakfast  my but i wish i was downstairs right now declared randy i wouldnt do a thing to that breakfast table  maybe theyll bring our breakfast to us suggested jack  if they do you can bet there wont be any too much of itif old duke has anything to do with it returned gif grimly     chapter v  by the fishingpole route   another half hour went by and the boys confined in the room on the third floor of the school building became more and more impatient  perhaps they wont give us any breakfast at all said phil franklin presently  if they dont therell be war declared andy i wont stand for being starved  none of us will stand for that put in gif grimly but i dont believe duke will dare do it you must remember he will have all the other teachers to contend with they have the same rights here as he has  yes but professor grawson turned this affair over to duke was freds comment  that was because old duke was the only one to really suffer through what we did answered jack  another fifteen minutes passed and then those in the room heard footsteps outside the door was unlocked and professor duke appeared followed by pud hicks and bob nixon and two of the messroom waiters  well did you behave yourselves during the night demanded the teacher as he glanced sharply from one to another of the cadets all of whom eyed him curiously  we did sir answered phil who was nearest to the door  leaving those who had accompanied him at the door so that none of the cadets present might escape snopper duke strode into the room and looked around suspiciously even going so far as to glance into the bathroom and the clothing closet as was the custom during the school term the cadets had put the beds and the cots in order and also arranged the chairs and other furniture  professor duke id like to ask something do you know we have no heat in here questioned jack  growing boys like you dont need too much heatit makes them lazy responded the teacher tartly you will be warm enough after you have had your breakfast  can we go downstairs now and get it asked andy quickly  no you are to have it up here i have had it brought up for you was the answer and then professor duke motioned for the two waiters to come in  they carried two trays covered with napkins and these they deposited on the table  has colonel colby come back yet questioned spouter  you will know quickly enough when he comes was the teachers reply and then he motioned the waiters out of the room  professor do you think began bob nixon but the teacher caught the hall chauffeur by the arm and pushed him out into the hallway  never mind now nixon he broke in hastily well talk matters over downstairs and thereupon he closed and locked the door once again and the cadets heard him and all of the others go below  what do you suppose he brought hicks and nixon up here for questioned randy when they were left alone  i dont know unless he thought we might try to break out and if so he would have them along to stop us answered jack  maybe he thought the cold and waiting for breakfast would make us desperate suggested gif however now theyve gone lets see what they have brought us to eat  eagerly the seven cadets whipped away the napkins that covered the two trays they gave one look and then a cry of disappointment arose  what do you know about this  isnt this the limit  black coffee and bread without butter  and mush with nothing but a little molasses on it  and no sugar in the coffee either  talk about your prison fare groaned andy i think this takes the cake  you mention cake and ill murder you burst out fred why dont you speak of ham and eggs lamb chops fried potatoes coffee cake with raisins in it and things like that while youre at it  wow fred for the water faucet exclaimed jack and got his cousin by the arm and made as if to run him into the bathroom  hold up ill be good pleaded the youngest rover but say doesnt looking at these two trays make you weary in the bones  well anyway the coffee is hot declared spouter as he tasted it and we might as well drink it before it gets cold it will help to warm us up  thereupon the seven cadets fell to eating and soon every particle of the scanty breakfast furnished to them had disappeared they grumbled however as they ate and continued to grumble after the repast was finished  im quite sure colonel colby wouldnt treat us like this declared gif  he certainly did much better by fred and me when we were placed in the guardroom declared jack we got as good a meal as we ever had served to us in the mess hall  its nothing short of a crime not to turn the heat on said fred who was examining the radiator again just as cold as ever  listen cried randy suddenly  all did so and heard a faint knocking on the door  who is that questioned jack moving to the portal  is that you jack came in fatty hendrys voice the stout youth was whispering through the keyhole  yes fatty what brought you up here  i got wind that you fellows were being fed scanty rations answered fatty how about it  its true all right enough  illustration our friends are on the job cried fred delightedly rover boys at big horn ranch page 51  well dan soppinger walt baxter and myself got our heads together and we managed to make up a bundle of food for you just watch the window on your right continued the stout youth and then tiptoed away  wondering what their friends intended to do the seven cadets crowded to the window in question and opened it wide it was still snowing and through the thicklyflying flakes they presently saw the end of a fishing pole on which was tied a bundle done up in a pillow case  hurrah our friends are on the job cried fred delightedly as the bundle was slipped from the end of the fishing pole and hauled into the room then he looked out of the window and saw at a little distance the face of dan soppinger at another window  got it all right did you demanded dan as he hauled in the fishing pole  we sure did dan and much obliged to you  has colonel colby come back yet questioned jack looking over his cousins shoulder  no and there is no telling when hell come back answered dan he sent word that his business might keep him away for several days then dan spoke to some one behind him and continued in a low voice ive got to go now or theyll catch us goodbye  the imprisoned cadets closed the window again and then placed the bundle on the table and opened it they found it contained a rather jumbled collection of buttered bread cheese the knuckle of a boiled ham a small glass full of jelly a square of pound cake three bananas a couple of oranges several apples a small bag of lump sugar and a can of condensed milk  some collection all right enough declared spouter as they surveyed it i guess they grabbed up anything they could lay their hands on  they must have heard we had black coffee without sugar put in fred too bad we were in such a hurry we might have feasted in great shape off of this collection  never mind the sugar and condensed milk may come in handy later answered jack  the boys divided some of the fruit and then made themselves a few sandwiches and with this topped off the scanty breakfast they had previously consumed they placed the rest of the things on the top shelf of the closet and folded up the pillow case carefully  well have to send that back the first chance we get declared fred otherwise some cadet is going to catch it when his room is inspected  with nothing to do the cadets found the time drag heavily they looked around the room for some reading matter but found nothing outside of some newspapers which had been placed on the shelves of the closet these were old sheets and contained nothing which they cared to peruse  hurrah were going to have some heat anyhow cried randy about eleven oclock hear the radiator cracking  he was right and soon the radiator became moderately warm this did not of course warm the room very thoroughly but it took the chill off and made it more comfortable than it had been  ill bet a cooky that some of the others made old duke turn the heat on declared gif  either that or else some of our chums turned it on when he wasnt watching answered jack some time later they found out that bob nixon had turned on the heat unbeknown to snopper duke it was also learned that professor grawson and professor brice knew nothing about the heat having been turned off  about halfpast twelve snopper duke appeared again this time with one of the under teachers and two of the waiters the under teacher had his arms full of books  i have had some of your text books brought up here explained professor duke there is no sense in your wasting your time here doing nothing i want you to study the same as if you were attending your classes i have also had your dinner brought up  do you expect us to study in a cold room questioned jack he had thrown one of the small bed covers over the radiator and added a book or two so that the teacher might not notice that it was warm  ill not discuss that point with you rover was snopper dukes sharp reply you can eat your dinner and then go at your studies and thereupon he directed the two waiters to deposit the fresh trays on the table and take the old ones away then the seven cadets were locked up as before  in comparison the dinner was just as scanty as the breakfast had been for each pupil there was a small boiled potato almost cold a few lima beans a small slice of roast beef and one slice of unbuttered bread there were also several paper drinking cups to indicate that the cadets might drink all the water they cared to draw from the faucet in the bathroom  regular misers lunch was andys comment as he surveyed it  exactly answered fred and then he added dryly what are we going to use that sugar and condensed milk on  oh the condensed milk will go fine on the bread put in spouter i used to like condensed milk sandwiches  and you can eat the lump sugar for dessert if you want to put in jack  all began to eat and in the midst of the meal they heard another knock on the door this time ned lowe was there one of their chums who was a great singer and banjo player  be on the watch for the beautiful fishing pole sang ned in a low voice hurry up we cant stay up here very long  all leaped for the window and a few minutes later the fishing rod came once more into view this time with another bundle attached to it they held the end of the pole while they detached the bundle and fastened upon it the empty pillow case the new bundle was in a large paper flour bag  here is where we are going to have a regular feast cried jack with satisfaction just look almost half a boiled tongue a quart jar of hot coffee some boiled sweet potatoes and half an apple pie i declare i dont see how they managed to get hold of it  theyre certainly looking out for us answered spouter  with this addition to the food already on hand the boys started in to have a real good dinner they were enjoying it thoroughly and cracking all kinds of jokes when they suddenly heard a commotion in the corridor outside  ive caught you have i they heard snopper duke exclaim what business have you up here anyway  i wasnt doing any harm professor came in the voice of dan soppinger  what is that you have behind your back give it to me this instant went on the teacher  gee thats dan soppinger and hes got himself into trouble exclaimed jack in alarm  i really didnt mean to do any harm the imprisoned cadets heard dan answer  what is that you are trying to hide give it to me there was a brief silence and then those in the room heard the teacher continue a pumpkin pie and almost a pound of cheese where did you get those things soppinger and what were you going to do with them come answer me  if you want to know i was going to try to get them to those fellows you locked up answered dan soppinger in desperation i heard you were just about starving them to death  whats that starving them to death stuff and nonsense they are getting all that they need and its not for you to interfere in my business went on snopper duke his highpitched voice rising still higher in anger you should be down in your classroom give me those things and go downstairs at once ill attend to your case later  gee poor dan is certainly in hot water whispered jack  old duke must have been spying on him said randy  maybe hell come in here and see how matters are going cried spouter excitedly it might not be a bad thing to get all that extra food out of sight  he had scarcely spoken when they heard professor duke at the door an instant later the portal was thrown open and the teacher stepped in his eyes swept the trays and the plates of food the cadets were holding  ha so this is what is going on eh he stormed having food brought in on the sly eh well ill see that that is stopped youll go without your supper for this and then after a few more words he stormed out of the room banging the door behind him and locking it     chapter vi  a touch of mystery   now i reckon we are worse off than we were before remarked jack as the assembled cadets looked at each other in consternation  if he cuts off our supper the best thing we can do is to save this grub declared randy well have to go on short rations  and when we feel real hungry we can turn to our school books for consolation added his twin brother gee but doesnt this take the cake and picking up his algebra he threw it at phil the boy from texas dodged and the algebra hit the wall behind him  dont start a roughhouse andy remonstrated jack quickly were in deep enough as it is please dont forget that fred and i are worse off than any of you  how do you make that out demanded gif  because we are officers and are supposed to be models for the rest of the cadets  huh i forgot that said gif thats too bad  it must be admitted that the cadets were far less cheerful while finishing their meal than they had been a few minutes before they ate somewhat sparingly and placed what was left of the food in an outoftheway corner under one of the cots  no use of taking chances said jack duke may come in here and search the closet for rations when he gets the dirty dishes  well i suppose we might as well spend our time studying came from spouter presently weve got to learn our lessons no matter if we are prisoners otherwise later on well be marked down for that too  too bad that poor dan had to be caught with that pumpkin pie and cheese groaned randy he was particularly fond of the pies turned out by the hall cooks  making themselves as comfortable as they could around the radiator the seven cadets began to study thus an hour passed and then came more footsteps in the hall  another visitor said jack looking up  when the door was thrown open they expected to see snopper duke or one of the other professors and they were therefore much surprised when colonel colby stepped into the room the master of the hall was alone  attention called jack sharplyfor this had been arranged between the cadets earlier in the dayand thereupon all of the cadets leaped to their feet and saluted  this action came somewhat as a surprise to the master of the school and just the faintest flicker of a smile passed over his features then he closed the door behind him and came forward  i am very sorry to learn that all of you have been breaking the rules of this institution said colonel colby in an even tone of voice captain rover i would like to have your version of the affair if you care to make a report  i dont know that i can make much of a report colonel answered the young captain his face flushing we brought the snowballs into the school and that is all there is to it  well what about sending that big snowball down the stairs on top of professor duke  that was an accident sir and i was responsible for it broke in andy  an accident professor duke is quite certain it was done by design  he is mistaken sir continued andy and then in a few words related exactly how the accident had occurred  well what about the snowballs that were placed in the rooms of stowell besser lunn and in the bathroom  we only meant it for a little fun colonel pleaded fred of course i realize now that maybe we went a little too far  you certainly did go too far lieutenant rover and i am especially surprised to find you and captain rover mixed up in anything of this sort i expect the officers of the cadets to set a good example  i was thinking you might say that colonel colby put in jack quickly and i should have thought of it before i went into the affair but we were having such fun outside snowballing and like that that we got deeper into it before we gave it a second thought  and we really didnt know that we couldnt bring any snow into the school put in phil rather lamely  such an explanation wont go here franklin i expect my students to have more common sense than that of course it may have been nothing but a boyish prank and if you can give me your word that the snowball which went down the stairs and hit professor duke was not aimed at him deliberately i shall feel inclined to let the matter pass  oh colonel colby will you really do that questioned fred eagerly  please remember weve been punished already put in spouter locked up like a lot of criminals and the radiator turned off until we almost froze to death  the radiator turned off questioned the owner of the school it is hot enough now he added as he placed his hand upon it  but it wasnt before answered gif and gave the particulars as he did this colonel colbys face became a study  i will look into that he said and then walked over to one of the cots and also to one of the beds and inspected the thin coverings i trust none of you caught cold  well i did catch a little cold answered spouter and began to cough for what he said was true  after this colonel colby talked to the cadets for fully ten minutes trying to show them that what they had done was not what he expected of them he was kind almost to the point of being fatherly and made several remarks which caused the boys to do considerable thinking  i am afraid some of you lads do not like professor duke said he i am afraid you consider him rather quicktempered and irritable  well he certainly isnt as nice as most of the other teachers declared randy flatly  he always seems to be waiting for a chance to get in on a fellow broke out fred in some ways hes even worse than asa lemm was  but hes a splendid teacher i will say that for him declared jack only the way he sometimes jumps on a fellow is terrible  i shouldnt like to have you boys compare professor duke with that scalawag asa lemm declared colonel colby lemm had a good educationif he hadnt had i should not have engaged him to teach herebut he was not the honest and upright man snopper duke is i will admit that at times he is quicktempered but believe me boys he has good reasons for itor at least there is quite some excuse for his acting that way at times i do not feel like discussing his personal affairs with you but you will be doing a real act of kindness if at times you dont notice his actions when he seems rather sharp i am quite sure he doesnt always mean it  well of course if theres some reason began jack  there is quite a reason captain rover but as i said before i do not care to discuss professor dukes personal affairs further only if i were one of you boys i should go very slow in judging him and now to come back to this present affair i have had a talk with professor duke and i will have another talk this evening and all told i think you have been punished enough so we will call the matter off and you can return to your classrooms  thank you very much colonel colby cried jack and starting forward he offered his hand and the master of the school shook it warmly then all of the other cadets came forward to do likewise  i hope you wont punish those other fellows for getting some extra food up to us said fred as he and andy brought out the hidden things and placed them on one of the trays they only tried to do us a good turn  you may rest assured rover that i shall treat them only as they deserve answered colonel colby and led the way downstairs here the cadets separated each to pay a brief visit to his own room before going down to the classrooms on the lower floor  i wonder what colonel colby meant when he said duke had reasons for being irritable remarked randy  i dont know im sure answered jack thoughtfully  maybe hes suffering from some sickness suggested fred perhaps he ought to have an operation and hates to have it done  maybe hes worried about money matters came from randy  it was certainly something worth while or colonel colby wouldnt have been so serious about it said fred gee im sorry if i misjudged him if there is really something wrong  i dont believe colonel colby would caution us if it wasnt so said jack and after this im going to give duke as much consideration as i possibly can  the boys had been told to go to their classrooms but this was hardly necessary for they had just about presented themselves when the afternoon session of the school came to an end then they followed some of their friends down to the gymnasium where they were at once surrounded and asked to give the particulars of what had happened to them  it wasnt a great deal said jack and first of all i want to know what was done to dan and the others  oh colonel colby read us a little lecture thats all answered walt baxter one of the cadets he told us we had no right to take any of the food without asking for it  i offered to pay for it put in ned lowe and so did dan but the colonel said that wasnt the point that he wanted the discipline of the hall maintained  did he say anything about professor duke questioned fred  not a word  well he told us something continued the youngest rover and then related what had been said on the subject  say that squares with something i once heard cried walt baxter i met professor duke down at the barn one day where he was waiting to have nixon drive him down to town the professor was walking around wringing his hands and muttering to himself he looked all out of sorts and he said something that sounded to me like i dont see how i can do it i dont see how i can really attempt it  and what do you suppose it was that bothered him walt questioned jack curiously  im sure i dont know i watched him walk up and down and wring his hands and then he took a notebook out of his pocket and began to study some of the figures in it then nixon came along with the auto and he jumped in and rode off  well that sure is a mystery declared randy  this news concerning snopper duke gradually spread throughout the school and many of the boys watched the teacher curiously in the meantime colonel colby had a conference not only with duke but also with professor grawson and when the classes opened the next day jack and the others found themselves treated just as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred  colonel colby said he would let the matter pass and i guess hes going to keep his word remarked fred  there was only one boy who remained troubled and that was codfish he avoided the rovers and the others as much as possible often running away at the sight of them  codfish is just about scared stiff remarked randy he knows he got himself in wrong  what a poor fish he is answered his twin  on saturday afternoon a number of the boys obtained permission to visit the town and attend the moving picture performance if they so desired jack had telephoned to his sister and martha had answered that probably a number of girls from clearwater hall would be in town at the same time  and ive got something to tell you too jack said martha over the wire something im sure youll be interested in hearing  why dont you tell me now he replied  oh this isnt something to tell over a public telephone his sister answered  the snowstorm had come to an end and it was clear and bright overhead when the four rovers and some of the others tramped to haven point here at the railroad station they met martha and mary and also ruth stevenson may powell and several other girls from the academy  how are your eyes feeling ruth questioned jack anxiously as he walked side by side with the girl on the way to the moving picture theater as my old readers know ruth had once suffered dreadfully through getting some pepper into her eyes and it had been feared that she might go blind  oh my eyes are quite all right again jack answered the girl sometimes they feel the least bit scratchy but i bathe them with a solution the doctor gave me and then they feel quite natural  im mighty glad to hear that jack returned warmly for of all the girls who were friends of his sister he liked ruth the best  as luck would have it there was a very good show on that afternoon and as a consequence a crowd had assembled to obtain tickets of admission randy went ahead to get all the tickets needed and while he did this martha plucked her brother by the coat sleeve and drew him a little to one side  whats this youve got to tell me martha questioned the young captain in a whisper  its about a fellow at your schoola chap named lester bangs replied the girl  oh you mean the fellow we call brassy bangs what about him  he and one or two of his particular chums have been up to clearwater hall three times they took some of the girls out in a sleigh they hired and that bangs did his level best to get ruth to go along and now he has invited her to attend some kind of a party next week was marthas reply words which for some reason he could not explain even to himself cut jack to the heart     chapter vii  something about a sleighride party   what kind of a party is it martha  i dont know except that its somewhere out of town and some of the girls and fellows are going to the place in sleighs i wasnt asked to go and i got the information in a roundabout way  then ruth hasnt said anything to you about it  not a word but im sure she received this lester bangs invitation  and you think she may accept it  i hope not jack because i dont like bangs he wears such showy clothing and jewelry  thats the reason we call him brassyhe is brassy in looks and brassy in manner hes just as much of a hotair bag as tommy flanders went on the young captain referring to an arrogant youth who the summer before had pitched for longley academy and been knocked out of the box  isnt it queer he put me in mind of flanders whispered martha i hope you dont have any trouble with him jack and then as some of the others came closer the private conversation had to come to an end  while in the moving picture theater jack sat with ruth beside him they occasionally spoke about the scenes presented to them and also about school matters in general but not one word was said by either about the party martha had mentioned  mr falstein certainly gets good pictures remarked the girl when the performance had come to an end and the crowd of young people was moving out of the theater theyre just as good as one can see in the big cities  theyre the same thing only he gets them a little later answered jack  i like the comic pictures better than anything declared andy i hate those serious ones theyre generally so awfully mushy  why andy rover how you talk cried alice strobell i think that picture they showed today of life in a big city was perfectly grand  especially where the heroine sobbed herself to sleep over the sewing machine in her garret room went on andy with a snicker wasnt that just the tearbringer  i dont care it was just as true to life as it could be answered alice sturdily  well maybe was the airy return of the funloving rover come to think of it i never did run a sewing machine in a garret room with the snow blowing through a busted window id rather sit in the shade of the old apple tree reading a good book and getting on the outside of some ripe pears he continued and at this there was general laughter  as was their custom the young folks drifted from the theater to a nearby candy and icecream establishment here they split up into various groups at some tables in the rear of course the boys insisted on treating the girls and there was quite a discussion over what each would have martha and mary had paired off with gif and spouter and fred and the twins were with some of the other girls and this left ruth and jack by themselves  several times the young captain wanted to bring the conversation around to the question of the party that had been mentioned but every time he checked himself  what were you going to say questioned ruth when he caught himself once you act as if you had something on your mind of special importance jack  not at all not at all he returned hastily how are you getting along with your studies ruth do your eyes interfere much with them  not a great deal but of course i have to be more or less careful but im doing finely so the teachers say  were going to have an election of officers soon continued the young captain some of the fellows are urging me to run for major of the battalion ralph mason is going to drop out you know  oh jack why dont you run  do you want me to run ruth  why of course if theres any chance of getting it and i dont see why there shouldnt be she returned quickly  her manner was so intimate that once again he was on the point of mentioning the party but then he shut his teeth hard and pretended to be interested in something taking place at the other tables  dont you think you could win the election if you tried ruth continued after looking at him questioningly for a moment  oh i guess id have as good a chance as any one in command of course there are a number of other officers who would have as good a chance as id have but im not altogether sure that i want to be major if i held that office colonel colby would expect me to toe the mark all the time just as an example to the others even as it was he didnt like to have me as a captain and fred as a lieutenant mixed up in that snowball affair  oh but jack think of the honor of being major of the battalion cried the girl im sure martha and your folks will be very proud of you  would you be proud ruth if i should win the position he asked in a low tone  why of coursewe all would returned the girl her face flushing slightly i always like to see my friends make something of themselves  ruths tone was cordial enough and once again jack was on the point of switching the talk to the party but now some of the young folks had finished and the little gathering began to break up and he and ruth were surrounded by the others  weve got to do some shopping declared mary when they were out on the sidewalk so we cant remain with you boys any longer and a few minutes later the crowd separated the girls hurrying in one direction and the cadets in another  you let me know if you hear any more about that party whispered jack on parting from his sister  i will she answered  on starting back for the hall jack paired off with fred and purposely lagged behind  did you hear anything about a party in which brassy bangs was interested he asked of his cousin  mary said that brassy was getting up some sort of party to come off either thursday or friday of this week the crowd is going somewhere in two big sleighs  she didnt say where  she didnt know  did she say who was going  as far as she knew the crowd of fellows consisted of brassy and two or three of his chums at the hall and some young fellows around town  and what about the girls fred  they asked jennie mason and ida brierley to go and a number of the other girls from clearwater  did they ask may  mary wasnt sure but she rather thinks that may and ruth both got an invite although in some kind of roundabout way did ruth say anything to you about it  not a word but martha did she too thought ruth had an invitation but she didnt mention may  i wonder if may and ruth will go questioned the youngest rover he was almost as chummy with spouters cousin as jack was with ruth  im sure i dont know fred but i do know id hate to see either of them going out with such a fellow as brassy  it will be a shame to have any of those girls associate with him burst out fred indignantly hes not in their class at allhes altogether too loud and flashy  he certainly sports a lot of cheap jewelry was jacks comment and that suit of clothes that he had on when he first came to the hall was a scream  lets go around to the livery stable and see if we can find out something about the party  the place fred had in mind was located on a side street less than a block away and it did not take the two young officers long to reach it they found the liverystable keeper out but one of his assistants came forward to see what they wanted  hello waxy cried jack cordially for he had met the young fellow many times before how are you these days  fine as a spiders web answered waxy with a grin  i understand youre going to use your two big sleighs for a party this week for some of our fellows went on the young captain  yes both sleighs are hired for thursday or friday night was the answer but you could get em for any other night you might want went on waxy with an eye to business  where is the party to be held questioned fred  i dont know exactly theyre to go about twelve miles out of town so i was told  some young fellows from town helping to get it up i believe  yes tom drake bill fenny joe mcguire ted rosenblatt and a bunch of others are interested theyll have one high old time you believe me went on the liverystable keepers assistant with a grin  rather a lively bunch are they questioned jack  about as lively as this town affords  its a wonder some of our fellows are going with them was freds comment  oh thatll be all right there wont be anything out of the way put in waxy hastily afraid that he had said too much theyll have a lively time but everything will be perfectly all right  maybe answered jack and then after a few more words with the assistant the two cadets hurried off after their chums  if mcguire and rosenblatt have anything to do with that party it will certainly be a lively one said fred on the way to the school theyre the liveliest fellows this town affords  it wont be any kind of a party for our girl friends to attend remarked jack i certainly hope may and ruth dont go  maybe we ought to warn them jack  if we did that somebody might say we were sore because we werent invited fred  i know it but its a shame just the same  we might let martha and mary know what we found out and then they might put a flea in the ears of the other girls  it must be confessed that jack was rather sober that night and all day sunday he could not get the coming party out of his mind and he wondered constantly whether ruth would really accept the invitation which had been extended to her along with a number of other cadets he attended church in town but owing to the fact that it had begun to snow again none of the girls from clearwater hall were present at the services  i guess i might as well call martha up on the phone he told fred sunday evening  all right was his cousins reply and dont forget to mention may  when the young captain had his sister on the wire he learned a number of things that surprised him not a little it seemed that the matter of the coming sleighride party had been rather freely discussed at clearwater hall and a number of the pupils there were divided on the question as to whether to participate in the affair or not jennie mason ida brierley and four or five others were in favor of accepting while others had either declined or were noncommittal  some of the girls have gotten almost into a fight over it said martha its the liveliest thing that has happened in this school in a long while i believe if the discussion keeps up none of the girls will be allowed to go even though two married ladies from the town are to go along as chaperones  did you hear anything further about ruth or anything about may questioned jack  not a word of course not having been invited myself i didnt care to question either of them for fear they might think i was just a bit jealous or something like that  well i dont think they ought to go to any such party answered jack and then told what he and fred had learned at the livery stable  ive heard of joe mcguire and also heard of ted rosenblatt exclaimed martha i certainly shouldnt want to be seen in their company ill have to mention this to some of the others and here the conversation had to come to an end  on monday morning jack met brassy bangs in one of the corridors and noticed that the loudspoken youth looked at him rather speculatively nothing however was said and the young captain entered one of the classrooms and was soon deep in his studies that evening however brassy bangs and two of his chums were missing from their usual places at one of the messhall tables  they got permission to go to town i suppose they went to make further arrangements about that big sleighing party remarked randy  to show that he meant to do his best as captain of company c jack put in a full day on tuesday drilling his command and in the classrooms as a consequence that evening found him pretty well worn out from his duties yet he had some studying he felt he must do and so announced he was going to sit up for a while after his cousins who occupied rooms on both sides of him had retired  the young captain was hard at work doing some examples in geometry when there came a sudden sharp rap on his door thinking that one of his school chums had come to have a word with him before retiring he threw the door open and found himself confronted by brassy bangs  i want to have a few words with you jack rover cried the loudmouthed cadet savagely and then closing the door he advanced upon the young captain in anything but a friendly manner     chapter viii  a fight and a challenge   jack rover could see that brassy bangs was laboring under great excitement the youth who loved to dress in such a showy manner was red of face and his eyes glittered in a manner calculated to make any one quail before him  but the young captain of company c was not going to quail and he stood his ground and looked the other youth squarely in the face  you want a few words eh he said coldly well what is it  you know well enough what brought me here cried brassy ive a good mind to wipe up the floor with you  im not fighting just now bangs but dont forget that i can defend myself if its necessary answered the young captain quickly and then he added now say what youve got to say or get out  ill stay as long as i please blustered the showy youth its a fine piece of business youve been intrying to belittle me and my chums in the eyes of the girls at clearwater hall  if you came here to talk about the young ladies from clearwater the sooner you get out the better answered jack his face flushing  thought you were pulling off a fine stunt didnt you when you talked to ruth stevenson about me sneered brassy  i havent said a word to miss stevenson about you  i know better jack rover you went to her and some of the other girls and told them that my chums and i were no good and that the sleighride party we and some other fellows were getting up was going to be the wildest thing that ever took place at haven point  youre entirely mistaken bangs and the sooner you get out of here the better it will please me  do you dare deny that you hauled us over the coals with those girls at clearwater hall  i decline to discuss the matter any further with you answered the young captain  see here rover you cant ride any high horse like that with me blustered brassy you and your cousins and some of the other fellows did your best to queer our whole sleighing party and youve got to take the consequences and now brassy bangs doubled up his fists and tried to look more dangerous than ever  see here bangs if you dont stop your noise and get out of here ill put you out returned jack in a low but firm voice i dont want any fight with you but i want you to understand that i can hold up my end every time  like pie you can you put on a big front as a captain but i know your sort well enough you cant pull the wool over my eyes you went to the girls school and shot off your mouth and you are going to take the consequences and without further ado brassy bangs stepped forward and aimed a heavy blow at jacks face  had the fist landed as intended jack might have been knocked flat but the young captain had not been in athletic training for several years for nothing and he dodged quickly brassy was carried forward so that his arm shot over jacks shoulder and his body came in contact with the young captains arm the next instant jack had him by the back of the collar and was holding him at arms length  now you get out of here he cried and tried to drag brassy toward the door  of course the other youth squirmed and in an instant there was a rough and tumble scuffle jack was pushed against the wall and retaliated by forcing brassy backward over a chair then the two spun around the room upsetting a stand containing a number of books  hello whats going on here came a voice from one of the side rooms and fred appeared he had been in bed and was attired only in his pajamas  jack and brassy were so wrought up by this time that neither paid attention to the interruption nor did they take notice when another door opened and andy and randy came into view brassy managed to break away and land a blow on jacks arm and in return received a crack in the chin which sent his head backward and all but unbalanced him  gee its a regular fight burst out andy i didnt know brassy was here  neither did i said fred why didnt you call us jack  he didnt give me time answered the young captain he accused me of getting him into trouble at clearwater hall and then pitched into me  ill fix you yelled brassy who was now almost beside himself with rage ill fix you and he made another lunge for jack  but the blow he intended to deliver fell short and before he could recover the young captain came at him with a crack in the ear followed by another on the cheek and these caused brassy to stagger into a corner where he held fast to a chair  say you fellows will have colonel colby here in another minute warned fred  i dont care who comes bellowed brassy recklessly but see here im not going to fight four of you he went on sullenly as he glared from one to another of the rovers  there wont be any more fight cried jack who had no desire to be brought up before the master of the school again fred open that door and then as the youngest rover did so he added to his opponent now get out of here before i throw you out  you cant throw me out blustered brassy but then as jack advanced on him threateningly he made a sudden spring for the door and ran out into the corridor im not going to fight four to one but just waitthis isnt ended yet he went on and then disappeared  fred closed the door again and he and the others gathered around jack who was panting from his unexpected exertions  gosh but he looked mad was randys comment what was it all about  in as few words as possible the young captain explained the situation so far as he was able  brassy must have gone over to clearwater hall and there got the idea that you were queering that proposed party was freds comment well im glad if the girls are wise to what is going on  better chew this over in the morning admonished andy the thing now is to get into bed and put out the lights one of the professors may be up here any minute  this advice was considered good and with lightninglike rapidity the room was placed in order and the others retired again leaving jack to undress and go to bed as quickly as possible a little later one of the monitors came through the hall but none of the rovers was disturbed  it was not until two days later that the rovers heard the particulars of what had occurred at clearwater hall then they learned that unknown to any of the girls one of the teachers had been delegated by miss garwood the head of the academy to make a quiet investigation concerning the proposed sleighing party and when this teacher had found out who were on the committee of arrangements miss garwood had forbidden any of the young ladies to participate when this became known brassy bangs had at once concluded that jackand perhaps some of his relatives and friendswas responsible for what had occurred the party had been called off  im glad its called off said jack  so am i returned fred but believe me jack brassy will have it in for you after this  possibly  you didnt hear anything about what girls intended to go did you put in randy  i heard jennie mason ida brierley and nettie goss mentioned thats all answered jack  he would have given a good deal to have known what was the real attitude of ruth and may toward the party but as before neither he nor fred felt inclined to make any direct inquiries  it almost looks as if brassy had expected ruth to go with him murmured the young captain to himself when he was alone that night and it must be confessed that the thought made him feel quite gloomy  after this incident matters ran along smoothly for a week or more at the hall during that time the snow commenced to melt and almost before the cadets knew it it had disappeared entirely  in the meanwhile there was constant talk of the election for officers that was to take place ralph mason the major of the school battalion was about to leave as was also one of the captains so there would be first an election to fill these vacancies and then another election in case one or both vacancies were filled by those who were already acting as officers  i really think you ought to try for the majorship said gif to jack you certainly have done well as a captain  it would be very nice gif was jacks reply but i feel sometimes as if i ought to give some of the other fellows a show  but they may not want it answered andy look at me for instance i dont want to be an officer and neither does randy and gif here would rather continue at the head of our athletics  yes but you fellows are not the whole school declared jack with a smile  i know lots of fellows who want you to run declared spouter and you say the word and ill go around and do a lot of electioneering for you  the matter was talked over a good many times and fully twenty of the cadets came to jack and told him they wanted him to run for the office of major and finally he consented  hello heres news burst out fatty hendry one day as he joined his chums its the richest thing ever and he grinned broadly  whats that questioned dan soppinger who was present  i just heard through teddy brown that brassy bangs wants to run for major that he even told one of the professors about it  why he cant do that declared fred quickly that is not without special permission from colonel colby or captain dale the major is always chosen from among the captains and lieutenants or those who have been officers before that is if there is any one to pick its only colonel colby or captain dale who can declare the election open to any one you cant put a fellow who has just learned to handle a gun to march at the head of the battalion  well of course brassy didnt know that and he wouldnt believe it until captain dale explained it to him and then he said he thought he ought to be able to hold the position because he was one of the best shots in the school  well he certainly is a good shot declared fred i saw him shooting at a target one day and he certainly made some marvelous hits  he comes from the westfrom some place where everybody knows how to shoot declared walt baxter i heard him telling some of the fellows about it one day he said he had learned to ride and to shoot when he was only six or seven years old and he can ride all right enough too i saw him do it one day when i was on the road back of the point  well i think a few of us can do a little shooting declared andy dont forget that out of a possible twentyfive points fred once made nineteen and jack eighteen  oh yes i remember that put in ned lowe that was the time lew barrow scored twenty  yes and the time i scored the whole of ten chuckled andy but i dont care he added proudly i guess i brought down my share of small game when we went hunting  the talk concerning brassy bangs wanting to run for the office of major was true and the cadet was much disgusted when he found that the regulations of the hall forbade this  i can beat any one of them at shooting he grumbled to paul halliday one of his particular cronies and the fellow who had aided in trying to get up the sleighing party  of course you can was hallidays quick reply then he went on say lest why dont you challenge jack rover and his cousin fred to shoot against you you can show em up in great shape it would be better than fighting them  ill do it announced brassy promptly for the idea was one that appealed to him ill shoot against them with either pistols or rifles just as they may choose ill show em up for a couple of dubs when it comes to handling firearms  thats the talk broke in billy sands another of bangs chums you say the word and paul and i will take the challenge to the rovers right away  all provided colonel colby or captain dale will permit the contest said brassy sourly maybe thats another one of the things their dirty rules wont allow  the matter was talked over for a while longer and the three boys went off to interview captain dale he listened to them with a smile and then nodded  of course you can have a contest of that sort if you desire bangs he said presently  following this the challenge to jack and fred was promptly issued it of course came as a surprise to the rovers  we ought not to dirty our hands with a fellow like bangs declared the young captain to fred  oh we cant afford to refuse jack cried his cousin if we did the fellows in the hall would think we were afraid  and thereupon the challenge was accepted     chapter ix  the shooting contest   it was decided that the shooting contest should take place the next day  it doesnt give us much time to practice grumbled fred  we might as well have it over with answered jack there is no use of allowing it to interfere with our lessons or with the coming election for officers  do you think we can shoot as well as brassy  we can try fred from all reports hes quite a wonderful shot it seems he comes from a place where everybody is used to firearms  it had been decided to hold the contest on the regular range back of the school grounds fred and jack had been in favor of rifles but the boy from the west had voted in favor of pistols as a consequence captain dale had told them the contest would be divided into two parts of a possible fifteen points each the first part to take place with pistols and the second with rifles  say you fellows have just got to snow brassy under cried randy dont leave him a leg to stand on  thats easy enough to say randy answered jack but it isnt so easy to do  i know it and i was only fooling however do your best and make some kind of showing against that loudmouthed fellow  early on the morning of the contest jack and fred received permission to take rifles and pistols and do a little practicing with the firearms they went out alone not wishing to be disturbed by any one  as they were crossing the fields they saw a figure coming from a side road the person approaching had the cape of his overcoat drawn up tightly around his throat and wore his cap pulled down well over his forehead  that fellow looked like brassy bangs declared fred as the distant figure leaped over a hedge and disappeared  it certainly did look like brassy answered his cousin but what in the world could he be doing out so early in the morning  maybe he was practicing a little on his own account  he didnt have any gun with him  thats right but he might have a pistol  he never struck me as a fellow who would get up so very early he always appeared to be rather lazy and besides that he didnt come from the range he came from the river road  i know it jack maybe hes been out all night for a good time with some of those fellows from town  after this the two rovers lost no time in hurrying to the rifle range and there practised with their pistols and their rifles until it was time to return to the hall for roll call and the drill before breakfast  well we may not win but well make some kind of a showing remarked fred  it was a clear day the air just bracing enough to put the cadets of colby hall in good spirits when the time came for the contest nearly all of them hurried to the range  now then lest show em what you can do cried paul halliday  the rovers wont have a lookin broke out billy sands it will be a regular walkaway for lest  dont be so sure of that answered gif  brassy may be all right enough with a pistol but dont forget that jack and fred know how to handle a rifle added spouter  a coin was tossed up and it was thereby decided that the contest with pistols should take place first each contestant was to shoot three times the rings on the target counting from 1 to 5 the three contestants were to shoot in rotation fred first brassy second and jack last  if fred was a trifle nervous when he went to the front to shoot he did his best to control it taking as careful aim as possible he fired  a three  thats good enough for a starter  with a selfsatisfied look on his face brassy bangs strode forward took quick aim and fired  a bullseye shouted billy sands in delight  i told you he could do it added paul halliday  when jack came to the front he managed to make a 4  thats the stuff cried randy youre only one point behind  on the second round fred managed to make a 4 while jack scored a 3 thus tying the rovers brassy scored a 4  seven to nine in favor of bangs  then came the third round and again fred scored a 3 and jack did likewise while brassy delighted his cronies by scoring another bullseye  a total of ten each for the rovers  and fourteen for bangs  i told you lest could hold em down shouted billy sands  just wait till they shoot with the rifles hell walk away from em added paul halliday  it must be admitted that the rovers and their chums were somewhat disappointed that the score stood four points in favor of brassy  now fred do your best whispered andy to his cousin as the latter went to the front after carefully examining the rifle handed to him by captain dale  the firearm was a light affair but of approved pattern and supposed to be quite accurate for use at a distance of two hundred yards  fred took longer to aim with the rifle than he had with the pistol and there was a breathless silence until after the report rang out  a four  thats the stuff fred  now brassy let us see what you can do  as confident as ever brassy bangs came to the front took the rifle handed to him and shot rather hastily  a three  jack was up next and to the dismay of many of his friends made only a 2  then came the second round with rifles and in that fred scored a 4 bangs a 1 and jack a 3  hurrah fred rover and brassy bangs are tied with eighteen points each  and jack rover has fifteen points  then came the final round and amid a breathless silence fred shot and scored a bullseye then came bangs and made a 2 and jack ended the contest with a bullseye  hurrah fred rover wins the match with twentythree points  yes and jack rover and brassy bangs are tied for second place with twenty each  hurrah for fred rover  pretty good shooting ill say  it was all to the merry fred exclaimed jack as he caught his cousins hand you did fine  the best ever burst out andy  say jack why dont you and brassy shoot off the tie questioned spouter  im willing was the ready reply of the young captain  ill shoot off the tie with pistols put in brassy quickly  no let it be with rifles broke in randy  ill tell you what i think would be fair announced captain dale each of you take one shot with a rifle and one shot with a pistol and after quite a little discussion it was so agreed  the pistols were used first and there brassy made a bullseye while jack managed to register a 4 then the rifles were used and here jack shooting first made a bullseye while brassy got a 2  hurrah nine to seven in favor of captain rover  some shooting jack  if you had shot as good as that in the first contest you might have beaten fred  im quite content even if i didnt beat fred announced the young captain with a smile  brassy bangs was quite gloomy over the outcome of the contest and he and his cronies lost no time in quitting the range  im mighty glad you two fellows beat him announced gif maybe it will take a little of the conceit out of him  well gif youve got to admit hes a wonderful shot with the pistol answered jack  yes and his rifle work isnt any worse than mine answered andy now ill promise to make a lot of bullseyes for you if youll let me use a goodsized shotgun or a blunderbuss and at this there was a snicker  for the rest of that day brassy bangs had little to say but the next morning he was as loudmouthed as ever declaring that he would have won the contest had he been allowed to use his own pistola long affair of the oldfashioned western variety  had he done that it might have given him one more point declared randy of course that would have put him ahead of jack in the first contest but it wouldnt have helped him when it came to the rifle work  oh lets drop brassy said jack i am really getting tired of hearing of him  i cant bear him put in phil franklin once or twice he has tried to become chummy with me but ive always given him the cold shoulder  it was now drawing on toward the time for the election and there was a great deal of wirepulling among the various cadets as to who might run for the offices three names were in the field for the office of major jack a captain glasby and a lieutenant harkness  glasby was a fellow who was very well liked while harkness was a lieutenant who at one time had been more or less of a crony of nappy martell gabe werner and others of the crowd that had been opposed to the rover boys  well i shant complain if glasby gets the position declared jack but id hate mightily to see lieutenant harkness at the head of the school battalion  i never liked harkness myself put in spouter he isnt a bit better in many respects than gabe werner  it was soon noised around the school that brassy bangs and his cronies were doing their best for harkness while another crowd led by bart white were rooting in rather a lively fashion for captain glasby  weve got to get busy for jack said gif to spouter come on lets sound out all the fellows in the hall we think we can influence and thereupon he and spouter and a number of others set to work to electioneer for jack as hard as they could  several days before the election andy and randy obtained permission to go to haven point on an errand it was rather a disagreeable misty day and they were tramping along through the mud on the outskirts of the town when they saw brassy bangs and a stranger ahead of them the stranger was a tall thin individual dressed in an oldfashioned suit of rusty black and with a big slouch hat pulled well down over his head he was puffing away at a large black cigar and seemed to be very much in earnest in what he was saying to brassy  i saw that fellow around the school about a week ago declared randy he didnt look like a very nice sort either  he certainly has a fiercelooking mustache was andys comment and its as red as his hair  i tell you i cant do it and thats all there is to it the boys heard brassy exclaim in reply to something the stranger had said  and i say youve got to do it returned the man and his tone was decidedly ugly youve got to do itor otherwise youve got to take the consequences  you wouldnt be so mean haddon pleaded brassy and now the rovers could see that he was more or less scared  wouldnt i returned the strange man harshly you just try me and see the best thing you can do is to agree to what i said if you dont well and here the tall man shrugged his shouldersyoull do as i said beforeor youll take the consequences     chapter x  spouters secret   say this is rather interesting remarked randy in a low tone to his brother  that fellow is certainly threatening brassy returned andy i wonder what it can be all about  he wants brassy to do something  the two rovers kept on behind bangs and the man called haddon and presently saw them turn down a side street where was located a small factory that had been in operation during the war but which was now closed both disappeared into a shed attached to the factory  lets see if we can find out what its all about said randy  im willing answered his twin maybe that fellow will grow abusive and hurt brassy  well a good licking wouldnt hurt him answered his brother with a grin  oh thats all right but we dont want to see him half killed even if we dont like him  you trust brassy to take care of himself was the quick reply  the twins hurried to the shed and there found that the door had been left open and that the man and their fellowcadet had gone into another part of the low building  you know as well as i do that that barn and them hosses was worth at least twelve thousand dollars the man was saying to brassy that was a big loss for john calder  please dont say another word about it pleaded brassy  i wont if youll do as i told you to  but ive let you have a hundred and ten dollars already its every cent i can spare  well ive got to have more  ill bet youve been gambling it away haddon  its none of your business what bud haddon does with his money exclaimed the stranger with a toss of his head and blowing a ring of tobacco smoke toward the ceiling of the shed if you dont want me to start things you do as i told you to  do you know what i think exclaimed brassy after a pause i think those tramp cowboys were guilty  you cant put that off on no cowboys exclaimed bud haddon i know all about it and so do jillson and dusenbury  they dont know anythingat least they dont know anything about me cried brassy but it was plainly to be seen that he was exceedingly nervous somebodys been cooking up a story against me  aint nobody cookin up nothin growled the man i know what im talkin about youd better get busy if you know when youre well off if you dont and your uncle gets wind of thiswell goodnight for you  oh dont say anything to my uncle please dont  well then you get busy ive hung around here about as long as i intend to im goin back to chicago in a few days  at this juncture the rovers heard a noise outside and several boys playing hideandseek appeared not wishing to be discovered by brassy and his companion andy and randy hurried out into the street and up to the corner here they waited for a while and presently saw brassy and bud haddon come forth the man sauntered away in the direction of the town while brassy sped off on the winding road leading to colby hall  now what do you make of this questioned randy as he and his brother continued on their errand  it looks rather suspicious to me answered andy it looks as if brassy had done something that wasnt right and this man was going to expose him unless brassy paid over some hush money  yes and from what brassy said he evidently has already paid the man one hundred and ten dollars  on the way back to colby hall after their errand was finished the twins discussed the matter but could arrive at no satisfactory conclusion that evening they told their cousins of what they had heard and also mentioned the matter to gif and spouter  it looks to me as if that bud haddon had a hold on brassy remarked jack but whether brassy is really guilty or not of some wrongdoing remains to be found out  i wouldnt put it past him to do something that wasnt right came from fred  that remains to be seen fred brassy might do some things that we wouldnt do but at the same time i doubt if hes so very bad at heart hes loudmouthed and has a hasty temper and he likes to show off and all that sort of thing but that doesnt say hes a criminal  that bud haddon looks like a bad one announced randy i wouldnt trust him with a nickel  it certainly is a mystery came from fred just the same as its a mystery about professor duke  gosh dont mention duke broke out gif i had all i could do to keep from getting into a row with him this morning he certainly is a tart one at times  but he looks troubled answered jack ever since colonel colby spoke about him ive been watching him carefully and believe me that man has something on his mind thats far from pleasant  he certainly comes and goes a good deal said spouter he was away several hours last night and the night before and i understand hes going away tomorrow afternoon again  colonel colby must know its all right otherwise he wouldnt let him go away so much declared gif  on the following morning when the mail was distributed spouter received a letter from his father that interested him greatly he read the communication several times and then placing it in his pocket ran off to where he had left gif  come on gif he cried gayly ive got great news come ahead and help find the rovers  whats the news demanded the other as they hurried on side by side  just wait and ill tell you all about itmaybe and then spouter stopped short struck by a sudden idea he thought for a few seconds and then his face broke into a broad smile  the two boys found the rovers up in room 20 which the four cousins used as a sitting room all were busy studying and looked up in surprise as spouter dashed in with gif at his heels  glorious news boys glorious news sang out spouter as he beamed at them  what is it they demanded in chorus  glorious i tell you glorious spouter waved his hands eloquently why remain cooped up here within the dingy walls of a school when the mighty plains the boundless forests the leaping streams and the azure blue of the skies await you why snuff the tainted air of the musty classroom when the free ozone of the hills and mountains beckons to you why waste time over musty books when rifle and fishing rod can be had when one can fling himself in the saddle and go dashing madly across the  jumping crabs and hopping mud turtles exclaimed andy spouter has got em again  what is this spouter demanded randy a moving picture or just a plain everyday nightmare  ha ha continued spouter prancing around whoopee bang bang let her go boys lasso him quick before he gets away and the talkative cadet made a movement as if throwing a lasso  say spouter come down to earth will you cried jack grabbing his chum by the shoulder whats the matter with you  maybe he swallowed a few yeast cakes by mistake remarked andy  its the best news ever fellows went on spouter i got it this morning  all right lets have it came quickly from fred  ive been waiting for this news for several weeks  news from where came from the others  news from home  from your dad questioned randy  exactly  what has he done nowbought you an automobile questioned gif  better than that  for goodness sake spill out what youve got to say returned fred in exasperation  when we went to cedar lodge on our grand hunt we were gifs guests resumed spouter this summer the tables are to be turned and all of you are to be the guests of yours truly  gee that sounds interesting spouter cried randy  where do we go and when questioned his twin  youre to go just as soon as school shuts down and you can get ready  and where to questioned jack curiously  ha thats the deep dark and delightful secret returned spouter youre all to be my guests and ill promise you the time of your lives oh boys but this is going to be something great and the cadet playfully pounded one and another on the shoulder with his fist  but how can we go if we dont know where were going asked fred  youll know fred before youre on the way was the mysterious answer and believe me after youve found out you wont want to turn back  what do you mean youre not going to tell us where were going demanded jack in astonishment  exactly jack thats going to be my little secret until this school shuts up and spouter folded his arms calmly and grinned at all his chums  they looked at him in blank amazement this was a proceeding that had never happened before suddenly gif made a dash forward  lets pound it out of him  thats the talk well make him tell  pull him down and sit on him  pull off his shoes and tickle his feet hes got to tell  poke him in the ribs  he got a letter this morning ill bet the news is in that shouted gif its in his pocket now  all attempted to pounce upon spouter but he was too quick for them and dashing across the room he shot into freds bedroom banging the door after him then as the others followed he ran out into the corridor and then sped for his own room where he locked the door behind him then he hid the letter in a place where he was sure none of his chums would find it  well this takes the bakery announced randy after all of them had pounded on spouters door in vain what do you suppose it means  its simple enough remarked jack spouter is going to invite us on some sort of outing this summer but he doesnt want to tell us yet what sort its to be  he spoke about mountains and rivers and horseback riding said randy that looks like some sort of outdoor affair and his eyes glistened  come on out spouter and let us love you a little called fred through the keyhole  you go on down and ill meet you downstairs was the reply and remember youre not to know another word about this until vacation comes  going to take us away in a submarine spouter demanded andy  no hes going to take us in an airship to the south pole declared his twin  never mind where im going to take you answered spouter you just keep calm until vacation time comes and then youll learn fast enough in what direction youre going to travel and believe me well have some outing or else ill miss my guess  and with this statement the rover boys and gif had to be content     chapter xi  the election for officers   company attention shoulder arms forward march  boom boom boom boom boom  the drums rang out clearly on the morning air and the colby hall battalion swung into line on a march that carried it around the school buildings and then to the lake shore here colonel colby and captain dale inspected the three companies then the retiring major ralph mason was called on for a little speech which brought forth many cheers and after this the command was dismissed  it was the day for the election and there was to be no school session until the afternoon  at the last election there had been a total of 111 votes cast but now there were one hundred and twentyfive cadets at the institution there had been some talk of organizing a new command to be known as company d but so far this had not materialized  as was the custom the election was held in the main hall of the school and was presided over by captain dale and professor brice  i see they expect a hundred and twentyfive votes remarked randy that means sixtythree will be necessary to a choice  well im sure jack will get at least forty on the first vote returned his brother  i hope he gets the whole sixtythree put in dan soppinger dan had once run for a captaincy but had dropped out and turned most of his attention to athletics  as at other elections it was decided by colonel colby that each officer should be voted for separately  well try for a new major first announced the head of the hall  the ballot box was placed on the table and after a short intermission during which there was some very active electioneering among the various groups assembled a bell rang and the cadets were formed in one long line and told to march up and deposit their ballots in the box  it must be admitted that jack was rather anxious although he did his best to conceal it he smiled at captain glasby who smiled back then he smiled at lieutenant harkness but that underofficer only favored him with a scowl  harkness will never win anything with that look on his face was gifs comment as he noticed the scowl the fellows like an officer who can take things pleasantly  it did not take the cadets long to vote and as soon as all of the ballots had been cast captain dale assisted by professor brice began to tabulate the vote in less than ten minutes they had finished then a bell rang and captain dale came forward to read the result  total number of votes cast         125 necessary to a choice             63 louis glasby has               51 jack rover has                50 darrell harkness has             24  what do you know about that exclaimed fred jack and glasby are within one vote of each other  ill say thats getting pretty close answered randy  as no cadet has received the number of votes necessary to a choice i will give the school a recess for fifteen minutes then we will vote againfor the same cadets or for new ones if you feel so inclined  after this brief announcement by captain dale came a hum of voices and there was some strenuous electioneering in all parts of the hall and also in the corridors and out on the campus  glasby is stronger than i thought he was remarked gif to jack well have to do some tall work to overcome his vote  i think we can get some of the harkness fellows to come over to us put in spouter i dont believe hes as popular as he thinks  maybe we can get him to withdraw suggested andy with a grin  withdraw not broke out fred hes not that sort  while the conversation was going on somebody touched jack on the shoulder and turning he found himself confronted by paul halliday  say see here rover id like a word with you whispered halliday somewhat excitedly  all right shoot answered the young captain  this is a little private matter went on halliday you can bring your cousins along if you want to he added  wondering what halliday had in his mind jack along with fred and andy who happened to be close by followed him to an outoftheway corner of a corridor  we want to know if youre willing to make a deal with us said halliday in a low nervous tone of voice you know harkness got twentyfour votes well hes willing to throw those votes to you if you are willing to back him for the new captain of company c  i cant do that answered jack quickly if i get to be major im going to back fred here for the captaincy  oh but jack i could drop out of that put in his cousin quickly  not much fred i said i was going to do it and im going to stick to my word besides that i might as well tell you halliday that i dont believe harkness is the best fellow for the position  then you wont consider my offer demanded halliday sourly  certainly not  i dont believe you can control the harkness votes put in andy i believe jack will get a whole lot of them on the next ballot  he wont get a one of them and hell lose some of his own answered paul halliday you just wait and see and then he walked away  jack that move might have given you the majorship said fred  if ive got to get it that way fred i dont want it was the prompt reply i wouldnt vote for harkness under any circumstances hes in hand and glove with brassy bangs halliday sands and that whole bunch and i dont believe he ought to be an officer  a few minutes later came a commotion near the main entrance of the hall a cadet named gibson who was doing some electioneering for glasby had knocked paul halliday down and there was every prospect of a fight when the two cadets were separated by a number of friends  he offered to sell the harkness vote if our crowd would vote later on the way he wanted us to declared gibson you would think he had half the vote of the hall in his pocket and he glared at halliday who thereupon lost no time in sneaking out of sight  the report that halliday sands and even brassy bangs were trying to sell the harkness vote in exchange for some votes for a captaincy soon spread and a number of the cadets who had voted for the lieutenant became disgusted and promptly said they were going to change a lively discussion followed in the midst of which the bell rang for the second ballot  gee jack if some of those fellows do change their votes i hope they come to you murmured gif  well i must confess im hoping that myself answered the young captain with a smile  once more the boys lined up and deposited their ballots then came some anxious waiting and finally captain dale announced the result  total number of votes cast125 necessary to a choice63 jack rover has67 louis glasby has46 darrell harkness has9 peter floyd has3  hurrah jack wins cried fred enthusiastically and was the first person to grab his cousin by the hand and shake it warmly  thats great jack exclaimed gif slapping him on the shoulder let me congratulate you  its just the result i was looking for burst in spouter his face wreathed in smiles  of course louis glasby was much disappointed but he took his defeat in good part and came up bravely to shake jack by the hand  it was a fair and square contest jack he said and i congratulate you and then turning to the other cadets he called out three cheers for major rover they were given with a will and then colonel colby captain dale and many of the older persons came forward to congratulate the newlyelected head of the school battalion  speech speech came the cry from the students a speech from the new major and almost before he was aware of it jack was escorted to the platform  i dont know what to say to you he said as he faced his fellowstudents i thank you very heartily for your support and i will do my best to deserve it i want to say that i am particularly pleased at the nice manner in which louis glasby has taken his defeat hes a fine fellow and i hope i shall always have him for my friend and following these words there was more cheering  evidently the harkness combination went to pieces remarked randy he polled only nine votes  and that was nine too many murmured his brother  following the election for major captain dale announced that they would next vote for a new captain for company a  i dont know what you fellows are going to do but i know im going to vote for louis glasby announced jack  i think a whole lot of fellows will do that answered fred hell probably get every one of his original fiftyone votes  again there was an intermission of a quarter of an hour and then the boys were lined up for the vote to fill the vacancy in company a on the first ballot glasby got 60 votes while fred poled 18 votes the rest being scattering then on the second ballot glasby was declared elected with 69 votes in his favor  three cheers for captain glasby of company a called out jack quickly as he shook hands with his late rival and the cheers were given with as much of a will as they had been for the newlyelected major  well i got thirtytwo votes on that last ballot announced fred that shows ive got some friends in this school i dont want to be the captain of company a id rather remain a lieutenant of company c  but weve got to have a new captain for company c now that jack has stepped out put in phil franklin  a quarter of an hour later the balloting began for a new captain for the company jack had commanded here developed a spirited rivalry and it was not until the fifth ballot that the final vote was taken then fred won by 64 votes with the other votes scattered among eight contestants  three cheers for captain fred rover shouted phil franklin enthusiastically and threw his cap high in the air he had electioneered as hard as anybody for the youngest rover  then fred was called on for a little speech and after that there was another election for lieutenants and a number of minor officers  it certainly was our day fred said jack as he and his cousin shook hands  right you are major rover and fred saluted in the most precise military fashion  bonfires tonight boys sang out andy and well have some big doings believe me  right you are declared his twin     chapter xii  bonfire night   it was the custom at colby hall for the officers of the battalion to take dinner with colonel colby on the day of an election this was quite a formal affair and the cadets to participate made it a point to look their best  say jack youre going to make a stunning looking major remarked fred as he watched his cousin dressing  how about yourself as captain was the reply  just wait till ruth stevenson sees jack in his new uniform cried randy  say jack why not have a lifesized photo taken and give it to her to hang over her dressing table put in andy with a grin  you beware andy admonished his cousin waving a finger severely at him remember as the commandant of the battalion i can throw you into a dungeon cell if i feel so inclined and jack strutted around grandly in the privacy of the rovers sitting room  ill be good oh most noble one answered the funloving rover bowing down until his head almost touched his feet  jack and fred had already sent word to martha and mary and they of course had told ruth and the others it is needless to say that the rover girls and their chums were almost as much pleased over the results of the election as the boys had been  im just dying to see them on parade with jack at the head confided martha to the others  yes and fred in command of company c added mary just to think of it and he so much younger than the others  i hope im on hand to see their first parade said ruth her eyes beaming with pleasure  i thought you were going to write jack a letter about that party said martha in a low tone  i am tonight and ill let him know that ive wanted to do it ever since the party was talked of went on ruth  the officers dinner was a great success every one present made a little speech and colonel colby and captain dale made addresses to which the cadets listened with keen attention  it is my desire to make this military academy one of the best in the country declared the colonel earnestly and i cannot do that without the sincere coöperation of every cadet attending the institution as many of you knowand here he glanced at jack and fredwhen i was about your age i attended putnam hall military academy i am sure the training i received there did me much good and i am also sure that i made many friends who will stand by me as long as i live  i want this institution to be one of goodfellowship all around and i am relying upon all of you to do your best at putnam hall in many respects we followed the honor system which i have put into operation here that honor system did not fail there and i do not look for it to fail here i want you all to have a good time but there is a limit and every one of you knows what that limit is just as well as i do in the late war the training which some of our soldiers had received at putnam hall stood them in good stead and i want the training received here to be of equal benefit if any of my cadets should ever be called upon to fight for our country  three cheers for colonel colby came from jack a minute later and the boys assembled nearly split their throats trying to do justice to their feelings  while this dinner was going on the other cadets had their repast in the mess hall and then flew off in all directions to prepare for the real festivities of the evening they had gotten together several piles of barrels and boxes as well as brushwood from the forest behind the school and these were soon heaped up along the river bank into great bonfires the light of which could be seen a long distance  its going to be some night believe me sang out andy merrily well tear the woodpile down as the old saying is  we want to be a little bit careful or else well have snopper duke or some other professor calling us down  snopper duke is going away i heard him tell one of the other teachers that he had had a sudden call to go somewhere out of town answered randy  going away again eh questioned gif in surprise he certainly is getting to be a regular man of mystery  the greater part of the cadets were wildly excited over the prospects of a good time that night a few of them however including lieutenant harkness paul halliday and brassy bangs looked far from pleased  they make me tired was brassys comment youd think that being major of the school battalion was next to being president  if i cant be anything better than a lieutenant i think ill resign altogether returned harkness id rather go in for athletics  youll have a pretty good chance if you do announced paul halliday i understand theyre going to try to divorce the officers from participating in baseball and football as much as possible a fellow can hold a commission and be on a team at the same time only when it seems absolutely necessary  then jack rover and fred rover will have to give up playing baseball put in brassy quickly  more than likely although of course theyll hate to lose such good players as they are put in another cadet who was present  when the officers dinner was at an end jack and fred lost no time in hurrying to their rooms where they donned their old uniforms it was what was termed a holiday night at the hall which meant that for the time being the cadets were all on an even footing and must treat each other as if such a thing as an officer was unknown  by the time jack and fred joined the crowd along the river bank the fun was at its height many of the cadets were running around indulging in all sorts of horseplay while others were dancing around the bonfires singing the songs they had learned in the school and while at the encampments several of the boys including andy were in clowns costume with big slapsticks which they used vigorously on everybody who came within their reach  hurrah boys let her flicker cried fred as he rushed forward everybody join in he added and then boomed out with this wellknown hall refrain      who are we     cant you see     colby hall     dum dum dum dum dum     here we come with fife and drum     colby colby colby hall  thats the stuff cried jack lets have it again and then the refrain boomed out louder than ever  come on lets march around the school came from gif and he caught up a firebrand as he spoke  a number of others were quick to follow his example and in a minute more a torchlight procession was in progress winding along over the campus around the school and through the edge of the woods beyond then the boys came back by way of the barns and sheds in the rear  look out that you dont set something on fire warned jack  something is on fire already burst out andy suddenly  you dont say queried spouter  where is the fire demanded half a dozen others looking around anxiously  right down there declared the funloving rover and pointed to the bonfires along the river  wow lets duck him for that cried phil franklin  he made a dive for andy and so did several others but the agile rover was too quick for them and danced out of their reach having no desire to take an involuntary bath in the river which at that time of the year was very cold  in the past the cadets had had considerable fun with job plunger the school janitor who was quite deaf and who was often called shout because everybody had to shout at him to make him hear but this time plunger was wise and kept out of sight as did also pud hicks his assistant and bob nixon the chauffeur the only person the boys could get hold of was si crews the gymnastic instructor  give us a song wont you asked several of the boys at once for si crews was known to be quite a singer  i will if lowe will play the mandolin or the banjo answered crews  thats the stuff ned called fred go on and get your mandolin  ned lowe who was also a good singer was willing and at once ran off into the school to get the musical instrument mentioned when he came out he tuned up hastily and then played while si crews sang one or two oldtime songs then ned gave the crowd one or two funny songs and a dozen or more of the cadets joined in the chorus  heres a chance to get square with codfish cried fred as the sneak of the school showed himself in the crowd  oh we might as well let codfish drop answered jack  but before this could be done andy and randy caught hold of stowell and pushed him forward through the circle of merry cadets around one of the fires  were going to initiate you in the ancient order of cornmeal declared andy  i dont want to be initiated answered codfish you let me alone  illustration there descended upon codfish several pounds of finelyground cornmeal rover boys at big horn ranch page 131  oh but this is a firstclass order codfish returned randy if your reputation is bad it will render you almost spotless  you let me go burst out codfish in sudden fear as andy and randy and several others came close to him i dont want any horseplay tonight im tired out  to be initiated in this order youve got to lie down continued andy and motioning to his brother and some of the others they suddenly caught poor codfish and stretched him out on the grass in front of the fire  are you ready to be initiated questioned randy solemnly as he stood over codfish with a small paper bag in one hand  you let me began codfish  he says let me burst out randy quickly so go to it most potent sower of the ancient and honorable order of cornmeal go to it i say  and thereupon without further ado randy overturned the paper bag he held in his hand and there descended upon codfish several pounds of finelyground meal which the lads had purchased in town a day or two before  hi hi whats this you let me go cried codfish and then began to splutter as the dry cornmeal got into his mouth and nose  my codfish youd make a regular muffin now declared andy as the whitened youth struggled to his feet  give us a song codfish  make it a regular corncake hoedown put in randy  you let me go shrieked codfish and then in commingled rage and fear he suddenly caught up a long firebrand from the bonfire and whirled it around rapidly before him  get out of my wayall of you he screamed and the next minute made a movement as if to dash the firebrand directly into randys face     chapter xiii  a startling discovery   drop that codfish exclaimed randy and backed away so suddenly that he tripped over some brushwood and came down flat on his back  im not going to be tormented any more stormed codfish and swung the firebrand around again this time so the flames brushed andys shoulder and also freds arm  drop that you imp exclaimed ned lowe do you want to put out somebodys eyes  i dont care youve got to let me alone screamed codfish  we wont let you alone until you learn how to behave yourself and act like the other fellows do answered andy youre the worst sneak this school ever had and you know it  yes and see how you acted after all we did for you when we were at cedar lodge added randy who had scrambled to his feet  ii didnt mean to say anything about those snowballs whined stowell they made me do it and thereupon pitching the firebrand back on the bonfire he pushed his way through the crowd of cadets and disappeared in the darkness in the direction of the school  gee he certainly is a pill was dan soppingers comment i think none of us would weep if codfish left the school for good how about it  never minddont let it spoil the festivities cried andy gayly come on everybody join in a fine of one suspender button for the fellows who dont sing and thereupon he began a ditty he had composed during the war      johnny get your musket     you must get your musket     johnny get your musket     you must get it now  and this ditty the lads sang over and over again as they leaped and swung in a circle around the bonfires  but all gala occasions must come to an end and by eleven oclock the bonfires were nothing but heaps of smouldering ashes and then one by one the cadets returned to the hall and retired  well jack it will seem kind of funny wont it to be at the head of the school battalion tomorrow morning questioned gif as he and the newlyelected major turned into the corridor leading to their rooms  yes gif but it wont be so very strange either because you know i had to command the battalion two or three times when the other officers were away  their activities during the whole of the day had made the cadets sleepy and nearly all turned in without much ado here and there there was an exception and these included fatty hendry and dan soppinger  ive got to get out some sort of a composition on city improvements declared fatty i dont know much about em but if i dont get the paper in by nine oclock tomorrow morning theres going to be trouble  and i still have some examples in algebra to work out answered dan so i think ill go at them before i retire  all of the rovers slept soundly and did not awaken until they heard an unexpected knock on their door some time before the rising bell  let me in came in the voice of dan soppinger ive got news  jack opened the door and dan came in followed by fatty  say what do you know about this exclaimed dan colby hall has been robbed  robbed ejaculated jack what do you mean what did they take  what did they take burst out fatty i guess they took about everything they could get their hands on that was easy to carry off i lost my stickpin and my watch  and i lost two old stickpins and two rings that i havent been wearing put in dan  when did you find this out questioned the newlyelected major  i made the discovery just when i was going to bed after doing some examples in algebra answered dan it was about halfpast twelve so i didnt want to wake anybody upthat is none of the other fellows although i did call on fatty because i knew he was writing a composition he looked around his room then and found he had been robbed too then as professor duke was away we called on professor watson he made an investigation and then said he would report to colonel colby the first thing this morning  the talk in jacks room had brought fred to the scene and a few minutes later randy and andy came in rubbing their eyes sleepily  what was your stuff worth dan questioned fred  i think the rings were worth about fifteen dollars each and the stickpins almost as much  my stickpin was worth thirtyfive dollars groaned fatty and the watch was a gold one given to me by my grandfather and i wouldnt lose that for a good deal  hark whats that commotion put in jack suddenly  there was a murmur of excited voices in the corridor and throwing open the door the rovers and their friends came out to see what was up  my room has been robbed  my watch is gone and a whole lot of other jewelry  i lost three dollars  huh that isnt anything i lost fourteen dollars and a half  so the talk ran on as an excited group of cadets some fully attired and some still wearing their pajamas crowded forward  say what do you know about this exclaimed fred  is anything belonging to us gone questioned jack suddenly  im going back to find out came from randy i was so sleepy last night that i just tumbled into bed and let it go at that  without further ado the four rovers ran back into the rooms they occupied and began a search of their chiffoniers and the other places where they kept their things of value  my stickpin is gone and also one of my rings groaned randy  i had a brand new fivedollar bill tucked away in one of my drawers said his brother i cant find it anywhere and yes my wristwatch is missing  my watch and chain and stickpin are gone and likewise all my badges cried fred oh this is the worst ever  well im out a ring and three stickpins announced jack including that brand new pin i got last year  as quickly as possible the four rovers dressed and then joined the other cadets in the corridor from all sides were heard excited exclamations as one pupil after another came forward to announce that either his jewelry or his moneyand sometimes bothwere gone  colonel colby and several of the professors had already been notified and they quickly appeared on the scene and tried to interview the cadets this however was a hard thing to undertake because nearly all the boys wanted to talk at once there was so much excitement that for the time being the morning parade and breakfast were completely forgotten  this is certainly a terrible state of affairs remarked the colonel to captain dale have you any idea who can be guilty  no colonel i have always thought that every one connected with this school was honest  it may be the work of some of the hired help mused colonel colby but i hate to think that every one who is here came highly recommended  we might make inquiry and see if any strangers were in the school last night during the celebration suggested captain dale there was so much excitement that some one might have slipped in and out without our noticing  finally colonel colby told all the cadets to go below for breakfast dispensing with the early morning drill  as soon as you have finished eating i wish each cadet to make a thorough search of his room and make out a written list of everything that is missing and sign the paper take careful note of everything when you are making your search and if you find any clues to the perpetrator of this outrageous affair let me know the lists can be left at the office as soon as they are made out and then after a moment of thought he added there will be no session of the school this morning  shall we notify the haven point authorities questioned professor brice  not at present i wish to make my own investigation first answered the head of the school  it did not take jack and his cousins long to swallow their breakfast and this finished they hurried back to their rooms and began the search colonel colby had advised  well im shy that gold fountain pen aunt martha gave me announced jack presently id forgotten about that because i didnt usually use it i use the one mother gave me  outside of this the rovers could find nothing more missing nor did they locate anything in the way of a clue that might lead to the robber they sat down and made out their brief lists signed them and then walked together down to the office  here a crowd of cadets were coming and going it was learned that twentytwo cadets in all had suffered losses which ranged from seventyfive cents to one hundred and twentyfive dollars in all it was figured that the loss would amount to at least twelve hundred dollars  this is about the worst thing that ever struck colby hall announced jack  who do you suppose did it questioned randy  dont ask me randy id hate to suspect any of the fellows  oh i dont think any of the fellows did it burst out fred  well what about the hired help questioned andy  i dont know any of them that id suspect said jack promptly every one looks like a pretty good sort  only two cadets came forward with objects that might possibly be a clue to the robbery one boy had picked up a handkerchief in his room that he said did not belong to him and another boy had found the marks of muddy footprints over his window sill and on a fireescape outside  say that looks as if somebody had come up the fireescape and got into the rooms that way said jack when he heard of this  they say the handkerchief that was picked up is not marked in any way said gif  well every handkerchief used by the cadets is marked returned spouter theyve got to be that way or theyd get all mixed up in the laundry  how about the help  their stuff is all marked too one of the teachers told me so put in dan soppinger  say ned you came upstairs for your mandolin cried jack suddenly did you see anybody up here  i dont remember that i did answered ned lowe i was in such a hurry to get the instrument that i didnt pay much attention and besides that it seemed pretty dark in here after coming away from that big bonfire  a robber would be sure to keep out of neds sight put in fred  i remember seeing some fellows in the lower hallmajor mason bart white and one or two others but i cant seem to remember seeing anybody upstairsand yet somehow or other it seems to me i did pass somebody just before i ran into my room and now ned looked perplexed  cant you think who it was questioned andy quickly  no i cant  if it was a stranger you would have remembered wouldnt you asked jack  i think i would jack id think right away what that person was doing upstairs ned scratched his head no if i did meet somebody im sure it must have been one of the cadets but who it was i cant think  a little later colonel colby continued his investigation by asking all those who had been inside the building during the celebration to come forward and tell anything they could that might be of advantage it developed that not only ned but also ralph mason bart white and two of the older cadets named lawrence and philips had been upstairs some time between eight and eleven oclock the most of these cadets said they had seen no one else upstairs in the building but bart white declared while at one end of a long corridor he had seen some one slip around a corner out of sight he was not sure whether the person had been a cadet one of the hired help or an outsider  it was either a man or a big boy said bart but he moved so quickly and it was so dark i didnt recognize him even if i happened to know him  and what time was this questioned colonel colby  some time between halfpast nine and ten oclock  bart was asked to show the colonel where the disappearance of the stranger had taken place and it was proved that this was at a point just around a corner from the room where the footprints leading to the fireescape had been discovered  perhaps you saw the person just at the time he was making his escape was colonel colbys comment we will look for footprints below the fireescape  this was done but the cadets the night before had tramped around the school building so much that the footprints were hopelessly mixed then the boys were questioned as to whether or not they had seen any one dropping from the fireescape to the ground and all answered in the negative  we will question the hired help and see what they have to say announced the master of the school     chapter xiv  the parade   the inquiries made among the hired help of colby hall produced little results some of the servants were rather scared and declared to colonel colby that they were innocent of any wrong doing  i am not accusing any one here declared the master of the hall i only want to find out if possible who was guilty of this outrageous proceeding  it was found that two men with wagon loads of supplies for the school had visited the place during the evening but neither of these men had gone any further into the building than the storeroom and both had departed as soon as their errands were finished outside of that so far as the servants could remember no outsiders had been on the premises  and yet those footmarks on the window sill and the fireescape look as if it had been done by an outsider said captain dale to the head of the school  its just possible that it may have been an inside job and an outside job combined ventured professor grawson  what do you mean by that  somebody in the institution may be in collusion with some outsidersome professional thief the inside person may have given the outsider a tip as to when the coast was clear and may even have stood on guard while the rooms were being looted  that is possible professor but is there any one in the place that you suspect  at this professor grawson shook his head  no sir so far as i can imagine they are all thoroughly honest  we might institute a general search of all the buildings announced captain dale we can call all the cadets out on the campus and all the hired help into the mess room and request them to remain while the search is going on  some of the hired help may object to that came from professor watson  if they did it would throw suspicion on them answered colonel colby quickly i think the idea had better be carried out  all the persons in the school were assembled as mentioned and then captain dale explained to the cadets what had been proposed and colonel colby did the same to the hired help  theyre certainly welcome to search our rooms declared major jack promptly  and mine too added a score of others  im sure i havent anything to conceal put in lieutenant harkness  and i havent anything to conceal either came from brassy bangs they can search my room all they please he had announced the loss of a stickpin and six dollars and a quarter in cash  among the hired help there was more or less murmuring one of the old cooks an irish woman who had been in the place since it had been opened shaking her head dubiously  sure an i didnt think yez would take me fer a thief colonel colby said bridget gazing at the head of the school severely  im not taking any one for a thief mrs mulligan he answered but it would not be fair to search any of the rooms without searching all of them  sure an thats true fer yez announced the cook nodding her head in assent an if thats the way yere after lookin at it go ahead and search me room all ye please only dont be disturbin them trinkets i have from me dead mother  the search was made without delay all of the teachers and the cadets who had lost their belongings taking part it occupied the rest of the morning every room was gone over carefully and when anything in the way of jewelry or other such articles as had been reported missing were discovered all those who had suffered were asked to look on and see if they could identify anything  gee theres a fountain pen that belongs to me cried one of the boys presently and then he added in a crestfallen manner its all right i lent that to bill latimer a couple of weeks ago and forgot all about it  outside of this incident the search came to an end with nothing out of the ordinary happening not an article that had been taken was discovered in any of the rooms occupied by the cadets or the hired help nor was anything discovered in any of the other rooms or closets of the institution  it certainly is puzzling declared colonel colby after the search had been called off it looks to me as if a thief had gotten away with everything he took  either that or he has some hiding place which we as yet havent unearthed answered captain dale  after that the hired help were told they might go and as soon as possible dinner was served to the cadets and the teachers then when the pupils were told to go to their afternoon classes colonel colby and captain dale held a conference in the office and notified the local police authorities  i hate to do it said colonel colby but there seems to be no help for it it will certainly give our institution a black eye  but i do not see how anyone can hold you responsible for this affair returned captain dale we are as watchful at this institution as they are anywhere  of course i shall not permit our cadets to lose anything by this went on the master of the school quickly i shall ask each of them to value carefully what they have lost and then if the things are not recovered before the end of the term i will make the loss good  that would be very nice on your part colonel colby and i think it would be a good investment too added captain dale it will prove to the parents of the cadets that you consider yourself responsible while they are under your care  when the local authorities came to the school they went over the ground carefully with colonel colby and some of the others and asked innumerable questions  we have a number of strangers stopping in town mostly traveling salesmen announced the chief of police ill look em up and also look up any tramps or any other suspicious characters that may be hanging around and that for the time being was all he could say soon he and his men departed  that evening jack found a letter in his box which had been mailed early that morning at haven point it was from ruth there was also a brief note to fred which had been sent by may  in her communication to the newlyelected major ruth congratulated him heartily on his success and said she hoped soon to see him in a parade at the head of the battalion after that she wrote as follows about the sleighing party that had been called off    i received an invitation to that party from lester bangs and may   received an invitation from paul halliday jennie mason ida   brierley and several of the other girls had invitations and they   wanted us to go very much but of course i did not want to go   with such a fellow as bangs then he came to me and started a   report that all of you rovers were going to another party with some   of the girls from the town and that the party was to take place   the same night as our party of course i did not want to say   anything about it because i realized that you could do as you   pleased but i told bangs positively that i would not go with him   and may told the same thing to halliday then both of them got   quite ugly and accused you and your cousin of trying to spoil his   outing i told him you had had nothing to do with it but he   declared that you had and that you had better look out or you would   get into hot water so jack please look out for him and tell fred   to look out for halliday and the others  there was more to the letter and jack read the communication with great interest he felt greatly relieved to think that ruth had not intended to accept brassys invitation and later on he dropped her a note thanking her for her kind congratulations and telling her that the report of another party in which the rovers and some girls from haven point were to participate had been faked up  the note received by fred was on lines similar to the communication sent to jack he sent word to may clearing up the situation  it was a mean thing for bangs and halliday to do declared the newlyelected captain of company c we ought to pitch into them  we cant afford to do it fred now that im a major and youre a captain was jacks reply remember what colonel colby said we must be models for the other cadets  great scott does that mean we cant stick up for our rights demanded the youngest rover indignantly  not at all fred if those fellows say anything give it back to them and if they start to fight defend yourself just as well as you are able  as mentioned before snopper duke had been absent from the hall during the election for officers and the celebration which had followed when he returned he looked much worried and this worry was far from dispelled when he visited his room  colonel colby i too have been robbed he exclaimed as he came rushing down to the office ive had a silver cardcase taken and also a gold watch which has been in our family for several generations a watch that belonged to my father and my grandfather  its too bad professor duke answered the master of the hall seriously may i ask what the articles were worth  i dont suppose the cardcase was worth more than a few dollars but the watch was of gold and i presume it must have cost fifty or sixty dollars it was an heirloom and i treasured it highly  i am doing my best to find out something about the robbery said colonel colby but so far all my efforts have been in vain i intend if the articles are not recovered by the time the school session comes to an end to pay for everything that has been stolen and that was all the master of the hall could say  it must be admitted that both jack and fred felt quite proud when the first regular parade of the battalion took place that spring the cousins had of course sent home word of the election and had received permission to purchase new uniforms both looked spick and span as they marched out at the head of their respective commands it was a clear warm day and colonel colby announced that the cadets could parade through haven point to clearwater hall and return if they so desired  hurrah thats the stuff cried fred  and so it was arranged and one of the teachers telephoned over to the girls academy to let those at that institution know what they might expect then one of the cadets telephoned to felix falstein the owner of the haven point moving picture theater  falstein always hangs out his flags for us said this cadet and hell do it this time im sure  colby hall now boasted of a drum and fife corps of twelve pieces and they made merry music as the battalion marched away in the direction of haven point all but three or four of the cadets were in the best of spirits  i think marching over to clearwater hall is punk declared brassy bangs with a snarl why cant they march some place worth while or just go around the town and let it go at that  i guess jack rover wants to show off before those girls grumbled paul halliday  i wouldnt go if i could get out of it growled brassy  oh dont squeal returned his crony quickly if you do theyll only laugh at us and make us go anyway  attention there bangs cried the captain of company b the command to which brassy belonged no talking in the ranks and thereupon the cadets became silent  as had been anticipated when the cadets reached haven point they found that felix falstein had outdone himself in the way of decorations not only were several flags displayed across the front of his theater but he had strung two big flags across the street and between them placed a banner which he had had painted some time before and which read                                welcome to                               colby hall  thats very nice of him remarked jack who was marching at the head of the procession with captain dale on horseback close beside him  very nice indeed major rover answered the military man  i wonder if we cant come to a halt here and go through the manual of arms went on the newlyelected major  certainly if you wish to do so  battalion halt called out jack turning around and the three companies came to a stop     chapter xv  baseball   soon the three companies of the colby hall battalion were in a long line in front of the moving picture theater at once a crowd began to gather until several hundred people were assembled then the cadets were put through the manual of arms after which followed some fancy evolutions in the street in front of the show house  very good very good indeed shouted felix falstein who was present  his face was beaming and he clapped his hands loudly and taking this hint the crowd applauded with vigor then the march through haven point was resumed and soon the cadets came in sight of clearwater hall  they had good reason to feel proud of what those at the girls school had done in their honor the big flag was flying from the flagstaff on the campus and other flags were displayed from the front of the building in addition to this the classes had been dismissed for the time being and nearly all the girls were out at the front of the school many carrying small flags which they waved vigorously as the cadets approached  oh dont they look grand cried mary  superb added martha ecstatically  i do believe jack has a brand new uniform came from ruth and then she began to cheer and all the girls joined in  the cadets had been cautioned to preserve true military discipline and they did their best not to smile and make eyes at their admirers but it was hard work and many a face broke into a grin impossible to control  opposite the school the command came to a halt and then miss garwood and a number of her teachers came forward to greet the cadets and those with them and invite them to the campus here another drill was given the girls applauding louder than ever as each movement was executed with a precision that would have done credit to the cadets at west point  im sure thats as good as our fathers did at putnam hall declared mary to her cousin  colonel colby had come along with captain dale and during the drilling had been in earnest conversation with miss garwood then came a surprise as the cadets were asked to march into the dining hall of the girls school here they found generous plates of cake and icecream as well as glasses of refreshing lemonade awaiting them  gee this is the best ever declared andy smacking his lips  yes and what a surprise returned randy  some day well have to return this compliment came from jack my wouldnt it be a lark to have the girls in our mess hall and treat them  i suppose wed have to give em regular soldiers fare was andys dry comment salt pork and baked beans and things like that and he grinned  nothing doing declared fred well feed em toasted marshmallows and angel cake and at this sally there was a laugh  following the refreshments the cadets were allowed fifteen minutes in which to walk around the school campus and mingle with the girl students jack of course at once sought out ruth to tell her personally how much he appreciated the letter she had sent  i hope jack you havent had any more trouble with lester bangs the girl said anxiously  oh hes growling around a little but thats all answered the young major im not paying any attention to him ruth im mighty glad that you didnt accept his invitation and he gave her a warm glance  it was awful for him to get up that report about another party answered the girl of course i didnt think it was truethat is not what he said about you and your cousins  suppose we let the whole matter drop ruth and forget brassy bangs and his crowd  im sure im willing to do that jack and then the girl added quickly youve had some terrible doings over at the hall so i have been told  you mean the robbery i suppose  yes have they discovered anything  not a thing it certainly is a mystery  when the gathering of boys and girls broke up nearly every one was in the best of humor the only exceptions being brassy bangs and paul halliday these two unworthies had done their best to get on friendly terms with some of the girls but had been snubbed in such a manner that it made them much crestfallen  ill be glad when we start back grumbled brassy to his crony  come on lets take a walk outside answered halliday and thereupon the pair left the school grounds  what about baseball this spring jack questioned his sister just before the cadets were ready to start  ill be out of that this year there is a new ruling that officers must step aside and let the other cadets have a chance on the baseball nine and the football eleven as well as have a chance in the rowing and other contests colonel colby has an idea that not enough cadets have filled these various places in the past he wants to give every fellow a chance if possible  well you cant blame him for that  not at all martha im quite content to step aside so far as baseball is concerned and so is fred we want to do our best as officers and also do our best with our studies you know the folks at home are expecting us to make real records in the classrooms  i know that only too well jack mary and i are working day and night on our lessons here were going to do our best to come out either at the head of our classes or very near to it  how is ruth making out  shes doing very well of course she had a hard struggle to catch up on account of the time lost because of her eyesight  following the parade to clearwater hall the cadets settled down to the usual routine of drills and studies but soon there came a call for aspirants to the baseball team and then talk of the coming matches with columbus academy hixley high and longley academy filled the air  gee it makes my hands tingle to think about baseball sighed fred when talking the matter over with jack  i feel the same way answered the young major but remember fred we cant have everything in this world and id rather be major of the school battalionat least for one term  of course and id rather be captain of company c  gif tells me there are going to be a number of important changes on the nine went on jack a lot of new fellows are clamoring to get on theyre going to have their tryouts in a day or two  what jack said was true and the following saturday afternoon a somewhat patchedup first team played a scrub team on the scrub somewhat to the rovers surprise were brassy bangs and paul halliday  they both claim to know a whole lot about the game explained gif so im bound to give them a tryout  why i thought brassy bangs came from a ranch in the west  so he does but he told me they frequently played baseball on the ranch and that some of the cowboys were really good players he said one of the fellows had once played on one of the midwest leagues  gee theres no telling what an uptodate cowboy will do these days remarked andy playing baseball going into the movies and into vaudeville and i dont know what else  i guess he finds more money in the doing of those things than he does in the herding of cows answered his twin  the game between the patchedup first nine and the scrub nine resulted in a tie 7 to 7 jack and his cousins watched the game and had to admit that brassy bangs and paul halliday did quite wellin fact much better than had been expected  after that the practice was continued gif as head of the athletic association trying out one player after another then came the final selection of the regular club to represent colby hall and brassy bangs was given the position of third baseman while paul halliday went to center field  i think i ought to be allowed to pitch grumbled brassy im sure i can send em in just as good as any of those other fellows  you pitch a pretty swift ball i admit returned gif but your delivery is rather erratic you put them over the catchers head several times if you did that when the bases were full it would mean just so many runs coming in and after that brassy said no more about pitching  the first game to be played was on the grounds of longley academy the cadets journeyed to the place in carriages and automobiles and on bicycles and were joined by quite a number of the girls from clearwater hall  do you suppose tommy flanders will pitch questioned randy  no they tell me that last game we had over here was too much for flanders and he has given up the nine entirely i think theyll put in that new lefthander that they tried at the end of that game answered jack and in this surmise he was correct  when the first man came to the bat it was easy to be seen that both nines were on their mettle it was a colby hall player who had the stick and the lefthanded twirler for longley academy struck him out in onetwothree order  hurrah thats the way to do it yelled one of the longley students now make it three straight  gee that was nevins one of our best batters whispered randy to his cousin mary  never mind that colby hall shouted jack youve got to encourage em a little bit and at this there was a smile  the next man to the bat got a hit and on a wild pitch managed to reach third but that was all that could be done and colby hall retired without scoring  during their half of the inning longley academy managed to make two runs and this was increased by two more at the end of the fourth inning in the meantime the best colby hall could do was to get two hits and bring in one run  hurrah four to one in favor of longley shouted one of the students from that academy  youve got to tighten up boys called out fred to the members of his school team tighten up and show em what you can do  the fifth inning passed without a run and so did the sixth then in the seventh colby hall managed to pass the home plate twice while longley academy scored once this made the score longley academy 5 colby hall 3  oh jack it looks as if colby hall might be beaten said ruth anxiously  i think they might have a better fellow than brassy bangs on third put in fred he could have put out that last runner with ease that run wasnt deserved at all and a number of others who heard this remark agreed with the young captain of company c  in the eighth inning colby hall made one more run then longley academy came once more to the bat and with two men on first and second and two out the batsman knocked a high fly to center field  scoop it in halliday  its a dead easy fly  they wont get any runs this inning  so the shouts from the colby hall boys went on  in the meanwhile paul halliday stepped back a few paces and got directly under the descending sphere down it came striking his finger tips and bouncing over his head  hes muffed it hes muffed it yelled several of the longley academy contingent gleefully run boys run  and how the runners did streak from base to base and before the ball could be recovered by the bewildered halliday the three runs had been scored     chapter xvi  spouter is cornered   hurrah for longley  thats the way to do it that makes the score eight to four  my what a muff that was that center fielder is a regular butterfingers  soak it to em good and plenty longley only two men out  thus the hubbub on the part of the students of longley academy continued while the cadets of colby hall had little to say there were one or two cries to take halliday out of the field but these were quickly hushed  anybody might muff a ball declared jack its too bad but probably it couldnt be helped  the very next player to the bat knocked a liner between first and second and got to second on a fumble by the first baseman then the next player after having two strikes called on him sent a low one down to center field  go for it halliday get it yelled the cadets eagerly  halliday ran for the ball but was only able to get it on the first bounce then as he saw the batsman rounding first for second he threw the ball wildly  run newcomb run  there goes the ball for the grandstand hurry up markle and make it a homer  the ball had sailed over the head of the runner and landed at least ten feet away from the home plate the catcher made a dive for it while the pitcher came to the plate to stop the runners but it was too late and before the sphere could be sent in both runs had been scored  zip boom two more runs for longley  thats the way to do it boys lets snow em under  take halliday out was the angry cry of fully a dozen cadets take him out he has no business on the team  and thereupon amid shouts of derision paul halliday was compelled to quit the field and one of the substitutes went to take his place  it wasnt my fault i stepped in a hole growled halliday when he came to the bench he made a show of limping badly i almost sprained my ankle  well your two errors have been very costly answered gif coldly  after that the pitcher for colby hall tightened up and the next man up was put out on strikes and the side retired  with the score 10 to 4 against them colby hall did what it could to redeem itself during the last inning they made one run followed by two outs and two hits which brought a man on first and another on third then brassy bangs came to the bat  now brassy heres your chance  knock it over the back lots  brassy set his teeth and swung the bat with a doordare expression then the first ball pitched came in an outcurve which he swung at in vain  take your time called out gif  the next was an incurve but brassy swung at it and missed again  strike two  hit it brassy hit it  knock the cover off  take your time wait until you get just what you want  and thereupon brassy bangs did waituntil he had three strikes called upon him and was declared out  that ends the game  and the score is ten to five in favor of longley academy  hurrah thats the time we showed colby hall what we can do  the longley academy boys went wild in their enthusiasm and danced around the field like so many indians and they had good cause to be elated for they remembered only too well the drubbing they had gotten at the hands of colby hall the season before when jack and fred had made such records for themselves  the colby hall cadets could say nothing against the record made by the longley nine they had put up a stiff fight from the start and deserved their laurels  our defeat was largely due to halliday and bangs declared spouter between them they let in at least five runs  thats exactly the truth answered dan soppinger if i were gif id read the riot act to those two players  oh i dont think id be too hard on them came from jack anybody might have muffed that ball down in center field and any of us might have struck out as brassy did  but both of them made several other errors put in walt baxter  on the way back to colby hall the students were free in their comments on the game and there were many uncomplimentary things said about brassy and halliday those two players tried to excuse themselves as best they could but a baseball player who has not made good seldom gets any sympathy  ill give you both another chance in the game with hixley high said gif at last in talking the matter over with the two players but if you make a single error it will cost you your positions  the game with hixley high came off on the following saturday and was won by the narrow score of 7 to 6 in the second inning halliday made another wild throw from center to second and brassy bangs made a bad fumble in the fourth inning and as a consequence both were retired and substitutes put in their places  it was certainly a narrow squeak declared fred when the game was over and the boys were preparing to celebrate that evening i believe if gif had kept brassy and halliday on the team we would have lost  well we may lose some other games even so said jack and he was right out of a total of seven games played with the other schools of that vicinity that season colby hall won but four  well we cant win every year declared randy and were half a game to the good anyway and thats something  its certainly better than being half a game behind answered his twin  while these matters were going on colonel colby and captain dale had been doing everything possible with the aid of the local police and also a private detective who had been called in to solve the mystery concerning the robbery at the school but all efforts seemed to be in vain not a trace of the person or persons who had committed the crime could be found it was a great mystery  i think ill have to settle with all of the boys and with professor duke said colonel colby to his head assistant and there i suppose the matter will have to be dropped  later on he took up the various claims and paid each one of them in cash  i am very thankful to you for this colonel colby declared snopper duke when he received his money it will come in quite handy i assure you and yet i am much distressed over that watch which once belonged to my grandfather  well i hope it is brought to light some day professor answered the master of the hall and if it is then you can pay me back for it and he smiled faintly  in those days a number of the cadets noticed that snopper duke seemed to be much preoccupied he paid hardly any attention to what his pupils were doing and was so absentminded that often he answered the simplest questions in the most ridiculous manner  hes certainly got something on his mind was freds comment i must say id like to know what it can be  maybe well never know answered jack but because of what colonel colby said im certainly going to be careful how i treat him he may have more of a load on his mind and heart than any of us imagine  it now lacked but ten days to the end of the term and the boys were busy finishing up with the examinations in the various classes and also in writing the final essays to be handed in all had worked hard to make a showing  just think only ten days more exclaimed andy throwing a grammar across his room at randy doesnt it make you feel fine  it sure does answered his twin catching the book and sending it back so quickly that his brother was hit in the stomach and that puts me in mind andy why not get at spouter and make him tell us what hes got in mind about our vacation this summer  lets do it come on well get fred and jack and gif and go and pound it out of him  all alive with their scheme the twins burst in upon the other rovers while they were busy writing their essays and broached the subject the others agreed and fred ran off to get gif then the whole crowd rounded up spouter and grabbing him by the arms fairly forced him along the corridor and into the rover boys sitting room  now spouter youve got to tell us declared randy no more secrets  oh gee is that it was spouters reply i thought you wanted to borrow a nickel from me or something like that and he smiled feebly  come on now spouter give it to us straight demanded fred  no more sawing and fiddling put in andy we want straight goods where are we going this summer  youre going with me answered spouter with a grin  so youve told us about three thousand times but where are we going  youre going home first  pound him fellows pound him throw him down and pound him good and thereupon the whole crowd pounced upon the luckless schemer  hold on hold on let me up spluttered spouter let me up and ill tell you everything  honest demanded andy if you fool us this time well drag you to the bathroom and duck you  cross my heart panted spouter now let me up  the others allowed him to arise and then forced him into an easy chair in the corner and all stood over him menacingly  you are going to spend your vacation at a new place which was purchased by my dad only a few months ago answered spouter  and what place is that came in a chorus from his chums  big horn ranch     chapter xvii  goodbye to school   what do you know about that  big horn ranch that sounds interesting  what sort of a place is it spouter  i suppose you must have thousands of heads of cattle  how about horses spouter well have enough mounts shant we  any good hunting or fishing  stop stop what are you trying to do spluttered spouter trying to drown me in a flood of questions why dont you ask one thing at a time  well where is the ranch and how are we going to get to it questioned jack  and how big is it put in fred  and then came another flood of questions until poor spouter placed his hands to his ears in dismay  i cant answer everything at once he said finally so youd better let me tell what i know in my own way big horn ranch is located out in montana and it comprises a thousand acres or morehow large i dont exactly know to get there you journey by rail to a little jumpingoff place called four rocks and then you have to ride or drive to the ranch which is four or five miles away the nearest town of any size is arrow junction which is quite a distance off  how is it your dad bought a place like that broke in gif i didnt know he was interested in ranches  oh he has always liked outdoor lifeyou all know that and this ranch came to him in rather an unexpected way there were two brothers who were interested in a speculation in which my dad was interested too my dad advanced a lot of money to these brothers and as they couldnt pay up in cash they asked him if he wouldnt take the ranch off their hands by allowing them an additional thirty thousand dollars so he made a trip out there in company with another man who knew all about ranches and then he concluded to buy and did so so now we own big horn ranch and the family expects to spend a large part of each summer there  and your father said we could all go out there with you questioned randy  yes he told me to invite you four rovers and also gif and that isnt all went on spouter hes invited all your folks out there too hes going to make a great big houseparty of it  our folks exclaimed fred what do you mean they cant all go uncle dick is just back from texas and somebody has got to look after the offices in new york  it has been arranged that your father and mother are to go along first fred and later on randy and andys father and mother are to come out then when they go back to new york its possible that jacks folks will come west before the season is over gifs folks have not decided on what they can do but will let us know in a week or two  and what about the girls questioned fred quickly  of course they are to go along too martha will go with mary and her folks and may will of course be with my mother and she is going to try to get ruth to go with her  but ruth said she was going somewhere else remarked jack and his face showed disappointment  i know that jack but i think may can get the stevensons to allow her to go anyway all the girls are going to try  after that the rovers and gif asked many other questions concerning big horn ranch and spouter told them all he could  of course i know only what dad has written and what was said about the ranch before we purchased it i suppose ill learn a lot more as soon as i go home and then ill let you know about it  gee we ought to have the best time ever exclaimed andy gleefully as he caught spouter by the shoulders and commenced to dance him around the room  it was certainly well worth waiting for spouter came from jack  i dont see how you managed to keep it a secret put in randy id have been bustin to tell it every minute  well i had a job of it believe me with you fellows dinging at me all the time was spouters answer  when do you suppose we can start questioned fred  that of course will depend a good deal on you and your folks answered spouter my folks are already out there getting the ranch in readiness for visitors i suppose youll want to go home over the fourth of july but maybe youll be able to start west right after that  i dont know what could hold us back  is the ranch house big enough to accommodate such a large crowd questioned jack there are a lot of us remember  i think so you see the ranch is really a combination of two ranches the buildings of one ranch were located near the eastern boundary while the buildings of the other ranch were set equally close to the western boundary and as a result the two sets of buildings are not very far apart father and mother didnt know exactly what they were going to do they said they would either divide the party between the two ranch houses or otherwise send all the hired help to one of the houses and keep our whole party at the other  it would be nice if we could stick together said randy  oh it wont make much difference because as i understand it its only a short walk from one set of buildings to the other  after this revelation from spouter it was difficult for the rover boys and gif to settle down once more to their essay writing and their examinations however all did their best and when the school term came to an end each had made a creditable showing  ill be proud to take this card home and show it said fred as he examined the pasteboard which had been handed to him  out of a possible 100 per cent he had received 94 per cent jack had passed with 92 per cent randy with 89 per cent and andy with 88 per cent this last figure was the one also reached by gif spouter who was naturally a very studious person had passed with the highest mark of the class96 per cent  well eightyeight per cent isnt as good as it might be but its a good deal better than lots of the fellows made remarked andy and its a long way from the failure markbelow seventy  of course the boys had already talked over the telephone to the girls and then it leaked out that all of those at clearwater hall knew about big horn ranch and that ruth was almost certain that she could go with the rover girls and may  if we all go together we had better charter a private car remarked jack  say that would be something worth while put in fred with satisfaction lets put it up to our folks  two days before the boys were to leave for home randy saw a messenger boy deliver a telegram to snopper duke the professor read the brief communication and then randy saw him stagger up against a chair in the hallway as if about to fall he rushed forward and caught the professor by the arm  what is the trouble professor he questioned kindly for he could see that snopper duke was in deep distress  ii dont mind me rover stammered the teacher its a little bad news thats all and coming on top of some other bad news ive received lately i can hardly stand it and with these words snopper duke turned and went slowly upstairs to his room half an hour later he was closeted with colonel colby and then drove away from the hall and that was the last the colby hall cadets saw of the strange teacher during that term  hes certainly got something on his mind said randy in telling the others of the incident and i must confess im growing really sorry for him  on the next day came another surprise for the rovers all of them were out on the campus when they saw brassy bangs leap a side hedge and start toward the school at the same time they saw a tall man wearing a slouch hat hurrying off in the opposite direction  hello there is that fellow brassy had trouble with in town exclaimed randy  just look at brassy whispered fred after the youth had passed them and gone into the hall why hes as pale as a ghost  it certainly is a mystery about brassy and that strange man was jacks comment just as much of a mystery as about professor dukes doings  soon the boys were busy packing up getting ready to leave then came the usual jolly times just previous to saying goodbye to their fellowcadets and the teachers the students were to scatter in all directions and the majority of them expected to have a glorious time during the summer vacation phil franklin was to go back to the oil fields to visit his father  at the railroad station the rovers met mary and martha and also some of the other girls and here many goodbyes were said  i hope you get a chance to get out to big horn ranch said jack to ruth  so do i jack but i havent received permission to go yet if i dont get there you must write to me  i certainly will ruth and you must write also but come out if you possibly can  the homecoming of the rovers was as usual made a gala event the three mothers had come down to meet their children and there was a happy reunion at the grand central terminal and then the three families drove off in their automobiles to their homes on riverside drive a little later the fathers of the young folks came in from downtown and that night there was a grand dinner spread for all in tom rovers house  gosh its good to be home once more mother cried andy and hugged his parent from one side while his twin hugged her from the other  and its mighty good to think that we can all be together came from jack its so different from what it was when the war was going on  oh please dont speak of the war i never want to hear of it again put in martha  and to think were all going out to big horn ranch burst out fred isnt that just the grandest ever     chapter xviii  on the way west   well were off for big horn ranch at last  it certainly is a grand prospect eh jack we ought to have barrels of fun on the ranch  yes randy it certainly ought to make a dandy vacation  im fairly itching to get on horseback put in andy what dandy rides we shall have  maybe well get a chance to break in a broncho put in fred with a grin  dont you dare do such a thing fred rover burst out his sister mary most likely the bronco would break your neck  well we wont bust any broncos until we get to the ranch came with a smile from freds father who had followed the young people into the sleeping car at the grand central terminal  it was the day of their departure for the west and the young folks were quivering with suppressed excitement sam rover and his wife headed the party which consisted of the four boys and the two girls  fourth of july had been spent rather quietly at home preparing for the trip of course andy and randy had had some fun especially with fireworks in the evening but otherwise the young folks had been too preoccupied with their arrangements for getting away to pay special attention to the national holiday  it had been arranged that only the rovers mentioned above should at first make the trip to the ranch and gif and spouter were to meet them in chicago where they would change cars for montana tom rover and his wife were to come to the ranch two weeks later and bring with them may powell and ruth stevenson later still it was barely possible that dick rover and his wife would come west  jacks idea of chartering a private car had fallen through because not all of the party to meet at big horn ranch were to go at the same time but those now gathered had seats at one end of the sleeper along with a private compartment for mrs rover and the two girls so they were all comfortable  the boys were in the best of spirits and for a while sam rover had his hands full making andy and randy behave  i hope we strike a lot of lively cowboys uncle sam broke out andy  perhaps youll find some of the cowboys too lively was the answer  jack and fred as well as their sisters were disappointed that may and ruth had not been able to accompany them but they were glad to know that the others would follow later to the ranch  soon new york was left behind and the train was speeding along the hudson river on its way to albany  just think by this time tomorrow well be in chicago remarked martha isnt it wonderful how you can cover such a distance  do you know i almost wish we were going out there in an auto returned fred that would be a trip worth taking  especially if you had to put on all the extra tires along the way fred added andy with a grin  oh well i guess i could do that too if i had to answered the youngest rover boy quickly but the roads from here to chicago are pretty good they tell me so i dont think wed have many punctures or blowouts  such a trip would be dandy only it might take more time than wed care to spend on the way right now remarked jack personally i want to get out to big horn ranch as soon as possible  exactly my sentiments came from randy me for the mountains and plains and a life in the open air      oh for a life in the open air     under the skies so blue and fair  sang out andy gayly  gee andy is bursting into poetry cried fred whats going to happen next  maybe he ate something that didnt agree with him giggled mary  youd better bottle up that poetry stuff andy remarked jack remember were going out to a ranch owned by songbird powell and he was nicknamed songbird while at putnam hall because he was always bursting out into homemade poetry maybe well get a surplus of it when we get out to the ranch  lunch was had in the dining car and almost before the young folks realized it the train was rolling into albany here an extra car was attached and then they were off on the long journey through the mohawk valley to buffalo cleveland and the great city by the lakes  after the train had passed utica andy and randy who found it hard to sit still took a walk through the cars from end to end thinking they might meet somebody they knew they were gone so long that sam rover became a little worried over them  i think ill hunt them up he said to his wife for all we know they may have gotten into some mischief  more than likely theyre into something answered mrs grace rover theyre exactly like their father tom when it comes to stirring things up  sam rover was just leaving his seat when andy and randy came back to the car their faces showed their excitement  what do you think exclaimed randy as he dropped into a seat we met that same fellow who was threatening brassy bangs at haven point  was brassy with him questioned jack quickly  no but two other men were with him and its a tough crowd believe me  where are they questioned fred  two cars behind and from the way the three talked they must have gotten on at albany the fellow brassy had something to do with is tough enough but the other two men seem to be much worse by their talk they are cattle men and i shouldnt be surprised if they have been cowboys  and that isnt all added andy they spoke about going to arrow junction  arrow junction repeated fred why thats the town that spouter said was nearest to big horn ranch  what were they going to do at arrow junction questioned jack  theyve got some sort of a deal on for handling horses and cattle we couldnt make out exactly what it was answered randy but they certainly are a tough bunch it looks to me as if they might have been drinking  did you hear them mention brassy asked fred  no but that fellow who met brassy at haven point the chap called bud haddon told the others he had struck a real snap in the east and one of the others answered that he had noticed that bud was rather flush  its certainly a mystery what that fellow had to do with brassy remarked jack and then of a sudden his face became a study  a sudden thought had occurred to him and it was such a horrible one that he was inclined to force it from his mind and yet it came bobbing up time and again until fred who was sitting beside his cousin noticed that something was on his mind  what are you thinking of jack ruth  no fred i was thinking of that fellow who met brassy bangs in haven point  youre wondering i suppose why brassy let him have some money  partly that and partly something else fred but its so horrible i hate to think of it  why what do you mean jack  well if you must know it just happened to cross my mind that that bud haddon was hanging around haven point and was seen around the school several times just when colby hall was robbed  as the young major uttered these words in a low tone of voice fred stared at him in astonishment  my gracious jack thats so he whispered isnt it queer we didnt think of it before from what andy and randy tell of how that fellow treated brassy i wouldnt put it past him to be a bad one but if he had anything to do with the robbery at the school do you think brassy had too  i dont know what to think fred brassy never struck me as that sort of a fellow hes loudmouthed and hes got a big opinion of himself and all that but i never put him down as being crooked  neither did i but you must remember one thingthat fellow was dinging at him for money he said brassy must get it or there would be trouble  yes im remembering that fred i must confess it looks pretty bad but i dont think we had better say anything until we know more about the men  lets pump andy and randy all we can  freds suggestion was followed out and the four rover boys talked the matter over among themselves the twins were as much surprised as fred had been when jack mentioned what was in his mind  gee that bud haddon may be the guilty one burst out randy why didnt we think of this before colonel colby might have put a detective on his trail  do you think we ought to send him a telegram or anything like that asked andy  it wouldnt do much good what would be better i think is for us to watch the man and see if we can find out more about him if he is going to arrow junction we may have a chance of learning more about him out there did he expect to stay at the junction  i think soor at least in that vicinity the whole crowd is bound for some ranch out there  then if we learn anything of importance against the fellow we can have the local authorities make an investigation said jack  gosh wouldnt it be queer if that fellow really had robbed colby hall and if brassy was mixed up in it remarked randy  it would be terrible if brassy was guilty answered jack it would just about ruin him forever  come on jack suppose you and i walk back and see if we can locate the fellows suggested fred they dont know us so they wont be suspicious  well we might try it was the young majors reply  and thereupon he and his cousin walked through the cars to the place where the twins said bud haddon and his two companions were seated     chapter xix  in the saddle   the two boys located the three men without any trouble they were seated near the end of the car where there was a water cooler and here the two lads stopped to fumble for a minute or two over the paper drinking cups and then to take their time getting a drink  yes we ought to make a lot of money on that deal noxley they heard bud haddon say that is provided we mind what were doin  oh therell be no tripup this time answered the man called noxley  ive been wonderin how many horses there would be that we could sell put in the third man of the group  i heard we could get at least twenty jenks of course i cant tell exactly until ive looked over the ground  well twenty head of horses and two hundred head of cattle are not to be sneezed at answered the man called jenks a fine piece of business ill say and he laughed shrewdly  how long do you expect to stay at arrow junction before you go out to bimbels ranch questioned noxley  not more n three or four days im expectin word from bimbel as soon as i reach the junction and then ill know just what he wants us to do  one thing i want understood went on jenks crossly this time i get all thats comin to meno holdin back  and i want the same remember that put in noxley sourly  youll get your full shareno fear of that said haddon reassuringly only remember youve got to do your full share of the work too no shirkin at the last minute  well we dont want to be takin too many chances and jenks shook his uncombed head dubiously  youve got to take chances in this game jenks you cant expect the hens to lay eggs right in your hands and haddon chuckled at his little joke  after that the men talked about a good time they had had in albany the evening before they said nothing further of what they expected to do in the west nor did haddon mention haven point or brassy bangs  we might as well go back whispered jack to fred after they had remained as long at the water cooler as they dared the men had glanced at them carelessly but had evidently given them scant attention  when the two lads returned to the others they held a consultation and then laid the whole case before freds father sam rover listened with interest and his face became a study  it is just possible that your guess may be correct and this fellow haddon may be guilty of robbing colby hall but it would be sheer foolishness to accuse the fellow unless you had sufficient evidence against him this talk about horses and cattle may be a perfectly legitimate affair however when we get to the ranch we can look into the matter further and find out what sort of place this bimbels ranch is and what the men really intend to do while there that may give us a better line on this bud haddon and the others  im going to watch that crowd as long as they travel with us said jack and the other lads said they would do the same  a night was spent on the train all the boys sleeping soundly and in the middle of the forenoon they rolled into the great station at chicago here the lads kept their eyes wide open and saw haddon and his two companions walk away dresssuitcases in hand nor did they reappear when the rovers an hour later hurried for the train which was to take them further westward evidently the three men were going to take some other train to montana  here they are weve been waiting for you folks came the cry and spouter rushed up to the rovers followed by gif  ho for the glorious west put in gif arent you fellows anxious to get there he questioned  anxious doesnt express it answered andy why all night long i was riding broncos and lassoing wild cattle and he grinned  sleepingcar accommodations had been reserved for all of the crowd and they were soon making themselves at home then as the train sped westward the rovers told their chums about bud haddon  that certainly is interesting said gif just the same i cant think that brassy bangs is a thief why if youll remember he said he had been robbed himself  he might have said that just to throw dust in the eyes of the public answered spouter to my mind it will certainly be a good thing to keep our eyes open for this fellow haddon  the trip to montana took the best part of three days and every one in the party enjoyed the journey thoroughly they often went out to the observation end of the train there to view the endless panorama of prairies and mountains forests and streams as they sped swiftly past the magnificent view impressed spouter as much as anybody  its sublimestupendously sublime he murmured over and over again the thoughts that well up in my bosom at such a sight as this are beyond the power of words to express when i view these immense plains these mountain tops fading away in the distance these wild and weird torrents rushing over the rocks and these trackless forests with often not a human abode in sight i cannot but think  that there is room here for every man woman and child in the city of new york and then some finished andy gee how can they stick in one or two miserable cubbyholes of rooms when we have all this land to draw on  thats what gets me put in gif but they do it and im told that a whole lot of em would rather die huddled together than live out here where neighbors are miles apart  the through train took them only as far as arrow junction here they alighted and then boarded a little side line running through the hills to a dozen small stations including four rocks  this isnt so nice sighed martha when all had piled into one of the two little cars which comprised the train their baggage had been put in the other car which was a combination baggage and smoking car there were but a few other passengers in the car including one fat woman with two small and exceedingly dirty children there were also several cowboys and a chinaman who looked as if he might be a cook  i think dad has a chink at our ranch said spouter anyway he wrote he thought hed hire one  they had telegraphed ahead so that there might be some one to meet them when they arrived at four rocks  its certainly an odd name for a railroad station remarked mrs rover to her husband  four rocks sounds substantial enough he returned with a smile  is it much of a town  not likely to be any town at all perhaps a little railroad station and possibly one store which of course would also be the postoffice  sam rovers idea of four rocks proved to be correct situated near a ridge of rocks was a small railroad station with a telegraph office and baggage room attached a water tower and opposite to the station were two low buildings one a general store and the other a place where there had once been a saloon and dance hall but which was now closed up  theres my dad now cried spouter excitedly as he leaped off the train and the next minute he was running towards an automobile in which sat his parent where is ma he demanded  she remained at the house to see that everything was in readiness when you got there answered songbird powell as he shook hands with his son  close to the automobile stood a number of horses all saddled on one sat a bronzed cowboy who grinned broadly at the boys and tipped his hat rather awkwardly to mrs rover and the girls  this is my foreman joe jackson said songbird powell joe this is mr and mrs rover and these are the rover boys and their sisters and this is my son and another of his chums i guess youll get better acquainted a little later on and he smiled broadly  whos to ride on horseback questioned andy quickly we cant all get into that machine  you boys can all ride with joe answered spouters father i thought youd rather do that than anything else the girls and the others can ride with me  how do you know i dont want to ride on horseback uncle john cried martha gayly she often called this intimate chum of her father uncle  no martha youd better ride with us now put in mrs rover hastily you can do your horseback riding later on  oh i was only fooling aunt grace the girl replied  im just crazy to see big horn ranch uncle john came from mary  well i hope youll like it returned songbird powell i want every one of you to have the best times ever while youre here his eyes glistened we ought to have a regular oldfashioned reunion and then unable to control himself he broke out into a bit of his oldtime doggerel      im glad youre here     i hope youll stay     ill miss you much     when youre away  hurrah songbird that certainly sounds natural cried sam rover slapping his old chum on the shoulder youll have to give us more of that later on  i havent spent much time on verses the last few years sam answered songbird ive been too busy attending to business but maybe ill get back to it while loafing around the ranch he added  are any other people coming to the ranch  yes one other person and i think youll be very much surprised to see him  who is that  oh you had better wait until he arrives returned songbird powell and began to grin as though the thought of what was coming pleased him  the older persons and the girls waited until all the boys were safely in the saddle and then songbird powell started the automobile  im leaving them in your care joe he called back to his foreman as he moved along bring em to the ranch in safety  trust me called out the foreman promptly well be at the ranch almost as soon as you  well dont ride the horses to death shouted back songbird and then in a few minutes more the automobile disappeared in the distance  the boys will certainly enjoy that horseback riding said mary  glad of it answered songbird powell and as the automobile rolled onward he murmured gaily      an elephant sat on a bamboo tree     and he was as happy as he could be     to travel said he is awfully punk     unless you remember to take your trunk  oh what a funny rhyme giggled martha  ill have to write that down in my scrap book returned her cousin and at this remark spouters father looked real pleased  hurrah for big horn ranch shouted randy waving his cap come on if youre ready  dont work your horses too hard at the start cautioned joe jackson its a good five miles to the ranch and part of it is rather tough climbing  if its tough climbing how is the automobile going to get there questioned jack quickly  oh theyll go around by the river road but that is eight miles longer well take the hills  then maybe we can get there first after all broke in fred  well we can try anyhow answered the foreman of the ranch do all of you boys know how to ride  sure we do  then forward it is and away rode the foreman with jack and spouter on either side of him and the others following close behind     chapter xx  at big horn ranch   the way lay along a flat stretch of prairie bordering the river and then up into the hills the brushwood in the immediate neighborhood was scanty but in the distance they could see some scrub timber backed up by a stretch of forest far to the westward they could see the distant mountains over which the sun was now setting  come on you fellows come on dont lag behind shouted spouter and set off at a brisk pace along the welldefined trail leading to the ranch  joe jackson having seen that all of them could ride well was quite willing to let them set their own pace  only look and see where youre going he shouted and remember at the split in the trail to take the one on the right and then he allowed them to plunge on ahead but kept his eyes on everything they were doing  illustration off to the eastward you can see a bit of our range rover boys at big horn ranch page 205  two miles from the station the boys found they had quite a climb and here they were forced to slow down a little later they reached the top of the first hill  there off to the eastward you can see a bit of our range said the ranch foreman pointing with his finger and those cattle yonder are our cattle  by the time they reached the foot of the first hill the sun was setting beyond the mountains in the west and the long shadows were creeping across the trail and over the forest beyond  this must be some dark trail at night remarked jack  dark as a tunnel answered joe jackson you have to carry a lantern or a flashlight when you try to ride it after dark  ever get held up questioned fred curiously  nary a holdup lad answered the foreman with a grin we leave all that to the movie men  did you ever have a moving picture company out here asked gif  yes we had one crowd out here last year they stayed around about six weeks taking some sort of a drama as they called it it was funny added the foreman with a chuckle the leading lady was scared to death of horses and yet she had to do a little riding the man who was having the pictures taken wanted her to smile while she was cantering along but that smile believe me wasnt anything to brag about they ought to have brought along some leading lady who liked horses and knew all about em  did they use any of your outfit  oh they used a few of our cowboys in a roundup they wanted me to go into some of the pictures but i told em there was nothing doingthat i was here to manage the ranch and not make moving pictures  how many men on the place asked randy  we have six at present but the boss is thinking of getting some more and increasing the herd  did dad get his chinese cook questioned spouter  yes hes got a chink named hop lung a pretty good sort of a chap too  they crossed two more hills and then passed through a patch of tall timber here there was a rough wagon road and the foreman explained that it was used for hauling firewood to the ranch house and the bunkhouse  it was growing dark when the party on horseback approached the ranch already lights were streaming from the windows and the automobile stood in front of the wide veranda which ran around two sides of the building  they got here ahead of us announced jack  i thought they would answered the foreman the river road is in pretty good shape just now so i suppose the boss made fast time in driving over  the trail to the ranch was rougher than i expected put in andy if you tried to run a horse over it he would most likely break a leg and maybe you would break your neck  ive known one of our boys to go over to the station inside of twenty minutes returned the foreman but he only did it to catch a train and on a bet id rather take my time and save my horseflesh  when they reached the ranch mrs powell came out on the veranda to greet her son and his chums she was a roundfaced motherly woman and she immediately did all she could to make the young folks feel at home  you must be thoroughly tired out from your long trip said she so we will have supper right away and then if any of you want to go to bed you can do so  i cant say that im tired answered jack but i suppose the girls are and maybe aunt grace is too  the travelers were shown to some rooms and then told where they could wash up if they so desired  supper will be ready in ten minutes announced mrs powell so dont take too much time in primping up she added with a smile to the girls remember you are on a ranch now and you can dress exactly as you please  im going to slip on a plain gingham right now declared martha  their hand baggage had been brought along on the runningboard of the touring car and a little later one of the cowboys came in with their trunks which had been brought over from the station in a wagon in the meanwhile the crowd sat down to a somewhat elaborate supper which hop lung had prepared under mrs powells supervision  hes a very good cook the lady of the ranch confided to mrs rover but he occasionally tries to turn out some very funny concoctions so that i find it advisable to keep my eyes on him  the cowboys are quite excited over the idea of having visitors here all summer said songbird powell during the course of the meal and two or three of them are especially excited over the fact that there are going to be so many girls and ladies you see the brothers who used to own these combined ranches werent married and all they had around the houses were an indian woman and a real old dutch woman who was almost entirely deaf  joe jackson told me that one of the cowboys a fellow named hank minno was very bashful and had almost been on the point of giving up his job when he heard so many skirts were coming here  oh dear i think id like to make the acquaintance of mr hank said martha mischievously  perhaps if he saw you coming hed run away returned mary  oh i think hell get over his bashfulness and so will some of the others answered songbird powell and let me tell you one thingwhen i first got here i thought the men were a pretty rough crowd but the more i get to know them the more im satisfied theyre all right at heart  your foreman certainly seems to be a fine fellow said jack we got well acquainted with him riding over  he was well recommended by the former owners of the ranch jack and so far ive had no occasion to find any fault with him he seems thoroughly trustworthy  the powells had given their visitors their choice of what to do concerning rooms they could either crowd themselves a little and remain in the one ranch house or otherwise the boys could take rooms in the other house which was located about two hundred yards away  if we went over to the other place we could have things all our own way whispered andy to his brother and fred we could come and go to suit ourselves  i think you boys had better stay in this house with us said mrs rover then we can keep an eye on you  but there is no sense in all of us being crowded returned sam rover and the boys are certainly old enough to take care of themselves i think we had better let this matter rest until tomorrow and then we can see how we can arrange it  if the boys go over to the other ranch house ill have joe jackson stay there with them said songbird hell know how to make them line up if anything goes wrong  several days later it was arranged for all the boys to take their belongings and settle down in the other ranch house so far as rooming was concerned they were to have their meals in the main house the foreman of the ranch went with them taking a room in a corner where he could watch what was going on if it became necessary to do so the boys took three connecting rooms the twins occupying one jack and fred another and spouter and gif the third  on the second day at the ranch the boys began to feel quite at home accompanied by the men they had visited many points of interest and had become acquainted with all the cowboys and also with hop lung the cook  wellee nice boys remarked the cook after they had been chatting with him and gone their way wellee nice boys me cookee heap good dinner for em and then he dived into his kitchen to start his preparations for the next meal  the boys found all the cowboys friendly one of them could do some marvelous stunts with a lasso and urged by the foreman gave an exhibition which interested the lads exceedingly  why that fellow is as good as anybody on the vaudeville stage remarked fred i never dreamed so much could be done with a rope just see how he whirled it around his body and between his legs and over his head  yes and how he lassoed those three running horses all in a bunch added fred thats what got me  he ought to be in a wild west show put in jack  ill have the boys give you an exhibition of shooting this evening said the foreman and he was as good as his word  some of the cowboys proved to be remarkable shots both with the rifle and the pistol but here the boys especially fred and jack felt at home and they too showed what they could do  rattlesnakes and tarantulas exclaimed one of the cowboys hank minno the fellow who was supposed to be so bashful you kids sure kin shoot some i spose you learned it at that there military school youve been goin to  yes answered fred although we sometimes do a little practicing when were at home down in the long cellar of our house  well its a good thing to know how to shoot lad sometimes it comes in mighty handy like answered hank minno     chapter xxi  hop lung and the fish   by the end of the first week all of the boys felt thoroughly at home on big horn ranch they had visited many points of interest including the cowboys bunkhouse and also the big range to the eastward and they had likewise tramped over a number of the hills and tried their hand at fishing in the river  it certainly is one dandy place remarked jack to the others one day when they were coming up to the house from the river each with a fairsized string of fish to his credit  we certainly never had such fishing as this in the east answered gif as he looked at his string admiringly just look at the size of em will you  i wonder what hop lung will say when he sees them remarked fred  ive got a scheme cried andy lets have a little fun and thereupon he unfolded to the others what he had in mind to do they readily agreed to his suggestion and all came up to the ranch house by a roundabout way then spouter called out loudly  hop lung hop lung come out here a minute  a moment later the chinese cook appeared a long soup ladle in on one hand and a carving knife in the other  you callee me he queried  yes answered spouter i want you to come around to the front of the house and tell me what you know about this and he motioned to the cook to follow him around to the big veranda  no sooner had their chum and the cook disappeared than the others ran into the kitchen here at one side was a homemade kitchen cabinet the top within a foot of the ceiling  see if you can find the big breadboard said randy i guess that will answer our purpose  and here is the fishing line added his twin we can run it from the ceiling over to the window and then outside  the line was run to the window as mentioned then fastened to the ceiling back of the cabinet and then to the back end of the board which was placed flat on the top of the cabinet on the board the boys placed the fish laying them out in a row from front to back one fish was placed on the pulledout shelf of the lower part of the cabinet  now then clear out before hop lung catches us said andy and the lads lost no time in disappearing  in the meanwhile spouter had taken the chinese cook to the front of the ranch house and then to an outoftheway corner where there was a large spiders web  hello hes gone now exclaimed spouter in a tone of disappointment do you see him anywhere hop lung  hop lung see what demanded the puzzled cook  why that great big blue and gold spider with white feet  blue an gol spide queried hop lung see black spide  oh no i dont mean the black spider i mean that great big blue and gold spider about that long and spouter showed up his two forefingers six inches apart  noee see spide so long dat answered the chinese cook shaking his head doubtfully sploutel maybe see catpillal  no it wasnt a caterpillar it was a spider although i think it might have had wings  um wings spide he all the samee buttelfly announced hop lung no see him and he got down on his hands and knees to peer up into the corner to make certain  spouter continued to engage his attention until he heard the boys coming around the corner of the house then he turned to them as if in surprise  hello i thought you fellows were off fishing he remarked  so we were answered gif calmly  i got a nice little fish hop lung i laid him in the kitchen for you remarked andy  you git only one flish queried the cook in surprise  well maybe you can catch more put in randy  hop lung no go flishee hop lung cookee was the calm reply and then the cook walked back to the rear of the ranch house  watching their chance the boys stole back some to the window where was located the string which had been attached to the board on the top of the cabinet and others to another window from which they might see what would take place hop lung had gone inside and picked up the fish left on the cabinet shelf he looked it over wiped off the shelf carefully and then took up the fish and disappeared into the pantry with it  now then andy whispered his twin and thereupon andy gave the string in his hand two or three little jerks from the board on the top of the cabinet a fish fell down to the shelf below  it had hardly fallen in place when hop lung came from the pantry he looked to see how matters were going on the stove and then turned again to the cabinet  a queer look came over his face when he saw the fish lying in the same place that the first had occupied he looked toward the door to find no one there  him funny he murmured in his pidginenglish him vellee funny then he took up the second fish and walked into the pantry with it  no sooner had he done this than andy doing his best to control his laughter jiggled the string again this time as luck would have it two fish came down to light side by side on the cabinet shelf  again hop lung entered the kitchen and again he looked at what was cooking on the stove he stirred the mass in one of the pots carefully and then came back to his cabinet to get some seasoning  when he saw the two fish lying there his eyes nearly started out of his head he jabbered something in his native tongue and then looked around wildly first to one side of the kitchen and then the other then he looked toward the door leading to the dining room and then he came to the door leading to the yard  duck was all andy said and he and the others lost no time in getting out of sight  hop lung looked carefully around the yard and then came slowly back into the kitchen he walked again to the stove to see that nothing was burning and finally came back to the cabinet and picked up the two fish gingerly meanwhile the boys tiptoed their way back to their original positions at the windows  hell begin to think the cabinet is haunted whispered jack  either that or else hell think hes bewitched answered gif  and both were about right for the poor chinaman looked all around the cabinet and even behind and under it and then he looked under the table and the chairs finally still bewildered he walked into the pantry with the fish which he carried before him at arms length as if afraid it might bite him  better give him a shower now andy whispered his brother and thereupon andy gave the string a strong pull which sent all the remaining fish tumbling down on the cabinet and the floor the noise reached hop lung in the pantry and he came forth on a run  when he saw the quantity of fish that had appeared so miraculously he was nearly dumbfounded with eyes and mouth wide open and hands upraised he uttered a sudden yell of fright and dove through the doorway leading to the dining room and the living room beyond  in the living room mrs rover and mrs powell were sitting doing some sewing the sudden appearance of the chinaman caused them to look up in astonishment  what is the matter hop lung demanded mrs powell as she sprang to her feet  flishee flishee screamed the cook kitchen full flishee hop lung no knowee where flishee come one flisheetwo flisheetwo flishee morewhole blame kitchen flishee spluttered the cook his eyes rolling from one side to the other  gracious me is the man crazy asked mrs rover rising what does he mean by flishee  flishee flishee repeated hop lung no flisheeall flishee  i cant imagine what hes driving at remarked mrs powell where is the trouble hop lung in the kitchen  les miz plowell kitchen all flishee  without ado the lady of the ranch marched into the kitchen followed by mrs rover all the ladies could see were the freshlycaught fish resting on the cabinet shelf and the floor  i dont see anything the matter here except that some of your fish are on the floor remarked mrs powell calmly you had better pick them up and wash them off  did the boys catch those fish asked mrs rover they said they were going fishing a couple of hours ago  boys clatchee one flishee announced hop lung then a sudden idea entered his head and he made a quick leap to the yard door he was just in time to see the boys trying to retreat all laughing merrily  you foolee hop lung you foolee hop lung he shrieked wildly and of a sudden came back into the kitchen scooped up several of the fish and ran outside again wildly he threw one fish after another at the lads  hop lung stop that commanded mrs powell sternly those fish are too good to throw away  bloys fool hop lung was the reply one flisheetwo flisheefour flisheeall whole lot flishee he continued trying his best to explain and then by pantomime he showed how he had found the first of the fish and placed them in the pantry  its nothing more than some of their tricks hop lung said mrs powell they had no right to play such tricks and ill call them to account for it but you had better pick up the fish which you threw outside theyre too good to be thrown away  hop lung flix bloys play flishee tlick answered the celestial and then a little later he set about preparing supper  the boys did not think it wise to return to the house just then and so wandered off to the stable where the ranch horses were kept  it was certainly a rich joke remarked fred with a chuckle  ill bet hop lung will have it in for us for that returned randy  and hop lung did have it in for them as they were to learn in the near future     chapter xxii  a horse and a snake   during the days which followed at big horn ranch the rover boys and their chums asked joe jackson if he knew bud haddon and the other men who had been with him  yes i know haddon answered the foreman of the ranch he used to work for bimbel on a ranch on the other side of the river but i think he left there several months ago  well if he did i rather think hes going back answered jack can you tell us anything about him  oh i imagine hes as good as the average fellow around bimbels place answered joe jackson you see none of our crowd have much to do with that outfit bimbel is a hard fellow to get along with and some of the men working for his outfit have rather shady characters the foreman looked at the boys curiously how do you happen to know the fellow  the lads had come to like the foreman very much and felt that they could trust him thoroughly so they told their story in detail to which jackson listened with interest  looks to me as if haddon was trying to blackmail that kid bangs was his comment that is unless there was something in the talk about that barn being burned with the horses its just possible that fellow bangs had something to do with it and haddon was making him pay for keeping his mouth shut  do you know anybody by the name of john calder whose barn burned down  no that couldnt have been anywhere around here or i certainly would have heard about it but theres one thing i do know added the foreman suddenly theres a man named jarley bangs who owns a ranch on the other side of the rivera small place next to the one run by bimbel  jarley bangs exclaimed fred do you suppose it could be brassy bangs father  i dont think so answered gif i believe bangs folks live in wyoming  but this bangs may be some relative of his put in spouter  the matter was talked over a while longer but the boys could learn little further from the foreman  ill tell you what ill do said joe jackson at last ill put it up to some of the cowboys they may know more about bimbel and his outfit and about jarley bangs than i do bangs has a reputation for being a very queer and miserly man but thats about all i can say of him  the boys and even the girls spent quite a little of their time in the saddle both mary and martha had learned to ride while at home using the bridle path in central park so they felt at home when galloping over the plains  this outing is going to do mary a world of good confided mrs rover to mrs powell she has always been so timid  the river in which the boys went fishing and also bathing was a broad shallow stream which could be forded in many places with ease so far however the lads had remained on their side of the watercourse but one day jack proposed that they go off on horseback and do a little exploring on the other side  we might ride past the bimbel place and also the one jarley bangs owns said he who knows but what we may catch sight of bud haddon and his crowd  we dont want to get into any trouble with those fellows put in fred quickly  oh they cant touch us exclaimed andy they dont even know us and weve as much right to use the trails around here as anybodythe land isnt fenced in  yes but you know what jackson said went on fred he said the bimbel outfit wasnt a very nice one and that bangs was very miserly and peculiar that sounds as if both places were good ones to steer clear of  oh come on lets go anyhow put in spouter im anxious to know what sort of neighbors we have they cant find any fault with us for coming over when they find out that my father owns this ranch  the boys talked this matter over several times and the next day obtained permission to take the horses and go off for a days outing along the river they were to take their lunch with them and did not expect to come back until evening  i wish we could go along sighed martha  well take you along next time martha answered her brother this time im afraid the ride will be a little too long for you  never mind martha and i will take a little ride of our own declared mary we can go up to the edge of the woods and pick some wild flowers  lets do it answered her cousin quickly one of the cowboys tells me there are all sorts of wild flowers up there near one of the springs  hop lung was told to prepare a lunch which the boys might take along with them and set to work immediately as he got the things ready the celestial had a faraway look in his eyes and once or twice he stuck out his tongue suggestively  one flisheetwo flisheelot flishee he murmured to himself hop lung fixee boys and he smiled in his own peculiar way  the day dawned bright and clear and immediately after breakfast the boys leaped into the saddle and with goodnatured shouts swung the sombreros they were wearing and started off on their ride each had equipped himself with a pistol although they expected to do no shooting and several carried small saddlebags containing their food and drink the latter placed in a couple of thermos bottles they also carried feed for the horses  whoopla shouted andy gaily come on fellows lets put distance between ourselves and the ranch  better take it a little easy at the start andy remonstrated gif remember we expect to cover quite a few miles and we dont want to wear out the horses at the start  well let spouter set the pace announced jack for he had not forgotten that they were all guests of the lad mentioned  they had questioned the foreman regarding the lay of the land and he had drawn up a rough map for them which jack carried inside of half an hour they reached the fording place he had mentioned and there crossed the stream coming out on the side of a small hill  i wonder if well come across any wild animals remarked fred as they pushed along a welldefined trail leading to the top of the hill and through a small patch of scrub timber further westward  from what joe jackson said i dont think theres very much left in this immediate vicinity answered spouter you see the cowboys have scared most of the animals away of course they occasionally come across a bobcat or a mountain lion and then we might come across a wolf or a fox or some jackrabbits or even a bear  well please dont let em come at us in a bunch cried randy with a grin one at a time please  itll be our luck not to see a thing worth shooting declared fred i wouldnt give five cents for our chances of bringing down anything  fred had scarcely spoken when the horse gif was riding shied suddenly to one side throwing gif into some low bushes then the horse gave a snort and leaped ahead on the trail not stopping until he had covered a hundred yards or more  hello whats the trouble exclaimed jack bringing his own steed to a halt are you hurt gif  no im all right but what startled that horse demanded the other lad as he scrambled to his feet then he gave a sudden yell its a snake look out  all looked in the direction pointed out by gif and there saw a black object wriggling away through the brushwood as quickly as they could jack and spouter who were close by pulled out their pistols and fired at the snake they saw the reptile rise up in the air turning and twisting and then disappear from sight between the rocks  whats up what are you shooting at cried fred galloping to the spot  a snake he scared gifs horse and threw gif into the bushes  where is he  i guess he got away although i think we wounded him answered jack  its funny how that horse shied said spouter maybe he stepped right on the snake  that might be put in fred maybe the snake was sunning himself and didnt notice our approach until the horse stepped on him then he switched around and that must have started the horse off i wonder if we can catch him  i think so answered spouter gosh im glad no one was bit that snake looked to be of pretty good size  while spouter and jack hurried forward to capture the runaway horse gif was assisted to the back of the steed randy rode  im glad i didnt go out on my head on the rocks remarked gif as the boys went forward i might have broken my neck  yes you picked out just the right place to fall into answered andy  i didnt pick it out i went where i was sent returned the other lad calmly after this im going to keep my eyes peeled for more snakes  i think we had better all do that said fred gee id forgotten all about those pests  when they reached the runaway horse they found him still somewhat skittish but he was soon calmed down and then gif remounted him and they set off along the trail as before  well we didnt exactly meet a wild animal remarked randy but we met something just as bad  presently the boys came to a spot where the river wound around the hill and beyond this was a broad stretch of plains apparently many miles in extent far to the southward they could see some tall timber  the bimbel ranch must be somewhere in this vicinity declared jack  yes and the bangs place cant be so very far off returned fred  but distances in the open air are deceiving and the boys rode along over the plains for the best part of an hour before they reached a spot where the trail branched in several directions here they came to a halt wondering which way to turn next  its too bad they dont put up a few signboards out here grumbled randy how is a fellow going to know where hes heading  i suppose the natives know these trails just like we know the main streets of new york city answered jack and that being so they dont need any signboards  jack had consulted the rude map given to him by the ranch foreman but this did not seem to have upon it the forks of the trail  i suppose those cowboys would know at once which was the main trail and which were only side trails said gif  the boys were still uncertain which way to turn when fred set up a cry of amazement  here comes an auto boys what do you know about that  an auto several of them repeated where  the youngest rover pointed with his finger and there to the astonishment of every one in the party they beheld a small touring car coming across the plains at a speed of twelve or fifteen miles an hour it was running in a curiously haphazard fashion  what a way to run an automobile ejaculated randy  maybe the driver is getting out of the way of holes answered jack and then he added quickly there isnt any driver  completely mystified the boys stared at the oncoming automobile for a moment it seemed heading directly for them but suddenly swerved and started off across the plains in another direction  it is empty ejaculated andy its running by itself     chapter xxiii  jarley bangs   what do you know about that  who ever heard of an automobile running around by itself  its gotten away from somebody came from jack just look at it skating over the ground  come on lets stop the blamed thing shouted andy and started off on horseback after the runaway car  youll have a sweet job catching that auto declared his twin nevertheless he followed andy and not knowing what else to do the others did the same  the automobile was of a cheap variety and clattered noisily on its way with one cylinder occasionally missing fire it had been running in a snakelike course but now it seemed to be making something of a circle  by jinks i think its coming back here exclaimed fred suddenly  it isnt running as fast as it was declared spouter maybe its going to stop  im going to see if i cant get aboard cried jack with sudden determination and headed his horse behind the touring car which was still moving at a fair rate of speed  once one of the front wheels went down in a hole and then the car slued around and started off heading almost for the boys  look out  get out of the way there or youll be run down  wild cries rent the air and the young horsemen scattered in every direction but jack was watching his chance and as the car slued around once more he managed to leap from his horse and clutch the side of the automobile then he leaped into the car and turned off the power and in a few seconds he brought the automobile to a standstill  this is the queerest adventure i ever heard of declared gif when the brief excitement had come to an end who ever heard of meeting a runaway auto like this  i guess we can be thankful that we werent run down returned fred you took a big chance jack in jumping on board as you did  oh it wasnt such a risk answered his cousin modestly i think the auto was getting ready to stop anyhow  i wonder where the owner is questioned andy  perhaps the auto struck a stone and threw him out exclaimed spouter suddenly he may be lying along the trail somewhere stunned or dead  i guess the best thing we can do is to see if we can locate the owner declared gif after a pause  come on spouter you get in the auto with me and well run it back in the direction it came from said jack the other fellows can follow and bring our horses  do you think you can run this car questioned spouter  sure i can it isnt much different from the cars im used to even though its a cheap one was the reply  spouter dismounted and was soon beside jack the power was again turned on and the car moved on with many a little jerk and jangling of metalware  its next door to a bit of junk remarked jack as they moved forward along the trail at a rate of about fifteen miles an hour i think if a fellow tried to make real speed with it it would fall to pieces  sounds to me as if it needed oiling ventured spouter  yes it needs oiling and new springs and a new engine and a new chassis and a few other things and then it would be quite a good car answered jack with a grin  the two lads in the car had covered less than a mile and the others were coming up behind them when they saw a man running toward them and waving his arms wildly  hi there stop called out the man stop i tell you if you dont stop ill have the law on you  as soon as he saw the man jack slowed up and came to a standstill by the side of the fellow he was a tall lean man of about fifty with a strangely wrinkled and sallow face and long drooping reddish mustache he had a pair of greenishbrown eyes that seemed to bore the boys through and through as he gazed rather savagely at them  what do you mean by running off with my car he demanded as he shook his fist at the lads  is this your car questioned jack  you know well enough its my car blustered the man and i demand to know what you mean by running away with it  we didnt run away with it answered spouter  yes you did  we did not put in jack we found it back there on the plains running around all by itself  what you expect me to believe such a story as that exclaimed the tall man glaring at them more ferociously than ever running around by itself how could it be doing that you took it from where i left it up by the trees yonder and he pointed to a quantity of tall timber some distance away  by this time the other boys were coming up bringing with them the two unused horses the man gazed at them in surprise and also noted the two steeds that were not being used  maybe youre telling the truth and maybe you aint went on the man sourly id like to git at the bottom of this thereupon the boys related what had taken place and spouter mentioned the fact that his father was the owner of big horn ranch  oh then youre mr powells son eh cried the man are you the boy who went to colby hall with my nephew lester bangs  is lester your nephew queried spouter and as the man nodded shortly he added then you must be mr jarley bangs and again the man nodded  i think you ought to thank our chum here jack rover for bringing your car back to you mr bangs remarked gif if he hadnt jumped from his horse into the car the machine might be racking itself to pieces out on the prairie now it was doing all sorts of stunts when he jumped aboard and shut off the power  i cant understand this nohow grumbled jarley bangs if what you say is true how in thunder did that car git started i left it by the edge of the woods while i went in to look over some timber that we thought of gitting out this fall all at once i heard the engine go off with a bang and when i ran out of the woods to see what was doing the car was gone  was any one with you questioned spouter  no i came out alone lester wanted to come along but i told him to stay at the ranch and do some work he seems to think that all hes out here for is to play  oh then lester is staying with you is he queried fred  yes his folks let him come up for a couple of months then hes going back to his home in wyoming and after that hes got to return to that military school i think its a fool notion to send him to that school if i was his father id make him stay out here and go to work  you dont suppose lester tried to start the car do you questioned andy  how could he if he was at the ranch but wait a minute he said something about going fishing in that brook that flows through the woods maybe he did come up that way after all  does he know how to run the auto asked randy  yes he does but i dont let him run it very often because hes so careless im afraid hell ruin the machinehe bangs her over the rocks something awful i aint got no money to waste on a new car this has got to do even if it is kind of used up  maybe brassyi mean lestercame up and tried to start the car while the gears were in mesh suggested jack and then when the car started to run away perhaps he got scared and ran away too  if he did anything like that hell have an account to settle with me exclaimed jarley bangs his eyes glowing with anger that boy is getting too fresh i said he could come up here thinking hed do some work around the place and so earn the money that i promised him for his schooling but evidently he thinks more of having a good time than he does of working he is forever fooling around the car and wanting to run it so i wouldnt put it past him to do what you suspect as soon as i git home ill ketch him and make him tell me the truth continued jarley bangs with a determined shake of his head  after that he questioned spouter concerning the ranch mr powell had purchased and spoke of the men who had previously owned the place  these city fellows think they kin come out here and make a fortune on a ranch he growled but after theyve owned a place a year or two they find it aint so easy a man has got to hustle like all gitout to make a living  where is your ranch located asked fred  our buildings are right behind that patch of timber was the reply its not so very much of a place but its good enough for me  and where is the bimbel ranch questioned gif  thats up to the northward over the top of yonder hill but you young fellows had better give bimbel a wide berth went on jarley bangs with a shake of his head  why asked spouter  he dont like no strangers hanging around thats why if a stranger comes up to his door bimbel always reaches for his gun he had trouble years ago with some tramps and he never got over it  after that jarley bangs had but little more to say the boys had left the touring car and now the man jumped inside saw to it that everything was in order and then asked spouter to crank up for him  aint no use to waste time here he remarked ive got to git back to what i was doing ill tell lester i saw you and if he wants to he kin come over to big horn ranch and visithe aint of much account around my place and ill git at the bottom of what happened to this auto too even if i have to lick it out of him  i dont think lester will care to visit our ranch answered spouter coldly  well i aint got nothing to say about that one way or the other now im off and with a short nod of his head jarley bangs threw in the gears of his machine and rattled away slowly gathering speed as he proceeded  a kind considerate man not exclaimed andy in disgust  how politely he thanked jack for returning his car added spouter  and the beautiful invitation we got to visit his place put in randy  i wonder if brassy really started that car on him questioned fred  it might be answered gif and then he added gee im sorry for brassy if he has to live with such an uncle as that wouldnt you think hed rather stay at home  perhaps its a case of money put in randy didnt you hear what mr bangs said about paying for tuition at colby hall brassys folks may be quite poor and they may be depending on this uncle for financial aid     chapter xxiv  a new arrival   after the disappearance of jarley bangs the rover boys and their chums continued their trip on horseback  lets move over the hill in the direction of the bimbel ranch suggested spouter id like to get a birdseye view of that outfit  perhaps we had better not go too close advised fred bimbel may be getting out a shotgun for us  i guess it isnt as bad as all that fred those things might have happened years ago when the country was more sparsely settled and when there were more bad men around i dont take much stock in what bangs said probably he and bimbel have quarreled he struck me as being a man who could get into a dispute very easily  oh i was only fooling answered fred i wouldnt be afraid to ride right up to his door that is in the daytime of course if we did it at night he might become suspicious  say do you fellows know that its five minutes to twelve questioned andy after consulting his watch i move that we keep our eyes open for some place where we can take it easy and have lunch  and i second the commotion returned his brother joking in a way their father had made familiar to them  the boys rode on for half an hour longer and then reached the top of the hill they were ascending here they could look a long distance in all directions  some view ill say declared jack as he surveyed the panorama what a picture for an artist to paint and he pointed to the majestic mountains to the westward  just look at the riverhow it glistens and sparkles in the sunshine burst out spouter see how it winds in and out like a silvery ribbon among the hills and brushwood and then comes out to cut the broad and fertile prairie in the far distance  spouter youll have to write an essay about this when you get back to the hall said fred with a grin  gee dont mention school at a time like this burst out andy i want to forget all about studying until its absolutely necessary to go back to it and dont forget its high time to eat he added  they moved along slowly and presently selected a spot for their temporary camp this was a short distance from the trail they had been following it was at the edge of a patch of timber where they were sheltered from the rays of the sun which were now quite warm  well be in the shade here and yet just see the view well have cried gif  suits me announced spouter promptly and the others agreed that the spot was a firstrate location  it did not take the six chums long to give the horses their feed and then to empty the saddlebags and prepare their midday meal they had brought along chicken as well as roastbeef sandwiches hard boiled eggs pickles and a large cake and also a bag of doughnuts which hop lung had learned to make from mrs powell and of which the celestial was justly proud they also had with them a thermos bottle of hot cocoa and another of coffee all fixed ready to drink  well hop lung certainly spread himself for us said jack as he took up one of the fat chicken sandwiches and surveyed it with satisfaction then he turned to the twins what are you grinning about he questioned quickly  oh i was only thinking about the trick we played on the chink chuckled andy  and i was thinking of the same thing put in his twin  its a wonder he didnt try to get square with us for that came from fred an american would be sure to try it  the long ride in the open air had made all of the boys hungry and it was not long before they had disposed of a large part of the sandwiches pickles and eggs washing the meal down with cocoa and coffee and also with water from a regular water bottle spouter carried  now i guess its about time we passed around some of the cake remarked jack presently  i think ill start on a doughnut answered gif  the cake was in a square tin and had been cut ready for use in a few seconds all of the boys were munching away lustily  and then something happened it was fred who was the first to notice that the piece of cake he was devouring had a peculiar puckery taste he rolled some of the cake around in his mouth and then suddenly ejected it and just as he did this andy dropped the doughnut he was devouring  oh my whats the matter with that cake  say this doughnut tastes like fire  gee my mouth is burning up  give me some of that water quick my tongue is getting blistered  what do you suppose is in this cake anyhow and in the doughnuts demanded jack as he too made a wry face and stopped eating  gracious me do you suppose hop lung put the wrong stuff in the cake and in the doughnuts demanded spouter anxiously  oh this is awful groaned gif im burning up inside and he put both hands on his stomach  maybe were poisoned suggested randy he made a wild dive for the water bottle and this was passed around from hand to hand each lad drinking eagerly in an endeavor to wash the burning taste from his mouth and throat  i know whats the matter said jack after the most of the excitement was over hop lung doctored the cake and the doughnuts to get square with us for the trick we played on him  i wonder if thats so questioned andy soberly  sure its so broke in gif that chink wasnt as slow as you thought andy  gosh my mouth burns yet grumbled randy taking a drink of cocoa thats the worst dose i ever chewed what do you suppose he put in the cake  tasted to me like a combination of cayenne pepper mustard and a few things like that answered jack  then the whole cake and all the doughnuts must be no good  thats too bad and i had my heart set on a nice doughnut answered spouter just the same i cant blame hop lung  well anyway lets be thankful the sandwiches are all right and so are the eggs remarked fred  maybe some of the sandwiches that are left are doctored put in andy suspiciously  no they look all right announced gif after an inspection and he couldnt do much with the eggs while they were in their shells he added  while he was speaking and while some of the boys were still taking drinks of various kinds to clear their mouths and throats of that awful burning taste spouter made an inspection of the paper bag containing the doughnuts  hello heres another little bag at the bottom of the big one he cried lets see what it contains  he dumped out the doughnuts and drew forth the smaller bag opening this the lads found it contained six pieces of golden yellow pound cake neatly wrapped in tissue paper  gee is that more of the doctored stuff questioned fred  maybe but i dont think so answered spouter i think hop lung put this in for a peace offering to be found after we had chewed on that other stuff  and in that surmise spouter proved correct the pound cake was delicious and having sampled it with caution to find that it was all right the boys ate it to the last crumb with great satisfaction  wed better dump all that other stuff away said fred no use of carrying it if it isnt fit to eat  maybe some of it is good returned andy  do you want to sample it and make sure questioned jack with a grin  not on your life i wouldnt want that burning taste in my mouth again for a hundred dollars  the boys threw the highlyseasoned cake and the doughnuts away repacked what was left of the other food and then continued on their ride the trail led through the patch of timber and then over some rather rough rocks and through some brushwood among the rocks they found a spring where the water was clear and cold and here they had a most refreshing drink and watered their horses  its queer this spring is away up here on the top of the hill remarked spouter that water must flow underground from the mountains yonder  what a lot of underground streams there must be returned fred  while moving along those in the lead had kept their eyes open for more snakes but no reptiles appeared for which they were thankful  but im sorry we didnt see some sort of wild animals said randy in speaking of this i thought sure wed see a bear or a deer or something like that  even birds seemed to be scarce in that vicinity and the only sound that broke the stillness as they advanced was their own voices and the clatter of the horses hoofs on the rocks  the trail was a welldefined one and they could see that it had been used only a short while before  half a dozen horsemen have been this way within the last few hours declared gif most likely they were on their way to bimbels ranch  i wonder if that man haddon has gotten here yet said jack  more than likely answered fred if youll remember those men didnt expect to stay in arrow junction very long  id like to know more about that chap and know exactly how hes mixed up with brassy bangs went on the oldest of the rover boys  i guess wed all like to know that put in randy  presently they came to a turn of the trail here they could see across a wide stretch of prairie to where there was a collection of low buildings seven or eight in number to the rear of the buildings was a corral for horses  it doesnt look much different from lots of other ranches said fred  do you want to go any closer to it questioned gif  the boys talked the matter over and while andy and randy were rather curious to get a more intimate view of the place the others decided that they would not ride any closer on this trip  its now nearly two oclock said spouter and if we want to go any distance up the river it will take us until sundown to get back home  they turned back and an hour or so later reached the point where they had parted from jarley bangs then they took a trail up the river and followed this until the sun sinking over the western mountains warned them that it was time for them to head for home  say ive got an idea announced andy when they came in sight of the ranch house dont let on to anybody about that doctored cake if hop lung or anybody else mentions it just act as if nothing unusual had happened say the lunch was as good as any we ever had  thats the idea returned his twin well keep that chink guessing and it may be added here that the boys kept their word and hop lung never knew how his little joke had terminated although he felt sure in his own mind that they had received the full benefit of the trick he had played  the six boys were still some distance from the house when they saw a man come out on the veranda and wave his hand to them at first they thought it might be sam rover but then of a sudden jack let out a yell  boys what do you know about this do you recognize that man  its hans mueller ejaculated fred  uncle hans  who would have thought he was coming to the ranch  hans mueller murmured andy ill be glad to see him hes as full of fun as a stray dog is of fleas  hans mueller was a man who in his boyhood days had been a boon companion of the rover boys fathers when he had gone to putnam hall with the rovers he had spoken very broken english and his improvement in speech had been slow and painful but hans had prospered in a business way and was now the sole proprietor of a chain of delicatessen stores in chicago he was unmarried and having no family of his own had insisted upon it that all of his young friends call him uncle  hello der eferypody called out hans mueller cordially as he came down from the veranda to greet them his fat face beaming genially  how are you uncle hans cried jack leaping to the ground and shaking hands this is certainly a surprise  yes songpird tol me you wouldnt know i vas coming was the answer how you been alreatty  fine as silk answered andy gayly and now all the boys clustered around to shake hands  youre just the man we want here to help us enjoy our vacation put in fred  dots nice fred i tink i vas going to haf a fine time alreatty and i need him went on hans mueller since i come from de war back from europe where i fights for uncle sam i work like a steam horse in mine delicatessen stores but so soon like songpird says come out here and meet dem rovers and you udder friends i say to my clerks you got to run dem stores by yourselfes alreatty yet awhile i go oud to pig horn ranch and git some fresh air mine lungs in  youll get the fresh air all right enough announced spouter and were mighty glad youre here he added and then led the way into the house     chapter xxv  professor dukes secret   the girls had already returned from the woods and met uncle hans as they called him  i got someting by mine trunk in for you young ladies said hans mueller with a broad smile and later on when his trunk arrived he presented each of them with a bottle of the highest grade of olives he also had some olives for mrs powell for use on the table  i import dem olives myself alreatty yet he vouchsafed nopody by chicago has olives half so goot  i knew youd be surprised to see uncle hans here declared songbird powell and i knew an outing on the ranch would do him a world of good he has been confining himself too closely to business since he got back from the war  it was grand of you uncle hans to fight for uncle sam declared martha  and vhy i like to know demanded hans mueller since i come by der united states over i been just such a goot american like anypody  thats the way to talk uncle hans cried jack and slapped him on the shoulder  the next day the young folks took great pleasure in showing hans mueller around the place  he vas chust like a farm only different remarked the delicatessen man dot iss a nice lot of cows you got songpird i dink dos cows vould make apout a million pounds of frankfurters not and at this remark there was a general laugh  a few days later jack noticed that songbird powell seemed to be worried over something the owner of big horn ranch held an earnest consultation with joe jackson and then the foreman of the ranch rode off in hot haste accompanied by two of his cowboys  whats the matteris something wrong questioned jack of spouter  four of our best horses are missing answered spouter the men are not sure whether they strayed away or have been stolen jackson and the fellows with him are going to ride along the river and see if they can find out  didnt you say something about other horses being stolen before we got here  yes but they didnt belong to my father they belonged to the men who formerly owned this ranch they left them here but at their own risk  were the animals now missing the horses we rode questioned fred  no they were the mounts used by jackson and his men that is three of the horses were the other was that beautiful black my father occasionally rode  you mean blackbird exclaimed randy  yes  why i think blackbird is the finest horse on the ranch declared gif  he certainly is a splendid nag answered spouter and my dad thinks a great deal of him  the horse in question was a threeyearold shining black in color with a peculiar diamondshaped spot of white on his forehead and a similar spot on his chest because of these spots some of the cowboys often referred to him as twospot  i suppose those horses are worth some money remarked fred  indeed they are declared spouter i heard my father say he wouldnt take four hundred dollars for blackbird and the other animals must be worth at least a hundred and fifty dollars apiece you know they always had pretty good horses on this ranch  i certainly hope they get some trace of the horses said jack  but this hope was not fulfilled jackson and those with him came back disappointed saying that they had found no trace of the animals  about a week later came another surprise the young folks including the girls had gone off to the woods for the best part of the day and when they returned much to their astonishment they saw seated in rocking chairs on the veranda ruth and may  my goodness screamed mary ruth and may glory hallelujah how in the world did you get here  and you never let us know wailed martha as she bounced up the steps to embrace her school chums  we got started sooner than we expected answered may  did you come alone questioned jack as he too came forward his pleasure showing on his face  no we didnt come alone answered ruth we came with mr and mrs rover they are inside with the others  my mother and dad burst out andy where are they and he raced into the house followed by his twin  there followed a joyous reunion all around everybody was happy to see everybody else and for a while it seemed as if all were trying to talk at once  we had a splendid trip over declared mrs nellie rover not a single hitch all along the way tom had everything mapped out to the last detail and she gave her husband an affectionate glance  thats what army discipline did for me answered tom rover i didnt used to be so particular but now ive got in the habit of walking a regular chalk mark  yes ive walked me a chalk mark too put in hans mueller i run mine delicatessen stores chust like they vas by army regulations alreatty and it pays belief me  its a regular touch of old times to see you around hans said tom grabbing his former school chum by both arms how is that new pickling machine getting along  vot pickling machine you mean tom questioned hans looking at him blankly  why that machine youre going to invent whereby you can grind up old oilcloth and automobile tires and make dill pickles of them  i dont vas got no machine like dot tom answered the delicatessen man in bewilderment i buy mine dill pickles by der barrel dem dill pickles grows you cant make em by no machine  oh then maybe it was a new sourkraut stamper went on tom innocently  oh tom you vas joking chust like you alvays vas exclaimed hans a light breaking in on him vell i dont care you vas a pretty goot fellow anyhow and hans smiled as broadly as ever  it sure is a touch of old times declared songbird powell and then unable to restrain himself he burst out      from among the mountain tops     where the brooklet flows     there i love to linger long      counting up my toes  broke in tom with a twinkle in his merry eyes  counting up my toes snorted songbird nothing of the kind you always did knock my poetry endways tom that last line was to read like this      where the sunset glows  the young folks had a grand time that evening singing and dancing and did not retire until the older heads had hinted several times that they had better do so  oh jack its a splendid place to come to said ruth when she was on the point of retiring i know im going to have the best times ever  and to think my uncle john owns the place put in may isnt it simply glorious  after that the days seemed to speed along swiftly the boys and girls made up various parties up and down the river and on the hills and in the woods once they got up a grand family picnic and everybody attended  during those days the boys often wondered whether brassy bangs would show himself but brassy kept out of sight and for the time being they heard nothing further concerning him but they did hear through joe jackson of bud haddon that man had been met on the trail to bimbels ranch in company with several other persons  they were a bumlooking bunch declared jackson i wouldnt give one of em house room on this ranch  haddon certainly didnt make a very good impression on me declared jack im frank to admit i think hes a thoroughly bad egg  from time to time the boys had been sending letters to some of their other school chums and a number of letters had come in return one day gif received a long communication from fatty hendry which he read in wonder  heres something that will interest all of you he declared after he had finished i guess it clears up the mystery surrounding professor duke  what is it questioned fred eagerly  its a letter from fatty hendry hes been staying at a place named ellenvale which as you know is about thirty miles north of haven point he says that snopper duke came from that place and has an aged father living there  has duke been taking care of his father questioned jack  yes and his father has been very sick and has had to have several operations it seems the operations cost a lot of money and duke wanted two of his younger brothers to help pay for them but they wouldnt contribute a cent  gee that was certainly rough declared randy no wonder the professor was grouchy at times  that isnt all of it went on gif fatty got interested and made a little investigation and he found out that there was another brother a little older than the professor who had gotten into difficulties with the firm he was working for that firm was on the point of having him arrested so fatty heard but at the last minute professor duke came forward and settled up for him so he wasnt prosecuted  but fatty adds in his letter that he heard this not only took every cent the professor had but it also placed him in debt to colonel colby and some of his friends  well thats what i call hard lines declared jack emphatically the poor professor must have been worried half to death  does fatty say anything further about dukes father  yes since the last operation the old gentleman is feeling quite like himself again  and what became of the brother who got into trouble asked spouter  he disappeared and fatty says there is a report that he went to england where the family originally came from i suppose professor duke was glad to have him go  after this gif handed around the letter so that all might read it after its perusal andy was the first to speak  its too bad he said with a deep sigh im mighty sorry now that i didnt treat the professor with more consideration that poor man certainly had as much of a load as anybody to carry  well have to make it up to him when we get back to colby hall declared randy im going to show him just what i think of him he went on he certainly was a fine fellow to help his old father and to get his brother out of that hole  the boys were still discussing this matter when they suddenly saw joe jackson dash up to the ranch house on his horse and dismount in great haste  hello something is wrong declared jack  songbird powell and tom and sam rover had seen the approach of the foreman and men and boys ran out to listen to what he might have to say  four more horses are gone declared joe jackson the best horses on the ranch and boss im certain this time that they didnt stray away they were stolen     chapter xxvi  the cattle stampede   four more horses gone cried songbird powell in consternation when did this happen jackson  less than half an hour ago over on the threetree range returned the foreman  and what makes you certain that they were stolen this time  because the horses had been left all properly tethered billy brown and his crowd had em and i know billy is a very careful man hes positive they couldnt have broken away  this is certainly getting to be a serious matter declared sam rover songbird if these last four horses were stolen its more than probable that the first four went the same way  any clue to the thief or thieves asked tom rover  the boys looked around and picked up a quirt that they say dont belong to our outfit but its a very ordinary quirt and might belong to almost anybody of course they found a good many hoof marks but they were so mixed up with the marks from the other horses they couldnt tell one from the other  ill ride over to the place with you and investigate returned songbird powell after a moments thought perhaps we can get on the trail of the thieves  can we go along questioned spouter quickly  no son we want to use the horses and anyway i think it would be better for you lads to remain behind  songbird and the foreman hurried down to the horse corral accompanied by tom and sam and thus the boys and girls as well as the ladies of the household were left by themselves  gee id like to go on a chase after those horse thieves burst out andy  you might get a pretty warm reception if you did that remarked fred horse thieves and cattle rustlers are usually a bad bunch  it isnt likely theyll get on the trail of the horses very quickly put in jack those fellows have too much of a start the most they can do is to advertise the loss as widely as possible and trust to it that some one will recognize the horses especially blackbird  the boys had spoken about going fishing and ruth and may had asked if they could go along as a consequence the young folks spent the remainder of the afternoon along the river they managed to catch a good mess of fish of which they were justly proud  and just to think i caught two of the fish myself exclaimed ruth i never knew i was going to be a fisherman  you mustnt say fisherman you must say fisherlady put in andy mischievously  the men did not return until ten oclock that night all were tired and hungry and glad to sit down to the meal which mrs powell and the cook provided  it was a wildgoose chase answered tom rover in reply to a question from andy we followed half a dozen clues but they didnt get us anywhere  what are you going to do next dad questioned spouter  we sent word to arrow junction and several other places and theyll post notices giving a description of the stolen animals answered songbird and ive offered a hundred dollars reward for any information leading to the recovery of the horses  the next day one of the cowboys came in with more information this was to the effect that a ranch in that neighborhood owned by a man named cheltham had suffered the loss of three horses one a mare of considerable value  say this certainly is getting interesting said jack when the lads heard the older heads talking it over first thing we know all the horses on the place will be gone  years ago they used to suffer from the cattle rustlers in this neighborhood said spouter but horse stealing is something new  i wonder if that fellow bud haddon had anything to do with it questioned fred  i was thinking of that broke in randy i think they ought to make an investigation  the boys spoke to the men about this and there was a long discussion which ended when songbird said he would ride over to the bimbel ranch with his foreman and interview the men  the visit to the bimbel ranch occurred the next day and the boys waited impatiently for the return of the two men to learn what bimbel and bud haddon might have to say  another wildgoose chase announced songbird powell on the return that evening we saw bimbel and he seemed as much surprised as anybody to learn of the horses being taken  and what about bud haddon asked jack  we didnt see haddon but bimbel said he had been at the ranch house early in the morning and he was certain haddon knew nothing about the loss he said haddon and the other men were out on a range to the westward looking after the cattle of course if haddon was away out there he couldnt have been here taking our horses  and you didnt see any trace of the animals asked spouter  nothing at all they said they hadnt heard of the theft nor of the loss of the horses over at chelthams ranch  after that a week passed swiftly during which time the young folks enjoyed themselves thoroughly not only in tramping and riding around and in fishing but also in other sports around the ranch home with so much level ground available a tennis court had been laid out and also a croquet ground and the boys and girls enjoyed these games immensely the lads also pitched quoits a sport which at times had been popular at colby hall  one day the boys accompanied joe jackson on a roundup of some cattle far down the river this was a day full of excitement for some of the cattle broke away and andy and fred happened to be separated from the rest of the crowd and got directly in line with the runaway steers  hi there hi there ride out of the way yelled joe jackson at the top of his lungs  andy and fred were looking in the opposite direction and did not notice the cattle until the beasts were within a hundred yards of them then they heard the foremans cry and also the beating of the hoofs on the prairie  my gracious gasped fred look whats coming  weve got to get out of the way and be quick about it returned andy and struck his horse on the flank  the steeds the boys were riding needed no urging for the sudden rush of the cattle filled them with alarm away they bounded across the grassy plain with the maddened cattle thundering after them  lets ride to one side and let em pass gasped fred who was badly shaken by this sudden turn of affairs he had not dreamed that the herd of cattle would head for them in this fashion  but to get out of the way was not easy to one side of the plains was a series of rough rocks while to the other side there was a brook flowing into the river and here the ground was soft and treacherous  dont go that way cried andy as he saw his cousin heading toward the brook youll get stuck and youll never get out  id rather get stuck than be trampled under foot by those beasts panted fred  no no fred turn this way im sure we can get up on the rocks somehow declared andy  the boys continued to advance with the thoroughly frightened cattle not far behind them while being rounded up both cattle and cowboys had come upon a nest of small rattlesnakes these had of course frightened the beasts and they were still more frightened when the cowboys had begun to shoot at the reptiles then a few of the cattle had started the stampede and the rest terrorized by the pistol shots had followed  as the two lads galloped on they looked anxiously to the side where the rocks were located most of the places they passed were too steep to ascend but presently andy caught sight of a point where there was something of a trail leading upward  come on this way he yelled to his cousin i think we can get up on the rocks here  in the meanwhile joe jackson and his men followed by jack and the others were doing their best to get the cattle to turn back to the point from which they had started the best herd riders were circling the edge of the rushing animals shouting at the top of their lungs and firing their pistols but so far this demonstration had had little effect  oh jack do you think theyll be run down gasped randy  i hope not  theyre on a pair of good horses they ought to be able to outrun the cattle came from gif  dont be so sure of that cried spouter a mad steer can go some believe me  who ever thought they would start off like that went on randy  it was firing at those rattlesnakes did it declared jack of course i cant blame the cowboys for doing that  andy and fred found the rocks anything but easy to ascend they went up a few feet and then the horses began to slip and were in danger of rolling over carrying their young riders with them  look out screamed fred he had to catch his horse around the neck to keep from being flung headlong  but the horses were as anxious to escape the maddened cattle as were the lads and the steeds continued to scramble upward until they reached a ledge of rock where the footing was comparatively level  do you think well be all right here panted fred when he could catch his breath sufficiently to speak  we shall be unless some of those steers take it into their heads to climb the rocks the same way we did answered andy he was suffering from a slight bruise on his left leg where he had brushed some of the roughest of the rocks  the horses were still alarmed and continued to snort and stamp their feet and the two lads for a few seconds had their hands full quieting the animals they looked below them and saw the cattle coming on in a great mass some had already passed but others were huddled close to the rocks as if on the point of making an ascent  i really think theyll try to come up said fred  come ahead well see if we cant get a little higher up answered andy i dont think the steers will follow us very far even if they do come we can shoot at them if we have to he added for each of them carried a pistol  beyond the ledge were more rough rocks and here the two lads had to proceed with caution for fear one of their horses might slip and perhaps break a leg as they advanced they looked back and saw that the cowboys were coming closer and were beginning to drive a part of the cattle to the rear  oh if only they can drive them back sighed fred just look at em andy there must be a hundred of the steers directly below us and see how angry that big black fellow looks he acts just as if hed like to come up here and gore us  listen ejaculated andy pulling back on the rein whats that funny noise  both listened and mingled with the murmurs of the cattle at the foot of the rocks came to their ears a peculiar whine or growl that was entirely new to the lads  its a wild animal of some kind cried fred as the growl was repeated  where did it come from  i dont know but it was close at hand  thoroughly scared both boys looked on all sides then of a sudden fred let out another exclamation  there it is right on the shelf of rocks yonder oh andy its a mountain lion     chapter xxvii  the mountain lion   it was a time of extreme peril and both of the rover boys realized it the shelf of rock was not over twenty feet ahead of them and on this rested the mountain lion crouched as if for a spring  fred had scarcely spoken when both horses began to snort and stamp their feet as if wanting to turn and run away  look out screamed andy or the horses will take us right back among those mad cattle  with the discovery of the mountain lion that lay close to the rocky shelf with glaring eyes and tail that swept nervously from side to side the boys had noted that the animal was as much penned in as they were themselves beyond the shelf was an overhanging cliff so that further progress in that direction was cut off completely had this not been so it is more than likely that the mountain lion would have turned and slunk away for like all wild beasts they do not fight unless they think it is necessary to do so  come ongive him a shot exclaimed fred as soon as he could recover from his astonishment  his weapon was handy and in a moment the pistol rang out sharply and this shot was followed by one from his cousin  had the two boys been on the ground their shots might have been more effective but it was another task to aim from the back of a restive horse that was threatening every instant to bolt and so both bullets merely grazed the mountain lions side  but these shots mingled with those coming from the plain below had one good effect the cattle had been stopped in their mad flight and now they turned back in the direction in which the cowboys wanted them to go  as the pistols rang out the mountain lion gave a scream of commingled pain and rage then it crept forward several feet and made a movement as if on the point of leaping for fred and his steed  back up back up fred yelled andy and fired a second time and his cousin did likewise  this time the aim of the boys was better and the mountain lion was hit in one of the forelegs and in the flank it made a sudden leap but the wound in the leg made it fall short and it fell down between the rocks directly in front of where freds horse was standing  as the mountain lion went down in the hollow the horse uttered another wild snort and an instant later leaped directly over the wild beast coming down at the foot of the rocky ledge beyond the steed andy rode backed violently until some other rocks stopped its retreat  hi there what are you shooting at came a cry from below and the two boys recognized the voice of joe jackson  its a lion called back andy  then plug him plug him quick yelled jackson plug him before he gets a chance to get at you  there was no need for this advice for andy was already taking aim this time the bullet passed through the body of the lion and the beast leaped up turning over and over convulsively then fred managed to steady his mount for a moment and he too fired this time catching the mountain lion in the ear then the beast gave a final leap and tumbled down the rocks almost at the feet of the astonished ranch foreman  are you hurt demanded jackson anxiously as he gave a glance at the lion to make certain that it was breathing its last  no came from both of the boys but it must be confessed that their voices were trembling they had all they could do to quiet their horses the steeds showing a great inclination to leap over the rough rocks and run away  by the time that fred and andy managed to descend to the plain below them the stampede of the cattle which had been only momentary was coming to an end only two steers having run away for parts unknown  but theyll come back boss said one of the cowboys to jackson they always do you cant hire em to herd by themselves theyll sure be back  a mountain lion what do you know about that exclaimed jack as he came riding up followed by the other boys  did he hurt you at all questioned spouter quickly  he didnt get a chance answered fred just a bit proudly andy and i let drive at him almost as soon as we saw him  a pretty powerful beast ill say remarked gif as he made an examination of the lion that was now dead i dont think id like to face such a creature  we had to fight him declared andy he was right up on that rocky shelf yonder and he couldnt back out if he had had the chance hed have leaped right on us  well youre the prize hunters of this crowd declared randy  you cant put that down to hunting answered his twin promptly that was simply a case of necessity  anyway youve got the lion and that skin will make some rug declared spouter  i wonder if there are any other mountain lions around remarked gif id like to get a shot at one of them myself  they often travel in pairs answered joe jackson but if youre going after lions you had better arm yourselves with rifles it was only good luck that brought this beast down with pistol bullets  the pistols were good enough at close quarters answered andy just the same id rather shoot the next mountain lion from a distance he added dryly  of course when the boys rode up to the ranch home with the carcass of the dead lion there was a good deal of excitement among the older folks and the girls and fred and andy had to tell their story in detail  you really must be more careful in the future boys declared mrs sam rover why you might have been trampled under foot by the cattle as well as chewed up by this mountain lion  i didnt know there was any danger of the cattle stampeding put in mrs tom rover  oh jackson assures me that the stampede wasnt of much consequence remarked songbird powell but of course the boys shouldnt have gotten in front of the animals but this question of facing a mountain lion is another story  py chimminy you dont vas cotch me facin no mountain lions declared hans mueller emphatically i did me dot years ago ven i go oud mit your faders but i tont do him no more alreatty  oh fred you must be more careful protested may to the youngest rover when she got the chance suppose that lion had jumped right on top of you  believe me may i didnt want to get so close he answered when we discovered the beast he wasnt over twenty feet away  and they told us there werent very many wild beasts around here came from martha after this i guess we had better be careful how we roam through the woods and along the river  oh theyre not likely to harm you unless you corner them said songbird powell theyll sneak away from you if you give them half a chance its only when theyre cornered or when theyre needing food that they are really combative  the mountain lion was skinned and the pelt taken away by the ranch foreman to be cured and then fred and andy took it easy for the rest of the day  isnt it queer that brassy bangs has never showed himself around this place remarked spouter that evening wouldnt you think hed at least ride over to see what sort of an outfit we had here  more than likely hes afraid of his welcome said jack he knows that none of us care for him  id like to know if he really started that auto put in fred  gosh what a sour fellow that jarley bangs was exclaimed andy  there had been an indication of a storm but this had passed away and one day found the rover boys and their chums off on a trip along a trail which led across the river and to the mountains westward a trail which they were informed by jackson led between the ranches owned by jarley bangs and bimbel  id like to get a better view of bimbels ranch and also of bangs place declared jack and maybe well see something of bud haddon and his crowd  all of the boys were now on good terms with hop lung and he had prepared for them a substantial lunch and also something extra in case they should remain out after the supper hour  now you lads take good care of yourselves admonished tom rover when they were ready to depart on their days outing no more rattlesnakes or mountain lions  or mixups with runaway cattle put in sam rover  spouter and jack carried small rifles and the others were armed with pistols they however were not going out to hunt but thought best to provide themselves with the firearms in case any game presented itself  it did not take the boys long to cross the river and then they followed a trail which led up a long hill and through a somewhat dense forest  they had journeyed along the best part of two hours when they noticed the sun going under a cloud this caused the trail under the trees to become dark  gee i wonder if were going to have a storm remarked randy  oh maybe its nothing but a wind cloud answered spouter  they continued to move along the trail and presently reached a small opening where there was a spring  halt called out jack who was riding ahead with spouter  whats the matter questioned gif quickly  look there isnt that a wolf asked jack he pointed with his rifle which he had already unslung and all the boys looked in the direction pointed out  maybe its a dog put in fred quickly  you dont want to shoot somebodys pet admonished gif  the animal had slunk away behind some brushwood and now they saw it trying to retreat pulling something through the dead leaves as it did so  its a wolf im sure of it declared jack and raising his rifle he took quick aim and fired  as the echo of the firearm died away the lads heard a snarl and a yelp and an instant later a gaunt wolf showed himself his fangs gleaming dangerously as he came closer  several shots rang out for all of the boys had their weapons ready the wolf was hit in three places and gave a single leap into the air and then dropped lifeless  hurrah weve got him yelled randy with satisfaction  be careful dont go too close before were sure warned jack better reload first  but the wolf was past doing further harm and having assured themselves of this the boys looked at what he had been carrying away  its the side of a calf exclaimed spouter isnt this the limit im glad we brought him down  he must have been raiding some cow yard said jack  no ranch cow yard said gif this half of a calf was skinned by some person ill bet he stole it out of some ranch larder and later on it was learned that the calf meat had been stolen from jarley bangs place the night before  the boys had become so interested in bringing down the wolf that they had paid no attention to what was taking place overhead but now they noticed that the sky was more overcast than ever the wind began to blow through the woods and of a sudden there came a downpour as surprising as it was dismaying     chapter xxviii  in the cave   were in for it now cried jack as he looked up at the sky and at the trees beginning to bend in the wind  and its going to be some storm or i miss my guess added gif  i wonder if we can find any shelter around here put in randy if we cant well be soaked to the skin in no time  jackson was telling me of a couple of caves toward the end of these woods said spouter quickly i wonder if we could reach the nearest of them it might help us to get out of the rain  come onlets try it put in fred eagerly  leaving the dead wolf where it had fallen the boys pushed forward on the trail which now led downward on the other side of the hill here they noticed the going was getting rougher and presently they found themselves entering a defile among the rocks here the trees were more scattering and consequently they were exposed to the full fury of the elements ever and anon a flash of lightning would illumine the sky followed by the crack and rumble of thunder  say maybe we had better stay under the trees suggested andy  suppose the trees should be struck by lightning questioned jack i think we had better go on especially if were anywhere near those caves jackson mentioned  a turn in the defile brought them to something of an open place here on one side the rocks towered fully fifty feet above their heads and at one point there was an opening perhaps fifteen feet square and leading into the side of the hill  this must be the first of the caves cried spouter come on in and without ceremony he led the way and the others followed glad to get out of the storm  they found the cave an irregular one running in somewhat of a semicircle and with a flooring that was comparatively level it was dry and fairly comfortable and once beyond the fury of the storm the lads dismounted and proceeded to make themselves at home  the rain continued to come down and with nothing better to do the boys proceeded to make themselves as comfortable as possible near the entrance to the cave they found some leaves and dead tree branches which were still dry and these they dragged inside and then made themselves a campfire  i reckon well have to cut out going any further announced spouter even if the storm clears away the trail will be very wet and slippery  it still lacked an hour to noon and with nothing else to do the boys tethered their horses and then proceeded to investigate their surroundings from the campfire they obtained several torches and with these in hand they moved along slowly around the bend of the cave and over a series of rocks which led upward  it certainly is a larger cave than i supposed said jack as he and gif led the way with the others close behind  i think i see a light ahead jack was gifs remark that must be another opening to the cave  maybe the two caves that jackson mentioned are really one and this passageway connects them  well soon find out  by this time all but one of the torches had burnt themselves out but this the lads did not mind for the light ahead was steadily increasing showing that they could not be far from another opening  look called jack suddenly and then he added keep quiet all of you  he pointed ahead and there around a bend of the rocks all saw two figures moving around on horseback one was the figure of a tall man and the other that of a wellgrown youth  why thats brassy bangs whispered fred excitedly  yes and the man is bud haddon returned andy  what do you bet haddon isnt after brassy for more money put in fred excitedly  while the youngest rover was speaking he and the others saw that the two figures on horseback had disappeared behind a mass of rocks  im going ahead and find out about this declared jack come on so far as we can see there are only two of them so the six of us have nothing to fear  especially as were armed added fred who carried his pistol with him  throwing down the last of their torches the six boys advanced with caution they heard the horses beyond the rocks occasionally stamping a hoof and caught a faint murmur of voices then led by jack they mounted the rocks noiselessly presently gaining a point where they could look directly down upon brassy bangs and his companion  its all wrong bud haddon and you know it they heard brassy declare and sooner or later the authorities will get after you for this  see here lester bangs you dont have to preach to me growled bud haddon youre just as deep in some things as i am in others  it isnt true and you know it whined brassy and now the lads who were listening could see that their fellowcadet was very much upset im not guilty and i never have been guilty of any wrongdoing  you tell that to the police and see what they have to say about it sneered haddon you know well enough that you set fire to john calders barn and burnt up horses that was worth thousands of dollars  and i always said it was some cowboys or tramps that did it stormed brassy  not much you did it i know it and so do jillson and dusenbury weve got the goods on you  what were jillson and dusenbury and you doing around the place questioned brassy suddenly  never mind what we were doing around there we know you set the barn on fire didnt you have a quarrel with old calder  yes i did but i didnt make any fire maybe you had a quarrel with him yourself  hold on there bangs none of that cried bud haddon sternly  well you wouldnt be too good to set the fire added brassy with sudden recklessness not after the way you are acting out here running away with those horses and after the way you acted at colby hall trying to rob every room in the place  wait a minute now wait a minute returned the man sarcastically who was it lent me his uniform and who was it that told me just what rooms to go into answer me those questions will you  you wouldnt have gotten hold of the uniform and you wouldnt have gotten any information if you hadnt threatened me in all sorts of ways answered brassy somewhat lamely i wish now that id never had anything to do with you  well you keep your tongue between your teeth or else youll get yourself in the hottest kind of water burst out bud haddon dont you know that they can send you to prison for ten years for what you did  i havent said anything to anybody as yet answered brassy hastily  well you see that you dont  but i didnt set calders barn on firereally i didnt pleaded the boy i dont see why you wont believe me  im willing to let that matter drop if only youll keep a civil tongue in your head and mind what youre doing returned bud haddon and dont forgeti want at least a hundred dollars more just as soon as you can lay your hands on it  i dont see how im going to get it im expecting some money from my uncle but that has got to pay for my tuition at colby hall this fall  well you let the school wait for its money and you turn it over to me they wont want you there anyhow if they should find out what sort of a fellow you are went on bud haddon coarsely now ive got to be getting back to bimbels rain or no rain he continued just remember youve got to fork over a hundred in cold cash before you start east again if you dontwell look out thats all and with this threat the tall man rode out of the cave  the rovers and their chums had listened to every word that had been spoken they were both mystified and amazed by what had been said  that fellow haddon is surely a firstclass rascal whispered spouter to jack  do you know what i think we had better do returned the young major lets stop brassy and have a straight talk with him i dont think hes quite as bad as we thought he might be  yes let us stop brassy by all means came in a low tone from fred  brassy bangs had ridden to the mouth of the cave and there sat astride of his horse watching bud haddon as he galloped away though the rain then he turned back in anything but a cheerful humor the other boys saw him dismount and sink down on a rock covering his face with his hands  come on said jack and without more ado he scrambled down from the rocks and came around to where brassy was sitting and the others did the same  brassys misery was so great that for several seconds he did not notice their approach then he looked up startled and leaped to his feet  where did you come from he demanded as soon as he could speak  we came from the other end of the cave brassy answered jack  how long have you been here  weve been here long enough to hear the talk you had with that fellow named haddon answered fred  you did brassy turned pale it wasnt very nice to listen when you had no business to  never mind about that now brassy what we want to know is did you or that fellow rob colby hall  he did it i didnt have a thing to do with itat least willingly cried brassy bangs he forced me to do everything i did he threatened me in all sorts of wayssaid he would put me in prison and all that if i didnt help him oh hes the worst man there ever was groaned the overwrought boy and now the others could see that he was on the verge of collapse  see here brassy why dont you tell us the whole story put in gif kindly  why should i tell my story to you all you fellows are against meyou always were  were not against you brassy answered jack if you can prove to us that youre really being hounded by that man well do what we can to help you isnt that so fellows and at this question the others nodded  hounded is right hes done nothing but hound me ever since he knew me whined the accused one  you tell me one thing demanded spouter striding up and catching brassy by the shoulder did that rascal steal the horses from our ranch  i think he didin fact im about certain he did that is either he or the fellows hes in league with  who are those other fellows  two fellows who just came out here from chicago named jillson and dusenbury and two others from bimbels ranch named noxley and jenks the whole bunch were mixed up with bimbel some years ago in a shady transaction and they lit out for quite a while but now theyre back again  i dont see why you want to get mixed up with a crowd like that was andys comment  i didnt want to get mixed up with em declared brassy i havent had a thing to do with any of em except bud haddon oh i wish id never met that man and now brassy seemed almost on the verge of tears     chapter xxix  a confession   after that it was an easy matter for the other boys to get brassy to make a complete confession  my first trouble came when i got a job with john calder who has a farm on the outskirts of omaha said brassy i had had a quarrel at home and also a quarrel with my uncle here and had made up my mind to get a place and support myself but i couldnt get along with calder who was a very strict man and one afternoon we had a lively quarrel and i told him id leave and i did so and went to omaha about a week after that calders barn burned down and a number of horses were caught in the fire that was just after i had fallen in with bud haddon and his two chums jillson and dusenbury haddon pretended to be quite friendly but all at once he accused me of setting the fire and said that jillson and dusenbury who had left the day before could prove it i protested my innocence but he insisted i was guilty and worked me up to such an extent that i gave him almost every dollar i had in my pocket to keep him quiet  and you say positively that you had nothing to do with the fire questioned fred  not a thing  couldnt you prove that you werent there when the fire took place asked andy  no i couldnt because i went to a vaudeville show that evening and i was among strangers so that i couldnt account for my time  did haddon hound you when you came to colby hall questioned gif  he certainly didnot once but half a dozen times and i gave him all the money i could scrape up in fact i even borrowed some money from halliday and a couple of the other fellows  but what about the robbery at the hall questioned fred  several times haddon came to me and spoke in a mysterious manner about its being an easy matter to make a big haul then he hinted about the robbery but i would have nothing to do with it on the afternoon when we were getting ready to celebrate that night he sent word that he wanted to see me at a certain barn not far from the school when i got there he demanded that i help him go through the bedrooms while the fellows were having a good time on the campus and down by the river i said i wouldnt do it and then all of a sudden he hit me on the head and knocked me down then he stripped me of my trousers and jacket and tied me fast in one of the disused horse stalls  and you mean to say he used your uniform in stealing into the school asked spouter  thats it i didnt know it at the time because he went to another part of the barn where i couldnt see him but later on when he brought the uniform back he told me all about it he thought he had been wonderfully slick  why didnt you expose him at once demanded jack  he told me that if i exposed him he would tell the authorities that i had planned the whole scheme and that i had done most of the work myself he said some one had seen him in the uniform scooting from one room to another so that the report would circulate that some cadet was guilty he got me so worked up that at last i promised to keep quiet  and had he really robbed your room too demanded fred  yes i lost my stuff just as i reported oh you cant imagine how i felt went on brassy bangs in a hopeless tone of voice many a time i thought id go to colonel colby and confess everything but then i thought they would bring that old charge of barnburning up against me as well as the charge of helping in the robbery and i didnt have nerve enough to say a word oh i know i was a big fool i should have faced it out  wait a minute put in jack suddenly are you pretty sure haddon as well as dusenbury and jillson are guilty of making off with the horses that are missing  i am  well then isnt it possible that those three went to this john calders barn and stole some of the horses and then set fire to the place to cover the theft  by golly ill bet thats just what they did burst out brassy bangs i remember now that the reports in the newspapers said the fire had been so fierce that the carcasses of the horses had been burnt up completely they only found some of the bones in the ruins oh if they really did do that  did calder have any particularly good horses  yes he had a splendid team of matched grays that were worth considerable money he thought more of the grays than he did of all his other horses put together  ill wager a toothpick against a lemon that gang stole the grays before the fire declared andy emphatically  the police ought to arrest those three men and put em through what they call the third degree remarked gif  id like to know one other thing went on andy and now his face showed a slight grin what do you know about your uncle jarleys auto running away by itself  oh please dont mention that tin junk wagon pleaded brassy i started it and the blamed thing ran over me and i was lame for a week  does your uncle know anything about what haddon and his crowd are up to questioned jack  not exactly although hes becoming suspicious of the whole gang around the bimbel place you know hes never trusted bimbel since the man got into difficulty with the authorities several years ago  after that the seven boys talked the matter over for half an hour longer and then the others insisted upon it that brassy accompany them to the other entrance to the cave and there all sat down to partake of the lunch brought from big horn ranch  brassy appeared much relieved by the confession he had made and readily answered all the questions put to him his assertive manner had left him entirely and he appeared quite humble  if he ever gets out of this ill bet hell be a different fellow whispered randy to fred  i think so myself was the reply but how he is going to square himself with colonel colby remains to be seen it was a serious piece of business to let haddon steal all those things from the school and say nothing about it  while the boys were eating the storm stopped and less than an hour later the sun was shining as before  i think we might as well be on our way back to the ranch remarked spouter the sooner we get there and let our fathers know how matters stand the better  dont you want to go with us brassy asked jack  if i did that i couldnt get back to my uncles place tonight and then hed worry about me otherwise i would just as lief go to your place as not now that ive told you everything id like to see the whole matter cleaned up and quick too  how far is it to your uncles ranch asked fred  not over a mile and a half  then suppose we go there first and then all of us can strike out for big horn ranch maybe your uncle will want to take part in what is going on said jack  i wish you would go with me cried brassy eagerly im afraid my uncle will raise cain when i tell him the truth  he wont dare do much when were around answered gif if he gets too ugly you can clear out and meet us on the way to our place  thats the talk said randy  again there was a discussion but in the end it was decided that the whole party should lose no time in getting to jarley bangs ranch they would explain matters to brassys uncle and then set out for songbird powells place  the campfire was speedily stamped out and leaping into the saddle the seven boys set out for the bangs place brassy leading the way with spouter beside him it was a wet and dismal ride through the woods and it is safe to say that brassy felt every bit as dismal as his surroundings  gee but i certainly am sorry for him whispered andy to his twin he isnt a fellow that i would cotton to but he certainly has got himself into a pickle  presently the woods were left behind and they came out on the open prairie here the sun shone brightly and the trail was drying rapidly they urged their steeds into a gallop and in a short while came in sight of the jarley bangs outfit  as they rode up they saw jarley bangs come from the ranch house and move swiftly toward one of the stables where the horses were kept he was evidently in a hurry and much excited  hello where have you been he demanded of his nephew where did you pick up these chaps  i met em during the storm over at twin caves answered brassy  its a wonder you wouldnt stay around the house once in a while grumbled jarley bangs if you would maybe i wouldnt be losing things  losing things what do you mean uncle jarley questioned the nephew quickly  what do i mean stormed the ranch owner do you know what has happened since you went away  no  well then ill tell you two of our best horses have been stolen right out of the stable too exclaimed jarley bangs wrathfully duster and old whitehead  stolen came from all of the boys simultaneously  yes stolen nobody saw em taken but theyre gone and not a man on the ranch was near em  ill wager thats more of bud haddons work declared jack quickly  but he wasnt herehe was over at the caves returned fred  well if he didnt do it then some members of his gang did put in randy  im going to have the law on somebody for this stormed jarley bangs too many horses in this neighborhood have been stolen im going to visit some of the other ranchmen and notify the sheriff and see if we cant raise a posse to run down the rascals  thats the way to talk mr bangs cried spouter and we know just what gang to go after     chapter xxx  the captureconclusion   less than an hour later found the whole party including jarley bangs on the way to big horn ranch  brassys uncle had listened with keen interest to the story his nephew and the other lads had to relate he had interrupted a number of times to ask questions and at the finish of the recital had held up both hands in disgust  youre a bigger fool than i ever thought you were lester he had told his nephew why in thunder didnt you tell your folks and me all about this just as soon as it happened we could have set a trap for those rascals and caught em easy  but uncle jarley remember how i was tied up in that colby hall affair brassy had pleaded  i dont believe colonel colby would hold you responsible for thatnot after hed made a thorough investigation but that aint here nor there what we want to do now is to grab those fellows before theyve a chance to make a getaway id just like to ketch em with duster and whitehead in their possession i think i could find enough oldtimers around here to hand all of em a rope and jarley bangs eyes had flashed with a fire that was anything but agreeable  the rover boys and their chums had thought to take the regular trail leading back to big horn ranch but jarley bangs told them he knew of a shorter way  we can cut off over a mile said he and i reckon the quicker we get a posse out the better  dont you suppose we can round them up around bimbels ranch almost any time queried spouter  maybe and maybe not wed probably be able to get the others but haddon dusenbury and jillson come and go sometimes theyre here and sometimes in omaha and chicago  perhaps thats where they disposed of their stolen horses suggested jack  moren likely  jarley bangs had armed himself with a doublebarreled shotgun and he rode in advance with spouter at his side and the others close behind  the way lay across a stretch of prairie and then into the edge of the woods bordering the river the party had just gained the waters edge and were looking for a good fording place when brassy suddenly uttered an exclamation  look up the river will you there are those men now and see they are leading a couple of horses  get back out of sight quick ordered jarley bangs and in a few seconds all were behind the bushes which at that point lined the river  why theyre heading almost straight for big horn ranch exclaimed spouter excitedly  theyre going to follow the old river trail announced jarley bangs moren likely theyll take to the lower trail when they reach the forks  cant we head em off and capture em questioned fred  i think we can anyhow we can try was jarley bangs answer  the old ranchman made a swift mental calculation and then directed the boys to follow him to a fording place a little further down the river once on the other side of the watercourse he urged his steed forward at topmost speed in the direction of another patch of timber further southward  they wouldnt dare take the upper trail he told the lads for that would take em too close to big horn theyll come this way im almost certain  it was not easy riding on a trail which was used but seldom nevertheless the lads hurried after the old ranchman as well as they could they wound in and out over some rough rocks and up a small hill and presently emerged upon a much better trail  here is where they ought to pass announced jarley bangs now then well put our horses in the thicket and then see what we can do toward pocketing em when they come  the old ranchman had seen strenuous times in his younger days and he seemed to know exactly what to do he divided the boys into two groups placing them on either side of the winding and rocky road  now if you have to shoot shoot high so as not to hit anybody on the other side was his warning but maybe we can get em without firing a shot he went on  brassy was armed with a small rifle and he insisted upon remaining in the roadway with his uncle the other lads with their pistols and guns were placed in advantageous positions behind nearby rocks and trees  the arrangement was scarcely completed when they heard the tramp of horses hoofs over the somewhat rocky trail and in a minute more bud haddon came into view followed by jillson and dusenbury all on horseback and each of the latter leading an extra steed  throw up your hands shouted jarley bangs as the horsemen came closer and he leveled his shotgun full at haddons head while brassy covered dusenbury with his rifle the boys behind the rocks and trees covered all three men as well as they were able  the three rascals had not anticipated such a meeting and seeing the guns leveled at them not only from the front but also from the sides three pairs of hands went up almost as one  its bangs murmured the man named dusenbury i reckon the jig is up  dont dare to budge or ill blow somebodys head off roared jarley bangs and he looked as if he meant what he said  youve got the drop on me and i aint moving answered bud haddon surlily  hi powell come out here will you went on brassy bangs uncle and then as spouter came from the bushes with rifle in hand he continued go up there and take every one of their guns away from em  as soon as they had been disarmed the three rascals were told to dismount and stand in a line along the side of the road then as the boys confronted them jarley bangs went through their pockets once more to make sure that no weapon had been overlooked  fine piece of business to run away with my horses exclaimed the old ranch owner and he jerked his head in the direction of the two animals the men had been leading  with their hands tied in front of them the men were made to remount and then the entire party lost no time in heading for big horn ranch  ill fix you for this hissed haddon at brassy when he got the chance  you do your worst retorted the boy im not afraid of you any more  of course there was great excitement at the ranch when the crowd came in with the three prisoners the story of what had happened was quickly circulated and joe jackson and a number of the cowboys were called in from the ranges one of the cowboys was sent off to notify a deputy sheriff of what had occurred and of what the ranch owners expected to do and two other cowboys were started off to notify the owners of other ranches in that vicinity  as a consequence early the next morning a posse consisting of twelve men headed for bimbels ranch of course the boys wanted to go along but they were forced to remain behind much to their chagrin  you might get shot said songbird powell and besides that you have had glory enough helping to catch these three rascals and he smiled faintly  the affair at bimbels was rather a strenuous one jenks and noxley as well as bimbel tried to escape and noxley was shot in the leg the fellow thought he was going to die and while waiting for the doctor to come and attend him he made a full confession concerning the stealing of many of the horses in that neighborhood he said that bud haddon was at the head of the gang and that haddon with jillson and dusenbury were in the habit of disposing of the animals either at omaha or chicago although one or two steeds including one belonging to the former owners of big horn ranch had been sent further east  i guess it was one of the early thefts that took haddon to haven point declared jack and in that surmise he was correct  with this evidence against them haddon jillson and dusenbury were submitted to a severe gruelling each being examined separately finally dusenbury broke down completely and admitted that he and the other two had fired john calders barn after stealing his noted pair of gray horses the horses had been shipped out of town and were later on recovered as were also mr powells blackbird and several other of the animals  when bud haddons effects were examined many pawn tickets were discovered and following up the clues thus afforded colonel colby managed to get back many of the articles stolen from the school these included professor dukes heirloom watch and a number of the things lost by our friends  at first it was thought that brassy might be prosecuted but when bud haddon was brought to trial for the thefts the state used the youth as a witness against the fellow and consequently brassy was allowed to go free he however received a stern lecture from colonel colby and was then told that he had better not return to the hall  i dont think i want to come back said brassy a whole lot of the fellows would never forgive me for what i did and in this surmise he was probably correct brassy returned to his uncles ranch and that was the last heard of him for a long time  with the mystery of the robbery at colby hall and of the missing horses cleared up the rover boys and all the other young folks at big horn ranch turned their attention once more to having a good time sam rover went back to new york to take charge of the offices in wall street and that gave dick rover and his wife a chance to come out and pay the ranch a visit  weve certainly had some strenuous times here remarked jack one day  and he was right but other strenuous times were still in store for the lads and what some of these were will be related in the next volume to be entitled the rover boys at big bear lake or the camps of the rival cadets  big horn ranch is a delightful place said ruth i never thought a spot where they raised cattle could be so interesting  is your father going to stay out here and become a regular ranchman spouter questioned fred  i dont know about that answered the ranch owners son hell stay here for a while anyway he likes it better and better every day  i dink some day i got me a ranch mineself alreatty remarked hans mueller den i could raise all mine own meats for mine delicatessen stores not so and he smiled complacently  come on boys lets get on horseback and have a race cried andy as he came up from finishing a game of lawn tennis with mary  im with you answered fred who had been playing a game of croquet with may and some of the others  all right a horseback race it is cried jack  an extra piece of cake to the boy who wins shouted his sister martha after him  hurrah me for that piece of cake came from every one of the boys assembled  and here while they are running down to the corral pellmell to get on their horses for a gallop across the prairie we will leave them and say goodbye   the end                                    the famous rover boys series by arthur m winfield edward stratemeyer  over three million copies sold of this
