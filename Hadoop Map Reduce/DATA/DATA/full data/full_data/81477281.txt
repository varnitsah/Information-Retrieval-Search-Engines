81477281	on the makaloa matisland tales  by jack london     contents   on the makaloa mat the bones of kahekili when alice told her soul shinbones the water baby the tears of ah kim the kanaka surf     on the makaloa mat    unlike the women of most warm races those of hawaii age well and nobly  with no pretence of makeup or cunning concealment of times inroads the woman who sat under the hau tree might have been permitted as much as fifty years by a judge competent anywhere over the world save in hawaii  yet her children and her grandchildren and roscoe scandwell who had been her husband for forty years knew that she was sixtyfour and would be sixtyfive come the next twentysecond day of june  but she did not look it despite the fact that she thrust reading glasses on her nose as she read her magazine and took them off when her gaze desired to wander in the direction of the halfdozen children playing on the lawn  it was a noble situationnoble as the ancient hau tree the size of a house where she sat as if in a house so spaciously and comfortably houselike was its shade furnished noble as the lawn that stretched away landward its plush of green at an appraisement of two hundred dollars a front foot to a bungalow equally dignified noble and costly  seaward glimpsed through a fringe of hundredfoot coconut palms was the ocean beyond the reef a dark blue that grew indigo blue to the horizon within the reef all the silken gamut of jade and emerald and tourmaline  and this was but one house of the halfdozen houses belonging to martha scandwell  her townhouse a few miles away in honolulu on nuuanu drive between the first and second showers was a palace hosts of guests had known the comfort and joy of her mountain house on tantalus and of her volcano house her mauka house and her makai house on the big island of hawaii  yet this waikiki house stressed no less than the rest in beauty in dignity and in expensiveness of upkeep  two japanese yardboys were trimming hibiscus a third was engaged expertly with the long hedge of nightblooming cereus that was shortly expectant of unfolding in its mysterious nightbloom  in immaculate ducks a house japanese brought out the teathings followed by a japanese maid pretty as a butterfly in the distinctive garb of her race and fluttery as a butterfly to attend on her mistress  another japanese maid an array of turkish towels on her arm crossed the lawn well to the right in the direction of the bathhouses from which the children in swimming suits were beginning to emerge  beyond under the palms at the edge of the sea two chinese nursemaids in their pretty native costume of white yeeshon andstraightlined trousers their black braids of hair down their backs attended each on a baby in a perambulator  and all these servants and nurses and grandchildren were martha scandwells  so likewise was the colour of the skin of the grandchildrenthe unmistakable hawaiian colour tinted beyond shadow of mistake by exposure to the hawaiian sun  oneeighth and onesixteenth hawaiian were they which meant that seveneighths or fifteensixteenths white blood informed that skin yet failed to obliterate the modicum of golden tawny brown of polynesia  but in this again only a trained observer would have known that the frolicking children were aught but pureblooded white  roscoe scandwell grandfather was pure white martha threequarters white the many sons and daughters of them seveneighths white the grandchildren graded up to fifteensixteenths white or in the cases when their seveneighths fathers and mothers had married seveneighths themselves fourteensixteenths or seveneighths white  on both sides the stock was good roscoe straight descended from the new england puritans martha no less straight descended from the royal chiefstocks of hawaii whose genealogies were chanted in males a thousand years before written speech was acquired  in the distance a machine stopped and deposited a woman whose utmost years might have been guessed as sixty who walked across the lawn as lightly as a wellcaredfor woman of forty and whose actual calendar age was sixtyeight  martha rose from her seat to greet her in the hearty hawaiian way arms about lips on lips faces eloquent and bodies no less eloquent with sincereness and frank excessiveness of emotion  and it was sister bella and sister martha back and forth intermingled with almost incoherent inquiries about each other and about uncle this and brother that and aunt some one else until the first tremulousness of meeting over eyes moist with tenderness of love they sat gazing at each other across their teacups  apparently they had not seen nor embraced for years  in truth two months marked the interval of their separation  and one was sixtyfour the other sixtyeight  but the thorough comprehension resided in the fact that in each of them onefourth of them was the sunwarm lovewarm heart of hawaii  the children flooded about aunt bella like a rising tide and were capaciously hugged and kissed ere they departed with their nurses to the swimming beach  i thought id run out to the beach for several daysthe trades had stopped blowing martha explained  youve been here two weeks already bella smiled fondly at her younger sister  brother edward told me  he met me at the steamer and insisted on running me out first of all to see louise and dorothy and that first grandchild of his  hes as mad as a silly hatter about it  mercy martha exclaimed  two weeks  i had not thought it that long  wheres annieand margaret bella asked  martha shrugged her voluminous shoulders with voluminous and forgiving affection for her wayward matronly daughters who left their children in her care for the afternoon  margarets at a meeting of the outdoor circletheyre planning the planting of trees and hibiscus all along both sides of kalakaua avenue she said  and annies wearing out eighty dollars worth of tyres to collect seventyfive dollars for the british red cross this is their tag day you know  roscoe must be very proud bella said and observed the bright glow of pride that appeared in her sisters eyes  i got the news in san francisco of hoolaas first dividend  remember when i put a thousand in it at seventyfive cents for poor abbies children and said id sell when it went to ten dollars  and everybody laughed at you and at anybody who bought a share martha nodded  but roscoe knew  its selling today at twenty four  i sold mine from the steamer by wirelessat twenty even bella continued  and now abbies wildly dressmaking  shes going with may and tootsie to paris  and carl martha queried  oh hell finish yale all right  which he would have done anyway and you know it martha charged lapsing charmingly into twentiethcentury slang  bella affirmed her guilt of intention of paying the way of her school friends son through college and added complacently  just the same it was nicer to have hoolaa pay for it  in a way you see roscoe is doing it because it was his judgment i trusted to when i made the investment  she gazed slowly about her her eyes taking in not merely the beauty and comfort and repose of all they rested on but the immensity of beauty and comfort and repose represented by them scattered in similar oases all over the islands  she sighed pleasantly and observed  all our husbands have done well by us with what we brought them  and happily     martha agreed then suspended her utterance with suspicious abruptness  and happily all of us except sister bella bella forgivingly completed the thought for her  it was too bad that marriage martha murmured all softness of sympathy  you were so young  uncle robert should never have made you  i was only nineteen bella nodded  but it was not george castners fault  and look what he out of she grave has done for me  uncle robert was wise  he knew george had the faraway vision of far ahead the energy and the steadiness  he saw even then and thats fifty years ago the value of the nahala waterrights which nobody else valued then  they thought he was struggling to buy the cattle range  he struggled to buy the future of the water and how well he succeeded you know  im almost ashamed to think of my income sometimes  no whatever else the unhappiness of our marriage was not due to george  i could have lived happily with him i know even to this day had he lived  she shook her head slowly  no it was not his fault  nor anybodys  not even mine if it was anybodys fault  the wistful fondness of her smile took the sting out of what she was about to say  if it was anybodys fault it was uncle johns  uncle johns martha cried with sharp surprise  if it had to be one or the other i should have said uncle robert  but uncle john  bella smiled with slow positiveness  but it was uncle robert who made you marry george castner her sister urged  that is true bella nodded corroboration  but it was not the matter of a husband but of a horse  i wanted to borrow a horse from uncle john and uncle john said yes  that is how it all happened  a silence fell pregnant and cryptic and while the voices of the children and the soft mandatory protests of the asiatic maids drew nearer from the beach martha scandwell felt herself vibrant and tremulous with sudden resolve of daring  she waved the children away  run along dears run along grandma and aunt bella want to talk  and as the shrill sweet treble of child voices ebbed away across the lawn martha with scrutiny of the heart observed the sadness of the lines graven by secret woe for half a century in her sisters face  for nearly fifty years had she watched those lines she steeled all the melting softness of the hawaiian of her to break the halfcentury of silence  bella she said  we never know  you never spoke  but we wondered oh often and often  and never asked bella murmured gratefully  but i am asking now at the last  this is our twilight  listen to them  sometimes it almost frightens me to think that they are grandchildren my grandchildreni who only the other day it would seem was as heartfree legfree carefree a girl as ever bestrode a horse or swam in the big surf or gathered opihis at low tide or laughed at a dozen lovers  and here in our twilight let us forget everything save that i am your dear sister as you are mine  the eyes of both were dewy moist  bella palpably trembled to utterance  we thought it was george castner  martha went on and we could guess the details  he was a cold man  you were warm hawaiian  he must have been cruel  brother walcott always insisted he must have beaten you  no  no bella broke in  george castner was never a brute a beast  almost have i wished often that he had been  he never laid hand on me  he never raised hand to me  he never raised his voice to me  neveroh can you believe itdo please sister believe itdid we have a high word nor a cross word  but that house of his of ours at nahala was grey  all the colour of it was grey and cool and chill while i was bright with all colours of sun and earth and blood and birth  it was very cold grey cold with that cold grey husband of mine at nahala  you know he was grey martha  grey like those portraits of emerson we used to see at school  his skin was grey  sun and weather and all hours in the saddle could never tan it  and he was as grey inside as out  and i was only nineteen when uncle robert decided on the marriage how was i to know  uncle robert talked to me  he pointed out how the wealth and property of hawaii was already beginning to pass into the hands of the haoles whites  the hawaiian chiefs let their possessions slip away from them  the hawaiian chiefesses who married haoles had their possessions under the management of their haole husbands increase prodigiously  he pointed back to the original grandfather roger wilton who had taken grandmother wiltons poor mauka lands and added to them and built up about them the kilohana ranch  even then it was second only to the parker ranch martha interrupted proudly  and he told me that had our father before he died been as far seeing as grandfather half the then parker holdings would have been added to kilohana making kilohana first  and he said that never for ever and ever would beef be cheaper  and he said that the big future of hawaii would be in sugar  that was fifty years ago and he has been more than proved right  and he said that the young haole george castner saw far and would go far and that there were many girls of us and that the kilohana lands ought by rights to go to the boys and that if i married george my future was assured in the biggest way  i was only nineteen  just back from the royal chief schoolthat was before our girls went to the states for their education  you were among the first sister martha who got their education on the mainland  and what did i know of love and lovers much less of marriage  all women married  it was their business in life mother and grandmother all the way back they had married  it was my business in life to marry george castner  uncle robert said so in his wisdom and i knew he was very wise  and i went to live with my husband in the grey house at nahala  you remember it  no trees only the rolling grass lands the high mountains behind the sea beneath and the windthe waimea and nahala winds we got them both and the kona wind as well  yet little would i have minded them any more than we minded them at kilohana or than they minded them at mana had not nahala itself been so grey and husband george so grey  we were alone  he was managing nahala for the glenns who had gone back to scotland eighteen hundred a year plus beef horses cowboy service and the ranch house was what he received  it was a high salary in those days martha said  and for george castner and the service he gave it was very cheap bella defended  i lived with him for three years  there was never a morning that he was out of his bed later than halfpast four  he was the soul of devotion to his employers  honest to a penny in his accounts he gave them full measure and more of his time and energy  perhaps that was what helped make our life so grey  but listen martha  out of his eighteen hundred he laid aside sixteen hundred each year  think of it  the two of us lived on two hundred a year  luckily he did not drink or smoke  also we dressed out of it as well  i made my own dresses  you can imagine them  outside of the cowboys who chored the firewood i did the work  i cooked and baked and scrubbed  you who had never known anything but servants from the time you were born martha pitied  never less than a regiment of them at kilohana  oh but it was the bare naked pinching meagreness of it bella cried out  how far i was compelled to make a pound of coffee go a broom worn down to nothing before a new one was bought  and beef  fresh beef and jerky morning noon and night  and porridge  never since have i eaten porridge or any breakfast food  she arose suddenly and walked a dozen steps away to gaze a moment with unseeing eyes at the colourlavish reef while she composed herself  and she returned to her seat with the splendid sure gracious highbreasted nobleheaded port of which no outbreeding can ever rob the hawaiian woman  very haole was bella castner fairskinned finetextured  yet as she returned the high pose of head the levellidded gaze of her long brown eyes under royal arches of eyebrows the softly set lines of her small mouth that fairly sang sweetness of kisses after sixtyeight yearsall made her the very picture of a chiefess of old hawaii fullbursting through her ampleness of haole blood  taller she was than her sister martha if anything more queenly  you know we were notorious as poor feeders bella laughed lightly enough  it was many a mile on either side from nahala to the next roof  belated travellers or stormbound ones would on occasion stop with us overnight  and you know the lavishness of the big ranches then and now  how we were the laughingstock  what do we care george would say  they live today and now  twenty years from now will be our turn bella  they will be where they are now and they will eat out of our hand  we will be compelled to feed them they will need to be fed and we will feed them well for we will be rich bella so rich that i am afraid to tell you but i know what i know and you must have faith in me  george was right  twenty years afterward though he did not live to see it my income was a thousand a month  goodness  i do not know what it is today  but i was only nineteen and i would say to george  now now  we live now  we may not be alive twenty years from now  i do want a new broom  and there is a thirdrate coffee that is only two cents a pound more than the awful stuff we are using  why couldnt i fry eggs in butternow  i should dearly love at least one new tablecloth  our linen  im ashamed to put a guest between the sheets though heaven knows they dare come seldom enough  be patient bella he would reply  in a little while in only a few years those that scorn to sit at our table now or sleep between our sheets will be proud of an invitationthose of them who will not be dead  you remember how stevens passed out last yearfreeliving and easy everybodys friend but his own  the kohala crowd had to bury him for he left nothing but debts  watch the others going the same pace  theres your brother hal  he cant keep it up and live five years and hes breaking his uncles hearts  and theres prince lilolilo  dashes by me with half a hundred mounted ablebodied roystering kanakas in his train who would be better at hard work and looking after their future for he will never be king of hawaii  he will not live to be king of hawaii  george was right  brother hal died  so did prince lilolilo  but george was not all right  he who neither drank nor smoked who never wasted the weight of his arms in an embrace nor the touch of his lips a second longer than the most perfunctory of kisses who was invariably up before cockcrow and asleep ere the kerosene lamp had a tenth emptied itself and who never thought to die was dead even more quickly than brother hal and prince lilolilo  be patient bella uncle robert would say to me  george castner is a coming man  i have chosen well for you  your hardships now are the hardships on the way to the promised land not always will the hawaiians rule in hawaii  just as they let their wealth slip out of their hands so will their rule slip out of their hands  political power and the land always go together there will be great changes revolutions no one knows how many nor of what sort save that in the end the haole will possess the land and the rule  and in that day you may well be first lady of hawaii just as surely as george castner will be ruler of hawaii it is written in the books  it is ever so where the haole conflicts with the easier races  i your uncle robert who am halfhawaiian and halfhaole know whereof i speak  be patient bella be patient  dear bella uncle john would say and i knew his heart was tender for me  thank god he never told me to be patient  he knew  he was very wise  he was warm human and therefore wiser than uncle robert and george castner who sought the thing not the spirit who kept records in ledgers rather than numbers of heart beats breast to breast who added columns of figures rather than remembered embraces and endearments of look and speech and touch dear bella uncle john would say  he knew  you have heard always how he was the lover of the princess naomi  he was a true lover  he loved but the once  after her death they said he was eccentric  he was  he was the one lover once and always remember that taboo inner room of his at kilohana that we entered only after his death and found it his shrine to her  dear bella it was all he ever said to me but i knew he knew  and i was nineteen and sunwarm hawaiian in spite of my three quarters haole blood and i knew nothing save my girlhood splendours at kilohana and my honolulu education at the royal chief school and my grey husband at nahala with his grey preachments and practices of sobriety and thrift and those two childless uncles of mine the one with far cold vision the other the brokenhearted foreverdreaming lover of a dead princess  think of that grey house  i who had known the ease and the delights and the everlaughing joys of kilohana and of the parkers at old mana and of puuwaawaa  you remember  we did live in feudal spaciousness in those days  would you can you believe it marthaat nahala the only sewing machine i had was one of those the early missionaries brought a tiny crazy thing that one cranked around by hand  robert and john had each given husband george five thousand dollars at my marriage  but he had asked for it to be kept secret only the four of us knew  and while i sewed my cheap holokus on that crazy machine he bought land with the moneythe upper nahala lands you knowa bit at a time each purchase a harddriven bargain his face the very face of poverty  today the nahala ditch alone pays me forty thousand a year  but was it worth it  i starved  if only once madly he had crushed me in his arms  if only once he could have lingered with me five minutes from his own business or from his fidelity to his employers  sometimes i could have screamed or showered the eternal bowl of hot porridge into his face or smashed the sewing machine upon the floor and danced a hula on it just to make him burst out and lose his temper and be human be a brute be a man of some sort instead of a grey frozen demigod  bellas tragic expression vanished and she laughed outright in sheer genuineness of mirthful recollection  and when i was in such moods he would gravely look me over gravely feel my pulse examine my tongue gravely dose me with castor oil and gravely put me to bed early with hot stovelids and assure me that id feel better in the morning  early to bed our wildest sitting up was nine oclock  eight oclock was our regular bedtime  it saved kerosene  we did not eat dinner at nahalaremember the great table at kilohana where we did have dinner  but husband george and i had supper  and then he would sit close to the lamp on one side the table and read old borrowed magazines for an hour while i sat on the other side and darned his socks and underclothing  he always wore such cheap shoddy stuff and when he went to bed i went to bed  no wastage of kerosene with only one to benefit by it  and he went to bed always the same way winding up his watch entering the days weather in his diary and taking off his shoes right foot first invariably left foot second and placing them just so side by side on the floor at the foot of the bed on his side  he was the cleanest man i ever knew  he never wore the same undergarment a second time  i did the washing  he was so clean it hurt  he shaved twice a day  he used more water on his body than any kanaka  he did more work than any two haoles  and he saw the future of the nahala water  and he made you wealthy but did not make you happy martha observed  bella sighed and nodded  what is wealth after all sister martha  my new piercearrow came down on the steamer with me  my third in two years  but oh all the piercearrows and all the incomes in the world compared with a loverthe one lover the one mate to be married to to toil beside and suffer and joy beside the one male man lover husband      her voice trailed off and the sisters sat in soft silence while an ancient crone staff in hand twisted doubled and shrunken under a hundred years of living hobbled across the lawn to them  her eyes withered to scarcely more than peepholes were sharp as a mongooses and at bellas feet she first sank down in pure hawaiian mumbling and chanting a toothless mele of bella and bellas ancestry and adding to it an extemporized welcome back to hawaii after her absence across the great sea to california  and while she chanted her mele the old crones shrewd fingers lomied or massaged bellas silkstockinged legs from ankle and calf to knee and thigh  both bellas and marthas eyes were luminousmoist as the old retainer repeated the lomi and the mele to martha and as they talked with her in the ancient tongue and asked the immemorial questions about her health and age and greatgreatgrandchildren she who had lomied them as babies in the great house at kilohana as her ancestresses had lomied their ancestresses back through the unnumbered generations  the brief duty visit over martha arose and accompanied her back to the bungalow putting money into her hand commanding proud and beautiful japanese housemaids to wait upon the dilapidated aborigine with poi which is compounded of the roots of the water lily with iamaka which is raw fish and with pounded kukui nut and limu which latter is seawood tender to the toothless digestible and savoury  it was the old feudal tie the faithfulness of the commoner to the chief the responsibility of the chief to the commoner and martha threequarters haole with the anglosaxon blood of new england was fourquarters hawaiian in her remembrance and observance of the wellnigh vanished customs of old days  as she came back across the lawn to the hau tree bellas eyes dwelt upon the moving authenticity of her and of the blood of her and embraced her and loved her  shorter than bella was martha a trifle but the merest trifle less queenly of port but beautifully and generously proportioned mellowed rather than dismantled by years her polynesian chiefess figure eloquent and glorious under the satisfying lines of a halffitting grandly sweeping blacksilk holoku trimmed with black lace more costly than a paris gown  and as both sisters resumed their talk an observer would have noted the striking resemblance of their pure straight profiles of their broad cheekbones of their wide and lofty foreheads of their irongrey abundance of hair of their sweetlipped mouths set with the carriage of decades of assured and accomplished pride and of their lovely slender eyerows arched over equally lovely long brown eyes  the hands of both of them little altered or defaced by age were wonderful in their slender tapering fingertips lovelomied and loveformed while they were babies by old hawaiian women like to the one even then eating poi and iamaka and limu in the house  i had a year of it bella resumed and do you know things were beginning to come right  i was beginning to draw to husband george  women are so made i was such a woman at any rate  for he was good  he was just  all the old sterling puritan virtues were his  i was coming to draw to him to like him almost might i say to love him  and had not uncle john loaned me that horse i know that i would have truly loved him and have lived ever happily with himin a quiet sort of way of course  you see i knew nothing else nothing different nothing better in the way of men  i came gladly to look across the table at him while he read in the brief interval between supper and bed gladly to listen for and to catch the beat of his horses hoofs coming home at night from his endless riding over the ranch  and his scant praise was praise indeed that made me tingle with happiness yes sister martha i knew what it was to blush under his precise just praise for the things i had done right or correctly  and all would have been well for the rest of our lives together except that he had to take steamer to honolulu  it was business he was to be gone two weeks or longer first for the glenns in ranch affairs and next for himself to arrange the purchase of still more of the upper nahala lands  do you know he bought lots of the wilder and upanddown lands worthless for aught save water and the very heart of the watershed for as low as five and ten cents an acre  and he suggested i needed a change  i wanted to go with him to honolulu  but with an eye to expense he decided kilohana for me  not only would it cost him nothing for me to visit at the old home but he saved the price of the poor food i should have eaten had i remained alone at nahala which meant the purchase price of more nahala acreage  and at kilohana uncle john said yes and loaned me the horse  oh it was like heaven getting back those first several days it was difficult to believe at first that there was so much food in all the world  the enormous wastage of the kitchen appalled me  i saw waste everywhere so well trained had i been by husband george why out in the servants quarters the aged relatives and most distant hangerson of the servants fed better than george and i ever fed  you remember our kilohana way same as the parker way a bullock killed for every meal fresh fish by runners from the ponds of waipio and kiholo the best and rarest at all times of everything     and love our family way of loving  you know what uncle john was and brother walcott was there and brother edward and all the younger sisters save you and sally away at school  and aunt elizabeth and aunt janet with her husband and all her children on a visit  it was arms around and perpetual endearings and all that i had missed for a weary twelvemonth  i was thirsty for it i was like a survivor from the open boat falling down on the sand and lapping the fresh bubbling springs at the roots of the palms  and they came riding up from kawaihae where they had landed from the royal yacht the whole glorious cavalcade of them two by two flowergarlanded young and happy gay on parker ranch horses thirty of them in the party a hundred parker ranch cowboys and as many more of their own retainersa royal progress  it was princess lihues progress of course she flaming and passing as we all knew with the dreadful tuberculosis but with her were her nephews prince lilolilo hailed everywhere as the next king and his brothers prince kahekili and prince kamalau  and with the princess was ella higginsworth who rightly claimed higher chief blood lines through the kauai descent than belonged to the reigning family and dora niles and emily lowcroft and    oh why enumerate them all  ella higginsworth and i had been roommates at the royal chief school  and there was a great resting time for an hourno luau for the luau awaited them at the parkersbut beer and stronger drinks for the men and lemonade and oranges and refreshing watermelon for the women  and it was arms around with ella higginsworth and me and the princess who remembered me and all the other girls and women and ella spoke to the princess and the princess herself invited me to the progress joining them at mana whence they would depart two days later  and i was mad mad with it alli from a twelvemonth of imprisonment at grey nahala  and i was nineteen yet just turning twenty within the week  oh i had not thought of what was to happen  so occupied was i with the women that i did not see lilolilo except at a distance bulking large and tall above the other men  but i had never been on a progress  i had seen them entertained at kilohana and mana but i had been too young to be invited along and after that it had been school and marriage  i knew what it would be liketwo weeks of paradise and little enough for another twelve months at nahala  and i asked uncle john to lend me a horse which meant three horses of courseone mounted cowboy and a pack horse to accompany me  no roads then  no automobiles  and the horse for myself  it was hilo  you dont remember him  you were away at school then and before you came home the following year hed broken his back and his riders neck wildcattleroping up mauna kea  you heard about itthat young american naval officer  lieutenant bowsfield martha nodded  but hilo  i was the first woman on his back  he was a three yearold almost a fouryear and just broken  so black and in such a vigour of coat that the high lights on him clad him in shimmering silver  he was the biggest riding animal on the ranch descended from the kings sparklingdow with a range mare for dam and roped wild only two weeks before  i never have seen so beautiful a horse  he had the round deepchested bighearted wellcoupled body of the ideal mountain pony and his head and neck were true thoroughbred slender yet full with lovely alert ears not too small to be vicious nor too large to be stubborn mulish and his legs and feet were lovely too unblemished sure and firm with long springy pasterns that made him a wonder of ease under the saddle  i remember hearing prince lilolilo tell uncle john that you were the best woman rider in all hawaii martha interrupted to say that was two years afterward when i was back from school and while you were still living at nahala  lilolilo said that bella cried  almost as with a blush her long brown eyes were illumined as she bridged the years to her lover near half a century dead and dust  with the gentleness of modesty so innate in the women of hawaii she covered her spontaneous exposure of her heart with added panegyric of hilo  oh when he ran with me up the longgrass slopes and down the longgrass slopes it was like hurdling in a dream for he cleared the grass at every bound leaping like a deer a rabbit or a fox terrieryou know how they do  and cut up and prance and high life  he was a mount for a general for a napoleon or a kitchener and he had not a wicked eye but oh such a roguish eye intelligent and looking as if it cherished a joke behind and wanted to laugh or to perpetrate it  and i asked uncle john for hilo and uncle john looked at me and i looked at him and though he did not say it i knew he was feeling dear bella and i knew somewhere in his seeing of me was all his vision of the princess naomi  and uncle john said yes  that is how it happened  but he insisted that i should try hilo outmyself ratherat private rehearsal  he was a handful a glorious handful  but not vicious not malicious  he got away from me over and over again but i never let him know  i was not afraid and that helped me keep always a feel of him that prevented him from thinking that he was even a jump ahead of me  i have often wondered if uncle john dreamed of what possibly might happen  i know i had no thought of it myself that day i rode across and joined the princess at mana  never was there such festal time  you know the grand way the old parkers had of entertaining  the pigsticking and wildcattleshooting the horsebreaking and the branding  the servants quarters overflowing  parker cowboys in from everywhere  and all the girls from waimea up and the girls from waipio and honokaa and paauiloi can see them yet sitting in long rows on top the stone walls of the breaking pen and making leis flower garlands for their cowboy lovers  and the nights the perfumed nights the chanting of the meles and the dancing of the hulas and the big mana grounds with lovers everywhere strolling two by two under the trees  and the prince      bella paused and for a long minute her small fine teeth still perfect showed deep in her underlip as she sought and won control and sent her gaze vacantly out across the far blue horizon  as she relaxed her eyes came back to her sister  he was a prince martha  you saw him at kilohana before    after you came home from seminary  he filled the eyes of any woman yes and of any man  twentyfive he was in allglorious ripeness of man great and princely in body as he was great and princely in spirit  no matter how wild the fun how reckless mad the sport he never seemed to forget that he was royal and that all his forebears had been high chiefs even to that first one they sang in the genealogies who had navigated his doublecanoes to tahiti and raiatea and back again  he was gracious sweet kindly comradely all friendlinessand severe and stern and harsh if he were crossed too grievously  it is hard to express what i mean he was all man man man and he was all prince with a strain of the merry boy in him and the iron in him that would have made him a good and strong king of hawaii had he come to the throne  i can see him yet as i saw him that first day and touched his hand and talked with him    few words and bashful and anything but a yearlong married woman to a grey haole at grey nahala  half a century ago it was that meetingyou remember how our young men then dressed in white shoes and trousers white silk shirts with slashed around the middle the gorgeously colourful spanish sashes and for half a century that picture of him has not faded in my heart  he was the centre of a group on the lawn and i was being brought by ella higginsworth to be presented  the princess lihue had just called some teasing chaff to her which had made her halt to respond and left me halted a pace in front of her  his glance chanced to light on me alone there perturbed embarrassed  oh how i see himhis head thrown back a little with that high bright imperious and utterly carefree poise that was so usual of him  our eyes met  his head bent forward or straightened to me i dont know what happened  did he command did i obey  i do not know  i know only that i was good to look upon crowned with fragrant maile clad in princess naomis wonderful holoku loaned me by uncle john from his taboo room and i know that i advanced alone to him across the mana lawn and that he stepped forth from those about him to meet me halfway  we came to each other across the grass unattended as if we were coming to each other across our lives  was i very beautiful sister martha when i was young  i do not know  i dont know  but in that moment with all his beauty and truly royalmanness crossing to me and penetrating to the heart of me i felt a sudden sense of beauty in myselfhow shall i say as if in him and from him perfection were engendered and conjured within myself  no word was spoken  but oh i know i raised my face in frank answer to the thunder and trumpets of the message unspoken and that had it been death for that one look and that one moment i could not have refrained from the gift of myself that must have been in my face and eyes in the very body of me that breathed so high  was i beautiful very beautiful martha when i was nineteen just turning into twenty  and martha threescore and four looked upon bella threescore and eight and nodded genuine affirmation and to herself added the appreciation of the instant in what she beheldbellas neck still full and shapely longer than the ordinary hawaiian womans neck a pillar that carried regally her highcheeked highbrowed high chiefess face and head bellas hair highpiled intact sparkling the silver of the years ringleted still and contrasting definitely and sharply with her clean slim black brows and deep brown eyes and marthas glance in modest overwhelming of modesty by what she saw dropped down the splendid breast of her and generously true lines of body to the feet silken clad highheeledslippered small plump with an almost spanish arch and faultlessness of instep  when one is young the one young time bella laughed  lilolilo was a prince  i came to know his every feature and their every phase    afterward in our wonder days and nights by the singing waters by the slumberdrowsy surfs and on the mountain ways  i knew his fine brave eyes with their straight black brows the nose of him that was assuredly a kamehameha nose and the last least lovable curve of his mouth  there is no mouth more beautiful than the hawaiian martha  and his body  he was a king of athletes from his wicked wayward hair to his ankles of bronzed steel  just the other day i heard one of the wilder grandsons referred to as the prince of harvard mercy  what would they what could they have called my lilolilo could they have matched him against this wilder lad and all his team at harvard  bella ceased and breathed deeply the while she clasped her fine small hands in her ample silken lap  but her pink fairness blushed faintly through her skin and warmed her eyes as she relived her princedays  wellyou have guessed bella said with defiant shrug of shoulders and a straight gaze into her sisters eyes  we rode out from gay mana and continued the gay progressdown the lava trails to kiholo to the swimming and the fishing and the feasting and the sleeping in the warm sand under the palms and up to puuwaawaa and more pigsticking and roping and driving and wild mutton from the upper pasturelands and on through kona now mauka mountainward now down to the kings palace at kailua and to the swimming at keauhou and to kealakekua bay and napoopoo and honaunau  and everywhere the people turning out in their hands gifts of flowers and fruit and fish and pig in their hearts love and song their heads bowed in obeisance to the royal ones while their lips ejaculated exclamations of amazement or chanted meles of old and unforgotten days  what would you sister martha  you know what we hawaiians are you know what we were half a hundred years ago  lilolilo was wonderful  i was reckless  lilolilo of himself could make any woman reckless  i was twice reckless for i had cold grey nahala to spur me on  i knew  i had never a doubt  never a hope divorces in those days were undreamed  the wife of george castner could never be queen of hawaii even if uncle roberts prophesied revolutions were delayed and if lilolilo himself became king  but i never thought of the throne  what i wanted would have been the queendom of being lilolilos wife and mate  but i made no mistake what was impossible was impossible and i dreamed no false dream  it was the very atmosphere of love  and lilolilo was a lover  i was for ever crowned with leis by him and he had his runners bring me leis all the way from the rosegardens of manayou remember them fifty miles across the lava and the ranges dewy fresh as the moment they were plucked in their jewelcases of banana bark yardlong they were the tiny pink buds like threaded beads of neapolitan coral  and at the luaus feasts the for ever never ending luaus i must be seated on lilolilos makaloa mat the princes mat his alone and taboo to any lesser mortal save by his own condescension and desire  and i must dip my fingers into his own pa wai holoi fingerbowl where scented flower petals floated in the warm water  yes and careless that all should see his extended favour i must dip into his pa paakai for my pinches of red salt and limu and kukui nut and chili pepper and into his ipu kai fish sauce dish of kou wood that the great kamehameha himself had eaten from on many a similar progress  and it was the same for special delicacies that were for lilolilo and the princess alonefor his nelu and the ake and the palu and the alaala and his kahilis were waved over me and his attendants were mine and he was mine and from my flowercrowned hair to my happy feet i was a woman loved  once again bellas small teeth pressed into her underlip as she gazed vacantly seaward and won control of herself and her memories  it was on and on through all kona and all kau from hoopuloa and kapua to honuapo and punaluu a lifetime of living compressed into two short weeks  a flower blooms but once  that was my time of bloomlilolilo beside me myself on my wonderful hilo a queen not of hawaii but of lilolilo and love  he said i was a bubble of colour and beauty on the black back of leviathan that i was a fragile dewdrop on the smoking crest of a lava flow that i was a rainbow riding the thunder cloud      bella paused for a moment  i shall tell you no more of what he said to me she declared gravely save that the things he said were fire of love and essence of beauty and that he composed hulas to me and sang them to me before all of nights under the stars as we lay on our mats at the feasting and i on the makaloa mat of lilolilo  and it was on to kilaueathe dream so near its ending and of course we tossed into the pit of seasurging lava our offerings to the firegoddess of maile leis and of fish and hard poi wrapped moist in the ti leaves  and we continued down through old puna and feasted and danced and sang at kohoualea and kamaili and opihikao and swam in the clear sweetwater pools of kalapana and in the end came to hilo by the sea  it was the end  we had never spoken  it was the end recognized and unmentioned  the yacht waited  we were days late  honolulu called and the news was that the king had gone particularly pupule insane that there were catholic and protestant missionary plottings and that trouble with france was brewing  as they had landed at kawaihae two weeks before with laughter and flowers and song so they departed from hilo  it was a merry parting full of fun and frolic and a thousand last messages and reminders and jokes  the anchor was broken out to a song of farewell from lilolilos singing boys on the quarterdeck while we in the big canoes and whaleboats saw the first breeze fill the vessels sails and the distance begin to widen  through all the confusion and excitement lilolilo at the rail who must say last farewells and quip last jokes to many looked squarely down at me  on his head he wore my ilima lei which i had made for him and placed there  and into the canoes to the favoured ones they on the yacht began tossing their many leis  i had no expectancy of hope    and yet i hoped in a small wistful way that i know did not show in my face which was as proud and merry as any there  but lilolilo did what i knew he would do what i had known from the first he would do  still looking me squarely and honestly in the eyes he took my beautiful ilima lei from his head and tore it across  i saw his lips shape but not utter aloud the single word pau finish  still looking at me he broke both parts of the lei in two again and tossed the deliberate fragments not to me but down overside into the widening water pau  it was finished      for a long space bellas vacant gaze rested on the sea horizon martha ventured no mere voice expression of the sympathy that moistened her own eyes  and i rode on that day up the old bad trail along the hamakua coast bella resumed with a voice at first singularly dry and harsh  that first day was not so hard  i was numb  i was too full with the wonder of all i had to forget to know that i had to forget it  i spent the night at laupahoehoe  do you know i had expected a sleepless night  instead weary from the saddle still numb i slept the night through as if i had been dead  but the next day in driving wind and drenching rain  how it blew and poured  the trail was really impassable  again and again our horses went down  at fist the cowboy uncle john had loaned me with the horses protested then he followed stolidly in the rear shaking his head and i know muttering over and over that i was pupule  the pack horse was abandoned at kukuihaele  we almost swam up mud lane in a river of mud  at waimea the cowboy had to exchange for a fresh mount  but hilo lasted through  from daybreak till midnight i was in the saddle till uncle john at kilohana took me off my horse in his arms and carried me in and routed the women from their beds to undress me and lomi me while he plied me with hot toddies and drugged me to sleep and forgetfulness  i know i must have babbled and raved  uncle john must have guessed  but never to another nor even to me did he ever breathe a whisper  whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of naomi  i do have fleeting memories of some of that day all a broken hearted mad rage against fateof my hair down and whipped wet and stinging about me in the driving rain of endless tears of weeping contributed to the general deluge of passionate outbursts and resentments against a world all twisted and wrong of beatings of my hands upon my saddle pommel of asperities to my kilohana cowboy of spurs into the ribs of poor magnificent hilo with a prayer on my lips bursting out from my heart that the spurs would so madden him as to make him rear and fall on me and crush my body for ever out of all beauty for man or topple me off the trail and finish me at the foot of the palis precipices writing pau at the end of my name as final as the unuttered pau on lilolilos lips when he tore across my ilima lei and dropped it in the sea     husband george was delayed in honolulu  when he came back to nahala i was there waiting for him  and solemnly he embraced me perfunctorily kissed my lips gravely examined my tongue decried my looks and state of health and sent me to bed with hot stove lids and a dosage of castor oil  like entering into the machinery of a clock and becoming one of the cogs or wheels inevitably and remorselessly turning around and around so i entered back into the grey life of nahala  out of bed was husband george at half after four every morning and out of the house and astride his horse at five  there was the eternal porridge and the horrible cheap coffee and the fresh beef and jerky  i cooked and baked and scrubbed  i ground around the crazy hand sewing machine and made my cheap holokus  night after night through the endless centuries of two years more i sat across the table from him until eight oclock mending his cheap socks and shoddy underwear while he read the years old borrowed magazines he was too thrifty to subscribe to  and then it was bedtimekerosene must be economizedand he wound his watch entered the weather in his diary and took off his shoes the right shoe first and placed them just so side by side at the foot of the bed on his side  but there was no more of my drawing to husband george as had been the promise ere the princess lihue invited me on the progress and uncle john loaned me the horse  you see sister martha nothing would have happened had uncle john refused me the horse  but i had known love and i had known lilolilo and what chance after that had husband george to win from me heart of esteem or affection and for two years at nahala i was a dead woman who somehow walked and talked and baked and scrubbed and mended socks and saved kerosene  the doctors said it was the shoddy underwear that did for him pursuing as always the highmountain nahala waters in the drenching storms of midwinter  when he died i was not sad  i had been sad too long already nor was i glad  gladness had died at hilo when lilolilo dropped my ilima lei into the sea and my feet were never happy again lilolilo passed within a month after husband george  i had never seen him since the parting at hilo  la la suitors a many have i had since but i was like uncle john  mating for me was but once uncle john had his naomi room at kilohana  i have had my lilolilo room for fifty years in my heart  you are the first sister martha whom i have permitted to enter that room      a machine swung the circle of the drive and from it across the lawn approached the husband of martha  erect slender grey haired of graceful military bearing roscoe scandwell was a member of the big five which by the interlocking of interests determined the destinies of all hawaii  himself pure haole new england born he kissed bella first arms around fullhearty in the hawaiian way  his alert eye told him that there had been a woman talk and despite the signs of all generousness of emotion that all was well and placid in the twilight wisdom that was theirs  elsie and the younglings are comingjust got a wireless from their steamer he announced after he had kissed his wife  and theyll be spending several days with us before they go on to maui  i was going to put you in the rose room sister bella martha scandwell planned aloud  but it will be better for her and the children and the nurses and everything there so you shall have queen emmas room  i had it last time and i prefer it bella said  roscoe scandwell himself well taught of hawaiian love and love ways erect slender dignified between the two nobly proportioned women an arm around each of their sumptuous waists proceeded with them toward the house  waikiki hawaii  june 6 1916    the bones of kahekili    from over the lofty koolau mountains vagrant wisps of the trade wind drifted faintly swaying the great unwhipped banana leaves rustling the palms and fluttering and setting up a whispering among the laceleaved algaroba trees  only intermittently did the atmosphere so breathefor breathing it was the suspiring of the languid hawaiian afternoon  in the intervals between the soft breathings the air grew heavy and balmy with the perfume of flowers and the exhalations of fat living soil  of humans about the low bungalowlike house there were many but one only of them slept  the rest were on the tense tiptoes of silence  at the rear of the house a tiny babe piped up a thin blatting wail that the quickly thrust breast could not appease the mother a slender hapahaole halfwhite clad in a loose flowing holoku of white muslin hastened away swiftly among the banana and papaia trees to remove the babes noise by distance other women hapahaole and full native watched her anxiously as she fled  at the front of the house on the grass squatted a score of hawaiians  wellmuscled broadshouldered they were all strapping men  brownskinned with luminous brown eyes and black their features large and regular they showed all the signs of being as goodnatured merryhearted and softtempered as the climate  to all of which a seeming contradiction was given by the ferociousness of their accoutrement  into the tops of their rough leather leggings were thrust long knives the handles projecting  on their heels were hugerowelled spanish spurs  they had the appearance of banditti save for the incongruous wreaths of flowers and fragrant maile that encircled the crowns of their flopping cowboy hats  one of them deliciously and roguishly handsome as a faun with the eyes of a faun wore a flaming doublehibiscus bloom coquettishly tucked over his ear  above them casting a shelter of shade from the sun grew a widespreading canopy of ponciana regia itself a flame of blossoms out of each of which sprang pompoms of feathery stamens  from far off muffled by distance came the faint stamping of their tethered horses  the eyes of all were intently fixed upon the solitary sleeper who lay on his back on a lauhala mat a hundred feet away under the monkeypod trees  large as were the hawaiian cowboys the sleeper was larger  also as his snowwhite hair and beard attested he was much older  the thickness of his wrist and the greatness of his fingers made authentic the mighty frame of him hidden under loose dungaree pants and cotton shirt buttonless open from midriff to adams apple exposing a chest matted with a thatch of hair as white as that of his head and face  the depth and breadth of that chest its resilience and its relaxed and plastic muscles tokened the knotty strength that still resided in him  further no bronze and beat of sun and wind availed to hide the testimony of his skin that he was all haolea white man  on his back his great white beard thrust skyward untrimmed of barbers stiffened and subsided with every breath while with the outblow of every exhalation the white moustache erected perpendicularly like the quills of a porcupine and subsided with each intake  a young girl of fourteen clad only in a single shift or muumuu herself a granddaughter of the sleeper crouched beside him and with a feathered flyflapper brushed away the flies in her face were depicted solicitude and nervousness and awe as if she attended on a god  and truly hardman pool the sleeping whiskery one was to her and to many and sundry a goda source of life a source of food a fount of wisdom a giver of law a smiling beneficence a blackness of thunder and punishmentin short a manmaster whose record was fourteen living and adult sons and daughters six great grandchildren and more grandchildren than could he in his most lucid moments enumerate  fiftyone years before he had landed from an open boat at laupahoehoe on the windward coast of hawaii  the boat was the one surviving one of the whaler black prince of new bedford  himself new bedford born twenty years of age by virtue of his driving strength and ability he had served as second mate on the lost whaleship  coming to honolulu and casting about for himself he had first married kalama mamaiopili next acted as pilot of honolulu harbour after that started a saloon and boarding house and finally on the death of kalamas father engaged in cattle ranching on the broad pasture lands she had inherited  for over half a century he had lived with the hawaiians and it was conceded that he knew their language better than did most of them by marrying kalama he had married not merely her land but her own chief rank and the fealty owed by the commoners to her by virtue of her genealogy was also accorded him  in addition he possessed of himself all the natural attributes of chiefship  the gigantic stature the fearlessness the pride and the high hot temper that could brook no impudence nor insult that could be neither bullied nor awed by any utmost magnificence of power that walked on two legs and that could compel service of lesser humans not by any ignoble purchase by bargaining but by an unspoken but expected condescending of largesse  he knew his hawaiians from the outside and the in knew them better than themselves their polynesian circumlocutions faiths customs and mysteries  and at seventyone after a morning in the saddle over the ranges that began at four oclock he lay under the monkeypods in his customary and sacred siesta that no retainer dared to break nor would dare permit any equal of the great one to break  only to the king was such a right accorded and as the king had early learned to break hardman pools siesta was to gain awake a very irritable and grumpy hardman pool who would talk straight from the shoulder and say unpleasant but true things that no king would care to hear  the sun blazed down  the horses stamped remotely  the fading tradewind wisps sighed and rustled between longer intervals of quiescence  the perfume grew heavier  the woman brought back the babe quiet again to the rear of the house  the monkeypods folded their leaves and swooned to a siesta of their own in the soft air above the sleeper  the girl breathless as ever from the enormous solemnity of her task still brushed the flies away and the score of cowboys still intently and silently watched  hardman pool awoke  the next outbreath expected of the long rhythm did not take place  neither did the white long moustache rise up  instead the cheeks under the whiskers puffed the eyelids lifted exposing blue eyes choleric and fully and immediately conscious the right hand went out to the halfsmoked pipe beside him while the left hand reached the matches  get me my gin and milk he ordered in hawaiian of the little maid who had been startled into a tremble by his awaking  he lighted the pipe but gave no sign of awareness of the presence of his waiting retainers until the tumbler of gin and milk had been brought and drunk  well he demanded abruptly and in the pause while twenty faces wreathed in smiles and twenty pairs of dark eyes glowed luminously with wellwishing pleasure he wiped the lingering drops of gin and milk from his hairy lips  what are you hanging around for  what do you want  come over here  twenty giants most of them young uprose and with a great clanking and jangling of spurs and spurchains strode over to him  they grouped before him in a semicircle trying bashfully to wedge their shoulders one behind anothers their faces agrin and apologetic and at the same time expressing a casual and unconscious democraticness  in truth to them hardman pool was more than mere chief  he was elder brother or father or patriarch and to all of them he was related in one way or another according to hawaiian custom through his wife and through the many marriages of his children and grandchildren  his slightest frown might perturb them his anger terrify them his command compel them to certain death yet on the other hand not one of them would have dreamed of addressing him otherwise than intimately by his first name which name hardman was transmuted by their tongues into kanaka oolea  at a nod from him the semicircle seated itself on the manienie grass and with further deprecatory smiles waited his pleasure  what do you want demanded in hawaiian with a brusqueness and sternness they knew were put on  they smiled more broadly and deliciously squirmed their broad shoulders and great torsos with the appeasingness of so many wriggling puppies  hardman pool singled out one of them  well iliiopoi what do you want  ten dollars kanaka oolea  ten dollars pool cried in apparent shock at mention of so vast a sum  does it mean you are going to take a second wife remember the missionary teaching  one wife at a time iliiopoi one wife at a time  for he who entertains a plurality of wives will surely go to hell  giggles and flashings of laughing eyes from all greeted the joke  no kanaka oolea came the reply  the devil knows i am hard put to get kowkow for one wife and her several relations  kowkow pool repeated the chineseintroduced word for food which the hawaiians had come to substitute for their own paina  didnt you boys get kowkow here this noon  yes kanaka oolea volunteered an old withered native who had just joined the group from the direction of the house  all of them had kowkow in the kitchen and plenty of it  they ate like lost horses brought down from the lava  and what do you want kumuhana pool diverted to the old one at the same time motioning to the little maid to flap flies from the other side of him  twelve dollars said kumuhana  i want to buy a jackass and a secondhand saddle and bridle  i am growing too old for my legs to carry me in walking  you wait his haole lord commanded  i will talk with you about the matter and about other things of importance when i am finished with the rest and they are gone  the withered old one nodded and proceeded to light his pipe  the kowkow in the kitchen was good iliiopoi resumed licking his lips  the poi was onefinger the pig fat the salmonbelly unstinking the fish of great freshness and plenty though the opihis tiny rockclinging shellfish had been salted and thereby made tough  never should the opihis be salted  often have i told you kanaka oolea that opihis should never be salted  i am full of good kowkow  my belly is heavy with it  yet is my heart not light of it because there is no kowkow in my own house where is my wife who is the aunt of your fourth sons second wife and where is my baby daughter and my wifes old mother and my wifes old mothers feeding child that is a cripple and my wifes sister who lives likewise with us along with her three children the father being dead of a wicked dropsy  will five dollars save all of you from funerals for a day or several pool testily cut the tale short  yes kanaka oolea and as well it will buy my wife a new comb and some tobacco for myself  from a goldsack drawn from the hippocket of his dungarees hardman pool drew the gold piece and tossed it accurately into the waiting hand  to a bachelor who wanted six dollars for new leggings tobacco and spurs three dollars were given the same to another who needed a hat and to a third who modestly asked for two dollars four were given with a floweryworded compliment anent his prowess in roping a recent wild bull from the mountains  they knew as a rule that he cut their requisitions in half therefore they doubled the size of their requisitions  and hardman pool knew they doubled and smiled to himself  it was his way and further it was a very good way with his multitudinous relatives and did not reduce his stature in their esteem  and you ahuhu he demanded of one whose name meant poison wood  and the price of a pair of dungarees ahuhu concluded his list of needs  i have ridden much and hard after your cattle kanaka oolea and where my dungarees have pressed against the seat of the saddle there is no seat to my dungarees  it is not well that it be said that a kanaka oolea cowboy who is also a cousin of kanaka ooleas wifes halfsister should be shamed to be seen out of the saddle save that he walks backward from all that behold him  the price of a dozen pairs of dungarees be thine ahuhu hardman pool beamed tossing to him the necessary sum  i am proud that my family shares my pride  afterward ahuhu out of the dozen dungarees you will give me one else shall i be compelled to walk backward my own and only dungarees being in like manner well worn and shameful  and in laughter of love at their haole chiefs final sally all the sweetchildminded and physically gorgeous company of them departed to their waiting horses save the old withered one kumuhana who had been bidden to wait  for a full five minutes they sat in silence  then hardman pool ordered the little maid to fetch a tumbler of gin and milk which when she brought it he nodded her to hand to kumuhana  the glass did not leave his lips until it was empty whereon he gave a great audible outbreath of aaah and smacked his lips  much awa have i drunk in my time he said reflectively  yet is the awa but a common mans drink while the haole liquor is a drink for chiefs  the awa has not the liquors hot willingness its spur in the ribs of feeling its biting alive of oneself that is very pleasant since it is pleasant to be alive  hardman pool smiled nodded agreement and old kumuhana continued  there is a warmingness to it  it warms the belly and the soul it warms the heart  even the soul and the heart grow cold when one is old  you are old pool conceded  almost as old as i  kumuhana shook his head and murmured  were i no older than you i would be as young as you  i am seventyone said pool  i do not know ages that way was the reply  what happened when you were born  let me see pool calculated  this is 1880  subtract seventy one and it leaves nine  i was born in 1809 which is the year keliimakai died which is the year the scotchman archibald campbell lived in honolulu  then am i truly older than you kanaka oolea  i remember the scotchman well for i was playing among the grass houses of honolulu at the time and already riding a surfboard in the wahine woman surf at waikiki  i can take you now to the spot where was the scotchmans grass house  the seamans mission stands now on the very ground  yet do i know when i was born  often my grandmother and my mother told me of it  i was born when madame pele the fire goddess or volcano goddess became angry with the people of paiea because they sacrificed no fish to her from their fishpool and she sent down a flow of lava from huulalai and filled up their pond  for ever was the fishpond of paiea filled up  that was when i was born  that was in 1801 when james boyd was building ships for kamehameha at hilo pool cast back through the calendar which makes you seventynine or eight years older than i  you are very old  yes kanaka oolea muttered kumuhana pathetically attempting to swell his shrunken chest with pride  and you are very wise  yes kanaka oolea  and you know many of the secret things that are known only to old men  yes kanaka oolea  and then you know hardman pool broke off the more effectively to impress and hypnotize the other ancient with the set stare of his palewashed blue eyes  they say the bones of kahekili were taken from their hidingplace and lie today in the royal mausoleum  i have heard it whispered that you alone of all living men truly know  i know was the proud answer  i alone know  well do they lie there  yes or no  kahekili was an alii high chief  it is from this straight line that your wife kalama came  she is an alii  the old retainer paused and pursed his lean lips in meditation  i belong to her as all my people before me belonged to her people before her  she only can command the great secrets of me  she is wise too wise ever to command me to speak this secret  to you o kanaka oolea i do not answer yes i do not answer no  this is a secret of the aliis that even the aliis do not know  very good kumuhana hardman pool commanded  yet do you forget that i am an alii and that what my good kalama does not dare ask i command to ask  i can send for her now and tell her to command your answer  but such would be a foolishness unless you prove yourself doubly foolish  tell me the secret and she will never know  a womans lips must pour out whatever flows in through her ears being so made  i am a man and man is differently made  as you well know my lips suck tight on secrets as a squid sucks to the salty rock  if you will not tell me alone then will you tell kalama and me together and her lips will talk her lips will talk so that the latest malahini will shortly know what otherwise you and i alone will know  long time kumuhana sat on in silence debating the argument and finding no way to evade the factlogic of it  great is your haole wisdom he conceded at last  yes or no hardman pool drove home the point of his steel  kumuhana looked about him first then slowly let his eyes come to rest on the flyflapping maid  go pool commanded her  and come not back without you hear a clapping of my hands  hardman pool spoke no further even after the flapper had disappeared into the house yet his face adamantly looked  yes or no  again kumuhana looked carefully about him and up into the monkey pod boughs as if to apprehend a lurking listener  his lips were very dry  with his tongue he moistened them repeatedly  twice he essayed to speak but was inarticulately husky  and finally with bowed head he whispered so low and solemnly that hardman pool bent his own head to hear  no  pool clapped his hands and the little maid ran out of the house to him in tremulous fluttery haste  bring a milk and gin for old kumuhana here pool commanded and to kumuhana  now tell me the whole story  wait was the answer  wait till the little wahine has come and gone  and when the maid was gone and the gin and milk had travelled the way predestined of gin and milk when mixed together hardman pool waited without further urge for the story  kumuhana pressed his hand to his chest and coughed hollowly at intervals bidding for encouragement but in the end of himself spoke out  it was a terrible thing in the old days when a great alii died kahekili was a great alii  he might have been king had he lived who can tell  i was a young man not yet married  you know kanaka oolea when kahekili died and you can tell me how old i was  he died when governor boki ran the blonde hotel here in honolulu  you have heard  i was still on windward hawaii pool answered  but i have heard  boki made a distillery and leased manoa lands to grow sugar for it and kaahumanu who was regent cancelled the lease rooted out the cane and planted potatoes  and boki was angry and prepared to make war and gathered his fighting men with a dozen whaleship deserters and five brass sixpounders out at waikiki  that was the very time kahekili died kumuhana broke in eagerly you are very wise  you know many things of the old days better than we old kanakas  it was 1829 pool continued complacently  you were twentyeight years old and i was twenty just coming ashore in the open boat after the burning of the black prince  i was twentyeight kumuhana resumed  it sounds right  i remember well bokis brass guns at waikiki  kahekili died too at the time at waikiki  the people to this day believe his bones were taken to the hale o keawe mausoleum at honaunau in kona   and long afterward were brought to the royal mausoleum here in honolulu pool supplemented  also kanaka oolea there are some who believe to this day that queen alice has them stored with the rest of her ancestral bones in the big jars in her taboo room  all are wrong  i know  the sacred bones of kahekili are gone and for ever gone  they rest nowhere  they have ceased to be  and many kona winds have whitened the surf at waikiki since the last man looked upon the last of kahekili  i alone remain alive of those men  i am the last man and i was not glad to be at the finish  for see  i was a young man and my heart was whitehot lava for malia who was in kahekilis household  so was anapunis heart whitehot for her though the colour of his heart was black as you shall see  we were at a drinking that nightanapuni and ithe night that kahekili died  anapuni and i were only commoners as were all of us kanakas and wahines who were at the drinking with the common sailors and whaleship men from before the mast  we were drinking on the mats by the beach at waikiki close to the old heiau temple that is not far from what is now the wilders beach place  i learned then and for ever what quantities of drink haole sailormen can stand  as for us kanakas our heads were hot and light and rattly as dry gourds with the whisky and the rum  it was past midnight i remember well when i saw malia whom never had i seen at a drinking come across the wethard sand of the beach  my brain burned like red cinders of hell as i looked upon anapuni look upon her he being nearest to her by being across from me in the drinking circle  oh i know it was whisky and rum and youth that made the heat of me but there in that moment the mad mind of me resolved if she spoke to him and yielded to dance with him first that i would put both my hands around his throat and throw him down and under the wahine surf there beside us and drown and choke out his life and the obstacle of him that stood between me and her  for know that she had never decided between us and it was because of him that she was not already and long since mine  she was a grand young woman with a body generous as that of a chiefess and more wonderful as she came upon us across the wet sand in the shimmer of the moonlight  even the haole sailormen made pause of silence and with open mouths stared upon her  her walk  i have heard you talk o kanaka oolea of the woman helen who caused the war of troy  i say of malia that more men would have stormed the walls of hell for her than went against that old time city of which it is your custom to talk over much and long when you have drunk too little milk and too much gin  her walk  in the moonlight there the soft glowfire of the jellyfishes in the surf like the kerosenelamp footlights i have seen in the new haole theatre  it was not the walk of a girl but a woman  she did not flutter forward like rippling wavelets on a reefsheltered placid beach  there was that in her manner of walk that was big and queenlike like the motion of the forces of nature like the rhythmic flow of lava down the slopes of kau to the sea like the movement of the huge orderly tradewind seas like the rise and fall of the four great tides of the year that may be like music in the eternal ear of god being too slow of occurrence in time to make a tune for ordinary quickpulsing briefliving swiftdying man  anapuni was nearest  but she looked at me  have you ever heard a call kanaka oolea that is without sound yet is louder than the conches of god  so called she to me across that circle of the drinking  i half arose for i was not yet full drunken but anapunis arm caught her and drew her and i sank back on my elbow and watched and raged  he was for making her sit beside him and i waited  did she sit and next dance with him i knew that ere morning anapuni would be a dead man choked and drowned by me in the shallow surf  strange is it not kanaka oolea all this heat called love yet it is not strange  it must be so in the time of ones youth else would mankind not go on  that is why the desire of woman must be greater than the desire of life pool concurred  else would there be neither men nor women  yes said kumuhana  but it is many a year now since the last of such heat has gone out of me  i remember it as one remembers an old sunrisea thing that was  and so one grows old and cold and drinks gin not for madness but for warmth  and the milk is very nourishing  but malia did not sit beside him  i remember her eyes were wild her hair down and flying as she bent over him and whispered in his ear  and her hair covered him about and hid him as she whispered and the sight of it pounded my heart against my ribs and dizzied my head till scarcely could i halfsee  and i willed myself with all the will of me that if in short minutes she did not come over to me i would go across the circle and get her  it was one of the things never to be  you remember chief konukalani  himself he strode up to the circle  his face was black with anger  he gripped malia not by the arm but by the hair and dragged her away behind him and was gone  of that even now can i understand not the half  i who was for slaying anapuni because of her raised neither hand nor voice of protest when konukalani dragged her away by the hairnor did anapuni  of course we were common men and he was a chief  that i know  but why should two common men mad with desire of woman with desire of woman stronger in them than desire of life let any one chief even the highest in the land drag the woman away by the hair  desiring her more than life why should the two men fear to slay then and immediately the one chief  here is something stronger than life stronger than woman but what is it and why  i will answer you said hardman pool  it is so because most men are fools and therefore must be taken care of by the few men who are wise  such is the secret of chiefship  in all the world are chiefs over men  in all the world that has been have there ever been chiefs who must say to the many fool men  do this do not do that  work and work as we tell you or your bellies will remain empty and you will perish  obey the laws we set you or you will be beasts and without place in the world  you would not have been save for the chiefs before you who ordered and regulated for your fathers  no seed of you will come after you except that we order and regulate for you now  you must be peaceabiding and decent and blow your noses  you must be early to bed of nights and up early in the morning to work if you would heave beds to sleep in and not roost in trees like the silly fowls  this is the season for the yamplanting and you must plant now  we say now today and not picnicking and hulaing today and yamplanting tomorrow or some other day of the many careless days  you must not kill one another and you must leave your neighbours wives alone  all this is life for you because you think but one day at a time while we your chiefs think for you all days and for days ahead  like a cloud on the mountaintop that comes down and wraps about you and that you dimly see is a cloud so is your wisdom to me kanaka oolea kumuhana murmured  yet is it sad that i should be born a common man and live all my days a common man  that is because you were of yourself common hardman pool assured him  when a man is born common and is by nature uncommon he rises up and overthrows the chiefs and makes himself chief over the chiefs  why do you not run my ranch with its many thousands of cattle and shift the pastures by the rainfall and pick the bulls and arrange the bargaining and the selling of the meat to the sailing ships and war vessels and the people who live in the honolulu houses and fight with lawyers and help make laws and even tell the king what is wise for him to do and what is dangerous  why does not any man do this that i do  any man of all the men who work for me feed out of my hand and let me do their thinking for themme who work harder than any of them who eats no more than any of them and who can sleep on no more than one lauhala mat at a time like any of them  i am out of the cloud kanaka oolea said kumuhana with a visible brightening of countenance  more clearly do i see  all my long years have the aliis i was born under thought for me ever when i was hungry i came to them for food as i come to your kitchen now  many people eat in your kitchen and the days of feasts when you slay fat steers for all of us are understandable it is why i come to you this day an old man whose labour of strength is not worth a shilling a week and ask of you twelve dollars to buy a jackass and a secondhand saddle and bridle  it is why twice ten fool men of us under these monkeypods half an hour ago asked of you a dollar or two or four or five or ten or twelve  we are the careless ones of the careless days who will not plant the yam in season if our alii does not compel us who will not think one day for ourselves and who when we age to worthlessness know that our alii will think kowkow into our bellies and a grass thatch over our heads  hardman pool bowed his appreciation and urged  but the bones of kahekili  the chief konukalani had just dragged away malia by the hair of the head and you and anapuni sat on without protest in the circle of drinking  what was it malia whispered in anapunis ear bending over him her hair hiding the face of him  that kahekili was dead  that was what she whispered to anapuni that kahekili was dead just dead and that the chiefs ordering all within the house to remain within were debating the disposal of the bones and meat of him before word of his death should get abroad  that the high priest eoppo was deciding them and that she had overheard no less than anapuni and me chosen as the sacrifices to go the way of kahekili and his bones and to care for him afterward and for ever in the shadowy other world  the moepuu the human sacrifice pool commented  yet it was nine years since the coming of the missionaries  and it was the year before their coming that the idols were cast down and the taboos broken kumuhana added  but the chiefs still practised the old ways the custom of hunakele and hid the bones of the aliis where no men should find them and make fishhooks of their jaws or arrow heads of their long bones for the slaying of little mice in sport  behold o kanaka oolea  the old man thrust out his tongue and to pools amazement he saw the surface of that sensitive organ from root to tip tattooed in intricate designs  that was done after the missionaries came several years afterward when keopuolani died  also did i knock out four of my front teeth and halfcircles did i burn over my body with blazing bark  and whoever ventured outofdoors that night was slain by the chiefs  nor could a light be shown in a house or a whisper of noise be made  even dogs and hogs that made a noise were slain nor all that night were the ships bells of the haoles in the harbour allowed to strike  it was a terrible thing in those days when an alii died  but the night that kahekili died  we sat on in the drinking circle after konukalani dragged malia away by the hair  some of the haole sailors grumbled but they were few in the land in those days and the kanakas many  and never was malia seen of men again konukalani alone knew the manner of her slaying and he never told and in after years what common men like anapuni and me should dare to question him  now she had told anapuni before she was dragged away  but anapunis heart was black  me he did not tell  worthy he was of the killing i had intended for him  there was a giant harpooner in the circle whose singing was like the bellowing of bulls and gazing on him in amazement while he roared some song of the sea when next i looked across the circle to anapuni anapuni was gone he had fled to the high mountains where he could hide with the birdcatchers a week of moons  this i learned afterward  i  i sat on ashamed of my desire of woman that had not been so strong as my slaveobedience to a chief  and i drowned my shame in large drinks of rum and whisky till the world went round and round inside my head and out and the southern cross danced a hula in the sky and the koolau mountains bowed their lofty summits to waikiki and the surf of waikiki kissed them on their brows  and the giant harpooner was still roaring his the last sounds in my ear as i fell back on the lauhala mat and was to all things for the time as one dead  when i awoke was at the faint first beginning of dawn  i was being kicked by a hard naked heel in the ribs  what of the enormousness of the drink i had consumed the feelings aroused in me by the heel were not pleasant  the kanakas and wahines of the drinking were gone  i alone remained among the sleeping sailormen the giant harpooner snoring like a whale his head upon my feet  more heelkicks and i sat up and was sick  but the one who kicked was impatient and demanded to know where was anapuni  and i did not know and was kicked this time from both sides by two impatient men because i did not know  nor did i know that kahekili was dead  yet did i guess something serious was afoot for the two men who kicked me were chiefs and no common men crouched behind them to do their bidding  one was aimoku of kaneche the other humuhumu of manoa  they commanded me to go with them and they were not kind in their commanding and as i uprose the head of the giant harpooner was rolled off my feet past the edge of the mat into the sand  he grunted like a pig his lips opened and all of his tongue rolled out of his mouth into the sand  nor did he draw it back  for the first time i knew how long was a mans tongue  the sight of the sand on it made me sick for the second time  it is a terrible thing the next day after a night of drinking  i was afire dry afire all the inside of me like a burnt cinder like aa lava like the harpooners tongue dry and gritty with sand  i bent for a halfdrunk drinking coconut but aimoku kicked it out of my shaking fingers and humuhumu smote me with the heel of his hand on my neck  they walked before me side by side their faces solemn and black and i walked at their heels  my mouth stank of the drink and my head was sick with the stale fumes of it and i would have cut off my right hand for a drink of water one drink a mouthful even and had i had it i know it would have sizzled in my belly like water spilled on heated stones for the roasting  it is terrible the next day after the drinking  all the lifetime of many men who died young has passed by me since the last i was able to do such mad drinking of youth when youth knows not capacity and is undeterred  but as we went on i began to know that some alii was dead  no kanakas lay asleep in the sand nor stole home from their love making and no canoes were abroad after the early fish most catchable then inside the reef at the change of the tide  when we came past the hoiau temple to where the great kamehameha used to haul out his brigs and schooners i saw under the canoesheds that the matthatches of kahekilis great double canoe had been taken off and that even then at low tide many men were launching it down across the sand into the water  but all these men were chiefs  and though my eyes swam and the inside of my head went around and around and the inside of my body was a cinder athirst i guessed that the alii who was dead was kahekili  for he was old and most likely of the aliis to be dead  it was his death as i have heard it more than the intercession of kekuanaoa that spoiled governor bokis rebellion hardman pool observed  it was kahekilis death that spoiled it kumuhana confirmed all commoners when the word slipped out that night of his death fled into the shelter of the grass houses nor lighted fire nor pipes nor breathed loudly being therein and thereby taboo from use for sacrifice  and all governor bokis commoners of fighting men as well as the haole deserters from ships so fled so that the brass guns lay unserved and his handful of chiefs of themselves could do nothing  aimoku and humuhumu made me sit on the sand to the side from the launching of the great doublecanoe  and when it was afloat all the chiefs were athirst not being used to such toil and i was told to climb the palms beside the canoesheds and throw down drinkcoconuts  they drank and were refreshed but me they refused to let drink  then they bore kahekili from his house to the canoe in a haole coffin oiled and varnished and new  it had been made by a ships carpenter who thought he was making a boat that must not leak  it was very tight and over where the face of kahekili lay was nothing but thin glass  the chiefs had not screwed on the outside plank to cover the glass  maybe they did not know the manner of haole coffins but at any rate i was to be glad they did not know as you shall see  there is but one moepuu said the priest eoppo looking at me where i sat on the coffin in the bottom of the canoe  already the chiefs were paddling out through the reef  the other has run into hiding aimoku answered  this one was all we could get  and then i knew  i knew everything  i was to be sacrificed anapuni had been planned for the other sacrifice  that was what malia had whispered to anapuni at the drinking  and she had been dragged away before she could tell me  and in his blackness of heart he had not told me  there should be two said eoppo  it is the law  aimoku stopped paddling and looked back shoreward as if to return and get a second sacrifice  but several of the chiefs contended no saying that all commoners were fled to the mountains or were lying taboo in their houses and that it might take days before they could catch one  in the end eoppo gave in though he grumbled from time to time that the law required two moepuus  we paddled on past diamond head and abreast of koko head till we were in the midway of the molokai channel  there was quite a sea running though the trade wind was blowing light  the chiefs rested from their paddles save for the steersmen who kept the canoes bowon to the wind and swell  and ere they proceeded further in the matter they opened more coconuts and drank  i do not mind so much being the moepuu i said to humuhumu but i should like to have a drink before i am slain  i got no drink but i spoke true  i was too sick of the much whisky and rum to be afraid to die  at least my mouth would stink no more nor my head ache nor the inside of me be as dryhot sand  almost worst of all i suffered at thought of the harpooners tongue as last i had seen it lying on the sand and covered with sand  o kanaka oolea what animals young men are with the drink  not until they have grown old like you and me do they control their wantonness of thirst and drink sparingly like you and me  because we have to hardman pool rejoined  old stomachs are worn thin and tender and we drink sparingly because we dare not drink more  we are wise but the wisdom is bitter  the priest eoppo sang a long mele about kahekilis mother and his mothers mother and all their mothers all the way back to the beginning of time kumuhana resumed  and it seemed i must die of my sandhot dryness ere he was done  and he called upon all the gods of the under world the middle world and the over world to care for and cherish the dead alii about to be consigned to them and to carry out the cursesthey were terrible curseshe laid upon all living men and men to live after who might tamper with the bones of kahekili to use them in sport of verminslaying  do you know kanaka oolea the priest talked a language largely different and i know it was the priest language the old language maui he did not name maui but mauitikitiki and mauipotiki and hina the goddessmother of maui he named ina  and mauis godfather he named sometimes akalana and sometimes kanaloa strange how one about to die and very thirsty should remember such things  and i remember the priest named hawaii as vaii and lanai as ngangai  those were the maori names hardman pool explained and the samoan and tongan names that the priests brought with them in their first voyages from the south in the long ago when they found hawaii and settled to dwell upon it  great is your wisdom o kanaka oolea the old man accorded solemnly  ku our supporter of the heavens the priest named tu and also ru and la our god of the sun he named ra  and ra was a sungod in egypt in the long ago pool interrupted with a sparkle of interest  truly you polynesians have travelled far in time and space since first you began  a far cry it is from old egypt when atlantis was still afloat to young hawaii in the north pacific  but proceed kumuhana  do you remember anything also of what the priest eoppo sang  at the very end came the confirming nod though i was near dead myself and nearer to die under the priests knife he sang what i have remembered every word of  listen  it was thus  and in quavering falsetto with the customary brokennotes the old man sang  a maori deathchant unmistakable pool exclaimed sung by an hawaiian with a tattooed tongue  repeat it once again and i shall say it to you in english  and when it had been repeated he spoke it slowly in english   but death is nothing new death is and has been ever since old maui died then patatai laughed loud and woke the goblingod who severed him in two and shut him in so dusk of eve came on   and at the last kumuhana resumed i was not slain  eoppo the killing knife in hand and ready to lift for the blow did not lift and i  how did i feel and think  often kanaka oolea have i since laughed at the memory of it  i felt very thirsty  i did not want to die  i wanted a drink of water  i knew i was going to die and i kept remembering the thousand waterfalls falling to waste down the pans precipices of the windward koolau mountains  i did not think of anapuni  i was too thirsty  i did not think of malia  i was too thirsty  but continually inside my head i saw the tongue of the harpooner covered dry with sand as i had last seen it lying in the sand  my tongue was like that too  and in the bottom of the canoe rolled about many drinking nuts  yet i did not attempt to drink for these were chiefs and i was a common man  no said eoppo commanding the chiefs to throw overboard the coffin  there are not two moepuus therefore there shall be none  slay the one the chiefs cried  but eoppo shook his head and said  we cannot send kahekili on his way with only the tops of the taro  half a fish is better than none aimoku said the old saying  not at the burying of an alii was the priests quick reply it is the law  we cannot be niggard with kahekili and cut his allotment of sacrifice in half  so for the moment while the coffin went overside i was not slain  and it was strange that i was glad immediately that i was to live  and i began to remember malia and to begin to plot a vengeance on anapuni  and with the blood of life thus freshening in me my thirst multiplied on itself tenfold and my tongue and mouth and throat seemed as sanded as the tongue of the harpooner the coffin being overboard i was sitting in the bottom of the canoe  a coconut rolled between my legs and i closed them on it but as i picked it up in my hand aimoku smote my hand with the paddleedge  behold  he held up the hand showing two fingers crooked from never having been set  i had no time to vex over my pain for worse things were upon me all the chiefs were crying out in horror  the coffin headend up had not sunk  it bobbed up and down in the sea astern of us  and the canoe without way on it bowon to sea and wind was drifted down by sea and wind upon the coffin  and the glass of it was to us so that we could see the face and head of kahekili through the glass and he grinned at us through the glass and seemed alive already in the other world and angry with us and with otherworld power about to wreak his anger upon us  up and down he bobbed and the canoe drifted closer upon him  kill him  bleed him  thrust to the heart of him  these things the chiefs were crying out to eoppo in their fear  over with the taro tops  let the alii have the half of a fish  eoppo priest though he was was likewise afraid and his reason weakened before the sight of kahekili in his haole coffin that would not sink  he seized me by the hair drew me to my feet and lifted the knife to plunge to my heart  and there was no resistance in me  i knew again only that i was very thirsty and before my swimming eyes in midair and close up dangled the sanded tongue of the harpooner  but before the knife could fall and drive in the thing happened that saved me  akai halfbrother to governor boki as you will remember was steersman of the canoe and therefore in the stern was nearest to the coffin and its dead that would not sink  he was wild with fear and he thrust out with the point of his paddle to fend off the coffined alii that seemed bent to come on board  the point of the paddle struck the glass  the glass broke  and the coffin immediately sank hardman pool broke in the air that floated it escaping through the broken glass  the coffin immediately sank being builded by the ships carpenter like a boat kumuhana confirmed  and i who was a moepuu became a man once more  and i lived though i died a thousand deaths from thirst before we gained back to the beach at waikiki  and so o kanaka oolea the bones of kahekili do not lie in the royal mausoleum  they are at the bottom of molokai channel if not long since they have become floating dust of slime or builded into the bodies of the coral creatures dead and gone are builded into the coral reef itself  of men i am the one living who saw the bones of kahekili sink into the molokai channel  in the pause that followed wherein hardman pool was deep sunk in meditation kumuhana licked his dry lips many times  at the last he broke silence  the twelve dollars kanaka oolea for the jackass and the second hand saddle and bridle  the twelve dollars would be thine pool responded passing to the ancient one six dollars and a half save that i have in my stable junk the very bridle and saddle for you which i shall give you these six dollars and a half will buy you the perfectly suitable jackass of the pake chinese at kokako who told me only yesterday that such was the price  they sat on pool meditating conning over and over to himself the maori deathchant he had heard and especially the line so dusk of eve came on finding in it an intense satisfaction of beauty kumuhana licking his lips and tokening that he waited for something more  at last he broke silence  i have talked long o kanaka oolea  there is not the enduring moistness in my mouth that was when i was young  it seems that afresh upon me is the thirst that was mine when tormented by the visioned tongue of the harpooner  the gin and milk is very good o kanaka oolea for a tongue that is like the harpooners  a shadow of a smile flickered across pools face  he clapped his hands and the little maid came running  bring one glass of gin and milk for old kumuhana commanded hardman pool  waikiki honolulu june 28 1916    when alice told her soul    this of alice akana is an affair of hawaii not of this day but of days recent enough when abel ah yo preached his famous revival in honolulu and persuaded alice akana to tell her soul  but what alice told concerned itself with the earlier history of the then surviving generation  for alice akana was fifty years old had begun life early and early and late lived it spaciously  what she knew went back into the roots and foundations of families businesses and plantations she was the one living repository of accurate information that lawyers sought out whether the information they required related to landboundaries and land gifts or to marriages births bequests or scandals  rarely because of the tight tongue she kept behind her teeth did she give them what they asked and when she did was when only equity was served and no one was hurt  for alice had lived from early in her girlhood a life of flowers and song and wine and dance and in her later years had herself been mistress of these revels by office of mistress of the hula house  in such atmosphere where mandates of god and man and caution are inhibited and where woozled tongues will wag she acquired her historical knowledge of things never otherwise whispered and rarely guessed  and her tight tongue had served her well so that while the oldtimers knew she must know none ever heard her gossip of the times of kalakauas boathouse nor of the high times of officers of visiting warships nor of the diplomats and ministers and councils of the countries of the world  so at fifty loaded with historical dynamite sufficient if it were ever exploded to shake the social and commercial life of the islands still tight of tongue alice akana was mistress of the hula house manageress of the dancing girls who hulad for royalty for luaus feasts houseparties poi suppers and curious tourists  and at fifty she was not merely buxom but short and fat in the polynesian peasant way with a constitution and lack of organic weakness that promised incalculable years  but it was at fifty that she strayed quite by chance of time and curiosity into abel ah yos revival meeting  now abel ah yo in his theology and word wizardry was as much mixed a personage as billy sunday  in his genealogy he was much more mixed for he was compounded of onefourth portuguese one fourth scotch onefourth hawaiian and onefourth chinese  the pentecostal fire he flamed forth was hotter and more variegated than could any one of the four races of him alone have flamed forth  for in him were gathered together the cannyness and the cunning the wit and the wisdom the subtlety and the rawness the passion and the philosophy the agonizing spiritgroping and he legs up to the knees in the dung of reality of the four radically different breeds that contributed to the sum of him  his also was the clever selfdeceivement of the entire clever compound  when it came to word wizardry he had billy sunday master of slang and argot of one language skinned by miles  for in abel ah yo were the five verbs and nouns and adjectives and metaphors of four living languages  intermixed and living promiscuously and vitally together he possessed in these languages a reservoir of expression in which a myriad billy sundays could drown  of no race a mongrel par excellence a heterogeneous scrabble the genius of the admixture was superlatively abel ah yos  like a chameleon he titubated and scintillated grandly between the diverse parts of him stunning by frontal attack and surprising and confouding by flanking sweeps the mental homogeneity of the more simply constituted souls who came in to his revival to sit under him and flame to his flaming  abel ah yo believed in himself and his mixedness as he believed in the mixedness of his weird concept that god looked as much like him as like any man being no mere tribal god but a world god that must look equally like all races of all the world even if it led to piebaldness  and the concept worked  chinese korean japanese hawaiian porto rican russian english frenchmembers of all racesknelt without friction side by side to his revision of deity  himself in his tender youth an apostate to the church of england abel ah yo had for years suffered the lively sense of being a judas sinner  essentially religious he had foresworn the lord  like judas therefore he was  judas was damned  wherefore he abel ah yo was damned and he did not want to be damned  so quite after the manner of humans he squirmed and twisted to escape damnation the day came when he solved his escape  the doctrine that judas was damned he concluded was a misinterpretation of god who above all things stood for justice  judas had been gods servant specially selected to perform a particularly nasty job  therefore judas ever faithful a betrayer only by divine command was a saint  ergo he abel ah yo was a saint by very virtue of his apostasy to a particular sect and he could have access with clear grace any time to god  this theory became one of the major tenets of his preaching and was especially efficacious in cleansing the consciences of the backsliders from all other faiths who else in the secrecy of their subconscious selves were being crushed by the weight of the judas sin  to abel ah yo gods plan was as clear as if he abel ah yo had planned it himself  all would be saved in the end although some took longer than others and would win only to backseats  mans place in the everfluxing chaos of the world was definite and preordainedif by no other token then by denial that there was any everfluxing chaos  this was a mere bugbear of mankinds addled fancy and by stinging audacities of thought and speech by vivid slang that bit home by sheerest intimacy into his listeners mental processes he drove the bugbear from their brains showed them the loving clarity of gods design and thereby induced in them spiritual serenity and calm  what chance had alice akana herself pure and homogeneous hawaiian against his subtle democratictinged fourraceengendered slang munitioned attack  he knew by contact almost as much as she about the waywardness of living and sinninghaving been singing boy on the passengerships between hawaii and california and after that bar boy afloat and ashore from the barbary coast to heinies tavern  in point of fact he had left his job of number one bar boy at the university club to embark on his great preachment revival  so when alice akana strayed in to scoff she remained to pray to abel ah yos god who struck her hardheaded mind as the most sensible god of which she had ever heard  she gave money into abel ah yos collection plate closed up the hula house and dismissed the hula dancers to more devious ways of earning a livelihood shed her bright colours and raiments and flower garlands and bought a bible  it was a time of religious excitement in the purlieus of honolulu the thing was a democratic movement of the people toward god place and caste were invited but never came  the stupid lowly and the humble lowly only went down on its knees at the penitent form admitted its pathological weight and hurt of sin eliminated and purged all its bafflements and walked forth again upright under the sun childlike and pure upborne by abel ah yos gods arm around it  in short abel ah yos revival was a clearing house for sin and sickness of spirit wherein sinners were relieved of their burdens and made light and bright and spiritually healthy again  but alice was not happy  she had not been cleared  she bought and dispersed bibles contributed more money to the plate contraltod gloriously in all the hymns but would not tell her soul  in vain abel ah yo wrestled with her  she would not go down on her knees at the penitent form and voice the things of tarnish within her the ill things of good friends of the old days  you cannot serve two masters abel ah yo told her  hell is full of those who have tried  single of heart and pure of heart must you make your peace with god  not until you tell your soul to god right out in meeting will you be ready for redemption  in the meantime you will suffer the canker of the sin you carry about within you  scientifically though he did not know it and though he continually jeered at science abel ah yo was right  not could she be again as a child and become radiantly clad in gods grace until she had eliminated from her soul by telling all the sophistications that had been hers including those she shared with others  in the protestant way she must bare her soul in public as in the catholic way it was done in the privacy of the confessional  the result of such baring would be unity tranquillity happiness cleansing redemption and immortal life  choose  abel ah yo thundered  loyalty to god or loyalty to man  and alice could not choose  too long had she kept her tongue locked with the honour of man  i will tell all my soul about myself she contended  god knows i am tired of my soul and should like to have it clean and shining once again as when i was a little girl at kaneohe  but all the corruption of your soul has been with other souls was abel ah yos invariable reply  when you have a burden lay it down  you cannot bear a burden and be quit of it at the same time  i will pray to god each day and many times each day she urged i will approach god with humility with sighs and with tears  i will contribute often to the plate and i will buy bibles bibles bibles without end  and god will not smile upon you gods mouthpiece retorted  and you will remain weary and heavyladen  for you will not have told all your sin and not until you have told all will you be rid of any  this rebirth is difficult alice sighed  rebirth is even more difficult than birth  abel ah yo did anything but comfort her  not until you become as a little child      if ever i tell my soul it will be a big telling she confided  the bigger the reason to tell it then  and so the situation remained at deadlock abel ah yo demanding absolute allegiance to god and alice akana flirting on the fringes of paradise  you bet it will be a big telling if alice ever begins the beachcombing and disreputable kamaainas oldtimers gleefully told one another over their palm tree gin  in the clubs the possibility of her telling was of more moment the younger generation of men announced that they had applied for front seats at the telling while many of the older generation of men joked hollowly about the conversion of alice  further alice found herself abruptly popular with friends who had forgotten her existence for twenty years  one afternoon as alice bible in hand was taking the electric street car at hotel and fort cyrus hodge sugar factor and magnate ordered his chauffeur to stop beside her  willy nilly in excess of friendliness he had her into his limousine beside him and went threequarters of an hour out of his way and time personally to conduct her to her destination  good for sore eyes to see you he burbled  how the years fly youre looking fine  the secret of youth is yours  alice smiled and complimented in return in the royal polynesian way of friendliness  my my cyrus hodge reminisced  i was such a boy in those days  some boy she laughed acquiescence  but knowing no more than the foolishness of a boy in those long ago days  remember the night your hackdriver got drunk and left you  sssh he cautioned  that jap driver is a highschool graduate and knows more english than either of us  also i think he is a spy for his government  so why should we tell him anything besides i was so very young  you remember      your cheeks were like the peaches we used to grow before the mediterranean fruit fly got into them alice agreed  i dont think you shaved more than once a week then  you were a pretty boy  dont you remember the hula we composed in your honour the   sssh he hushed her  all thats buried and forgotten  may it remain forgotten  and she was aware that in his eyes was no longer any of the ingenuousness of youth she remembered  instead his eyes were keen and speculative searching into her for some assurance that she would not resurrect his particular portion of that buried past  religion is a good thing for us as we get along into middle age another old friend told her  he was building a magnificent house on pacific heights but had recently married a second time and was even then on his way to the steamer to welcome home his two daughters just graduated from vassar  we need religion in our old age alice  it softens makes us more tolerant and forgiving of the weaknesses of othersespecially the weaknesses of youth ofof others when they played high and low and didnt know what they were doing  he waited anxiously  yes she said  we are all born to sin and it is hard to grow out of sin  but i grow i grow  dont forget alice in those other days i always played square you and i never had a falling out  not even the night you gave that luau when you were twentyone and insisted on breaking the glassware after every toast  but of course you paid for it  handsomely he asserted almost pleadingly  handsomely she agreed  i replaced more than double the quantity with what you paid me so that at the next luau i catered one hundred and twenty plates without having to rent or borrow a dish or glass  lord mainweather gave that luauyou remember him  i was pigsticking with him at mana the other nodded  we were at a two weeks houseparty there  but say alice as you know i think this religion stuff is all right and better than all right but dont let it carry you off your feet  and dont get to telling your soul on me  what would my daughters think of that broken glassware  i always did have an aloha warm regard for you alice a member of the senate fat and baldheaded assured her  and another a lawyer and a grandfather  we were always friends alice  and remember any legal advice or handling of business you may require ill do for you gladly and without fees for the sake of our oldtime friendship  came a banker to her late christmas eve with formidable legal looking envelopes in his hand which he presented to her  quite by chance he explained when my people were looking up landrecords in iapio valley i found a mortgage of two thousand on your holdings therethat rice land leased to ah chin  and my mind drifted back to the past when we were all young together and wild a bit wild to be sure  and my heart warmed with the memory of you and so just as an aloha heres the whole thing cleared off for you  nor was alice forgotten by her own people  her house became a mecca for native men and women usually performing pilgrimage privily after darkness fell with presents always in their hands squid fresh from the reef opihis and limu baskets of alligator pears roasting corn of the earliest from windward cahu mangoes and starapples taro pink and royal of the finest selection sucking pigs banana poi breadfruit and crabs caught the very day from pearl harbour  mary mendana wife of the portuguese consul remembered her with a fivedollar box of candy and a mandarin coat that would have fetched threequarters of a hundred dollars at a fire sale  and elvira miyahara makaena yin wap the wife of yin wap the wealthy chinese importer brought personally to alice two entire bolts of pina cloth from the philippines and a dozen pairs of silk stockings  the time passed and abel ah yo struggled with alice for a properly penitent heart and alice struggled with herself for her soul while half of honolulu wickedly or apprehensively hung on the outcome  carnival week was over polo and the races had come and gone and the celebration of fourth of july was ripening ere abel ah yo beat down by brutal psychology the citadel of her reluctance it was then that he gave his famous exhortation which might be summed up as abel ah yos definition of eternity  of course like billy sunday on certain occasions abel ah yo had cribbed the definition  but no one in the islands knew it and his rating as a revivalist uprose a hundred per cent  so successful was his preaching that night that he reconverted many of his converts who fell and moaned about the penitent form and crowded for room amongst scores of new converts burnt by the pentecostal fire including half a company of negro soldiers from the garrisoned twentyfifth infantry a dozen troopers from the fourth cavalry on its way to the philippines as many drunken man ofwars men divers ladies from iwilei and half the riffraff of the beach  abel ah yo subtly sympathetic himself by virtue of his racial admixture knowing human nature like a book and alice akana even more so knew just what he was doing when he arose that memorable night and exposited god hell and eternity in terms of alice akanas comprehension  for quite by chance he had discovered her cardinal weakness  first of all like all polynesians an ardent lover of nature he found that earthquake and volcanic eruption were the things of which alice lived in terror  she had been in the past on the big island through cataclysms that had slacken grass houses down upon her while she slept and she had beheld madame pele the fire or volcano goddess fling redfluxing lava down the long slopes of mauna loa destroying fishponds on the seabrim and licking up droves of beef cattle villages and humans on her fiery way  the night before a slight earthquake had shaken honolulu and given alice akana insomnia  and the morning papers had stated that mauna kea had broken into eruption while the lava was rising rapidly in the great pit of kilauea  so at the meeting her mind vexed between the terrors of this world and the delights of the eternal world to come alice sat down in a front seat in a very definite state of the jumps  and abel ah yo arose and put his finger on the sorest part of her soul  sketching the nature of god in the stereotyped way but making the stereotyped alive again with his gift of tongues in pidginenglish and pidginhawaiian abel ah yo described the day when the lord even his infinite patience at an end would tell peter to close his day book and ledgers command gabriel to summon all souls to judgment and cry out with a voice of thunder welakahao  this anthromorphic deity of abel ah yo thundering the modern hawaiianenglish slang of welakahao at the end of the world is a fair sample of the revivalists speechtools of discourse welakahao means literally hot iron  it was coined in the honolulu ironworks by the hundreds of hawaiian men there employed who meant by it to hustle to get a move on the iron being hot meaning that the time had come to strike  and the lord cried welakahao and the day of judgment began and was over wikiwiki quickly just like that for peter was a better bookkeeper than any on the waterhouse trust company limited and further peters books were true  swiftly abel ah yo divided the sheep from the goats and hastened the latter down into hell  and now he demanded perforce his language on these pages being properly englished what is hell like  oh my friends let me describe to you in a little way what i have beheld with my own eves on earth of the possibilities of hell  i was a young man a boy and i was at hilo  morning began with earthquakes throughout the day the mighty land continued to shake and tremble till strong men became seasick and women clung to trees to escape falling and cattle were thrown down off their feet  i beheld myself a young calf so thrown  a night of terror indescribable followed  the land was in motion like a canoe in a kona gale there was an infant crushed to death by its fond mother stepping upon it whilst fleeing her falling house  the heavens were on fire above us  we read our bibles by the light of the heavens and the print was fine even for young eyes those missionary bibles were always too small of print  forty miles away from us the heart of hell burst from the lofty mountains and gushed redblood of firemelted rock toward the sea with the heavens in vast conflagration and the earth hulaing beneath our feet was a scene too awful and too majestic to be enjoyed  we could think only of the thin bubbleskin of earth between us and the everlasting lake of fire and brimstone and of god to whom we prayed to save us  there were earnest and devout souls who there and then promised their pastors to give not their shaved tithes but fivetenths of their all to the church if only the lord would let them live to contribute  oh my friends god saved us  but first he showed us a foretaste of that hell that will yawn for us on the last day when he cries welakahao in a voice of thunder  when the iron is hot  think of it  when the iron is hot for sinners  by the third day things being much quieter my friend the preacher and i being calm in the hand of god journeyed up mauna loa and gazed into the awful pit of kilauea  we gazed down into the fathomless abyss to the lake of fire far below roaring and dashing its fiery spray into billows and fountaining hundreds of feet into the air like fourth of july fireworks you have all seen and all the while we were suffocating and made dizzy by the immense volumes of smoke and brimstone ascending  and i say unto you no pious person could gaze down upon that scene without recognizing fully the bible picture of the pit of hell  believe me the writers of the new testament had nothing on us  as for me my eyes were fixed upon the exhibition before me and i stood mute and trembling under a sense never before so fully realized of the power the majesty and terror of almighty godthe resources of his wrath and the untold horrors of the finally impenitent who do not tell their souls and make their peace with the creator 1  but oh my friends think you our guides our native attendants deepsunk in heathenism were affected by such a scene  no  the devils hand was upon them  utterly regardless and unimpressed they were only careful about their supper chatted about their raw fish and stretched themselves upon their mats to sleep  children of the devil they were insensible to the beauties the sublimities and the awful terror of gods works  but you are not heathen i now address  what is a heathen  he is one who betrays a stupid insensibility to every elevated idea and to every elevated emotion  if you wish to awaken his attention do not bid him to look down into the pit of hell  but present him with a calabash of poi a raw fish or invite him to some low grovelling and sensuous sport  oh my friends how lost are they to all that elevates the immortal soul  but the preacher and i sad and sick at heart for them gazed down into hell  oh my friends it was hell the hell of the scriptures the hell of eternal torment for the undeserving      alice akana was in an ecstasy or hysteria of terror  she was mumbling incoherently  o lord i will give ninetenths of my all i will give all  i will give even the two bolts of pina cloth the mandarin coat and the entire dozen silk stockings      by the time she could lend ear again abel ah yo was launching out on his famous definition of eternity  eternity is a long time my friends  god lives and therefore god lives inside eternity  and god is very old  the fires of hell are as old and as everlasting as god  how else could there be everlasting torment for those sinners cast down by god into the pit on the last day to burn for ever and for ever through all eternity oh my friends your minds are smalltoo small to grasp eternity yet is it given to me by gods grace to convey to you an understanding of a tiny bit of eternity  the grains of sand on the beach of waikiki are as many as the stars and more  no man may count them  did he have a million lives in which to count them he would have to ask for more time now let us consider a little dinky old minah bird with one broken wing that cannot fly  at waikiki the minah bird that cannot fly takes one grain of sand in its beak and hops hops all day lone and for many days all the day to pearl harbour and drops that one grain of sand into the harbour  then it hops hops all day and for many days all the way back to waikiki for another grain of sand  and again it hops hops all the way back to pearl harbour and it continues to do this through the years and centuries and the thousands and thousands of centuries until at last there remains not one grain of sand at waikiki and pearl harbour is filled up with land and growing coconuts and pineapples  and then oh my friends even then it would not yet be sunrise in hell  here at the smashing impact of so abrupt a climax unable to withstand the sheer simplicity and objectivity of such artful measurement of a trifle of eternity alice akanas mind broke down and blew up  she uprose reeled blindly and stumbled to her knees at the penitent form  abel ah yo had not finished his preaching but it was his gift to know crowd psychology and to feel the heat of the pentecostal conflagration that scorched his audience  he called for a rousing revival hymn from his singers and stepped down to wade among the hallelujahshouting negro soldiers to alice akana  and ere the excitement began to ebb ninetenths of his congregation and all his converts were down on knees and praying and shouting aloud an immensity of contriteness and sin   word came via telephone almost simultaneously to the pacific and university clubs that at last alice was telling her soul in meeting and by private machine and taxicab for the first time abel ah yos revival was invaded by those of caste and place  the first comers beheld the curious sight of hawaiian chinese and all variegated racial mixtures of the smeltingpot of hawaii men and women fading out and slinking away through the exits of abel ah yos tabernacle  but those who were sneaking out were mostly men while those who remained were avidfaced as they hung on alices utterance  never was a more fearful and damning community narrative enunciated in the entire pacific north and south than that enunciated by alice akana the penitent phryne of honolulu  huh the first comers heard her saying having already disposed of most of the venial sins of the lesser ones of her memory  you think this man stephen makekau is the son of moses makekau and minnie ah ling and has a legal right to the two hundred and eight dollars he draws down each month from parke richards limited for the lease of the fishpond to bill kong at amana  not so  stephen makekau is not the son of moses  he is the son of aaron kama and tillie naone  he was given as a present as a feeding child to moses and minnie by aaron and tillie  i know  moses and minnie and aaron and tillie are dead  yet i know and can prove it  old mrs poepoe is still alive  i was present when stephen was born and in the nighttime when he was two months old i myself carried him as a present to moses and minnie and old mrs poepoe carried the lantern  this secret has been one of my sins  it has kept me from god  now i am free of it  young archie makekau who collects bills for the gas company and plays baseball in the afternoons and drinks too much gin should get that two hundred and eight dollars the first of each month from parke richards limited  he will blow it in on gin and a ford automobile  stephen is a good man  archie is no good  also he is a liar and he has served two sentences on the reef and was in reform school before that  yet god demands the truth and archie will get the money and make a bad use of it  and in such fashion alice rambled on through the experiences of her long and fullpacked life  and women forgot they were in the tabernacle and men too and faces darkened with passion as they learned for the first time the longburied secrets of their other halves  the lawyers offices will be crowded tomorrow morning macilwaine chief of detectives paused long enough from storing away useful information to lean and mutter in colonel stiltons ear  colonel stilton grinned affirmation although the chief of detectives could not fail to note the ghastliness of the grin  there is a banker in honolulu  you all know his name  he is way up swell society because of his wife  he owns much stock in general plantations and interisland  macilwaine recognized the growing portrait and forbore to chuckle  his name is colonel stilton  last christmas eve he came to my house with big aloha love and gave me mortgages on my land in iapio valley all cancelled for two thousand dollars worth  now why did he have such big cash aloha for me  i will tell you      and tell she did throwing the searchlight on ancient business transactions and political deals which from their inception had lurked in the dark  this alice concluded the episode has long been a sin upon my conscience and kept my heart from god  and harold miles was that time president of the senate and next week he bought three town lots at pearl harbour and painted his honolulu house and paid up his back dues in his clubs  also the ramsay home at honokiki was left by will to the people if the government would keep it up  but if the government after two years did not begin to keep it up then would it go to the ramsay heirs whom old ramsay hated like poison  well it went to the heirs all right  their lawyer was charley middleton and he had me help fix it with the government men  and their names were     six names from both branches of the legislature alice recited and added  maybe they all painted their houses after that  for the first time have i spoken  my heart is much lighter and softer it has been coated with an armour of housepaint against the lord and there is harry werther  he was in the senate that time everybody said bad things about him and he was never reelected yet his house was not painted  he was honest  to this day his house is not painted as everybody knows  there is jim lokendamper  he has a bad heart  i heard him only last week right here before you all tell his soul  he did not tell all his soul and he lied to god  i am not lying to god  it is a big telling but i am telling everything  now azalea akau sitting right over there is his wife  but lizzie lokendamper is his married wife  a long time ago he had the great aloha for azalea  you think her uncle who went to california and died left her by will that two thousand five hundred dollars she got  her uncle did not  i know  her uncle cried broke in california and jim lokendamper sent eighty dollars to california to bury him  jim lokendamper had a piece of land in kohala he got from his mothers aunt  lizzie his married wife did not know this  so he sold it to the kohala ditch company and wave the twentyfive hundred to azalea akau  here lizzie the married wife upstood like a fury longthwarted and in lieu of her husband already fled flung herself tooth and nail on azalea  wait lizzie lokendamper alice cried out  i have much weight of you on my heart and some housepaint too      and when she had finished her disclosure of how lizzie had painted her house azalea was up and raging  wait azalea akau  i shall now lighten my heart about you  and it is not housepaint  jim always paid that  it is your new bath tub and modern plumbing that is heavy on me      worse much worse about many and sundry did alice akana have to say cutting high in business financial and social life as well as low  none was too high nor too low to escape and not until two in the morning before an entranced audience that packed the tabernacle to the doors did she complete her recital of the personal and detailed iniquities she knew of the community in which she had lived intimately all her days  just as she was finishing she remembered more  huh she sniffed  i gave last week one lot worth eight hundred dollars cash market price to abel ah yo to pay running expenses and add up in peters books in heaven  where did i get that lot  you all think mr fleming jason is a good man  he is more crooked than the entrance was to pearl lochs before the united states government straightened the channel  he has liver disease now but his sickness is a judgment of god and he will die crooked  mr fleming jason gave me that lot twentytwo years ago when its cash market price was thirtyfive dollars  because his aloha for me was big  no  he never had aloha inside of him except for dollars  you listen  mr fleming jason put a great sin upon me  when frank lomiloli was at my house full of gin for which gin mr fleming jason paid me in advance five times over i got frank lomiloli to sign his name to the sale paper of his town land for one hundred dollars  it was worth six hundred then  it is worth twenty thousand now  maybe you want to know where that town land is  i will tell you and remove it off my heart  it is on king street where is now the come again saloon the japanese taxicab company garage the smith  wilson plumbing shop and the ambrosia lee cream parlours with the two more stories big addison lodging house overhead  and it is all wood and always has been well painted  yesterday they started painting it attain  but that paint will not stand between me and god  there are no more paint pots between me and my path to heaven   the morning and evening papers of the day following held an unholy hush on the greatest news story of years but honolulu was half a giggle and half aghast at the whispered reports not always basely exaggerated that circulated wherever two honoluluans chanced to meet  our mistake said colonel chilton at the club was that we did not at the very first appoint a committee of safety to keep track of alices soul  bob cristy one of the younger islanders burst into laughter so pointed and so loud that the meaning of it was demanded  oh nothing much was his reply  but i heard on my way here that old john ward had just been run in for drunken and disorderly conduct and for resisting an officer  now abel ah yo fine toothcombs the police court  he loves nothing better than soul snatching a chronic drunkard  colonel chilton looked at lask finneston and both looked at gary wilkinson  he returned to them a similar look  the old beachcomber lask finneston cried  the drunken old reprobate  id forgotten he was alive  wonderful constitution never drew a sober breath except when he was shipwrecked and when i remember him into every deviltry afloat  he must be going on eighty  he isnt far away from it bob cristy nodded  still beach combs drinks when he gets the price and keeps all his senses though hes not spry and has to use glasses when he reads  and his memory is perfect  now if abel ah yo catches him      gary wilkinson cleared his throat preliminary to speech  now theres a grand old man he said  a leftover from a forgotten age  few of his type remain  a pioneer  a true kamaaina oldtimer  helpless and in the hands of the police in his old age  we should do something for him in recognition of his yeoman work in hawaii  his old home i happen to know is sag harbour  he hasnt seen it for over half a century  now why shouldnt he be surprised tomorrow morning by having his fine paid and by being presented with return tickets to sag harbour and say expenses for a years trip  i move a committee  i appoint colonel chilton lask finneston and    and myself  as for chairman who more appropriate than lask finneston who knew the old gentleman so well in the early days  since there is no objection i hereby appoint lask finneston chairman of the committee for the purpose of raising and donating money to pay the policecourt fine and the expenses of a years travel for that noble pioneer john ward in recognition of a lifetime of devotion of energy to the upbuilding of hawaii  there was no dissent  the committee will now go into secret session said lask finneston arising and indicating the way to the library  glen ellen california august 30 1916    shinbones    they have gone down to the pit with their weapons of war and they have laid their swords under their heads   it was a sad thing to see the old lady revert  prince akuli shot an apprehensive glance sideward to where under the shade of a kukui tree an old wahine hawaiian woman was just settling herself to begin on some work in hand  yes he nodded halfsadly to me in her last years hiwilani went back to the old ways and to the old beliefsin secret of course and believe me she was some collector herself  you should have seen her bones  she had them all about her bedroom in big jars and they constituted most all her relatives except a halfdozen or so that kanau beat her out of by getting to them first  the way the pair of them used to quarrel about those bones was awe inspiring  and it gave me the creeps when i was a boy to go into that big forevertwilight room of hers and know that in this jar was all that remained of my maternal grandaunt and that in that jar was my greatgrandfather and that in all the jars were the preserved boneremnants of the shadowy dust of the ancestors whose seed had come down and been incorporated in the living breathing me  hiwilani had gone quite native at the last sleeping on mats on the hard floorshed fired out of the room the great royal canopied fourposter that had been presented to her grandmother by lord byron who was the cousin of the don juan byron and came here in the frigate blonde in 1825  she went back to all native at the last and i can see her yet biting a bite out of the raw fish ere she tossed them to her women to eat  and she made them finish her poi or whatever else she did not finish of herself  she  but he broke off abruptly and by the sensitive dilation of his nostrils and by the expression of his mobile features i saw that he had read in the air and identified the odour that offended him  deuce take it he cried to me  it stinks to heaven  and i shall be doomed to wear it until were rescued  there was no mistaking the object of his abhorrence  the ancient crone was making a dearestloved lei wreath of the fruit of the hala which is the screwpine or pandanus of the south pacific  she was cutting the many sections or nutenvelopes of the fruit into fluted bellshapes preparatory to stringing them on the twisted and tough inner bark of the hau tree  it certainly smelled to heaven but to me a malahini newcomer the smell was winewoody and fruitjuicy and not unpleasant  prince akulis limousine had broken an axle a quarter of a mile away and he and i had sought shelter from the sun in this veritable bowery of a mountain home  humble and grassthatched was the house but it stood in a treasuregarden of begonias that sprayed their delicate blooms a score of feet above our heads that were like trees with willowy trunks of trees as thick as a mans arm  here we refreshed ourselves with drinkingcoconuts while a cowboy rode a dozen miles to the nearest telephone and summoned a machine from town  the town itself we could see the lakanaii metropolis of olokona a smudge of smoke on the shoreline as we looked down across the miles of canefields the billowwreathed reeflines and the blue haze of ocean to where the island of oahu shimmered like a dim opal on the horizon  maui is the valley isle of hawaii and kauai the garden isle but lakanaii lying abreast of oahu is recognized in the present and was known of old and always as the jewel isle of the group  not the largest nor merely the smallest lakanaii is conceded by all to be the wildest the most wildly beautiful and in its size the richest of all the islands  its sugar tonnage per acre is the highest its mountain beefcattle the fattest its rainfall the most generous without ever being disastrous  it resembles kauai in that it is the firstformed and therefore the oldest island so that it had had time sufficient to break down its lava rock into the richest soil and to erode the canyons between the ancient craters until they are like grand canyons of the colorado with numberless waterfalls plunging thousands of feet in the sheer or dissipating into veils of vapour and evanescing in midair to descend softly and invisibly through a mirage of rainbows like so much dew or gentle shower upon the abyssfloors  yet lakanaii is easy to describe  but how can one describe prince akuli  to know him is to know all lakanaii most thoroughly  in addition one must know thoroughly a great deal of the rest of the world  in the first place prince akuli has no recognized nor legal right to be called prince  furthermore akuli means the squid  so that prince squid could scarcely be the dignified title of the straight descendant of the oldest and highest aliis high chiefs of hawaiian old and exclusive stock wherein in the ancient way of the egyptian pharaohs brothers and sisters had even wed on the throne for the reason that they could not marry beneath rank that in all their known world there was none of higher rank and that at every hazard the dynasty must be perpetuated  i have heard prince akulis singing historians inherited from his father chanting their interminable genealogies by which they demonstrated that he was the highest alii in all hawaii  beginning with wakea who is their adam and with papa their eve through as many generations as there are letters in our alphabet they trace down to nanakaoko the first ancestor born in hawaii and whose wife was kahihiokalani  later but always highest their generations split from the generations of ua who was the founder of the two distinct lines of the kauai and oahu kings  in the eleventh century ad by the lakanaii historians at the time brothers and sisters mated because none existed to excel them their rank received a boost of new blood of rank that was next to heavens door  one hoikemaha steering by the stars and the ancient traditions arrived in a great doublecanoe from samoa  he married a lesser alii of lakanaii and when his three sons were grown returned with them to samoa to bring back his own youngest brother  but with him he brought back kumi the son of tui manua which latters rank was highest in all polynesia and barely second to that of the demigods and gods  so the estimable seed of kumi eight centuries before had entered into the aliis of lakanaii and been passed down by them in the undeviating line to reposit in prince akuli  him i first met talking with an oxford accent in the officers mess of the black watch in south africa  this was just before that famous regiment was cut to pieces at magersfontein  he had as much right to be in that mess as he had to his accent for he was oxfordeducated and held the queens commission  with him as his guest taking a look at the war was prince cupid so nicknamed but the true prince of all hawaii including lakanaii whose real and legal title was prince jonah kuhio kalanianaole and who might have been the living king of hawaii nei had it not been for the haole white man revolution and annexationthis despite the fact that prince cupids alii genealogy was lesser to the heavenboosted genealogy of prince akuli  for prince akuli might have been king of lakanaii and of all hawaii perhaps had not his grandfather been soundly thrashed by the first and greatest of the kamehamehas  this had occurred in the year 1810 in the booming days of the sandalwood trade and in the same year that the king of kauai came in and was good and ate out of kamehamehas hand  prince akulis grandfather in that year had received his trouncing and subjugating because he was old school  he had not imaged island empire in terms of gunpowder and haole gunners  kamehameha farthervisioned had annexed the service of haoles including such men as isaac davis mate and sole survivor of the massacred crew of the schooner fair american and john young captured boatswain of the snow eleanor  and isaac davis and john young and others of their waywardly adventurous ilk with sixpounder brass carronades from the captured iphigenia and fair american had destroyed the war canoes and shattered the morale of the king of lakanaiis land fighters receiving duly in return from kamehameha according to agreement  isaac davis six hundred mature and fat hogs john young five hundred of

battlings and matings with the younger brothers of the demigods worldpolished oxfordaccented twentieth century to the tick of the second comes prince akuli prince squid pure veined polynesian a living

his island metropolis of olokona to tell me of his mother who reverted in her old age to ancientness of religious concept and ancestor worship and collected and surrounded herself with the charnel bones of those who had been her forerunners back in the darkness of time  king kalakaua started this collecting fad over on oahu prince akuli continued  and his queen kapiolani caught the fad from him  they collected everythingold makaloa mats old tapas old calabashes old doublecanoes and idols which the priests had saved from the general destruction in 1819  i havent seen a pearlshell fishhook in years but i swear that kalakaua accumulated ten thousand of them to say nothing of human jawbone fishhooks and feather cloaks and capes and helmets and stone adzes and poipounders of phallic design  when he and kapiolani made their royal progresses around the islands their hosts had to hide away their personal relics  for to the king in theory belongs all property of his people and with kalakaua when it came to the old things theory and practice were one  from him my father kanau got the collecting bee in his bonnet and hiwilani was likewise infected  but father was modern to his fingertips  he believed neither in the gods of the kahunas priests nor of the missionaries  he didnt believe in anything except sugar stocks horsebreeding and that his grandfather had been a fool in not collecting a few isaac davises and john youngs and brass carronades before he went to war with kamehameha  so he collected curios in the pure collectors spirit but my mother took it seriously  that was why she went in for bones  i remember too she had an ugly old stoneidol she used to yammer to and crawl around on the floor before  its in the deacon museum now  i sent it there after her death and her collection of bones to the royal mausoleum in olokona  i dont know whether you remember her father was kaaukuu  well he was and he was a giant  when they built the mausoleum his bones nicely cleaned and preserved were dug out of their hiding place and placed in the mausoleum  hiwilani had an old retainer ahuna  she stole the key from kanau one night and made ahuna go and steal her fathers bones out of the mausoleum  i know  and he must have been a giant  she kept him in one of her big jars  one day when i was a tidy size of a lad and curious to know if kaaukuu was as big as tradition had him i fished his intact lower jaw out of the jar and the wrappings and tried it on  i stuck my head right through it and it rested around my neck and on my shoulders like a horse collar  and every tooth was in the jaw whiter than porcelain without a cavity the enamel unstained and unchipped  i got the walloping of my life for that offence although she had to call old ahuna in to help give it to me  but the incident served me well  it won her confidence in me that i was not afraid of the bones of the dead ones and it won for me my oxford education  as you shall see if that car doesnt arrive first  old ahuna was one of the real old ones with the hallmark on him and branded into him of faithful bornslave service  he knew more about my mothers family and my fathers than did both of them put together  and he knew what no living other knew the burial place of centuries where were hid the bones of most of her ancestors and of kanaus  kanau couldnt worm it out of the old fellow who looked upon kanau as an apostate  hiwilani struggled with the old codger for years  how she ever succeeded is beyond me  of course on the face of it she was faithful to the old religion  this might have persuaded ahuna to loosen up a little  or she may have jolted fear into him for she knew a lot of the line of chatter of the old huni sorcerers and she could make a noise like being on terms of utmost intimacy with uli who is the chiefest god of sorcery of all the sorcerers  she could skin the ordinary kahuna lapaau medicine man when it came to praying to lonopuha and koleamoku read dreams and visions and signs and omens and indigestions to beat the band make the practitioners under the medicine god maiola look like thirty cents pull off a pule hee incantation that would make them dizzy and she claimed to a practice of kahuna hoenoho which is modern spiritism second to none  i have myself seen her drink the wind throw a fit and prophesy  the aumakuas were brothers to her when she slipped offerings to them across the altars of the ruined heiaus temples with a line of prayer that was as unintelligible to me as it was hairraising  and as for old ahuna she could make him get down on the floor and yammer and bite himself when she pulled the real mystery dope on him  nevertheless my private opinion is that it was the anaana stuff that got him  she snipped off a lock of his hair one day with a pair of manicure scissors  this lock of hair was what we call the maunu meaning the bait  and she took jolly good care to let him know she had that bit of his hair  then she tipped it off to him that she had buried it and was deeply engaged each night in her offerings and incantations to uli  that was the regular prayingtodeath i queried in the pause of prince akulis lighting his cigarette  sure thing he nodded  and ahuna fell for it  first he tried to locate the hidingplace of the bait of his hair  failing that he hired a pahiuhiu sorcerer to find it for him  but hiwilani queered that game by threatening to the sorcerer to practise apo leo on him which is the art of permanently depriving a person of the power of speech without otherwise injuring him  then it was that ahuna began to pine away and get more like a corpse every day  in desperation he appealed to kanau  i happened to be present  you have heard what sort of a man my father was  pig he called ahuna  swinebrains  stinking fish  die and be done with it  you are a fool  it is all nonsense  there is nothing in anything  the drunken haole howard can prove the missionaries wrong  squareface gin proves howard wrong  the doctors say he wont last six months  even squareface gin lies life is a liar too  and here are hard times upon us and a slump in sugar  glanders has got into my brood mares  i wish i could lie down and sleep for a hundred years and wake up to find sugar up a hundred points  father was something of a philosopher himself with a bitter wit and a trick of spitting out staccato epigrams  he clapped his hands  bring me a highball he commanded no bring me two highballs  then he turned on ahuna  go and let yourself die old heathen survival of darkness blight of the pit that you are but dont die on these premises  i desire merriment and laughter and the sweet tickling of music and the beauty of youthful motion not the croaking of sick toads and googlyeyed corpses about me still afoot on their shaky legs  ill be that way soon enough if i live long enough  and it will be my everlasting regret if i dont live long enough  why in hell did i sink that last twenty thousand into curtiss plantation  howard warned me the slump was coming but i thought it was the squareface making him lie  and curtis has blown his brains out and his head luna has run away with his daughter and the sugar chemist has got typhoid and everythings going to smash  he clapped his hands for his servants and commanded  bring me my singing boys  and the hula dancersplenty of them  and send for old howard  somebodys got to pay and ill shorten his six months of life by a month  but above all music  let there be music  it is stronger than drink and quicker than opium  he with his music druggery  it was his father the old savage who was entertained on board a french frigate and for the first time heard an orchestra  when the little concert was over the captain to find which piece he liked best asked which piece hed like repeated  well when grandfather got done describing what piece do you think it was  i gave up while the prince lighted a fresh cigarette  why it was the first one of course  not the real first one but the tuning up that preceded it  i nodded with eyes and face mirthful of appreciation and prince akuli with another apprehensive glance at the old wahine and her halfmade hala lei returned to his tale of the bones of his ancestors  it was somewhere around this stage of the game that old ahuna gave in to hiwilani  he didnt exactly give in  he compromised thats where i come in  if he would bring her the bones of her mother and of her grandfather who was the father of kaaukuu and who by tradition was rumoured to have been even bigger than his giant son she would return to ahuna the bait of his hair she was praying him to death with  he on the other hand stipulated that he was not to reveal to her the secret burialplace of all the alii of lakanaii all the way back  nevertheless he was too old to dare the adventure alone must be helped by some one who of necessity would come to know the secret and i was that one  i was the highest alii beside my father and mother and they were no higher than i  so i came upon the scene being summoned into the twilight room to confront those two dubious old ones who dealt with the dead  they were a pairmother fat to despair of helplessness ahuna thin as a skeleton and as fragile  of her one had the impression that if she lay down on her back she could not roll over without the aid of blockandtackle of ahuna ones impression was that the tooth pickedness of him would shatter to splinters if one bumped into him  and when they had broached the matter there was more pilikia trouble  my fathers attitude stiffened my resolution  i refused to go on the bonesnatching expedition  i said i didnt care a whoop for the bones of all the aliis of my family and race you see i had just discovered jules verne loaned me by old howard and was reading my head off  bones  when there were north poles and centres of earths and hairy comets to ride across space among the stars  of course i didnt want to go on any bone snatching expedition  i said my father was ablebodied and he could go splitting equally with her whatever bones he brought back  but she said he was only a blamed collectoror words to that effect only stronger  i know him she assured me  hed bet his mothers bones on a horserace or an acefull  i stood with fat her when it came to modern scepticism and i told her the whole thing was rubbish  bones i said  what are bones  even field mice and many rats and cockroaches have bones though the roaches wear their bones outside their meat instead of inside  the difference between man and other animals i told her is not bones but brain  why a bullock has bigger bones than a man and more than one fish ive eaten has more bones while a whale beats creation when it comes to bone  it was frank talk which is our hawaiian way as you have long since learned  in return equally frank she regretted she hadnt given me away as a feeding child when i was born  next she bewailed that she had ever borne me  from that it was only a step to anaana me  she threatened me with it and i did the bravest thing i have ever done  old howard had given me a knife of many blades and corkscrews and screwdrivers and all sorts of contrivances including a tiny pair of scissors  i proceeded to pare my fingernails  there i said as i put the parings into her hand  just to show you what i think of it  theres bait and to spare  go on and anaana me if you can  i have said it was brave  it was  i was only fifteen and i had lived all my days in the thick of the mystery stuff while my scepticism very recently acquired was only skindeep  i could be a sceptic out in the open in the sunshine  but i was afraid of the dark  and in that twilight room the bones of the dead all about me in the big jars why the old lady had me scared stiff  as we say today she had my goat  only i was brave and didnt let on and i put my bluff across for my mother flung the parings into my face and burst into tears  tears in an elderly woman weighing three hundred and twenty pounds are scarcely impressive and i hardened the brassiness of my bluff  she shifted her attack and proceeded to talk with the dead  nay more she summoned them there and though i was all ripe to see but couldnt ahuna saw the father of kaaukuu in the corner and lay down on the floor and yammered  just the same although i almost saw the old giant i didnt quite see him  let him talk for himself i said  but hiwilani persisted in doing the talking for him and in laying upon me his solemn injunction that i must go with ahuna to the burialplace and bring back the bones desired by my mother  but i argued that if the dead ones could be invoked to kill living men by wasting sicknesses and that if the dead ones could transport themselves from their burial crypts into the corner of her room i couldnt see why they shouldnt leave their bones behind them there in her room and ready to be jarred when they said goodbye and departed for the middle world the over world or the under world or wherever they abided when they werent paying social calls  whereupon mother let loose on poor old ahuna or let loose upon him the ghost of kaaukuus father supposed to be crouching there in the corner who commanded ahuna to divulge to her the burial place  i tried to stiffen him up telling him to let the old ghost divulge the secret himself than whom nobody else knew it better seeing that he had resided there upwards of a century  but ahuna was old school  he possessed no iota of scepticism  the more hiwilani frightened him the more he rolled on the floor and the louder he yammered  but when he began to bite himself i gave in  i felt sorry for him but over and beyond that i began to admire him  he was sterling stuff even if he was a survival of darkness  here with the fear of mystery cruelly upon him believing hiwilanis dope implicitly he was caught between two fidelities  she was his living alii his alii kapo sacred chiefess  he must be faithful to her yet more faithful must he be to all the dead and gone aliis of her line who depended solely on him that their bones should not be disturbed  i gave in  but i too imposed stipulations  steadfastly had my father new school refused to let me go to england for my education  that sugar was slumping was reason sufficient for him steadfastly had my mother old school refused her heathen mind too dark to place any value on education while it was shrewd enough to discern that education led to unbelief in all that was old  i wanted to study to study science the arts philosophy to study everything old howard knew which enabled him on the edge of the grave undauntedly to sneer at superstition and to give me jules verne to read  he was an oxford man before he went wild and wrong and it was he who had set the oxford bee buzzing in my noddle  in the end ahuna and i old school and new school leagued together won out  mother promised that shed make father send me to england even if she had to pester him into a prolonged drinking that would make his digestion go back on him  also howard was to accompany me so that i could decently bury him in england  he was a queer one old howard an individual if there ever was one  let me tell you a little story about him  it was when kalakaua was starting on his trip around the world  you remember when armstrong and judd and the drunken valet of a german baron accompanied him  kalakaua made the proposition to howard      but here the longapprehended calamity fell upon prince akuli  the old wahine had finished her lei hala  barefooted with no adornment of femininity clad in a shapeless shift of muchwashed cotton with agewithered face and labourgnarled hands she cringed before him and crooned a mele in his honour and still cringing put the lei around his neck  it is true the hala smelled most freshly strong yet was the act beautiful to me and the old woman herself beautiful to me  my mind leapt into the princes narrative so that to ahuna i could not help likening her  oh truly to be an alii in hawaii even in this second decade of the twentieth century is no light thing  the alii utterly of the new must be kindly and kingly to those old ones absolutely of the old  nor did the prince without a kingdom his loved island long since annexed by the united states and incorporated into a territory along with the rest of the hawaiian islandsnor did the prince betray his repugnance for the odour of the hala  he bowed his head graciously and his royal condescending words of pure hawaiian i knew would make the old womans heart warm until she died with remembrance of the wonderful occasion  the wry grimace he stole to me would not have been made had he felt any uncertainty of its escaping her  and so prince akuli resumed after the wahine had tottered away in an ecstasy ahuna and i departed on our graverobbing adventure  you know the ironbound coast  i nodded knowing full well the spectacle of those lava leagues of weather coast truly ironbound so far as landingplaces or anchorages were concerned great forbidding cliffwalls thousands of feet in height their summits wreathed in cloud and rain squall their knees hammered by the tradewind billows into spouting spuming white the air from sea to raincloud spanned by a myriad leaping waterfalls provocative in day or night of countless sun and lunar rainbows  valleys so called but fissures rather slit the cyclopean walls here and there and led away into a lofty and madly vertical back country most of it inaccessible to the foot of man and trod only by the wild goat  precious little you know of it prince akuli retorted in reply to my nod  youve seen it only from the decks of steamers  there are valleys there inhabited valleys out of which there is no exit by land and perilously accessible by canoe only on the selected days of two months in the year  when i was twentyeight i was over there in one of them on a hunting trip  bad weather in the auspicious period marooned us for three weeks  then five of my party and myself swam for it out through the surf  three of us made the canoes waiting for us  the other two were flung back on the sand each with a broken arm  save for us the entire party remained there until the next year ten months afterward  and one of them was wilson of wilson  wall the honolulu sugar factors and he was engaged to be married  ive seen a goat shot above by a hunter above land at my feet a thousand yards underneath  believe me that landscape seemed to rain goats and rocks for ten minutes  one of my canoemen fell off the trail between the two little valleys of aipio and luno  he hit first fifteen hundred feet beneath us and fetched up in a ledge three hundred feet farther down  we didnt bury him  we couldnt get to him and flying machines had not yet been invented  his bones are there now and barring earthquake and volcano will be there when the trumps of judgment sound  goodness me  only the other day when our promotion committee trying to compete with honolulu for the tourist trade called in the engineers to estimate what it would cost to build a scenic drive around the ironbound coast the lowest figures were a quarter of a million dollars a mile  and ahuna and i an old man and a young boy started for that stern coast in a canoe paddled by old men  the youngest of them the steersman was over sixty while the rest of them averaged seventy at the very least  there were eight of them and we started in the nighttime so that none should see us go  even these old ones trusted all their lives knew no more than the fringe of the secret  to the fringe only could they take us  and the fringe wasi dont mind telling that muchthe fringe was ponuloo valley  we got there the third afternoon following  the old chaps werent strong on the paddles  it was a funny expedition into such wild waters with now one and now another of our ancientmariner crew collapsing and even fainting  one of them actually died on the second morning out  we buried him overside it was positively uncanny the heathen ceremonies those grey ones pulled off in burying their grey brother  and i was only fifteen alii kapo over them by blood of heathenness and right of hereditary heathen rule with a penchant for jules verne and shortly to sail for england for my education  so one learns  small wonder my father was a philosopher in his own lifetime spanning the history of man from human sacrifice and idol worship through the religions of mans upward striving to the medusa of rank atheism at the end of it all  small wonder that like old ecclesiastes he found vanity in all things and surcease in sugar stocks singing boys and hula dancers  prince akuli debated with his soul for an interval  oh well he sighed i have done some spanning of time myself he sniffed disgustedly of the odour of the hala lei that stifled him  it stinks of the ancient he vouchsafed  i  i stink of the modern  my father was right  the sweetest of all is sugar up a hundred points or four aces in a poker game  if the big war lasts another year i shall clean up threequarters of a million over a million  if peace breaks tomorrow with the consequent slump i could enumerate a hundred who will lose my direct bounty and go into the old natives homes my father and i long since endowed for them  he clapped his hands and the old wahine tottered toward him in an excitement of haste to serve  she cringed before him as he drew pad and pencil from his breast pocket  each month old woman of our old race he addressed her will you receive by rural free delivery a piece of written paper that you can exchange with any storekeeper anywhere for ten dollars gold  this shall be so for as long as you live  behold  i write the record and the remembrance of it here and now with this pencil on this paper  and this is because you are of my race and service and because you have honoured me this day with your mats to sit upon and your thriceblessed and thricedelicious lei hala  he turned to me a weary and sceptical eye saying  and if i die tomorrow not alone will the lawyers contest my disposition of my property but they will contest my benefactions and my pensions accorded and the clarity of my mind  it was the right weather of the year but even then with our old weak ones at the paddles we did not attempt the landing until we had assembled half the population of ponuloo valley down on the steep little beach  then we counted our waves selected the best one and ran in on it  of course the canoe was swamped and the outrigger smashed but the ones on shore dragged us up unharmed beyond the wash  ahuna gave his orders  in the nighttime all must remain within their houses and the dogs be tied up and have their jaws bound so that there should be no barking  and in the nighttime ahuna and i stole out on our journey no one knowing whether we went to the right or left or up the valley toward its head  we carried jerky and hard poi and dried aku and from the quantity of the food i knew we were to be gone several days  such a trail  a jacobs ladder to the sky truly for that first pali precipice almost straight up was three thousand feet above the sea  and we did it in the dark  at the top beyond the sight of the valley we had left we slept until daylight on the hard rock in a hollow nook ahuna knew and that was so small that we were squeezed  and the old fellow for fear that i might move in the heavy restlessness of lads sleep lay on the outside with one arm resting across me  at daybreak i saw why  between us and the lip of the cliff scarcely a yard intervened  i crawled to the lip and looked watching the abyss take on immensity in the growing light and trembling from the fear of height that was upon me  at last i made out the sea over half a mile straight beneath  and we had done this thing in the dark  down in the next valley which was a very tiny one we found evidence of the ancient population but there were no people  the only way was the crazy footpaths up and down the dizzy valley walls from valley to valley  but lean and aged as ahuna was he seemed untirable  in the second valley dwelt an old leper in hiding  he did not know me and when ahuna told him who i was he grovelled at my feet almost clasping them and mumbled a mele of all my line out of a lipless mouth  the next valley proved to be the valley  it was long and so narrow that its floor had caught not sufficient space of soil to grow taro for a single person  also it had no beach the stream that threaded it leaping a pali of several hundred feet down to the sea  it was a godforsaken place of naked eroded lava to which only rarely could the scant vegetation find roothold  for miles we followed up that winding fissure through the towering walls far into the chaos of back country that lies behind the ironbound coast  how far that valley penetrated i do not know but from the quantity of water in the stream i judged it far  we did not go to the valleys head  i could see ahuna casting glances to all the peaks and i knew he was taking bearings known to him alone from natural objects  when he halted at the last it was with abrupt certainty  his bearings had crossed  he threw down the portion of food and outfit he had carried  it was the place  i looked on either hand at the hard implacable walls naked of vegetation and could dream of no burialplace possible in such bare adamant  we ate then stripped for work  only did ahuna permit me to retain my shoes  he stood beside me at the edge of a deep pool likewise apparelled and prodigiously skinny  you will dive down into the pool at this spot he said  search the rock with your hands as you descend and about a fathom and a half down you will find a hole  enter it headfirst but going slowly for the lava rock is sharp and may cut your head and body  and then i queried  you will find the hole growing larger was his answer  when you have gone all of eight fathoms along the passage come up slowly and you will find your head in the air above water in the dark  wait there then for me  the water is very cold  it didnt sound good to me  i was thinking not of the cold water and the dark but of the bones  you go first i said  but he claimed he could not  you are my alii my prince he said  it is impossible that i should go before you into the sacred burial place of your kingly ancestors  but the prospect did not please  just cut out this prince stuff i told him  it isnt what its cracked up to be  you go first and ill never tell on you  not alone the living must we please he admonished but more so the dead must we please nor can we lie to the dead  we argued it out and for half an hour it was stalemate  i wouldnt and he simply couldnt  he tried to buck me up by appealing to my pride  he chanted the heroic deeds of my ancestors and i remember especially he sang to me of mokomoku my greatgrandfather and the gigantic father of the gigantic kaaukuu telling how thrice in battle mokomoku leaped among his foes seizing by the neck a warrior in either hand and knocking their heads together until they were dead  but this was not what decided me  i really felt sorry for old ahuna he was so beside himself for fear the expedition would come to naught  and i was coming to a great admiration for the old fellow not least among the reasons being the fact of his lying down to sleep between me and the clifflip  so with true aliiauthority of command saying you will immediately follow after me i dived in  everything he had said was correct  i found the entrance to the subterranean passage swam carefully through it cutting my shoulder once on the lava sharp roof and emerged in the darkness and air  but before i could count thirty he broke water beside me rested his hand on my arm to make sure of me and directed me to swim ahead of him for the matter of a hundred feet or so  then we touched bottom and climbed out on the rocks  and still no light and i remember i was glad that our altitude was too high for centipedes  he had brought with him a coconut calabash tightly stoppered of whaleoil that must have been landed on lahaina beach thirty years before  from his mouth he took a watertight arrangement of a matchbox composed of two empty riflecartridges fitted snugly together  he lighted the wicking that floated on the oil and i looked about and knew disappointment  no burialchamber was it but merely a lava tube such as occurs on all the islands  he put the calabash of light into my hands and started me ahead of him on the way which he assured me was long but not too long  it was long at least a mile in my sober judgment though at the time it seemed five miles and it ascended sharply  when ahuna at the last stopped me i knew we were close to our goal  he knelt on his lean old knees on the sharp lava rock and clasped my knees with his skinny arms  my hand that was free of the calabash lamp he placed on his head  he chanted to me with his old cracked quavering voice the line of my descent and my essential high alii ness  and then he said  tell neither kanau nor hiwilani aught of what you are about to behold  there is no sacredness in kanau  his mind is filled with sugar and the breeding of horses  i do know that he sold a feather cloak his grandfather had worn to that english collector for eight thousand dollars and the money he lost the next day betting on the polo game between maui and oahu  hiwilani your mother is filled with sacredness  she is too much filled with sacredness  she grows old and weakheaded and she traffics overmuch with sorceries  no i made answer  i shall tell no one  if i did then would i have to return to this place again  and i do not want ever to return to this place  ill try anything once  this i shall never try twice  it is well he said and arose falling behind so that i should enter first  also he said  your mother is old  i shall bring her as promised the bones of her mother and of her grandfather these should content her until she dies and then if i die before her it is you who must see to it that all the bones in her family collection are placed in the royal mausoleum  i have given all the islands museums the onceover prince akuli lapsed back into slang and i must say that the totality of the collections cannot touch what i saw in our lakanaii burialcave remember and with reason and history we trace back the highest and oldest genealogy in the islands  everything that i had ever dreamed or heard of and much more that i had not was there  the place was wonderful  ahuna sepulchrally muttering prayers and meles moved about lighting various whaleoil lampcalabashes they were all there the hawaiian race from the beginning of hawaiian time  bundles of bones and bundles of bones all wrapped decently in tapa until for all the world it was like the parcels post department at a post office  and everything  kahilis which you may know developed out of the flyflapper into symbols of royalty until they became larger than hearseplumes with handles a fathom and a half and over two fathoms in length  and such handles  of the wood of the kauila inlaid with shell and ivory and bone with a cleverness that had died out among our artificers a century before  it was a centuriesold family attic  for the first time i saw things i had only heard of such as the pahoas fashioned of whaleteeth and suspended by braided human hair and worn on the breast only by the highest of rank  there were tapes and mats of the rarest and oldest capes and leis and helmets and cloaks priceless all except the tooancient ones of the feathers of the mamo and of the iwi and the akakane and the oo  i saw one of the mamo cloaks that was superior to that finest one in the bishop museum in honolulu and that they value at between half a million and a million dollars  goodness me i thought at the time it was lucky kanau didnt know about it  such a mess of things  carved gourds and calabashes shell scrapers nets of olona fibre a junk of ieie baskets and fish hooks of every bone and spoon of shell  musical instruments of the forgotten daysukukes and nose flutes and kiokios which are likewise played with one unstoppered nostril  taboo poi bowls and finger bowls lefthanded adzes of the canoe gods lavacup lamps stone mortars and pestles and poipounders  and adzes again a myriad of them beautiful ones from an ounce in weight for the finer carving of idols to fifteen pounds for the felling of trees and all with the sweetest handles i have ever beheld  there were the kaekeekesyou know our ancient drums hollowed sections of the coconut tree covered one end with sharkskin  the first kaekeeke of all hawaii ahuna pointed out to me and told me the tale  it was manifestly most ancient  he was afraid to touch it for fear the agerotted wood of it would crumble to dust the ragged tatters of the sharkskin head of it still attached  this is the very oldest and father of all our kaekeekes ahuna told me kila the son of moikeha brought it back from far raiatea in the south pacific  and it was kilas own son kahai who made that same journey and was gone ten years and brought back with him from tahiti the first breadfruit trees that sprouted and grew on hawaiian soil  and the bones and bones  the parceldelivery array of them besides the small bundles of the long bones there were full skeletons tapawrapped lying in oneman and two and threeman canoes of precious koa wood with curved outriggers of wiliwili wood and proper paddles to hand with the ioprojection at the point simulating the continuance of the handle as if like a skewer thrust through the flat length of the blade  and their war weapons were laid away by the sides of the lifeless bones that had wielded themrusty old horsepistols derringers pepperboxes fivebarrelled fantastiques kentucky long riffles muskets handled in trade by john company and hudsons bay sharktooth swords wooden stabbingknives arrows and spears boneheaded of the fish and the pig and of man and spears and arrows woodenheaded and firehardened  ahuna put a spear in my hand headed and pointed finely with the long shinbone of a man and told me the tale of it  but first he unwrapped the long bones arms and legs of two parcels the bones under the wrappings neatly tied like so many faggots this said ahuna exhibiting the pitiful white contents of one parcel is laulani  she was the wife of akaiko whose bones now placed in your hands much larger and malelike as you observe held up the flesh of a large man a threehundred pounder seven footer three centuries agone  and this spearhead is made of the shinbone of keola a mighty wrestler and runner of their own time and place  and he loved laulani and she fled with him  but in a forgotten battle on the sands of kalini akaiko rushed the lines of the enemy leading the charge that was successful and seized upon keola his wifes lover and threw him to the ground and sawed through his neck to the death with a sharktooth knife  thus in the old days as always did man combat for woman with man  and laulani was beautiful that keola should be made into a spearhead for her  she was formed like a queen and her body was a long bowl of sweetness and her fingers lomid massaged to slimness and smallness at her mothers breast  for ten generations have we remembered her beauty  your fathers singing boys today sing of her beauty in the hula that is named of her  this is laulani whom you hold in your hands  and ahuna done i could but gaze with imagination at the one time sobered and fired  old drunken howard had lent me his tennyson and i had mooned long and often over the idyls of the king  here were the three i thoughtarthur and launcelot and guinevere  this then i pondered was the end of it all of life and strife and striving and love the weary spirits of these long gone ones to be invoked by fat old women and mangy sorcerers the bones of them to be esteemed of collectors and betted on horse races and acefulls or to be sold for cash and invested in sugar stocks  for me it was illumination  i learned there in the burialcave the great lesson  and to ahuna i said  the spear headed with the long bone of keola i shall take for my own  never shall i sell it i shall keep it always  and for what purpose he demanded  and i replied  that the contemplation of it may keep my hand sober and my feet on earth with the knowledge that few men are fortunate enough to have as much of a remnant of themselves as will compose a spearhead when they are three centuries dead  and ahuna bowed his head and praised my wisdom of judgment  but at that moment the longrotted olonacord broke and the pitiful womans bones of laulani shed from my clasp and clattered on the rocky floor  one shinbone in some way deflected fell under the dark shadow of a canoebow and i made up my mind that it should be mine  so i hastened to help him in the picking up of the bones and the tying so that he did not notice its absence  this said ahuna introducing me to another of my ancestors is your greatgrandfather mokomoku the father of kaaukuu  behold the size of his bones  he was a giant  i shall carry him because of the long spear of keola that will be difficult for you to carry away  and this is lelemahoa your grandmother the mother of your mother that you shall carry  and day grows short and we must still swim up through the waters to the sun ere darkness hides the sun from the world  but ahuna putting out the various calabashes of light by drowning the wicks in the whaleoil did not observe me include the shinbone of laulani with the bones of my grandmother  the honk of the automobile sent up from olokona to rescue us broke off the princes narrative  we said goodbye to the ancient and freshpensioned wahine and departed  a halfmile on our way prince akuli resumed  so ahuna and i returned to hiwilani and to her happiness lasting to her death the year following two more of her ancestors abided about her in the jars of her twilight room  also she kept her compact and worried my father into sending me to england  i took old howard along and he perked up and confuted the doctors so that it was three years before i buried him restored to the bosom of my family  sometimes i think he was the most brilliant man i have ever known  not until my return from england did ahuna die the last custodian of our alii secrets  and at his deathbed he pledged me again never to reveal the location in that nameless valley and never to go back myself  much else i have forgotten to mention did i see there in the cave that one time  there were the bones of kumi the near demigod son of tui manua of samoa who in the long before married into my line and heavenboosted my genealogy  and the bones of my great grandmother who had slept in the fourposter presented her by lord byron  and ahuna hinted tradition that there was reason for that presentation as well as for the historically known lingering of the blonde in olokona for so long  and i held her poor bones in my handsbones once fleshed with sensate beauty informed with sparkle and spirit instinct with love and lovewarmness of arms around and eyes and lips together that had begat me in the end of the generations unborn  it was a good experience  i am modern tis true  i believe in no mystery stuff of old time nor of the kahunas  and yet i saw in that cave things which i dare not name to you and which i since old ahuna died alone of the living know  i have no children  with me my long line ceases  this is the twentieth century and we stink of gasolene  nevertheless these other and nameless things shall die with me  i shall never revisit the burialplace  nor in all time to come will any man gaze upon it through living eyes unless the quakes of earth rend the mountains asunder and spew forth the secrets contained in the hearts of the mountains  prince akuli ceased from speech  with welcome relief on his face he removed the lei hala from his neck and with a sniff and a sigh tossed it into concealment in the thick lantana by the side of the road  but the shinbone of laulani i queried softly  he remained silent while a mile of pasture land fled by us and yielded to caneland  i have it now he at last said  and beside it is keola slain ere his time and made into a spearhead for love of the woman whose shinbone abides near to him  to them those poor pathetic bones i owe more than to aught else  i became possessed of them in the period of my culminating adolescence  i know they changed the entire course of my life and trend of my mind  they gave to me a modesty and a humility in the world from which my fathers fortune has ever failed to seduce me  and often when woman was nigh to winning to the empery of my mind over me i sought laulanis shinbone  and often when lusty manhood stung me into feeling overproud and lusty i consulted the spearhead remnant of keola onetime swift runner and mighty wrestler and lover and thief of the wife of a king  the contemplation of them has ever been of profound aid to me and you might well say that i have founded my religion or practice of living upon them  waikiki honolulu hawaiian islands july 16 1916    the water baby    i lent a weary ear to old kohokumus interminable chanting of the deeds and adventures of maui the promethean demigod of polynesia who fished up dry land from ocean depths with hooks made fast to heaven who lifted up the sky whereunder previously men had gone on allfours not having space to stand erect and who made the sun with its sixteen snared legs stand still and agree thereafter to traverse the sky more slowlythe sun being evidently a trade unionist and believing in the sixhour day while maui stood for the open shop and the twelvehour day  now this said kohokumu is from queen lililuokalanis own family mele   maui became restless and fought the sun with a noose that he laid and winter won the sun and summer was won by maui       born in the islands myself i knew the hawaiian myths better than this old fisherman although i possessed not his memorization that enabled him to recite them endless hours  and you believe all this i demanded in the sweet hawaiian tongue  it was a long time ago he pondered  i never saw maui with my own eyes  but all our old men from all the way back tell us these things as i an old man tell them to my sons and grandsons who will tell them to their sons and grandsons all the way ahead to come  you believe i persisted that whopper of maui roping the sun like a wild steer and that other whopper of heaving up the sky from off the earth  i am of little worth and am not wise o lakana my fisherman made answer  yet have i read the hawaiian bible the missionaries translated to us and there have i read that your big man of the beginning made the earth and sky and sun and moon and stars and all manner of animals from horses to cockroaches and from centipedes and mosquitoes to sea lice and jellyfish and man and woman and everything and all in six days  why maui didnt do anything like that much  he didnt make anything  he just put things in order that was all and it took him a long long time to make the improvements  and anyway it is much easier and more reasonable to believe the little whopper than the big whopper  and what could i reply  he had me on the matter of reasonableness besides my head ached  and the funny thing as i admitted it to myself was that evolution teaches in no uncertain voice that man did run on allfours ere he came to walk upright that astronomy states flatly that the speed of the revolution of the earth on its axis has diminished steadily thus increasing the length of day and that the seismologists accept that all the islands of hawaii were elevated from the ocean floor by volcanic action  fortunately i saw a bamboo pole floating on the surface several hundred feet away suddenly upend and start a very devils dance this was a diversion from the profitless discussion and kohokumu and i dipped our paddles and raced the little outrigger canoe to the dancing pole  kohokumu caught the line that was fast to the butt of the pole and underhanded it in until a twofoot ukikiki battling fiercely to the end flashed its wet silver in the sun and began beating a tattoo on the inside bottom of the canoe  kohokumu picked up a squirming slimy squid with his teeth bit a chunk of live bait out of it attached the bait to the hook and dropped line and sinker overside  the stick floated flat on the surface of the water and the canoe drifted slowly away  with a survey of the crescent composed of a score of such sticks all lying flat kohokumu wiped his hands on his naked sides and lifted the wearisome and centuriesold chant of kuali   oh the great fishhook of maui manaiikalanimade fast to the heavens an earthtwisted cord ties the hook engulfed from lofty kauiki its bait the redbilled alae the bird to hina sacred it sinks far down to hawaii struggling and in pain dying caught is the land beneath the water floated up up to the surface but hina hid a wing of the bird and broke the land beneath the water below was the bait snatched away and eaten at once by the fishes the ulua of the deep muddy places   his aged voice was hoarse and scratchy from the drinking of too much swipes at a funeral the night before nothing of which contributed to make me less irritable  my head ached  the sun glare on the water made my eyes ache while i was suffering more than half a touch of mal de mer from the antic conduct of the outrigger on the blobby sea  the air was stagnant  in the lee of waihee between the white beach and the roof no whisper of breeze eased the still sultriness  i really think i was too miserable to summon the resolution to give up the fishing and go in to shore  lying back with closed eyes i lost count of time  i even forgot that kohokumu was chanting till reminded of it by his ceasing  an exclamation made me bare my eyes to the stab of the sun  he was gazing down through the waterglass  its a big one he said passing me the device and slipping over side feetfirst into the water  he went under without splash and ripple turned over and swam down i followed his progress through the waterglass which is merely an oblong box a couple of feet long open at the top the bottom sealed watertight with a sheet of ordinary glass  now kohokumu was a bore and i was squeamishly out of sorts with him for his volubleness but i could not help admiring him as i watched him go down  past seventy years of age lean as a toothpick and shrivelled like a mummy he was doing what few young athletes of my race would do or could do  it was forty feet to bottom  there partly exposed but mostly hidden under the bulge of a coral lump i could discern his objective  his keen eyes had caught the projecting tentacle of a squid  even as he swam the tentacle was lazily withdrawn so that there was no sign of the creature  but the brief exposure of the portion of one tentacle had advertised its owner as a squid of size  the pressure at a depth of forty feet is no joke for a young man yet it did not seem to inconvenience this oldster  i am certain it never crossed his mind to be inconvenienced  unarmed bare of body save for a brief malo or loin cloth he was undeterred by the formidable creature that constituted his prey  i saw him steady himself with his right hand on the coral lump and thrust his left arm into the hole to the shoulder  half a minute elapsed during which time he seemed to be groping and rooting around with his left hand  then tentacle after tentacle myriadsuckered and wildly waving emerged  laying hold of his arm they writhed and coiled about his flesh like so many snakes  with a heave and a jerk appeared the entire squid a proper devilfish or octopus  but the old man was in no hurry for his natural element the air above the water  there forty feet beneath wrapped about by an octopus that measured nine feet across from tentacletip to tentacletip and that could well drown the stoutest swimmer he coolly and casually did the one thing that gave to him and his empery over the monster  he shoved his lean hawklike face into the very centre of the slimy squirming mass and with his several ancient fangs bit into the heart and the life of the matter  this accomplished he came upward slowly as a swimmer should who is changing atmospheres from the depths  alongside the canoe still in the water and peeling off the grisly clinging thing the incorrigible old sinner burst into the pule of triumph which had been chanted by the countless squidcatching generations before him   o kanaloa of the taboo nights stand upright on the solid floor stand upon the floor where lies the squid stand up to take the squid of the deep sea rise up o kanaloa stir up  stir up  let the squid awake let the squid that lies flat awake  let the squid that lies spread out       i closed my eyes and ears not offering to lend him a hand secure in the knowledge that he could climb back unaided into the unstable craft without the slightest risk of upsetting it  a very fine squid he crooned  it is a wahine female squid i shall now sing to you the song of the cowrie shell the red cowrie shell that we used as a bait for the squid  you were disgraceful last night at the funeral i headed him off i heard all about it  you made much noise  you sang till everybody was deaf  you insulted the son of the widow  you drank swipes like a pig  swipes are not good for your extreme age  some day you will wake up dead  you ought to be a wreck today  ha he chuckled  and you who drank no swipes who was a babe unborn when i was already an old man who went to bed last night with the sun and the chickensthis day are you a wreck  explain me that  my ears are as thirsty to listen as was my throat thirsty last night  and here today behold i am as that englishman who came here in his yacht used to say i am in fine form in devilish fine form  i give you up i retorted shrugging my shoulders  only one thing is clear and that is that the devil doesnt want you report of your singing has gone before you  no he pondered the idea carefully  it is not that  the devil will be glad for my coming for i have some very fine songs for him and scandals and old gossips of the high aliis that will make him scratch his sides  so let me explain to you the secret of my birth  the sea is my mother  i was born in a doublecanoe during a kona gale in the channel of kahoolawe  from her the sea my mother i received my strength  whenever i return to her arms as for a breastclasp as i have returned this day i grow strong again and immediately  she to me is the milkgiver the life source  shades of antaeus thought i  some day old kohokumu rambled on when i am really old i shall be reported of men as drowned in the sea  this will be an idle thought of men  in truth i shall have returned into the arms of my mother there to rest under the heart of her breast until the second birth of me when i shall emerge into the sun a flashing youth of splendour like maui himself when he was golden young  a queer religion i commented  when i was younger i muddled my poor head over queerer religions old kohokumu retorted  but listen o young wise one to my elderly wisdom  this i know  as i grow old i seek less for the truth from without me and find more of the truth from within me why have i thought this thought of my return to my mother and of my rebirth from my mother into the sun  you do not know  i do not know save that without whisper of mans voice or printed word without prompting from otherwhere this thought has arisen from within me from the deeps of me that are as deep as the sea  i am not a god  i do not make things  therefore i have not made this thought  i do not know its father or its mother  it is of old time before me and therefore it is true  man does not make truth man if he be not blind only recognizes truth when he sees it  is this thought that i have thought a dream  perhaps it is you that are a dream i laughed  and that i and sky and sea and the ironhard land are dreams all dreams  i have often thought that he assured me soberly  it may well be so  last night i dreamed i was a lark bird a beautiful singing lark of the sky like the larks on the upland pastures of haleakala and i flew up up toward the sun singing singing as old kohokumu never sang  i tell you now that i dreamed i was a lark bird singing in the sky  but may not i the real i be the lark bird  and may not the telling of it be the dream that i the lark bird am dreaming now  who are you to tell me ay or no  dare you tell me i am not a lark bird asleep and dreaming that i am old kohokumu  i shrugged my shoulders and he continued triumphantly  and how do you know but what you are old maui himself asleep and dreaming that you are john lakana talking with me in a canoe  and may you not awake old maui yourself and scratch your sides and say that you had a funny dream in which you dreamed you were a haole  i dont know i admitted  besides you wouldnt believe me  there is much more in dreams than we know he assured me with great solemnity  dreams go deep all the way down maybe to before the beginning  may not old maui have only dreamed he pulled hawaii up from the bottom of the sea  then would this hawaii land be a dream and you and i and the squid there only parts of mauis dream  and the lark bird too  he sighed and let his head sink on his breast  and i worry my old head about the secrets undiscoverable he resumed until i grow tired and want to forget and so i drink swipes and go fishing and sing old songs and dream i am a lark bird singing in the sky  i like that best of all and often i dream it when i have drunk much swipes      in great dejection of mood he peered down into the lagoon through the waterglass  there will be no more bites for a while he announced  the fishsharks are prowling around and we shall have to wait until they are gone  and so that the time shall not be heavy i will sing you the canoehauling song to lono  you remember   give to me the trunk of the tree o lono give me the trees main root o lono give me the ear of the tree o lono   for the love of mercy dont sing i cut him short  ive got a headache and your singing hurts  you may be in devilish fine form today but your throat is rotten  id rather you talked about dreams or told me whoppers  it is too bad that you are sick and you so young he conceded cheerily  and i shall not sing any more  i shall tell you something you do not know and have never heard something that is no dream and no whopper but is what i know to have happened  not very long ago there lived here on the beach beside this very lagoon a young boy whose name was keikiwai which as you know means water baby  he was truly a water baby  his gods were the sea and fish gods and he was born with knowledge of the language of fishes which the fishes did not know until the sharks found it out one day when they heard him talk it  it happened this way  the word had been brought and the commands by swift runners that the king was making a progress around the island and that on the next day a luau feast was to be served him by the dwellers here of waihee  it was always a hardship when the king made a progress for the few dwellers in small places to fill his many stomachs with food  for he came always with his wife and her women with his priests and sorcerers his dancers and fluteplayers and hulasingers and fighting men and servants and his high chiefs with their wives and sorcerers and fighting men and servants  sometimes in small places like waihee the path of his journey was marked afterward by leanness and famine  but a king must be fed and it is not good to anger a king  so like warning in advance of disaster waihee heard of his coming and all food getters of field and pond and mountain and sea were busied with getting food for the feast  and behold everything was got from the choicest of royal taro to sugarcane joints for the roasting from opihis to limu from fowl to wild pig and poifed puppies everything save one thing  the fishermen failed to get lobsters  now be it known that the kings favourite food was lobster  he esteemed it above all kaikai food and his runners had made special mention of it  and there were no lobsters and it is not good to anger a king in the belly of him  too many sharks had come inside the reef  that was the trouble  a young girl and an old man had been eaten by them  and of the young men who dared dive for lobsters one was eaten and one lost an arm and another lost one hand and one foot  but there was keikiwai the water baby only eleven years old but half fish himself and talking the language of fishes  to his father the head men came begging him to send the water baby to get lobsters to fill the kings belly and divert his anger  now this what happened was known and observed  for the fishermen and their women and the tarogrowers and the birdcatchers and the head men and all waihee came down and stood back from the edge of the rock where the water baby stood and looked down at the lobsters far beneath on the bottom  and a shark looking up with its cats eyes observed him and sent out the sharkcall of fresh meat to assemble all the sharks in the lagoon  for the sharks work thus together which is why they are strong  and the sharks answered the call till there were forty of them long ones and short ones and lean ones and round ones forty of them by count and they talked to one another saying  look at that titbit of a child that morsel delicious of humanflesh sweetness without the salt of the sea in it of which salt we have too much savoury and good to eat melting to delight under our hearts as our bellies embrace it and extract from it its sweet  much more they said saying  he has come for the lobsters  when he dives in he is for one of us  not like the old man we ate yesterday tough to dryness with age nor like the young men whose members were too hardmuscled but tender so tender that he will melt in our gullets ere our bellies receive him  when he dives in we will all rush for him and the lucky one of us will get him and gulp he will be gone one bite and one swallow into the belly of the luckiest one of us  and keikiwai the water baby heard the conspiracy knowing the shark language and he addressed a prayer in the shark language to the shark god mokuhalii and the sharks heard and waved their tails to one another and winked their cats eyes in token that they understood his talk  and then he said  i shall now dive for a lobster for the king  and no hurt shall befall me because the shark with the shortest tail is my friend and will protect me  and so saying he picked up a chunk of lavarock and tossed it into the water with a big splash twenty feet to one side  the forty sharks rushed for the splash while he dived and by the time they discovered they had missed him he had gone to bottom and come back and climbed out within his hand a fat lobster a wahine lobster full of eggs for the king  ha said the sharks very angry  there is among us a traitor the titbit of a child the morsel of sweetness has spoken and has exposed the one among us who has saved him  let us now measure the lengths of our tails  which they did in a long row side by side the shortertailed ones cheating and stretching to gain length on themselves the longertailed ones cheating and stretching in order not to be out cheated and outstretched  they were very angry with the one with the shortest tail and him they rushed upon from every side and devoured till nothing was left of him  again they listened while they waited for the water baby to dive in  and again the water baby made his prayer in the shark language to mokuhalii and said  the shark with the shortest tail is my friend and will protect me  and again the water baby tossed in a chunk of lava this time twenty feet away off to the other side the sharks rushed for the splash and in their haste ran into one another and splashed with their tails till the water was all foam and they could see nothing each thinking some other was swallowing the titbit  and the water baby came up and climbed out with another fat lobster for the king  and the thirtynine sharks measured tails devoting the one with the shortest tail so that there were only thirtyeight sharks and the water baby continued to do what i have said and the sharks to do what i have told you while for each shark that was eaten by his brothers there was another fat lobster laid on the rock for the king  of course there was much quarrelling and argument among the sharks when it came to measuring tails but in the end it worked out in rightness and justice for when only two sharks were left they were the two biggest of the original forty  and the water baby again claimed the shark with the shortest tail was his friend fooled the two sharks with another lavachunk and brought up another lobster  the two sharks each claimed the other had the shorter tail and each fought to eat the other and the one with the longer tail won  hold o kohokumu i interrupted  remember that that shark had already  i know just what you are going to say he snatched his recital back from me  and you are right  it took him so long to eat the thirtyninth shark for inside the thirtyninth shark were already the nineteen other sharks he had eaten and inside the fortieth shark were already the nineteen other sharks he had eaten and he did not have the appetite he had started with  but do not forget he was a very big shark to begin with  it took him so long to eat the other shark and the nineteen sharks inside the other shark that he was still eating when darkness fell and the people of waihee went away home with all the lobsters for the king  and didnt they find the last shark on the beach next morning dead and burst wide open with all he had eaten  kohokumu fetched a full stop and held my eyes with his own shrewd ones  hold o lakana he checked the speech that rushed to my tongue i know what next you would say  you would say that with my own eyes i did not see this and therefore that i do not know what i have been telling you  but i do know and i can prove it  my fathers father knew the grandson of the water babys fathers uncle  also there on the rocky point to which i point my finger now is where the water baby stood and dived  i have dived for lobsters there myself  it is a great place for lobsters  also and often have i seen sharks there  and there on the bottom as i should know for i have seen and counted them are the thirty nine lavarocks thrown in by the water baby as i have described  but i began  ha he baffled me  look  while we have talked the fish have begun again to bite  he pointed to three of the bamboo poles erect and devildancing in token that fish were hooked and struggling on the lines beneath as he bent to his paddle he muttered for my benefit  of course i know  the thirtynine lava rocks are still there you can count them any day for yourself  of course i know and i know for a fact  glen ellen october 2 1916    the tears of ah kim    there was a great noise and racket but no scandal in honolulus chinatown  those within hearing distance merely shrugged their shoulders and smiled tolerantly at the disturbance as an affair of accustomed usualness  what is it asked chin mo down with a sharp pleurisy of his wife who had paused for a second at the open window to listen  only ah kim was her reply  his mother is beating him again  the fracas was taking place in the garden behind the living rooms that were at the back of the store that fronted on the street with the proud sign above  ah kim company general merchandise  the garden was a miniature domain twenty feet square that somehow cunningly seduced the eye into a sense and seeming of illimitable vastness  there were forests of dwarf pines and oaks centuries old yet two or three feet in height and imported at enormous care and expense  a tiny bridge a pace across arched over a miniature river that flowed with rapids and cataracts from a miniature lake stocked with myriadfinned orangemiracled goldfish that in proportion to the lake and landscape were whales  on every side the many windows of the severalstoried shackbuildings looked down  in the centre of the garden on the narrow gravelled walk close beside the lake ah kim was noisily receiving his beating  no chinese lad of tender and beatable years was ah kim  his was the store of ah kim company and his was the achievement of building it up through the long years from the shoestring of savings of a contract coolie labourer to a bank account in four figures and a credit that was gilt edged  an even halfcentury of summers and winters had passed over his head and in the passing fattened him comfortably and snugly  short of stature his full front was as rotund as a watermelon seed  his face was moon faced  his garb was dignified and silken and his blacksilk skullcap with the red button atop now alas fallen on the ground was the skullcap worn by the successful and dignified merchants of his race  but his appearance in this moment of the present was anything but dignified  dodging and ducking under a rain of blows from a bamboo cane he was crouched over in a halfdoubled posture  when he was rapped on the knuckles and elbows with which he shielded his face and head his winces were genuine and involuntary  from the many surrounding windows the neighbourhood looked down with placid enjoyment  and she who wielded the stick so shrewdly from long practice seventyfour years old she looked every minute of her time  her thin legs were encased in straightlined pants of linen stiff textured and shinyblack  her scraggly grey hair was drawn unrelentingly and flatly back from a narrow unrelenting forehead eyebrows she had none having long since shed them  her eyes of pinhole tininess were blackest black  she was shockingly cadaverous  her shrivelled forearm exposed by the loose sleeve possessed no more of muscle than several taut bowstrings stretched across meagre bone under yellow parchmentlike skin  along this mummy arm jade bracelets shot up and down and clashed with every blow  ah she cried out rhythmically accenting her blows in series of three to each shrill observation  i forbade you to talk to li faa  today you stopped on the street with her  not an hour ago half an hour by the clock you talkedwhat is that  it was the thriceaccursed telephone ah kim muttered while she suspended the stick to catch what he said  mrs chang lucy told you  i know she did  i saw her see me  i shall have the telephone taken out  it is of the devil  it is a device of all the devils mrs tai fu agreed taking a fresh grip on the stick  yet shall the telephone remain  i like to talk with mrs chang lucy over the telephone  she has the eyes of ten thousand cats quoth ah kim ducking and receiving the stick stinging on his knuckles  and the tongues of ten thousand toads he supplemented ere his next duck  she is an impudentfaced and evilmannered hussy mrs tai fu accented  mrs chang lucy was ever that ah kim murmured like the dutiful son he was  i speak of li faa his mother corrected with stick emphasis she is only half chinese as you know  her mother was a shameless kanaka  she wears skirts like the degraded haole womenalso corsets as i have seen for myself  where are her children  yet has she buried two husbands  the one was drowned the other kicked by a horse ah kim qualified  a year of her unworthy son of a noble father and you would gladly be going out to get drowned or be kicked by a horse  subdued chucklings and laughter from the window audience applauded her point  you buried two husbands yourself revered mother ah kim was stung to retort  i had the good taste not to marry a third  besides my two husbands died honourably in their beds  they were not kicked by horses nor drowned at sea  what business is it of our neighbours that you should inform them i have had two husbands or ten or none  you have made a scandal of me before all our neighbours and for that i shall now give you a real beating  ah kim endured the staccato rain of blows and said when his mother paused breathless and weary  always have i insisted and pleaded honourable mother that you beat me in the house with the windows and doors closed tight and not in the open street or the garden open behind the house  you have called this unthinkable li faa the silvery moon blossom mrs tai fu rejoined quite illogically and femininely but with utmost success in so far as she deflected her son from continuance of the thrust he had so swiftly driven home  mrs chang lucy told you he charged  i was told over the telephone his mother evaded  i do not know all voices that speak to me over that contrivance of all the devils  strangely ah kim made no effort to run away from his mother which he could easily have done  she on the other hand found fresh cause for more stick blows  ah  stubborn one  why do you not cry  mule that shameth its ancestors  never have i made you cry  from the time you were a little boy i have never made you cry  answer me  why do you not cry  weak and breathless from her exertions she dropped the stick and panted and shook as if with a nervous palsy  i do not know except that it is my way ah kim replied gazing solicitously at his mother  i shall bring you a chair now and you will sit down and rest and feel better  but she flung away from him with a snort and tottered agedly across the garden into the house  meanwhile recovering his skullcap and smoothing his disordered attire ah kim rubbed his hurts and gazed after her with eyes of devotion  he even smiled and almost might it appear that he had enjoyed the beating   ah kim had been so beaten ever since he was a boy when he lived on the high banks of the eleventh cataract of the yangtse river  here his father had been born and toiled all his days from young manhood as a towing coolie  when he died ah kim in his own young manhood took up the same honourable profession  farther back than all remembered annals of the family had the males of it been towing coolies  at the time of christ his direct ancestors had been doing the same thing meeting the precisely similarly modelled junks below the white water at the foot of the canyon bending the halfmile of rope to each junk and according to size tailing on from a hundred to two hundred coolies of them and by sheer two legged manpower bowed forward and down till their hands touched the ground and their faces were sometimes within a foot of it dragging the junk up through the white water to the head of the canyon  apparently down all the intervening centuries the payment of the trade had not picked up  his father his fathers father and himself ah kim had received the same invariable remunerationper junk onefourteenth of a cent at the rate he had since learned money was valued in hawaii  on long lucky summer days when the waters were easy the junks many the hours of daylight sixteen sixteen hours of such heroic toil would earn over a cent  but in a whole year a towing coolie did not earn more than a dollar and a half  people could and did live on such an income  there were women servants who received a yearly wage of a dollar  the net makers of ti wi earned between a dollar and two dollars a year they lived on such wages or at least they did not die on them but for the towing coolies there were pickings which were what made the profession honourable and the guild a close and hereditary corporation or labour union  one junk in five that was dragged up through the rapids or lowered down was wrecked  one junk in every ten was a total loss  the coolies of the towing guild knew the freaks and whims of the currents and grappled and raked and netted a wet harvest from the river  they of the guild were looked up to by lesser coolies for they could afford to drink brick tea and eat number four rice every day  and ah kim had been contented and proud until one bitter spring day of driving sleet and hail he dragged ashore a drowning cantonese sailor  it was this wanderer thawing out by his fire who first named the magic name hawaii to him  he had himself never been to that labourers paradise said the sailor but many chinese had gone there from canton and he had heard the talk of their letters written back  in hawaii was never frost nor famine  the very pigs never fed were ever fat of the generous offal disdained by man  a cantonese or yangtse family could live on the waste of an hawaii coolie  and wages  in gold dollars ten a month or in trade dollars two a month was what the contract chinese coolie received from the whitedevil sugar kings  in a year the coolie received the prodigious sum of two hundred and forty trade dollars more than a hundred times what a coolie toiling ten times as hard received on the eleventh cataract of the yangtse  in short all things considered an hawaii coolie was one hundred times better off and when the amount of labour was estimated a thousand times better off  in addition was the wonderful climate  when ah kim was twentyfour despite his mothers pleadings and beatings he resigned from the ancient and honourable guild of the eleventh cataract towing coolies left his mother to go into a boss coolies household as a servant for a dollar a year and an annual dress to cost not less than thirty cents and himself departed down the yangtse to the great sea  many were his adventures and severe his toils and hardships ere as a saltsea junksailor he won to canton  when he was twentysix he signed five years of his life and labour away to the hawaii sugar kings and departed one of eight hundred contract coolies for that far island land on a festering steamer run by a crazy captain and drunken officers and rejected of lloyds  honourable among labourers had ah kims rating been as a towing coolie  in hawaii receiving a hundred times more pay he found himself looked down upon as the lowest of the lowa plantation coolie than which could be nothing lower  but a coolie whose ancestors had towed junks up the eleventh cataract of the yangtse since before the birth of christ inevitably inherits one character in large degree namely the character of patience  this patience was ah kims  at the end of five years his compulsory servitude over thin as ever in body in bank account he lacked just ten trade dollars of possessing a thousand trade dollars  on this sum he could have gone back to the yangtse and retired for life a really wealthy man  he would have possessed a larger sum had he not on occasion conservatively played che fa and fan tan and had he not for a twelvemonth toiled among the centipedes and scorpions of the stifling canefields in the semidream of a continuous opium debauch  why he had not toiled the whole five years under the spell of opium was the expensiveness of the habit he had had no moral scruples  the drug had cost too much  but ah kim did not return to china  he had observed the business life of hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition  for six months in order to learn business and english at the bottom he clerked in the plantation store  at the end of this time he knew more about that particular store than did ever plantation manager know about any plantation store  when he resigned his position he was receiving forty gold a month or eighty trade and he was beginning to put on flesh  also his attitude toward mere contract coolies had become distinctively aristocratic  the manager offered to raise him to sixty fold which by the year would constitute a fabulous fourteen hundred and forty trade or seven hundred times his annual earning on the yangtse as a twolegged horse at one fourteenth of a gold cent per junk  instead of accepting ah kim departed to honolulu and in the big general merchandise store of fong  chow fong began at the bottom for fifteen gold per month  he worked a year and a half and resigned when he was thirtythree despite the seventyfive gold per month his chinese employers were paying him  then it was that he put up his own sign  ah kim company general merchandise also better fed there was about his less meagre figure a foreshadowing of the melonseed rotundity that was to attach to him in future years  with the years he prospered increasingly so that when he was thirtysix the promise of his figure was fulfilling rapidly and himself a member of the exclusive and powerful hai gum tong and of the chinese merchants association he was accustomed to sitting as host at dinners that cost him as much as thirty years of towing on the eleventh cataract would have earned him  two things he missed a wife and his mother to lay the stick on him as of yore  when he was thirtyseven he consulted his bank balance  it stood him three thousand gold  for twentyfive hundred down and an easy mortgage he could buy the threestory shackbuilding and the ground in fee simple on which it stood  but to do this left only five hundred for a wife  fu yee po had a marriageable properly smallfooted daughter whom he was willing to import from china and sell to him for eight hundred gold plus the costs of importation further fu yee po was even willing to take five hundred down and the remainder on note at 6 per cent  ah kim thirtyseven years of age fat and a bachelor really did want a wife especially a smallfooted wife for china born and reared the immemorial smallfooted female had been deeply impressed into his fantasy of woman  but more even more and far more than a smallfooted wife did he want his mother and his mothers delectable beatings  so he declined fu yee pos easy terms and at much less cost imported his own mother from servant in a boss coolies house at a yearly wage of a dollar and a thirty cent dress to be mistress of his honolulu threestory shack building with two household servants three clerks and a porter of all work under her to say nothing of ten thousand dollars worth of dress goods on the shelves that ranged from the cheapest cotton crepes to the most expensive handembroidered silks  for be it known that even in that early day ah kims emporium was beginning to cater to the tourist trade from the states  for thirteen years ah kim had lived tolerably happily with his mother and by her been methodically beaten for causes just or unjust real or fancied and at the end of it all he knew as strongly as ever the ache of his heart and head for a wife and of his loins for sons to live after him and carry on the dynasty of ah kim company  such the dream that has ever vexed men from those early ones who first usurped a hunting right monopolized a sandbar for a fishtrap or stormed a village and put the males thereof to the sword  kings millionaires and chinese merchants of honolulu have this in common despite that they may praise god for having made them differently and in selflikable images  and the ideal of woman that ah kim at fifty ached for had changed from his ideal at thirtyseven  no smallfooted wife did he want now but a free natural outstepping normalfooted woman that somehow appeared to him in his day dreams and haunted his night visions in the form of li faa the silvery moon blossom  what if she were twice widowed the daughter of a kanaka mother the wearer of whitedevil skirts and corsets and highheeled slippers  he wanted her  it seemed it was written that she should be joint ancestor with him of the line that would continue the ownership and management through the generations of ah kim company general merchandise   i will have no halfpake daughterinlaw his mother often reiterated to ah kim pake being the hawaiian word for chinese all pake must my daughterinlaw be even as you my son and as i your mother  and she must wear trousers my son as all the women of our family before her  no woman in shedevil skirts and corsets can pay due reverence to our ancestors  corsets and reverence do not go together  such a one is this shameless li faa she is impudent and independent and will be neither obedient to her husband nor her husbands mother  this brazenfaced li faa would believe herself the source of life and the first ancestor recognizing no ancestors before her  she laughs at our joss sticks and paper prayers and family gods as i have been well told  mrs chang lucy ah kim groaned  not alone mrs chang lucy o son  i have inquired  at least a dozen have heard her say of our joss house that it is all monkey foolishness  the words are hersshe who eats raw fish raw squid and baked dog  ours is the foolishness of monkeys  yet would she marry you a monkey because of your store that is a palace and of the wealth that makes you a great man  and she would put shame on me and on your father before you long honourably dead  and there was no discussing the matter  as things were ah kim knew his mother was right  not for nothing had li faa been born forty years before of a chinese father renegade to all tradition and of a kanaka mother whose immediate forebears had broken the taboos cast down their own polynesian gods and weakheartedly listened to the preaching about the remote and unimageable god of the christian missionaries  li faa educated who could read and write english and hawaiian and a fair measure of chinese claimed to believe in nothing although in her secret heart she feared the kahunas hawaiian witchdoctors who she was certain could charm away ill luck or pray one to death  li faa would never come into ah kims house as he thoroughly knew and kowtow to his mother and be slave to her in the immemorial chinese way  li faa from the chinese angle was a new woman a feminist who rode horseback astride disported immodestly garbed at waikiki on the surfboards and at more than one luau feast had been known to dance the hula with the worst and in excess of the worst to the scandalous delight of all  ah kim himself a generation younger than his mother had been bitten by the acid of modernity  the old order held in so far as he still felt in his subtlest crypts of being the dusty hand of the past resting on him residing in him yet he subscribed to heavy policies of fire and life insurance acted as treasurer for the local chinese revolutionises that were for turning the celestial empire into a republic contributed to the funds of the hawaiiborn chinese baseball nine that excelled the yankee nines at their own game talked theosophy with katso suguri the japanese buddhist and silk importer fell for police graft played and paid his insidious share in the democratic politics of annexed hawaii and was thinking of buying an automobile  ah kim never dared bare himself to himself and thrash out and winnow out how much of the old he had ceased to believe in  his mother was of the old yet he revered her and was happy under her bamboo stick  li faa the silvery moon blossom was of the new yet he could never be quite completely happy without her  for he loved li faa  moonfaced rotund as a watermelon seed canny business man wise with half a century of living nevertheless ah kim became an artist when he thought of her  he thought of her in poems of names as woman transmuted into flower terms of beauty and philosophic abstractions of achievement and easement  she was to him and alone to him of all men in the world his plum blossom his tranquillity of woman his flower of serenity his moon lily and his perfect rest  and as he murmured these love endearments of namings it seemed to him that in them were the ripplings of running waters the tinklings of silver wind bells and the scents of the oleander and the jasmine  she was his poem of woman a lyric delight a threedimensions of flesh and spirit delicious a fate and a good fortune written ere the first man and woman were by the gods whose whim had been to make all men and women for sorrow and for joy  but his mother put into his hand the inkbrush and placed under it on the table the writing tablet  paint said she the ideograph of to marry  he obeyed scarcely wondering with the deft artistry of his race and training painting the symbolic hieroglyphic  resolve it commanded his mother  ah kim looked at her curious willing to please unaware of the drift of her intent  of what is it composed she persisted  what are the three originals the sum of which is it  to marry marriage the coming together and wedding of a man and a woman  paint them paint them apart the three originals unrelated so that we may know how the wise men of old wisely built up the ideograph of to marry  and ah kim obeying and painting saw that what he had painted were three picturesignsthe picturesigns of a hand an ear and a woman  name them said his mother and he named them  it is true said she  it is a great tale  it is the stuff of the painted pictures of marriage  such marriage was in the beginning such shall it always be in my house  the hand of the man takes the womans ear and by it leads her away to his house where she is to be obedient to him and to his mother  i was taken by the ear so by your long honourably dead father  i have looked at your hand  it is not like his hand  also have i looked at the ear of li faa  never will you lead her by the ear  she has not that kind of an ear  i shall live a long time yet and i will be mistress in my sons house after our ancient way until i die   but she is my revered ancestress ah kim explained to li faa  he was timidly unhappy for li faa having ascertained that mrs tai fu was at the temple of the chinese aesculapius making a food offering of dried duck and prayers for her declining health had taken advantage of the opportunity to call upon him in his store  li faa pursed her insolent unpainted lips into the form of a half opened rosebud and replied  that will do for china  i do not know china  this is hawaii and in hawaii the customs of all foreigners change  she is nevertheless my ancestress ah kim protested the mother who gave me birth whether i am in china or hawaii o silvery moon blossom that i want for wife  i have had two husbands li faa stated placidly  one was a pake one was a portuguese  i learned much from both  also am i educated  i have been to high school and i have played the piano in public  and i learned from my two husbands much  the pake makes the best husband  never again will i marry anything but a pake  but he must not take me by the ear  how do you know of that he broke in suspiciously  mrs chang lucy was the reply  mrs chang lucy tells me everything that your mother tells her and your mother tells her much  so let me tell you that mine is not that kind of an ear  which is what my honoured mother has told me ah kim groaned  which is what your honoured mother told mrs chang lucy which is what mrs chang lucy told me li faa completed equably  and i now tell you o third husband to be that the man is not born who will lead me by the ear  it is not the way in hawaii  i will go only hand in hand with my man side by side fiftyfifty as is the haole slang just now  my portuguese husband thought different  he tried to beat me  i landed him three times in the police court and each time he worked out his sentence on the reef  after that he got drowned  my mother has been my mother for fifty years ah kim declared stoutly  and for fifty years has she beaten you li faa giggled  how my father used to laugh at yap ten shin  like you yap ten shin had been born in china and had brought the china customs with him his old father was for ever beating him with a stick  he loved his father  but his father beat him harder than ever when he became a missionary pake  every time he went to the missionary services his father beat him  and every time the missionary heard of it he was harsh in his language to yap ten shin for allowing his father to beat him  and my father laughed and laughed for my father was a very liberal pake who had changed his customs quicker than most foreigners  and all the trouble was because yap ten shin had a loving heart  he loved his honourable father  he loved the god of love of the christian missionary  but in the end in me he found the greatest love of all which is the love of woman  in me he forgot his love for his father and his love for the loving christ  and he offered my father six hundred gold for methe price was small because my feet were not small  but i was half kanaka  i said that i was not a slavewoman and that i would be sold to no man  my highschool teacher was a haole old maid who said love of woman was so beyond price that it must never be sold  perhaps that is why she was an old maid  she was not beautiful  she could not give herself away  my kanaka mother said it was not the kanaka way to sell their daughters for a money price  they gave their daughters for love and she would listen to reason if yap ten shin provided luaus in quantity and quality  my pake father as i have told you was liberal  he asked me if i wanted yap ten shin for my husband  and i said yes and freely of myself i went to him  he it was who was kicked by a horse but he was a very good husband before he was kicked by the horse  as for you ah kim you shall always be honourable and lovable for me and some day when it is not necessary for you to take me by the ear i shall marry you and come here and be with you always and you will be the happiest pake in all hawaii for i have had two husbands and gone to high school and am most wise in making a husband happy  but that will be when your mother has ceased to beat you  mrs chang lucy tells me that she beats you very hard  she does ah kim affirmed  behold  he thrust back his loose sleeves exposing to the elbow his smooth and cherubic forearms they were mantled with black and blue marks that advertised the weight and number of blows so shielded from his head and face  but she has never made me cry ah kim disclaimed hastily never from the time i was a little boy has she made me cry  so mrs chang lucy says li faa observed  she says that your honourable mother often complains to her that she has never made you cry  a sibilant warning from one of his clerks was too late  having regained the house by way of the back alley mrs tai fu emerged right upon them from out of the living apartments  never had ah kim seen his mothers eyes so blazing furious  she ignored li faa as she screamed at him  now will i make you cry  as never before shall i beat you until you do cry  then let us go into the back rooms honourable mother ah kim suggested  we will close the windows and the doors and there may you beat me  no  here shall you be beaten before all the world and this shameless woman who would with her own hand take you by the ear and call such sacrilege marriage  stay shameless woman  i am going to stay anyway said li faa  she favoured the clerks with a truculent stare  and id like to see anything less than the police put me out of here  you will never be my daughterinlaw mrs tai fu snapped  li faa nodded her head in agreement  but just the same she added shall your son be my third husband  you mean when i am dead the old mother screamed  the sun rises each morning li faa said enigmatically  all my life have i seen it rise  you are forty and you wear corsets  but i do not dye my hairthat will come later li faa calmly retorted  as to my age you are right  i shall be fortyone next kamehameha day  for forty years i have seen the sun rise  my father was an old man  before he died he told me that he had observed no difference in the rising of the sun since when he was a little boy  the world is round  confucius did not know that but you will find it in all the geography books  the world is round ever it turns over on itself over and over and around and around and the times and seasons of weather and life turn with it  what is has been before  what has been will be again  the time of the breadfruit and the mango ever recurs and man and woman repeat themselves  the robins nest and in the springtime the plovers come from the north  every spring is followed by another spring the coconut palm rises into the air ripens its fruit and departs but always are there more coconut palms  this is not all my own smart talk  much of it my father told me  proceed honourable mrs tai fu and beat your son who is my third husband to be  but i shall laugh  i warn you i shall laugh  ah kim dropped down on his knees so as to give his mother every advantage  and while she rained blows upon him with the bamboo stick li faa smiled and giggled and finally burst into laughter  harder o honourable mrs tai fu li faa urged between paroxysms of mirth  mrs tai fu did her best which was notably weak until she observed what made her drop the stick by her side in amazement  ah kim was crying  down both cheeks great round tears were coursing li faa was amazed  so were the gaping clerks  most amazed of all was ah kim yet he could not help himself and although no further blows fell he cried steadily on  but why did you cry li faa demanded often of ah kim  it was so perfectly foolish a thing to do  she was not even hurting you  wait until we are married was ah kims invariable reply and then o moon lily will i tell you   two years later one afternoon more like a watermelon seed in configuration than ever ah kim returned home from a meeting of the chinese protective association to find his mother dead on her couch  narrower and more unrelenting than ever were the forehead and the brushedback hair  but on her face was a withered smile the gods had been kind  she had passed without pain  he telephoned first of all to li faas number but did not find her until he called up mrs chang lucy  the news given the marriage was dated ahead with ten times the brevity of the oldline chinese custom  and if there be anything analogous to a bridesmaid in a chinese wedding mrs chang lucy was just that  why li faa asked ah kim when alone with him on their wedding night why did you cry when your mother beat you that day in the store  you were so foolish  she was not even hurting you  that is why i cried answered ah kim  li faa looked up at him without understanding  i cried he explained because i suddenly knew that my mother was nearing her end  there was no weight no hurt in her blows i cried because i knew she no longer had strength enough to hurt me  that is why i cried my flower of serenity my perfect rest that is the only reason why i cried  waikiki honolulu june 16 1916    the kanaka surf    the tourist women under the hau tree arbour that lines the moana hotel beach gasped when lee barton and his wife ida emerged from the bathhouse  and as the pair walked past them and down to the sand they continued to gasp  not that there was anything about lee barton provocative of gasps  the tourist women were not of the sort to gasp at sight of a mere mans swimmingsuited body no matter with what swelling splendour of line and muscle such body was invested  nevertheless trainers and conditioners of men would have drawn deep breaths of satisfaction at contemplation of the physical spectacle of him  but they would not have gasped in the way the women did whose gasps were indicative of moral shock  ida barton was the cause of their perturbation and disapproval they disapproved seriously so at the first instants glimpse of her  they thoughtsuch ardent selfdeceivers were theythat they were shocked by her swimming suit  but freud has pointed out how persons where sex is involved are prone sincerely to substitute one thing for another thing and to agonize over the substituted thing as strenuously as if it were the real thing  ida bartons swimming suit was a very nice one as womens suits go  of thinnest of firmwoven black wool with white trimmings and a white beltline it was highthroated shortsleeved and brief skirted  brief as was the skirt the legtights were no less brief  yet on the beach in front of the adjacent outrigger club and entering and leaving the water a score of women not provoking gasping notice were more daringly garbed  their mens suits as brief of legtights and skirts fitted them as snugly but were sleeveless after the way of mens suits the armholes deeply low cut and incut and by the exposed armpits advertiseful that the wearers were accustomed to 1916 decollete  so it was not ida bartons suit although the women deceived themselves into thinking it was  it was first of all say her legs or first of all say the totality of her the sweet and brilliant jewel of her femininity bursting upon them  dowager matron and maid conserving their softfat muscles or protecting their hothouse complexions in the shade of the hautree arbour felt the immediate challenge of her  she was menace as well an affront of superiority in their own chosen and variously successful game of life  but they did not say it  they did not permit themselves to think it  they thought it was the suit and said so to one another ignoring the twenty women more daringly clad but less perilously beautiful  could one have winnowed out of the souls of these disapproving ones what lay at bottom of their condemnation of her suit it would have been found to be the sexjealous thought  that no woman so beautiful as this one should be permitted to show her beauty  it was not fair to them  what chance had they in the conquering of males with so dangerous a rival in the foreground  they were justified  as stanley patterson said to his wife where the two of them lolled wet in the sand by the tiny freshwater stream that the bartons waded in order to gain the outrigger club beach  lord god of models and marvels behold them  my dear did you ever see two such legs on one small woman  look at the roundness and taperingness  theyre boys legs  ive seen featherweights go into the ring with legs like those  and theyre allwomans legs too  never mistake them in the world  the arc of the front line of that upper leg  and the balanced adequate fullness at the back and the way the opposing curves slender in to the knee that is a knee  makes my fingers itch  wish i had some clay right now  its a true human knee his wife concurred no less breathlessly for like her husband she was a sculptor  look at the joint of it working under the skin  its got form and blessedly is not covered by a bag of fat  she paused to sigh thinking of her own knees  its correct and beautiful and dainty  charm  if ever i beheld the charm of flesh it is now  i wonder who she is  stanley patterson gazing ardently took up his half of the chorus  notice that the round musclepads on the inner sides that make most women appear knockkneed are missing  theyre boys legs firm and sure  and sweet womans legs soft and round his wife hastened to balance  and look stanley  see how she walks on the balls of her feet  it makes her seem light as swans down  each step seems just a little above the earth and each other step seems just a little higher above until you get the impression she is flying or just about to rise and begin flying      so stanley and mrs patterson  but they were artists with eyes therefore unlike the next batteries of human eyes ida barton was compelled to run and that laired on the outrigger lanais verandas and in the hautree shade of the closely adjoining seaside  the majority of the outrigger audience was composed not of tourist guests but of club members and oldtimers in hawaii and even the oldtimes women gasped  its positively indecent said mrs hanley black to her husband herself a toostoutinthemiddle matron of fortyfive who had been born in the hawaiian islands and who had never heard of ostend  hanley black surveyed his wifes criminal shapelessness and voluminousness of antediluvian newengland swimming dress with a withering contemplative eye  they had been married a sufficient number of years for him frankly to utter his judgment  that strange womans suit makes your own look indecent  you appear as a creature shameful under a grotesqueness of apparel striving to hide some secret awfulness  she carries her body like a spanish dancer mrs patterson said to her husband for the pair of them had waded the little stream in pursuit of the vision  by george she does stanley patterson concurred  reminds me of estrellita  torso just well enough forward slender waist not too lean in the stomach and with muscles like some lad boxers armouring that stomach to fearlessness  she has to have them to carry herself that way and to balance the back muscles  see that muscled curve of the back  its estrellitas  how tall would you say his wife queried  there she deceives was the appraised answer  she might be fivefeetone or fivefeetthree or four  its that way she has of walking that you described as almost about to fly  yes thats it mrs patterson concurred  its her energy her seemingness of being on tip toe with rising vitality  stanley patterson considered for a space  thats it he enounced  she is a little thing  ill give her fivetwo in her stockings  and ill weigh her a mere one hundred and ten or eight or fifteen at the outside  she wont weigh a hundred and ten his wife declared with conviction  and with her clothes on plus her carriage which is builded of her vitality and will ill wager shed never impress any one with her smallness  i know her type his wife nodded  you meet her out and you have the sense that while not exactly a fine large woman shes a whole lot larger than the average  and now age  ill give you best there he parried  she might be twentyfive she might be twentyeight      but stanley patterson had impolitely forgotten to listen  its not her legs alone he cried on enthusiastically  its the all of her  look at the delicacy of that forearm  and the swell of line to the shoulder  and that biceps  its alive  dollars to drowned kittens she can flex a respectable knot of it       no woman much less an ida barton could have been unconscious of the effect she was producing along waikiki beach  instead of making her happy in the small vanity way it irritated her  the cats she laughed to her husband  and to think i was born here an almost even third of a century ago  but they werent nasty then  maybe because there werent any tourists  why lee i learned to swim right here on this beach in front of the outrigger we used to come out with daddy for vacations and for weekends and sort of camp out in a grass house that stood right where the outrigger ladies serve tea now  and centipedes fell out of the thatch on us while we slept and we all ate poi and opihis and raw aku and nobody wore much of anything for the swimming and squidding and there was no real road to town  i remember times of big rain when it was so flooded we had to go in by canoe out through the reef and in by honolulu harbour  remember lee barton added it was just about that time that the youngster that became me arrived here for a few weeks stay on our way around  i must have seen you on the beach at that very time one of the kiddies that swam like fishes  why merciful me the women here were all riding crosssaddle and that was long before the rest of the social female world outgrew its immodesty and came around to sitting simultaneously on both sides of a horse  i learned to swim on the beach here at that time myself  you and i may even have tried bodysurfing on the same waves or i may have splashed a handful of water into your mouth and been rewarded by your sticking out your tongue at me  interrupted by an audible gasp of shock from a spinsterappearing female sunning herself hard by and angularly in the sand in a swimming suit monstrously unbeautiful lee barton was aware of an involuntary and almost perceptible stiffening on the part of his wife  i smile with pleasure he told her  it serves only to make your valiant little shoulders the more valiant  it may make you self conscious but it likewise makes you absurdly selfconfident  for be it known in advance lee barton was a superman and ida barton a superwomanor at least they were personalities so designated by the cub bookreviewers flatfloor men and women and scholastically emasculated critics who from across the dreary levels of their living can descry no glorious humans overtopping their horizons  these dreary folk echoes of the dead past and importunate and selfelected pallbearers for the present and future proxylivers of life and vicarious sensualists that they are in a eunuch sort of way insist since their own selves environments and narrow agitations of the quick are mediocre and commonplace that no man or woman can rise above the mediocre and commonplace  lacking gloriousness in themselves they deny gloriousness to all mankind too cowardly for whimsy and derringdo they assert whimsy and derringdo ceased at the very latest no later than the middle ages flickering little tapers themselves their feeble eyes are dazzled to unseeingness of the flaming conflagrations of other souls that illumine their skies  possessing power in no greater quantity than is the just due of pygmies they cannot conceive of power greater in others than in themselves  in those days there were giants but as their mouldy books tell them the giants are long since passed and only the bones of them remain  never having seen the mountains there are no mountains  in the mud of their complacently perpetuated barnyard pond they assert that no brightbrowed brightapparelled shining figures can be outside of fairy books old histories and ancient superstitions  never having seen the stars they deny the stars never having glimpsed the shining ways nor the mortals that tread them they deny the existence of the shinning ways as well as the existence of the highbright mortals who adventure along the shining ways  the narrow pupils of their eyes the centre of the universe they image the universe in terms of themselves of their meagre personalities make pitiful yardsticks with which to measure the highbright souls saying  thus long are all souls and no longer it is impossible that there should exist greaterstatured souls than we are and our gods know that we are great of stature   but all or nearly all on the beach forgave ida barton her suit and form when she took the water  a touch of her hand on her husbands arm indication and challenge in her laughing face and the two ran as one for half a dozen paces and leapt as one from the hardwet sand of the beach their bodies describing flat arches of flight ere the water was entered  there are two surfs at waikiki  the big bearded man surf that roars far out beyond the divingstage the smaller gentler wahine or woman surf that breaks upon the shore itself  here is a great shallowness where one may wade a hundred or several hundred feet to get beyond depth  yet with a good surf on outside the wahine surf can break three or four feet so that close in against the shore the hardsand bottom may be three feet or three inches under the welter of surface foam  to dive from the beach into this to fly into the air off racing feet turn in mid flight so that heels are up and head is down and so to enter the water headfirst requires wisdom of waves timing of waves and a trained deftness in entering such unstable depths of water with pretty unapprehensive headfirst cleavage while at the same time making the shallowest possible of dives  it is a sweet and pretty and daring trick not learned in a day nor learned at all without many a milder bump on the bottom or close shave of fractured skull or broken neck  here on the spot where the bartons so beautifully dived two days before a stanford track athlete had broken his neck  his had been an error in timing the rise and subsidence of a wahine wave  a professional mrs hanley black sneered to her husband at ida bartons feat  some vaudeville tank girl was one of the similar remarks with which the women in the shade complacently reassured one another finding by way of the weird mental processes of selfillusion a great satisfaction in the money castedistinction between one who worked for what she ate and themselves who did not work for what they ate  it was a day of heavy surf on waikiki  in the wahine surf it was boisterous enough for good swimmers  but out beyond in the kanaka or man surf no one ventured  not that the score or more of young surfriders loafing on the beach could not venture there or were afraid to venture there but because their biggest outrigger canoes would have been swamped and their surfboards would have been overwhelmed in the tooimmense overtopple and downfall of the thundering monsters  they themselves most of them could have swum for man can swim through breakers which canoes and surfboards cannot surmount but to ride the backs of the waves rise out of the foam to stand full length in the air above and with heels winged with the swiftness of horses to fly shoreward was what made sport for them and brought them out from honolulu to waikiki  the captain of number nine canoe himself a charter member of the outrigger and a manytimes medallist in longdistance swimming had missed seeing the bartons take the water and first glimpsed them beyond the last festoon of bathers clinging to the lifelines from then on from his vantage of the upstairs lanai he kept his eyes on them  when they continued out past the steel divingstage where a few of the hardiest divers disported he muttered vexedly under his breath damned malahinis  now malahini means newcomer tenderfoot and despite the prettiness of their stroke he knew that none except malahinis would venture into the racing channel beyond the divingstage hence the vexation of the captain of number nine  he descended to the beach with a low word here and there picked a crew of the strongest surfers and returned to the lanai with a pair of binoculars  quite casually the crew six of them carried number nine to the waters edge saw paddles and everything in order for a quick launching and lolled about carelessly on the sand  they were guilty of not advertising that anything untoward was afoot although they did steal glances up to their captain straining through the binoculars  what made the channel was the freshwater stream  coral cannot abide fresh water  what made the channel race was the immense shoreward surffling of the sea  unable to remain flung up on the beach pounded ever back toward the beach by the perpetual shoreward rush of the kanaka surf the uppiled water escaped to the sea by way of the channel and in the form of undertow along the bottom under the breakers  even in the channel the waves broke big but not with the magnificent bigness of terror as to right and left  so it was that a canoe or a comparatively strong swimmer could dare the channel  but the swimmer must be a strong swimmer indeed who could successfully buck the current in  wherefore the captain of number nine continued his vigil and his muttered damnation of malahinis disgustedly sure that these two malahinis would compel him to launch number nine and go after them when they found the current too strong to swim in against  as for himself caught in their predicament he would have veered to the left toward diamond head and come in on the shoreward fling of the kanaka surf  but then he was no one other than himself a bronze hercules of twentytwo the whitest blond man ever burned to mahogany brown by a subtropic sun with body and lines and muscles very much resembling the wonderful ones of duke kahanamoku  in a hundred yards the world champion could invariably beat him a second flat but over a distance of miles he could swim circles around the champion  no one of the many hundreds on the beach with the exception of till captain and his crew knew that the bartons had passed beyond the divingstage  all who had watched them start to swim out had taken for granted that they had joined the others on the stage  the captain suddenly sprang upon the railing of the lanai held on to a pillar with one hand and again picked up the two specks of heads through the glasses  his surprise was verified  the two fools had veered out of the channel toward diamond head and were directly seaward of the kanaka surf  worse as he looked they were starting to come in through the kanaka surf  he glanced down quickly to the canoe and even as he glanced and as the apparently loafing members quietly arose and took their places by the canoe for the launching he achieved judgment before the canoe could get abreast in the channel all would be over with the man and woman  and granted that it could get abreast of them the moment it ventured into the kanaka surf it would be swamped and a sorry chance would the strongest swimmer of them have of rescuing a person pounding to pulp on the bottom under the smashes of the great bearded ones  the captain saw the first kanaka wave large of itself but small among its fellows lift seaward behind the two speckswimmers then he saw them strike a crawlstroke side by side faces downward fulllengths outstretched on surface their feet sculling like propellers and their arms flailing in rapid overhand strokes as they spurted speed to approximate the speed of the overtaking wave so that when overtaken they would become part of the wave and travel with it instead of being left behind it thus if they were coolly skilled enough to ride outstretched on the surface and the forward face of the crest instead of being flung and crumpled or driven headfirst to bottom they would dash shoreward not propelled by their own energy but by the energy of the wave into which they had become incorporated  and they did it  some swimmers the captain of number nine made announcement to himself under his breath  he continued to gaze eagerly  the best of swimmers could hold such a wave for several hundred feet  but could they  if they did they would be a third of the way through the perils they had challenged  but not unexpected by him the woman failed first her body not presenting the larger surfaces that her husbands did  at the end of seventy feet she was overwhelmed being driven downward and out of sight by the tons of water in the overtopple  her husband followed and both appeared swimming beyond the wave they had lost  the captain saw the next wave first  if they try to bodysurf on that good night he muttered for he knew the swimmer did not live who would tackle it  beardless itself it was father of all bearded ones a mile long rising up far out beyond where the others rose towering its solid bulk higher and higher till it blotted out the horizon and was a giant among its fellows ere its beard began to grow as it thinned its crest to the overcurl  but it was evident that the man and woman knew big water  no racing stroke did they make in advance of the wave  the captain inwardly applauded as he saw them turn and face the wave and wait for it  it was a picture that of all on the beach he alone saw wonderfully distinct and vivid in the magnification of the binoculars  the wall of the wave was truly a wall mounting ever mounting and thinning far up to a transparency of the colours of the setting sun shooting athwart all the green and blue of it  the green thinned to lighter green that merged blue even as he looked but it was a blue gembrilliant with innumerable sparklepoints of rose and gold flashed through it by the sun  on and up to the sprouting beard of growing crest the colour orgy increased until it was a kaleidoscopic effervescence of transfusing rainbows  against the face of the wave showed the heads of the man and woman like two sheer specks  specks they were of the quick adventuring among the blind elemental forces daring the titanic buffets of the sea  the weight of the downfall of that father of waves even then imminent above their heads could stun a man or break the fragile bones of a woman  the captain of number nine was unconscious that he was holding his breath  he was oblivious of the man  it was the woman  did she lose her head or courage or misplay her muscular part for a moment she could be hurled a hundred feet by that giant buffet and left wrenched helpless and breathless to be pulped on the coral bottom and sucked out by the undertow to be battened on by the fishsharks too cowardly to take their human meat alive  why didnt they dive deep and with plenty of time the captain wanted to know instead of waiting till the last tick of safety and the first tick of peril were one  he saw the woman turn her head and laugh to the man and his head turn in response  above them overhanging them as they mounted the body of the wave the beard creaming white then frothing into rose and gold tossed upward into a spray of jewels  the crisp offshore tradewind caught the beards fringes and blew them backward and upward yards and yards into the air  it was then side by side and six feet apart that they dived straight under the overcurl even then disintegrating to chaos and falling  like insects disappearing into the convolutions of some gorgeous gigantic orchid so they disappeared as beard and crest and spray and jewels in many tons crashed and thundered down just where they had disappeared the moment before but where they were no longer  beyond the wave they had gone through they finally showed side by side still six feet apart swimming shoreward with a steady stroke until the next wave should make them bodysurf it or face and pierce it  the captain of number nine waved his hand to his crew in dismissal and sat down on the lanai railing feeling vaguely tired and still watching the swimmers through his glasses  whoever and whatever they are he murmured they arent malahinis  they simply cant be malahinis   not all days and only on rare days is the surf heavy at waikiki and in the days that followed ida and lee barton much in evidence on the beach and in the water continued to arouse disparaging interest in the breasts of the tourist ladies although the outrigger captains ceased from worrying about them in the water  they would watch the pair swim out and disappear in the blue distance and they might or might not chance to see them return hours afterward  the point was that the captains did not bother about their returning because they knew they would return  the reason for this was that they were not malahinis  they belonged  in other words or rather in the potent islandsword they were kamaaina  kamaaina men and women of forty remembered lee barton from their childhood days when in truth he had been a malahini though a very young specimen  since that time in the course of various long stays he had earned the kamaaina distinction  as for ida barton young matrons of her own age privily wondering how she managed to keep her figure met her with arms around and hearty hawaiian kisses  grandmothers must have her to tea and reminiscence in old gardens of forgotten houses which the tourist never sees  less than a week after her arrival the aged queen liliuokalani must send for her and chide her for neglect  and old men on cool and balmy lanais toothlessly maundered to her about grandpa captain wilton of before their time but whose wild and lusty deeds and pranks told them by their fathers they remembered with gustograndpa captain wilton or david wilton or all hands as the hawaiians of that remote day had affectionately renamed him all hands exnorthwest trader the godless beachcombing clippershipless and shipwrecked skipper who had stood on the beach at kailua and welcomed the very first of missionaries off the brig thaddeus in the year 1820 and who not many years later made a scandalous runaway marriage with one of their daughters quieted down and served the kamehamehas long and conservatively as minister of the treasury and chief of the customs and acted as intercessor and mediator between the missionaries on one side and the beachcombing crowd the trading crowd and the hawaiian chiefs on the variously shifting other side  nor was lee barton neglected  in the midst of the dinners and lunches the luaus hawaiian feasts and poisuppers and swims and dances in aloha love to both of them his time and inclination were claimed by the crowd of lively youngsters of old kohala days who had come to know that they possessed digestions and various other internal functions and who had settled down to somewhat of sedateness who roistered less and who played bridge much and went to baseball often  also similarly oriented was the old poker crowd of lee bartons younger days which crowd played for more consistent stakes and limits while it drank mineral water and orange juice and timed the final round of jacks never later than midnight  appeared through all the rout of entertainment sonny grandison hawaiiborn hawaiiprominent who despite his youthful fortyone years had declined the proffered governorship of the territory also he had ducked ida barton in the surf at waikiki a quarter of a century before and still earlier vacationing on his fathers great lakanaii cattle ranch had hairraisingly initiated her and various other tender tots of five to seven years of age into his boys band the cannibal headhunters or the terrors of lakanaii  still farther his grandpa grandison and her grandpa wilton had been business and political comrades in the old days  educated at harvard he had become for a time a worldwandering scientist and social favourite  after serving in the philippines he had accompanied various expeditions through malaysia south america and africa in the post of official entomologist  at fortyone he still retained his travelling commission from the smithsonian institution while his friends insisted that he knew more about sugar bugs than the expert entomologists employed by him and his fellow sugar planters in the experiment station bulking large at home he was the bestknown representative of hawaii abroad  it was the axiom among travelled hawaii folk that wherever over the world they might mention they were from hawaii the invariable first question asked of them was  and do you know sonny grandison  in brief he was a wealthy mans son who had made good  his fathers million he inherited he had increased to ten millions at the same time keeping up his fathers benefactions and endowments and overshadowing them with his own  but there was still more to him  a ten years widower without issue he was the most eligible and most pathetically soughtafter marriageable man in all hawaii  a cleanandstrongfeatured brunette tall slenderly graceful with the lean runners stomach always fit as a fiddle a distinguished figure in any group the greying of hair over his temples in juxtaposition to his young textured skin and bright vital eyes made him appear even more distinguished  despite the social demands upon his time and despite his many committee meetings and meetings of boards of directors and political conferences he yet found time and space to captain the lakanaii polo team to more than occasional victory and on his own island of lakanaii vied with the baldwins of maui in the breeding and importing of polo ponies   given a markedly strong and vital man and woman when a second equally markedly strong and vital man enters the scene the peril of a markedly strong and vital triangle of tragedy becomes imminent  indeed such a triangle of tragedy may be described in the terminology of the flatfloor folk as super and impossible  perhaps since within himself originated the desire and the daring it was sonny grandison who first was conscious of the situation although he had to be quick to anticipate the sensing intuition of a woman like ida barton  at any rate and undebatable the last of the three to attain awareness was lee barton who promptly laughed away what was impossible to laugh away  his first awareness he quickly saw was so belated that half his hosts and hostesses were already aware  casting back he realized that for some time any affair to which he and his wife were invited found sonny grandison likewise invited  wherever the two had been the three had been  to kahuku or to haleiwa to ahuimanu or to kaneohe for the coral gardens or to koko head for a picnicking and a swimming somehow it invariably happened that ida rode in sonnys car or that both rode in somebodys car  dances luaus dinners and outings were all one the three of them were there  having become aware lee barton could not fail to register idas note of happiness ever rising when in the same company with sonny grandison and her willingness to ride in the same cars with him to dance with him or to sit out dances with him  most convincing of all was sonny grandison himself  fortyone strong experienced his face could no more conceal what he felt than could be concealed a lad of twentys ordinary lads love  despite the control and restraint of forty years he could no more mask his soul with his face than could lee barton of equal years fail to read that soul through so transparent a face  and often to other women talking when the topic of sonny came up lee barton heard ida express her fondness for sonny or her almost tooeloquent appreciation of his poloplaying his work in the world and his general allrightness of achievement  about sonnys state of mind and heart lee had no doubt  it was patent enough for the world to read  but how about ida his own dozenyears wife of a glorious lovematch  he knew that woman ever the mysterious sex was capable any time of unguessed mystery did her frank comradeliness with grandison token merely frank comradeliness and childhood contacts continued and recrudesced into adult years or did it hide in womans subtler and more secretive ways a beat of heart and return of feeling that might even out balance what sonnys face advertised  lee barton was not happy  a dozen years of utmost and postnuptial possession of his wife had proved to him so far as he was concerned that she was his one woman in the world and that the woman was unborn much less unglimpsed who could for a moment compete with her in his heart his soul and his brain  impossible of existence was the woman who could lure him away from her much less overbid her in the myriad continual satisfactions she rendered him  was this then he asked himself the dreaded contingency of all fond benedicts to be her first affair  he tormented himself with the ever iterant query and to the astonishment of the reformed kohala poker crowd of wise and middleaged youngsters as well as to the reward of the keen scrutiny of the dinnergiving and dinnerattending women he began to drink king william instead of orange juice to bully up the poker limit to drive of nights his own car more than rather recklessly over the pali and diamond head roads and ere dinner or lunch or after to take more than an average mans due of oldfashioned cocktails and scotch highs  all the years of their marriage she had been ever complaisant toward him in his cardplaying  this complaisance to him had become habitual  but now that doubt had arisen it seemed to him that he noted an eagerness in her countenancing of his poker parties  another point he could not avoid noting was that sonny grandison was missed by the poker and bridge crowds  he seemed to be too busy  now where was sonny while he lee barton was playing  surely not always at committee and boards of directors meetings  lee barton made sure of this  he easily learned that at such times sonny was more than usually wherever ida chanced to be at dances or dinners or moonlight swimming parties or the very afternoon he had flatly pleaded rush of affairs as an excuse not to join lee and langhorne jones and jack holstein in a bridge battle at the pacific clubthat afternoon he had played bridge at dora niles home with three women one of whom was ida  returning once from an afternoons inspection of the great dry dock building at pearl harbour lee barton driving his machine against time in order to have time to dress for dinner passed sonnys car and sonnys one passenger whom he was taking home was ida  one night a week later during which interval he had played no cards he came home at eleven from a stag dinner at the university club just preceding idas return from the alstone poi supper and dance  and sonny had driven her home  major fanklin and his wife had first been dropped off by them they mentioned at fort shafter on the other side of town and miles away from the beach  lee barton after all mere human man as a human man unfailingly meeting sonny in all friendliness suffered poignantly in secret not even ida dreamed that he suffered and she went her merry careless laughing way secure in her own heart although a trifle perplexed at her husbands increase in number of predinner cocktails  apparently as always she had access to almost all of him but now she did not have access to his unguessable torment nor to the long parallel columns of mental bookkeeping running their totalling balances from moment to moment day and night in his brain  in one column were her undoubtable spontaneous expressions of her usual love and care for him her many acts of comfortserving and of adviceasking and adviceobeying  in another column in which the items increasingly were entered were her expressions and acts which he could not but classify as dubious  were they what they seemed  or were they of duplicity compounded whether deliberately or unconsciously  the third column longest of all totalling most in human heartappraisements was filled with items relating directly or indirectly to her and sonny grandison  lee barton did not deliberately do this bookkeeping  he could not help it  he would have liked to avoid it  but in his fairly ordered mind the items of entry of themselves and quite beyond will on his part took their places automatically in their respective columns  in his distortion of vision magnifying apparently trivial detail which half the time he felt he magnified he had recourse to macilwaine to whom he had once rendered a very considerable service  macilwaine was chief of detectives  is sonny grandison a womaning man barton had demanded  macilwaine had said nothing then he is a womaning man had been bartons declaration  and still the chief of detectives had said nothing  briefly afterward ere he destroyed it as so much dynamite lee barton went over the written report  not bad not really bad was the summarization but not too good after the death of his wife ten years before  that had been a lovematch almost notorious in honolulu society because of the completeness of infatuation not only before but after marriage and up to her tragic death when her horse fell with her a thousand feet off nahiku trail  and not for a long time afterward macilwaine stated had grandison been guilty of interest in any woman  and whatever it was it had been unvaryingly decent  never a hint of gossip or scandal and the entire community had come to accept that he was a onewoman man and would never marry again  what small affairs macilwaine had jotted down he insisted that sonny grandison did not dream were known by another person outside the principals themselves  barton glanced hurriedly almost shamedly at the several names and incidents and knew surprise ere he committed the document to the flames  at any rate sonny had been most discreet  as he stared at the ashes barton pondered how much of his own younger life from his bachelor days resided in old macilwaines keeping  next barton found himself blushing to himself at himself  if macilwaine knew so much of the private lives of community figures then had not he her husband and protector and shielder planted in macilwaines brain a suspicion of ida   anything on your mind lee asked his wife that evening as he stood holding her wrap while she put the last touches to her dressing  this was in line with their old and successful compact of frankness and he wondered while he waited her answer why he had refrained so long from asking her  no she smiled  nothing particular  afterwards    perhaps      she became absorbed in gazing at herself in the mirror while she dabbed some powder on her nose and dabbed it off again  you know my way lee she added after the pause  it takes me time to gather things together in my own waywhen there are things to gather but when i do you always get them  and often theres nothing in them after all i find and so you are saved the nuisance of them  she held out her arms for him to place the wrap about herher valiant little arms that were so wise and steellike in battling with the breakers and that yet were such just merewomans arms round and warm and white delicious as a womans arms should be with the canny muscles masking under softroundness of contour and fine smooth skin capable of being flexed at will by the will of her  he pondered her with a grievous hurt and yearning of appreciation so delicate she seemed so porcelainfragile that a strong man could snap her in the crook of his arm  we must hurry she cried as he lingered in the adjustment of the flimsy wrap over her flimsyprettiness of gown  well be late and if it showers up nuuanu putting the curtains up will make us miss the second dance  he made a note to observe with whom she danced that second dance as she preceded him across the room to the door while at the same time he pleasured his eye in what he had so often named to himself as the spiritproud fleshproud walk of her  you dont feel im neglecting you in my toomuch poker he tried again by indirection  mercy no  you know i just love you to have your card orgies theyre tonic for you  and youre so much nicer about them so much more middleaged  why its almost years since you sat up later than one  it did not shower up nuuanu and every overhead star was out in a clear tradewind sky  in time at the inchkeeps for the second dance lee barton observed that his wife danced it with grandison which of itself was nothing unusual but which became immediately a registered item in bartons mental books  an hour later depressed and restless declining to make one of a bridge foursome in the library and escaping from a few young matrons he strolled out into the generous grounds  across the lawn at the far edge he came upon the hedge of nightblooming cereus  to each flower opening after dark and fading wilting perishing with the dawn this was its one night of life  the great creamwhite blooms a foot in diameter and more lilylike and waxlike white beacons of attraction in the dark penetrating and seducing the night with their perfume were busy and beautiful with their brief glory of living  but the way along the hedge was populous with humans two by two male and female stealing out between the dances or strolling the dances out while they talked in low soft voices and gazed upon the wonder of flowerlove  from the lanai drifted the lovecaressing strains of hanalei sung by the singing boys  vaguely lee barton rememberedperhaps it was from some maupassant storythe abbe obsessed by the theory that behind all things were the purposes of god and perplexed so to interpret the night who discovered at the last that the night was ordained for love  the unanimity of the night as betrayed by flowers and humans was a hurt to barton  he circled back toward the house along a winding path that skirted within the edge of shadow of the monkeypods and algaroba trees  in the obscurity where his path curved away into the open again he looked across a space of a few feet where on another path in the shadow stood a pair in each others arms  the impassioned low tones of the man had caught his ear and drawn his eyes and at the moment of his glance aware of his presence the voice ceased and the two remained immobile furtive in each others arms  he continued his walk sombred by the thought that in the gloom of the trees was the next progression from the openness of the sky over those who strolled the nightflower hedge  oh he knew the game when of old no shadow was too deep no ruse of concealment too furtive to veil a love moment  after all humans were like flowers he meditated  under the radiance from the lighted lanai ere entering the irritating movement of life again to which he belonged he paused to stare scarcely seeing at a flaunt of display of scarlet doublehibiscus blooms  and abruptly all that he was suffering all that he had just observed from the night blooming hedge and the twobytwo lovemurmuring humans to the pair like thieves in each others arms crystallized into a parable of life enunciated by the dayblooming hibiscus upon which he gazed now at the end of its day  bursting into its bloom after the dawn snowwhite warming to pink under the hours of sun and quickening to scarlet with the dark from which its beauty and its being would never emerge it seemed to him that it epitomized mans life and passion  what further connotations he might have drawn he was never to know for from behind in the direction of the algarobas and monkeypods came idas unmistakable serene and merry laugh  he did not look being too afraid of what he knew he would see but retreated hastily almost stumbling up the steps to the lanai  despite that he knew what he was to see when he did turn his head and beheld his wife and sonny the pair he had seen thieving in the dark he went suddenly dizzy and paused supporting himself with a hand against a pillar and smiling vacuously at the grouped singing boys who were pulsing the sensuous night into richer sensuousness with their honi kaua wikiwiki refrain  the next moment he had wet his lips with his tongue controlled his face and flesh and was bantering with mrs inchkeep  but he could not waste time or he would have to encounter the pair he could hear coming up the steps behind him  i feel as if i had just crossed the great thirst he told his hostess and that nothing less than a highball will preserve me  she smiled permission and nodded toward the smoking lanai where they found him talking sugar politics with the oldsters when the dance began to break up  quite a party of half a dozen machines were starting for waikiki and he found himself billeted to drive the leslies and burnstons home though he did not fail to note that ida sat in the drivers seat with sonny in sonnys car  thus she was home ahead of him and brushing her hair when he arrived  the parting of bedgoing was usual on the face of it although he was almost rigid in his successful effort for casualness as he remembered whose lips had pressed hers last before his  was then woman the utterly unmoral creature as depicted by the german pessimists he asked himself as he tossed under his reading lamp unable to sleep or read  at the end of an hour he was out of bed and into his medicine case  five grains of opium he took straight  an hour later afraid of his thoughts and the prospect of a sleepless night he took another grain  at onehour intervals he twice repeated the grain dosage  but so slow was the action of the drug that dawn had broken ere his eyes closed  at seven he was awake again drymouthed feeling stupid and drowsy yet incapable of dozing off for more than several minutes at a time  he abandoned the idea of sleep ate breakfast in bed and devoted himself to the morning papers and the magazines  but the drug effect held and he continued briefly to doze through his eating and reading  it was the same when he showered and dressed and though the drug had brought him little forgetfulness during the night he felt grateful for the dreaming lethargy with which it possessed him through the morning  it was when his wife arose her serene and usual self and came in to him smiling and roguish delectable in her kimono that the whimmadness of the opium in his system seized upon him  when she had clearly and simply shown that she had nothing to tell him under their ancient compact of frankness he began building his opium lie  asked how he had slept he replied  miserably  twice i was routed wide awake with cramps in my feet i was almost too afraid to sleep again  but they didnt come back though my feet are sorer than blazes  last year you had them she reminded him  maybe its going to become a seasonal affliction he smiled theyre not serious but theyre horrible to wake up to  they wont come again till tonight if they come at all but in the meantime i feel as if i had been bastinadoed   in the afternoon of the same day lee and ida barton made their shallow dive from the outrigger beach and went on at a steady stroke past the divingstage to the big water beyond the kanaka surf  so quiet was the sea that when after a couple of hours they turned and lazily started shoreward through the kanaka surf they had it all to themselves  the breakers were not large enough to be exciting and the last languid surfboarders and canoeists had gone in to shore  suddenly lee turned over on his back  what is it ida called from twenty feet away  my footcramp he answered calmly though the words were twisted out through clenched jaws of control  the opium still had its dreamy way with him and he was without excitement  he watched her swimming toward him with so steady and unperturbed a stroke that he admired her own selfcontrol although at the same time doubt stabbed him with the thought that it was because she cared so little for him or rather so much immediately more for grandison  which foot she asked as she dropped her legs down and began treading water beside him  the left oneouch  now its both of them  he doubled his knees as if involuntarily raised his head and chest forward out of the water and sank out of sight in the downwash of a scarcely cresting breaker  under no more than a brief several seconds he emerged spluttering and stretched out on his back again  almost he grinned although he managed to turn the grin into a paingrimace for his simulated cramp had become real  at least in one foot it had and the muscles convulsed painfully  the right is the worst he muttered as she evinced her intention of laying hands on his cramp and rubbing it out  but youd better keep away  ive had cramps before and i know im liable to grab you if these get any worse  instead she laid her hands on the hardknotted muscles and began to rub and press and bend  please he gritted through his teeth  you must keep away  just let me lie out hereill bend the ankle and toejoints in the opposite ways and make it pass  ive done it before and know how to work it  she released him remaining close beside him and easily treading water her eyes upon his face to judge the progress of his own attempt at remedy  but lee barton deliberately bent joints and tensed muscles in the directions that would increase the cramp  in his bout the preceding year with the affliction he had learned lying in bed and reading when seized to relax and bend the cramps away without even disturbing his reading  but now he did the thing in reverse intensifying the cramp and to his startled delight causing it to leap into his right calf  he cried out with anguish apparently lost control of himself attempted to sit up and was washed under by the next wave  he came up spluttered spreadeagled on the surface and had his knotted calf gripped by the strong fingers of both idas small hands  its all right she said while she worked  no cramp like this lasts very long  i didnt know it could be so savage he groaned  if only it doesnt go higher  it makes one feel so helpless  he gripped the biceps of both her arms in a sudden spasm attempting to climb out upon her as a drowning man might try to climb out on an oar and sinking her down under him  in the struggle under water before he permitted her to wrench clear her rubber cap was torn off and her hairpins pulled out so that she came up gasping for air and halfblinded by her wetclinging hair also he was certain he had surprised her into taking in a quantity of water  keep away he warned as he spreadeagled with acted desperateness  but her fingers were deep into the honest painwrack of his calf and in her he could observe no reluctance of fear  its creeping up he grunted through tight teeth the grunt itself a halfcontrolled groan  he stiffened his whole right leg as with another spasm hurting his real minor cramps but flexing the muscles of his upper leg into the seeming hardness of cramp  the opium still worked in his brain so that he could playact cruelly while at the same time he appraised and appreciated her stress of control and will that showed in her drawn face and the terror of death in her eyes with beyond it and behind it in her eyes and through her eyes the something more of the spirit of courage and higher thought and resolution  still further she did not enunciate so cheap a surrender as ill die with you  instead provoking his admiration she did say quietly  relax  sink until only your lips are out  ill support your head  there must be a limit to cramp  no man ever died of cramp on land  then in the water no strong swimmer should die of cramp  its bound to reach its worst and pass  were both strong swimmers and coolheaded  he distorted his face and deliberately dragged her under  but when they emerged still beside him supporting his head as she continued to tread water she was saying  relax  take it easy  ill hold your head up  endure it  live through it  dont fight it  make yourself slackslack in your mind and your body will slack  yield  remember how you taught me to yield to the undertow  an unusually large breaker for so mild a surf curled overhead and he climbed out on her again sinking both of them under as the wavecrest overfell and smashed down  forgive me he mumbled through pain clenched teeth as they drew in their first air again  and leave me  he spoke jerkily with painfilled pauses between his sentences  there is no need for both of us to drown  ive got to go  it will be in my stomach at any moment and then ill drag you under and be unable to let go of you  please please dear keep away  one of us is enough youve plenty to live for  she looked at him in reproach so deep that the last vestige of the terror of death was gone from her eyes  it was as if she had said and more than if she had said  i have only you to live for  then sonny did not count with her as much as he didwas bartons exultant conclusion  but he remembered her in sonnys arms under the monkeypods and determined on further cruelty  besides it was the lingering opium in him that suggested this cruelty  since he had undertaken this acid test urged the poppy juice then let it be a real acid test  he doubled up and went down emerged and apparently strove frantically to stretch out in the floating position  and she did not keep away from him  its too much he groaned almost screamed  im losing my grip ive got to go  you cant save me  keep away and save yourself  but she was to him striving to float his mouth clear of the salt saying  its all right  its all right  the worst is right now just endure it a minute more and it will begin to ease  he screamed out doubled seized her and took her down with him and he nearly did drown her so well did he playact his own drowning  but never did she lose her head nor succumb to the fear of death so dreadfully imminent  always when she got her head out she strove to support him while she panted and gasped encouragement in terms of  relax    relax    slack    slack out    at any time    now    youll pass    the worst    no matter how much it hurts    it will pass    youre easier now    arent you  and then he would put her down again going from bad to worsein his illtreatment of her making her swallow pints of salt water secure in the knowledge that it would not definitely hurt her sometimes they came up for brief emergences for gasping seconds in the sunshine on the surface and then were under again dragged under by him rolled and tumbled under by the curling breakers  although she struggled and tore herself from his grips in the times he permitted her freedom she did not attempt to swim away from him but with fading strength and reeling consciousness invariably came to him to try to save him  when it was enough in his judgment and more than enough he grew quieter left her released and stretched out on the surface  aah he sighed long almost luxuriously and spoke with pauses for breath  it is passing  it seems like heaven  my dear im waterlogged yet the mere absence of that frightful agony makes my present state sheerest bliss  she tried to gasp a reply but could not  im all right he assured her  let us float and rest up stretch out yourself and get your wind back  and for half an hour side by side on their backs they floated in the fairly placid kanaka surf  ida barton was the first to announce recovery by speaking first  and how do you feel now man of mine she asked  i feel as if id been run over by a steamroller he replied and you poor darling  i feel im the happiest woman in the world  im so happy i could almost cry but im too happy even for that  you had me horribly frightened for a time  i thought i was to lose you  lee bartons heart pounded up  never a mention of losing herself this then was love and all real love proved truethe great love that forgot self in the loved one  and im the proudest man in the world he told her because my wife is the bravest woman in the world  brave she repudiated  i love you  i never knew how much how really much i loved you as when i was losing you  and now lets work for shore  i want you all alone with me your arms around me while i tell you all you are to me and shall always be to me  in another halfhour swimming strong and steadily they landed on the beach and walked up the hard wet sand among the sandloafers and sunbaskers  what were the two of you doing out there queried one of the outrigger captains  cutting up  cutting up ida barton answered with a smile  were the village cutups you know was lee bartons assurance   that evening the evenings engagement cancelled found the two in a big chair in each others arms  sonny sails tomorrow noon she announced casually and irrelevant to anything in the conversation  hes going out to the malay coast to inspect whats been done with that lumber and rubber company of his  first ive heard of his leaving us lee managed to say despite his surprise  i was the first to hear of it she added  he told me only last night  at the dance  she nodded  rather sudden wasnt it  very sudden  ida withdrew herself from her husbands arms and sat up  and i want to talk to you about sonny  ive never had a real secret from you before  i didnt intend ever to tell you but it came to me today out in the kanaka surf that if we passed out it would be something left behind us unsaid  she paused and lee halfanticipating what was coming did nothing to help her save to girdle and press her hand in his  sonny rather lost his    his head over me she faltered  of course you must have noticed it  and    and last night he wanted me to run away with him  which isnt my confession at all      still lee barton waited  my confession she resumed is that i wasnt the least bit angry with himonly sorrowful and regretful  my confession is that i rather slightly only rather more than slightly lost my own head that was why i was kind and gentle to him last night  i am no fool  i knew it was due  andoh i know im just a feeble female of vanity compoundedi was proud to have such a man swept off his feet by me by little me  i encouraged him  i have no excuse  last night would not have happened had i not encouraged him  and i and not he was the sinner last night when he asked me  and i told him no impossible as you should know why without my repeating it to you  and i was maternal to him very much maternal  i let him take me in his arms let myself rest against him and for the first time because it was to be the forever last time let him kiss me and let myself kiss him  you    i know you understand    it was his renunciation  and i didnt love sonny  i dont love him  i have loved you and you only all the time  she waited and felt her husbands arm pass around her shoulder and under her own arm and yielded to his drawing down of her to him  you did have me worried more than a bit he admitted until i was afraid i was going to lose you  and      he broke off in patent embarrassment then gripped the idea courageously  oh well you know youre my one woman  enough said  she fumbled the matchbox from his pocket and struck a match to enable him to light his longextinct cigar  well he said as the smoke curled about them knowing you as i know you and all of you all i can say is that im sorry for sonny for what hes missedawfully sorry for him but equally glad for me  and    one other thing  five years hence ive something to tell you something rich something ridiculously rich and all about me and the foolishness of me over you  five years  is it a date  i shall keep it if it is fifty years she sighed as she nestled closer to him  glen ellen california august 17 1916    footnotes  1  see dibbles a history of the sandwich islands
