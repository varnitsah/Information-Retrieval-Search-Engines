35798423	history of friedrich ii of prussia  volume 14  by thomas carlyle     book xivthe surrounding european war does not endaugust 1742july 1744     chapter ifriedrich resumes his peaceable pursuits  friedrichs own peace being made on such terms his wish and hope was that it might soon be followed by a general european one that the livecoal which had kindled this war being quenched the war itself might go out silesia is his farther interest in the controversy except that it would end itself in some fair manner he has none silesia being settled think many thinks friedrich for one what else of real and solid is there to settle  the european public or benevolent individuals of it everywhere indulged also in this hope how glorious is my king the youngest of the kings and the grandest exclaims voltaire in his letters to friedrich at this time and reexclaims till friedrich has to interfere and politely stop it a king who carries in the one hand an allconquering sword but in the other a blessed olivebranch and is the arbiter of europe for peace or war friedrich the third so voltaire calls him counting ill or misled by ignorance of german nomenclature friedrich the third i mean friedrich the great frederic le grand will do this and do thatprobably the first emergence of that epithet in human speech as yet in a quite private hypothetic way letters of voltaire in oeuvres de frederic xxii 100 c this last letter is of date july 1742almost contemporary with the jauer transparency noticed above opinions about friedrichs conduct about his talents his moralities there were many all wide of the mark but this seemed clear that the weight of such a sword as his thrown into either scale would be decisive and that he evidently now wished peace an unquestionable fact that latter wished it yes right heartily and also strove to hopethough with less confidence than the benevolent outside public as knowing the interior of the elements better  these hopes how fond they were we now all know true my friends the livecoal which kindled this incendiary whirlpool one of the livecoals first of them that spread actual flame in these european parts and first of them all except jenkinss ear is out fairly withdrawn but the fire you perceive rages not the less the fire will not quench itself i doubt till the bitumen sulphur and other angry fuel have run much lower austria has fighting men in abundance england behind it has guineas austria has got injuries then successesthere is in austria withal a dumb pride quite equal in pretensions to the vocal vanity of france and far more stubborn of humor the first nation of the universe rashly hurling its finethroated huntingpack or army of the oriflamme into austriasee what a sort of badgers and gloomily indignant bears it has awakened there friedrich had to take arms again and an unwelcome task it was to him and a sore and costly we shall be obliged what is our grand difficulty in this history to note in their order the series of european occurrences and tedious as the matter now is keep readers acquainted with the current of that big war in which except friedrich broad awake and the ear of jenkins in somnambulancy there is now next to nothing to interest a human creature  it is an error still prevalent in england though long since exploded everywhere else that friedrich wanted new wars new successful robberies as our gazetteers called them and did wilfully plunge into this war again in the hope of again doing a stroke in that kind english readers on consulting the facts a little will not hesitate to sweep that notion altogether away shadow of basis except in their own angry uninformed imaginations they will find it never had and that precisely the reverse is manifest in friedrichs history a perfectly clearsighted friedrich able to discriminate shine from substance and gravitating always towards the solid the actual that of gloire which he owns to at starting we saw how soon it died out choked in the dire realities that of conquering hero in the macedoniasmadman style was at all times far from him if the reader knew itperhaps never farther from any king who had such allurements to it such opportunities for it this his first expedition to silesiaa rushing out to seize your own stolen horse while the occasion answeredwas a voluntary one produced we may say by friedrichs own thought and the invisible powers but the rest were all purely compulsoryto defend the horse he had seized clear necessities and powers very visible were the origin of all his other expeditions and warlike struggles which lasted to the end of his life  that recent moravian foray the jointstock principle in war matters and the terrible pass a man might reduce himself to at that enormous gamingtable of the gods if he lingered there think what considerations these had been for him so that his look became farouche in the sight of valori and the spectre of ruin kept him company and such helldogs were in chase of himtill czaslau when the dice fell kind again all this had been didactic on a young docile man he was but thirty gone and if readers mark such docility at those years they will find considerable meaning in it here are prudence moderation clear discernment very unusual veracity of intellect as we define itwhich quality indeed is the summary and victorious outcome of all manner of good qualities and faithful performances in a man given up to strong delusions in the tragical way many are friedrich was not and in practical matters very seldom indeed believed a lie  certain it is he now resumes his old reinsberg program of life probably with double relish after such experiences the other way and prosecutes it with the old ardor hoping much that his history will be of halcyon pacific nature after all would the mad warwhirlpool but quench itself dangerous for singeing a near neighbor who is only just got out of it fain would he be arbiter and help to quench it but it will not quench for a space of two years or more till august 1744 twentysix months in all friedrich busy on his own affairs with carefully neutral aspect towards this war yet with sword ready for drawing in case of need looks on with intense vigilance using his wisest interference not too often either in that sense and in that only be at peace oh come to peaceand finds that the benevolent public and he have been mistaken in their hopes for the next two years we sayfor the first year or till about august 1743 with hope not much abated and little actual interference needed for the latter twelvemonth with hope ever more abating interference warning almost threatening ever more needed and yet of no avail as if they had been idle talking and gesticulation on his parttill in august 1744 he had tobut the reader shall gradually see it if by any method we can show it him in something of its real sequence and shall judge of it by his own light  friedrichs domestic history was not of noisy nature during this intervaland indeed in the bewildered records given of it there is nothing visible at first but one wide vortex of simmering inanities leading to the desperate conclusion that friedrich had no domestic history at all which latter is by no means the fact your poor prussian dryasdust without even an index to help you being at least authentic if you look a long time intensely and on many sides features do at last dawn out of those sad vortexes and you find the old reinsberg program risen to activity again and all manner of peaceable projects going on friedrich visits the baths of aachen what we call aixlachapelle has the usual inspections business activities recreations visits of friends he opens his operahouse this first winter he enters on lawreform strikes decisively into that grand problem hoping to perfect it what is still more significant he in private begins writing his memoirs and furthermore gradually determines on having a little country house place of escape from his big potsdam palace and gets plans drawn for itplace which became very famous by the name of sanssouci in times coming his thoughts are wholly pacific of life to minerva and the arts not to bellona and the battlesand yet he knows well this latter too is an inexorable element about his army he is quietly busy augmenting improving it the staff of life to prussia and him  silesian fortressbuilding under ugly walrave goes on at a steadily swift rate much silesian settlement goes on fixing of the prussianaustrian boundaries without of the catholicprotestant limits within rapid not too rough remodelling of the province from austrian into prussian in the financial administrative and every other respectin all which important operations the success was noiseless but is considered to have been perfect or nearly so cannot we from these enormous papermasses carefully riddled afford the reader a glimpse or two to quicken his imagination of these things     settles the silesian boundaries the silesian arrangements with manifest profit to silesia and himself  in regard to the marches herr nussler as natural was again the person employed nussler shifty soul wideawake at all times has already seen this country noticed the pass into glatz with its blockhouse and perceived that his majesty would want it from september 22d to december 12th 1742 the actual operation went on ratified completely set at rest 16th january following busching beitrage nussler and buschings magazin b x halle 1776 where pp 475538 is a geschichte der c shlesischen granzscheidung im jahr

scant of breath cannot stand the rapid galloping about and thousandfold inspecting and detailing leaves it all to nussler who goes like the wind thus for example nussler dictates at evening from his

ground they are to deal with next day and takes notice of everything no wonder the boundarypillars set up in such manner which stand to this day bear marks that prussia here and there has had fair playpoor nussler has no fixed appointment yet except one of about 100 pounds a year in all my travels i have seen no man of equal faculty at lower wages nor did he ever get any signal promotion or the least exuberance of wages this poor nusslerunless it be that he got trained to perfect veracity of workmanship and to be a man without dryrot in the soul of him which indeed is incalculable wages income of 100 pounds a year and no dryrot in the soul of you anywhere income of 100000 pounds a year and nothing but dry and wet rot in the soul of you ugly appetites unveracities blusterous conceitsand probably as symbol of all things a potbelly to your poor body itself oh my friends  in settling the spiritual or internal catholicprotestant limits of silesia friedrich did also a workmanlike thing perfect fairness between protestant and catholic to that he is bound and never needed binding but it is withal his intention to be king in catholic silesia and that no holy father or other extraneous individual shall intrude with inconvenient pretensions there he accordingly nominates the now bishop of neisse and natural primate of silesiacardinal von sinzendorf who has made submission for any late austrian peccadilloes and thoroughly reconciled himselfnominates sinzendorf vicargeneral of the country who is to relieve the pope of silesian trouble and be himself quasisupreme of the catholic church there no offence holy papa of christian mankind your holy religion is and shall be intact in these parts but the palliums bulls and other holy wares and interferences are not needed here on that footing be pleased to rest content  the holy father shrieked his loudest which is now a quite calculable loudness nothing like so loud as it once was declared he would himself join the army of martyrs sooner and summoned sinzendorf to rome what kind of hinge are you cardinalis of the gates ofhusht shrieked his loudest we say but as nobody minded it and as sinzendorf would not come had to let the matter take its course adelung iii a 197200 and gradually noticing what correct observance of essentials there was he even came quite round into a high state of satisfaction with this heretic king in the course of a few years friedrich and the pope were very polite to each other thenceforth always ready to do little mutual favors and it is to be remarked friedrichs management of his clergy protestant and catholic was always excellent true in a considerable degree to the real law of things gentle but strict and without shadow of hypocrisyin which last fine particular he is singularly unique among modern sovereigns  he recognizes honestly the uses of religion though he himself has little takes a good deal of pains with his preaching clergy from the armychaplain upwardswill suggest texts to them with scheme of sermon on occasionis always anxious to have as clerical functionary the right man in the important place and for the rest expects to be obeyed by them as by his sergeants and corporals indeed the reverend men feel themselves to be a body of spiritual sergeants corporals and captains to whom obedience is the rule and discontent a thing not to be indulged in by any means and it is worth noticing how well they seem to thrive in this completely submissive posture how much real christian worth is traceable in their labors and them and what a fund of piety and religious faith in rugged effectual form exists in the armies and populations of such a king in 1780 at berlin the population being 140000 there are of ecclesiastic kind only 140 that is 1 to the 1000at munchen there are thirty times as many in proportion mirabeau monarchie prussienne viii 342 quoting nicolai  by degrees the munchows and official persons intrusted with silesia got it wrought in all respects financial administrative judicial secular and spiritual into the prussian model a long tough job but one that proved well worth doing in preuss i 197200 the various steps from 1740 to 1806 in this state counts one authority it was worth to prussia about six times what it had been to austriafrom some other forgotten source i have seen the computation eight times in money revenue at the end of friedrichs reign it is a little more than twice the eight times and the six times which are but loose multiples refer i suppose to population trade increase of national wealth of new regiments yielded by new cantons and the like westphalen in feldzuge des herzogs ferdinand printed berlin 1859 written 100 years before by that wellinformed person i 65 says in the rough six times preuss iv 292 gives very indistinctly the ciphers of revenue in 1740 and some later year according to friedrich himself oeuvres ii 102 the silesian revenue at first was 3600000 thalers 540000 pounds little more than half a million population a millionandhalf  six or eight times as useful to prussia and to the inhabitants what multiple of usefulness shall we give to be governed on principles fair and rational that is to say conformable to natures appointment in that respect and to be governed on principles which contradict the very rules of cocker and with impious disbelief of the very multiplication table the one is a perpetual gospel of cosmos and heaven to every unit of the population the other a gospel of chaos and beelzebub to every unit of them there is no multiple to be found in arithmetic which will express thatcertain of these advantages in the new government are seen at once others the still more valuable do not appear except gradually and after many days and years with the one and the other schlesien appears to have been tolerably content from that year 1742 to this schlesien has expressed by word and symptom nothing but thankfulness for the transfer it underwent and there is for the last hundred years no part of the prussian dominion more loyal to the hohenzollerns who are the authors of prussia without whom prussia had never been than this their latest acquisition when once it too got moulded into their own image preuss i 193 and ib 200 note from klein a silesian jurist favor not merit formerly magistracies a regular branch of tradehighway robbers on a strangely familiar footing with the old breslau magistrates c c     opening of the operahouse at berlin   december 7th this winter carnival being come or just coming friedrich opens his new operahouse for behoof of the cultivated berlin classes a fine edifice which had been diligently built by knobelsdorf while those silesian battlings went on one of the largest and finest operahouses in the whole world like a sumptuous palace rather stands free on all sides space for 1000 coaches round it five great entrances five persons can walk abreast through each and insideyou should see you should hear boxes more like rooms or boudoirs free view and perfect hearing of the stage from every point air pure and free everywhere water aloft not only for theatrical cascades but to drown out any fire or risk of fire seyfarth i 234 nicolai beschreibung von berlin i 169 this is seyfarths account still capable of confirmation by travelling readers of a musical turn i have seen operas with much more brilliancy of gas and gilding but none nearly so convenient to the human mind and sense or where the audience not now a gratis one attended to the music in so meritorious a way  perhaps it will attract moneyed strangers to frequent our capitalsome guess that was friedrichs thought at all events it is a handsome piece of equipage for a musical king and people not to be neglected in the circumstances thalia in generallet us not neglect thalia in such a dearth of worshipable objects nor did he neglect thalia the trouble friedrich took with his opera with his dancingapparatus french comedy and the rest of that affair was very great much greater surely than this editor would have thought of taking though on reflection he does not presume to blame the world is dreadfully scant of worshipable objects and if your theatre is your own to sweep away intrusive nonsense continually from the gates of it friedrichs opera costs him heavy sums surely i once knew approximately what but the sibylline leaf is gone again upon the windsand he admits gratis a select public and that only preuss i 277 and preuss buch fur jedermann i 100 this winter 174243

pounds was in action when the two queens queen regnant and queen mother dined with his majesty     friedrich takes the waters at aachen where voltaire comes to see him  months before that of the operahouse or those silesian settlements friedrich in the end of august what is the first thing visible in his domestic history makes a visit for healths sake to aachen aixlachapelle so called with a view to the waters there intends to try for a little improvement in health as the basis of ulterior things health has naturally suffered a little in these warhardships and the doctors recommend aix after wesel and the westphalian inspections friedrich accordingly proceeds to aix and for about a fortnight 23th august9th september drinks the waters in that old restingplace of charlemagneparticulars not given in the books except that he lodged with baege if any mortal now knew baege and did an audience or so to select persons now unknown he is not entirely incognito but is without royal state the guard of twenty men the escort of 160 men being no men of his but presumably mere townguard of aix coming in an honorary way aix is proud to see him he himself is intent on the waters here at old aix             aquisgranum urbs regalis           sedes regni principalis   my friend this was charlemagnes high place and his dust lies here these thousand years last past and there used to soar a very large gilt eagle ten feet wide or so aloft on the cathedralsteeple there eagle turned southward when the kaiser was in frankenland eastward when he was in teutsch or teutonland in fact pointing out the kaisers whereabouts to loyal mankind kohler reichshistorie eagle which shines on me as a human fact luminously gilt through the dark dryasdustic ages gone all spectral under dryasdusts sad handling friedrich knows farther that for many centuries after the reichs insignia reichskleinodien used to be herethough maria theresa has them now and will not give them up the whole of which points are indifferent to him the practical not the sentimental is friedrichs interestnot to say that werter and the sentimental were not yet born into our afflicted earth a king thoroughly practicalyet an exquisite player on the flute withal as we often notice whose adagio could draw tears from you for in himself too there were floods of tears as when his mother died and he has been heard saying not bragging but lamenting what was truly the fact that he had more feeling than other men but it was honest human feeling always and was repressed where not irrepressibleas it behooved to be  friedrichs suite was not considerable says the french spy at aix on this occasion pomp of entrancea thing to be mute upon came driving in with the common posthorses of the country and such a set of carriages as your lordship intent on the sublime has no idea of spyletter in campagnes des trois marechaux i 222 rumor was his britannic majesty was coming also on pretext of the waters to confer with him other rumor is if king george came in at one gate king friedrich would go out at the other a dubious friedrich to the french spy at this moment nothing like so admirable as he once was  the french emotions of which we say little on friedrichs making peace for himself had naturally been great to the french public it was unexpected somewhat sudden even to the court and sure enough it was of perilous importance in the circumstances few days ago broglio by order given him could not spare a man for the common causeand now the common cause has become entirely the broglio one and broglio will have the full use of all his men defection plainly treasonous to your liege lord and nation horrible to think of cried the french public the court outwardly taking a lofty tragicelegiac tone with some air of hope that his prussian majesty would perhaps come round again to the side of his afflicted france of which except in the way of helping france and the other afflicted parties to a just peace if he could his prussian majesty had small thought at this time  more affecting to friedrich were the natural terrors of the poor kaiser on this event the kaiser has already had his messenger at berlin in consequence of it with urgent inquiries entreatiesan expert messenger who knows berlin well so other than our old friend the ordnancemaster seckendorf now titular feldmarschallwhom one is more surprised than delighted to meet again being out with austria clamoring for great sums of arrears which they will not pay he has been hanging about this new kaiser ever since electiontime and is again getting into employment diplomatic strategic for some yearsthough we hope mostly to ignore him and it friedrichs own feeling at sight of himask not about it more than if there had been none friedrich gave him a distinguished reception friedrichs answer sent by him to the kaiser was all kindness emphatic assurance that not hostility by any means that loyalty friendship and aid wherever possible within the limits should always be his rule towards the now kaiser lawful head of the reich in difficult circumstances audience 30th july adelung iii a 217 which was some consolation to the poor manstript of his old revenues old bavarian dominions and unprovided with new this sublime headship of the reich bring moneyless and ones new kingdom of bohemia hanging in so uncertain a state with nothing but a pharsaliasahay to show for itself  among friedrichs inconsiderable suite at aachen was prince henri his youngest brother age now sixteen a small sensitive shivering creature but of uncommon parts and another young man prince ferdinand of brunswick his wifes youngest brother a soldier as all the brothers are soldier in friedrichs army this one in whose fine inarticulate eupeptic character are excellent dispositions and capacities discernible ferdinand goes generally with the king much about him in these years all the brothers follow soldiering it is the one trade of german princes when at home friedrich is still occasionally with his queen who lives at schonhausen in the environs of berlin but goes with him to charlottenburg to old reinsberg and has her share of galas in his company with the queen mother and cognate highnesses  another small fact still more memorable at present is that voltaire now made him a third visitprivately on fleurys instance as is evident this time of which voltaire visit readers shall know duly by and by what little is knowable but alas there is first an immense arrear of warmatters to bring up to which still more than to voltaire the afflicted reader must address himself if he would understand at all what friedrichs environment or circumambient lifeelement now was and how friedrich well or ill comported himself in the same brevity this editor knows is extremely desirable and that the scissors should be merciless on those sad paperheaps intolerable to the modern mind but unless the modern mind chance to prefer ease and darkness what can an editor do     chapter iiaustrian affairs are on the mounting hand  austrian affairs are not now in their nadirpoint a long while now since they passed that austria to all appearance dead started up and began to strike for herself with some success the instant walpoles souproyal that first 200000 pounds followed since by abundance more got to her lips touched her poor pale lips and went tingling through her like life and fiery elasticity out of death by inanition cardinal moment which history knows but can never date except vaguely some time in 1741 among the last acts of judicious walpole  austria thanks to its own khevenhullers and its english guineas was already rising in various quarters and now when the prussian affair is settled austria springs up everywhere like an elastic body with the pressure taken from it mounts steadily month after month in practical success and in height of humor in a still higher ratio and in the course of the next two years rises to a great height indeed heresnatched who knows with what difficulty from that shoreless bottomless slough of an austriansuccession war deservedly forgotten and avoided by extant mankindare some of the more essential phenomena which friedrich had to witness in those months to witness to scan with such intense interestrightly at his periland to interpret as actual omens for him as monitions of a most indisputable nature no haruspex i suppose with or without white beard and long staff for cutting the heavenly vault into compartments from the zenith downwards could in etruria or elsewhere watch the flight of birds now into this compartment now into that with stricter scrutiny than on the new terms did this young king from his potsdam observatory     warphenomena in the western parts king george tries a second time to draw his sword tugs at it violently for seven months february october 1742  the first phenomenon cheering to austria is that of the britannic majesty again clutching sword with evident intent to draw it on her behalf tindal xx 552 old newspapers c c besides his potent souproyal of halfmillions annually the britannic majesty has a considerable sword say 40000 of british and of subsidizedsword which costs him a great deal of money to keep by his side and a great deal of clamor and insolent gibing from the gazetteer species because he is forced to keep it strictly in the scabbard hitherto this year we observe he has determined again to draw it in the cause of human liberty whatever follow from early spring there were symptoms camps on lexden and other heaths much reviewing in hydepark and elsewhere from all corners a universal marching towards the kent coast the aspects being favorable we can besiege dunkirk at any rate cannot we your high mightinesses dunkirk which by all the treaties in existence ought to need no besieging but which in spite of treatyings innumerable always does the high mightinesses answer nothing articulate languidly grumble something in optative tonemeaning assent thinks the sanguine mind dutch hoistable after all thinks he dutch will cooperate if they saw example set and in england the work of embarking actually begins  britannic majestys purpose and even fixed resolve to this effect had preceded the prussianaustrian settlement may 20th 9th by the old newspapers but we always translate their os two regiments of foot first poor instalment of british troops had actually landed at ostendnews of the battle of chotusitz much more of the austrianprussian settlement or peace of breslau would meet them there but after that latter auspicious event things start into quick and doublequick time and the gazetteers get vocal almost lyrical about howards

bromley with their kettledrums going and are this day at gravesend to take shipor to give one other more specific example  yesterday 3d july 1742 general campbells regiment of scotch greys arrived in the borough of southwark on their march to dover where they are to embark for flanders they are fine hardy fellows that want no seasoning and make an appearance agreeable to all but the innkeeperswho have such billeting to do of late daily post june 23d os 1742 grey dragoons or royal scotsgreys is the title of this fine regiment and their colonel is lieutenantgeneral john campbell afterwards duke

editor knows twenty of these fine fellows twenty or so who had gone in one batch as greys sons of good annandale yeomen otherwise without a career open some two of whom did get back and lived to be old men the rumor of whom and of their unheardof adventures was still lingering in the air when this editor began existence pardon o reader  but all through those hot days it is a universal drumming kettledrumming coastward preparation of transports at gravesend at the top of ones velocity all the coopers in london are in requisition for watercasks so that our very brewers have to pause astonished for want of tubs there is pumping in of water day and night sunday not excepted then throwing of it out again owing to new circumstances 250 saddlehorses and 100 sumpter ditto for his majestys own usethese need a deal of water never to speak of ligonier and the greys for the honor of our country his majesty will make a grander appearance this campaign than any of his predecessors

royal highness duke of cumberland one should say is to go a most bravehearted flaxenflorid plump young creature hopeful son of mars could he once get experience which alas he never could though trying it for fiveandtwenty years to come under huge expense to this nation there are to be 16000 troops perhaps more 1000 sandbags empty as yet demolition of dunkirk the thing aimed at if only the dutch prove hoistable  and so from may on to september it noisily proceeds at multiplex rates and often with more haste than speed and in such five months seven strictly counted of clangorous movement and deadlift exertion there were veritably got across of horse and foot with their equipments the surprising number of 16334 men adelung iii a 201 may 20th it beganthat is the embarking began the noise and babble about it which have been incessant ever since had begun in february beforeand on september 26th ostend now almost weary of huzzaing over british glory by instalment had the joy of seeing our final portions of artillery arrive such a park of siegeandfield artillery exults the gazetteer asas these poor creatures never dreamt of before  magnanimous lord stair already plenipotentiary to the dutch is to be kings generalinchief of this fine enterprise carteret another lord of some real brilliancy and perhaps of still weightier metal is head of the cabinet hearty both of them for these antifrench intentions and the public cannot but think surely something will come of it this time more especially now that maillebois about the middle of august by a strange turn of fortune is swept out of the way maillebois lying over in westphalia with his 30 or 40000 on check to your king this year past had on sight of these antidunkirk movements been ordered to look dunkirk way and at length to move thitherward for protection of dunkirk so that stair before his dunkirk business will have to fight maillebois which stair doubts not may be satisfactorily done but behold in august and earlier come marvellous news from the prag quarter tragical to france and maillebois is off at his best speed in the reverse direction on a far other errandof which readers shall soon hear enough  dunkirk therefore is now open with 16000 british troops hanoverians to the like number and hessians 6000 together near 40000 not to speak of dutch at all surely one might manage dunkirk if not something still better it is after mailleboiss departure that these dreadful exertions coopering of watercasks pumping all sunday go on at gravesend swift oh be swift while time is and generalissimoplenipotentiary stair who has run over beforehand is ardent enough upon the dutch his eloquence fiery and incessant magnanimous high mightinesses was there will there again be such a chance the cause of human liberty may be secured forever dunkirkor what is dunkirk even between us and paris there is nothing now that maillebois is off on such an errand why should not we play marlborongh again and teach them a little what invasion means it is ourselves alone that can hinder it now i say or never  stair was a pupil of marlboroughs is otherwise a shining kind of man and has immense things in his eye at this time they say what is not unlikely he proposed an interview with friedrich now at aachen would come privately to take the waters for a day or twowhile maillebois was on his new errand and such a crisis had risen but friedrich anxious to be neutral and give no offence politely waived such honor lord stair was thought to be something of a general in fact as well as in costumeand perhaps he was so and had there been a proper countess of stair or new sarah jenningsto cover gently by artmagic the britannic majesty and fat boy under a tub and to put britain and british parliament and resources into stairs hand for a few yearswho knows what stair too might have done a marlborough in the war artsperhaps still less in the peace ones if we knew the great marlboroughhe could not have been but there is in him a recognizable flash of magnanimity of heroic enterprise and purpose which is highly peculiar in that sordid element and it can be said of him as of lightning striking ineffectual on the bog of allen or the stygian fens that his strength was never triedfor the upshot of him we will wait not very long  these are fine prospects if only the dutch prove hoistable but these are as nothing to what is passing and has passed in the eastern parts in the bohemianbavarian quarter since we were there poor kaiser karl what an outlook for him his own real bavaria much more his imaginary upper austria and conquests on the donau after that segur adventure are plunging headlong as to his once kingdom of bohemia it has already plunged nay the army of the oriflamme is itself near plunging in spite of that pharsalia of a sahay bavaria itself we say is mostly gone to khevenhuller segur with his french on march homeward and nothing but bavarians left the belleislebroglio grand budweis expedition is gone totally heels over head belleisle and broglio are getting step by step shut up in prag and besieged there while mailleboislet us try whether by snatching out here a fragment and there a fragment with chronological and other appliances it be not possible to give readers some conceivable notion of what friedrich was now looking at with such interest     how duc dharcourt advancing to reinforce the oriflamme had to split himself in two and become an army of bavaria to little effect  the poor kaiser who at one time counted 30000 bavarians of his own has all along been

ingolstadtdonauworth regions with nothing but thorring people and small french garrisons to hinder himwhere it will be fatal if he quite prosper ingolstadt being our placeofarms and house on the highway both for bavaria and bohemia  for months past there had been a gleam of hope for kaiser karl and his new kingdom of bohemia and old electorate of bavaria from the rumor of dharcourts reinforcementa 20 or 30000 new frenchmen marching into those parts in a very detached intermittent manner great in the gazettes but it proved a gleam only and came to nothing effectual poor dharcourt owing to cross orders groglio clamorously demanding that the new force should come to prag karl albert the kaiser nominally generalinchief demanding that it should go down the donau and sweep his bavaria clear was in difficulty to do either of these cross orders might have brought some result but to halfdo both of them as he was enjoined to attempt was not wise some half of his force he did detach towards broglio which got to actual junction partly before partly after that pharsaliasahay affair and raised broglio to a strength of 24000still inadequate against prince karl which done dharcourt himself went down the donau on his original scheme with the remainder of his forcesnow likewise become inadequate he is to join with feldmarschall thorring in theand does it as we shall see

aprildharcourt advancing terrible as a rumorrejoiced exceedingly to see the austrians march out at their best pace and the exultant populace even massacred a loitering tolpatch or two who well deserve it think the populace judging by their experience for the last three months since barenklau and mentzel became king hererumor of dharcourt answers khevenhuller from the kelheimpassau side of things let us wait for sight of him at least and orders munchen to be reoccupied so that alas within a week on the 5th of may barenklau is back upon the poor city exacts severe vengeance for the tolpatch business and will give them seven months more of his company in spite of dharcourt and the army of bavaria as he now called himselfnew army of bavaria when once arrived in those countries and joined with poor thorring and the kaisers people there such an army of bavaria first and last asas khevenhuller could have wished it under dharcourt joined with old feldmarschall thorring him whom men liken

this historyand shall say only that comte de saxe before long relieves him of this bavarian armyand will be seen at the head of it on a most important business that rises  kaiser karl begins to have real thoughts of recalling this thorring who is grown so very audible altogether home and of appointing seckendorf instead a course which belleisle has been strongly recommending for some time seckendorf is at present gathering meal in the oberpfalz upper palatinate road from ingolstadt to eger to bohmen generally that is forming magazines on the kaisers behalf there surely a likelier man than your thorring urges belleisle always with whom the kaiser does finally comply nominates seckendorf commanderrecalls the invaluable thorring to his services in our cabinet council which more befit his great age in which safe post poor thorring like a drum not beaten upon has thenceforth a silent life of it seckendorf fighting in his steadas we shall have to witness more or less  khevenhullers

batteries around guerre de boheme ii 149 170 to which the french belleisles high soul animating everything as furiously responded making continual sallies of a hot desperate nature especially on the fifth day of the siege one sally to be mentioned by and by which was very famous at prag and at paris     concerning the italian war which simultaneously went on all along  war in italythe spanish termagant very high in her antipragmatic notionsthere had been for eight months past and it went on fiercely enough doggedly enough on both sides for six years more till 1748 when the general finis came war of which we propose to say almost nothing but must request the reader to imagine it all along as influential on our specific affairs  the spanish termagant wished ardently to have the milanese and pertinents as an apanage for her second infant don philip a young gentleman who now needs to be provided for as don carlos had once done cannot get to be pope this one it appears said the fond mother who at one time looked that way for her infant well here is the milanese fallen loose readers know her for a lady of many claims of illimitable aspirations and she went very high on the pragmatic question headship of the golden fleece madam you head of it i say all austria german and italian is minethough she has now magnanimously given up the german part to kaiser karl vii and will be content with the italian as an apanage for don philip and so there is war in italy and will be to be imagined by us henceforth  a war in which these three elements are noticeable as the chief first the sardinian majesty charles emanuel victor amadeuss son hubner t 293 born 27th april 1701 lived and reigned till 19th february 1773 oertel t 77 who is very anxious himself for milanese parings and additaments but except by skilfully playing offandon between the french side and the austrian has no chance of getting any for spain he is able to fight and also on good british subsidies against spain element second is the british navy cruising always between spain and the seat of war rendering supplies by sea impossiblealmost impossible third the passes of savoy wild alpine chasms stonelabyrinths inexpugnable with a sardinian majesty defending which are the one remaining road for armies and supplies out of spain or france  the savoy passes are in fact the gist of the war the insoluble problem for don philip and the french by detours by circuitous effort and happy accident your troops may occasionally squeeze through but without one secure road open behind them for supplies and recruitments what good is it battles there are behind the alps on what we may call the stage itself of this italian wartheatre but the grand steady battle is that of france and don philip struggling spasmodically year after year to get a road through the coulisses or sidescenesnamely those savoy passes they try it by this pass and by that pass of demont pass of villafranca or montalban glorious for france but futile pass of exilles or col dassiette again glorious again futile and fatal sometimes by the way of nice itself and rocky muletracks overhanging the seaedge british navalcannon playing on themand can by no way do it  there were fine fightings in the interior too under generals of mark general browne doing feats excellent old general feldmarschall traun of whom we shall hear maillebois belleisle the younger of whom we have heard there was battle of camposanto new battle there trauns there was battle of rottofreddo of piacenza doleful to mailleboisfollowed by invasion of provence by revolt of genoa and other things which all readers have now forgotten two elaborate works on the subject are said to be instructive to military readers buonamici who was in it for a while de bello italico commentarii in works of buonamici lyon 1750 and pezay campagnes de maillebois our westphalian friend again en italie 17451746 paris 1775 readers are to imagine this italian war all along as a fact very loud and real at that time and continually pulsing over into our german events like halfaudible thunder below the horizon into raging thunder above little as we can afford to say of it here one small scene from this italian warone or with difficulty twoand if possible be silent about all the rest     scene roads of cadiz october 1741 by what astonishing artifice this italian war did at length get begun   the spanish court that is termagant elizabeth who rules everybody there being in this humor was passionate to begin and stood ready a good while indignantly champing the bit before the sad preliminary obstacles could be got over at barcelona she had in the course of last summer doubly busy ever since mollwitz time got into equipment some 15000 men but could not by any method get them acrossowing to the british fleets which hung blockading this place and that blockading cadiz especially where lay her transportships and warships at this interesting juncture fleurys cunctations were disgusting to the ardent mind and here now still more insuperable are the british fleets hereand a pest to himis your admiral haddock blockading cadiz with his seventyfours  but again on the other or pragmatic side there were cunctations the sardinian majesty charles emanuel of savoy holding the door of the alps was difficult to bargain with in spite of british subsidiesstood out for higher doorfees a larger slice of the milanese than could be granted him had always one ear open for france too in short was tedious and capricious and there seemed no bringing him to the point of drawing sword for her hungarian majesty in the end he was brought to it by a stroke of british artsuch to the admiring gazetteer and diplomatic mind it seemedequal to anything we have since heard of on the part of perfidious albion  one day middle of october last the seventyfours of haddock and perfidious albionspanish official persons looking out from cadiz lighthouse ask themselves where are they vanished from these waters not a seventyfour of them to be seenhave got foul in the underworks or otherwise some blunder has happened and the blockading fleet of perfidious albion has had to quit its post and run to gibraltar to refit that i guess was the machiavellian stroke of art they had done without investigating haddock and company as indignant honorable members did i will wager that and nothing more  in any case the termagant finding no seventyfours there and the wind good despatches swiftly her transports and warships to barcelona swiftly embarks there her 15000 france cautiously assisting and lands them complete by the middle of december haddock feebly opposing on the genoa coast have at the milanese my men which obliges charles emanuel to end his cunctations and rank at once in defence of that country adelung ii 535 538 who believes in the stroke of art what kind of art it was learn sufficiently in gentlemans

modicum of seventyfours dursley galleys bombvessels on an errand from his admiral one matthews and the britannic majesty much to the astonishment of naples commodore martin hovers about all morning and at 4 pm drops anchorwithin shot of the place fearfully nearand therefrom sends ashore a message that his sicilian majesty baby carlos our notable old friend who is said to be a sovereign of merit otherwise has not been neutral in this italian war as his engagements bore but has joined his force to that of the spaniards declared enemies of his britannic majesty which rash step his britannic majesty hereby requires him to retract if painful consequences are not at once to ensue that is martins message to which he stands doggedly without variation in the extreme flutter and multifarious reasoning of the poor court of naples recall your 20000 men and keep them recalled persists martin and furthermore at last as the reasoning threatens to get lengthy your answer is required within one hourand lays his watch on the cabintable  the court thrown into transcendent tremor with no resource but either to be burnt or comply answers within the hour yes in all points some eight hours or so

neutrality obtained in this manner lasted for a yearandhalf a sensible alleviation to her hungarian majesty for the time we here quit the italian war leaving it to the readers fancy on the above terms      the siege of prag contimes a grand sally there  prag 22d august in the same hours while martin lay coercing naples the army of the oriflamme in prag city was engaged in furious salliesreaders may divine what that means for prag and the oriflamme  prag is begirdled bombarded from all the wischerads ziscabergs and hill environments every avenue blocked above 60000 austrians round it near 40000 of them regulars a place difficult to defend but with excellent arrangements for defence on belleisles part and the garrison with its blood up garrison makes continual furious sallieswhich are eminently successful say the french newspapers but which end as all sallies do in returning home again without conquest except of honorand on this wednesday 22d august comes out with the greatest sally of all campagnes vi 5 guerre de boheme ii 173 while commodore martin many a pipes and hatchway standing grimly on the watch unknown to us is steering towards matthews and the toulon waters again the equal sun looking down on all  it was about twelve oclock when this prag sally now all in order broke out several thousand strong and all at the white heat now a constant temperature sally almost equal to that pharsalia of a sahay it would seemconcerning which we can spend no word in this brief summary fierce fighting fiery irresistible onslaught but it went too far lost all its captured cannon again and returned only with laurels and a heavy account of killed and woundedthe leader of it being himself carried home in a very bleeding state oh the incomparable troops cried pariscried voltaire withal as i gather and in very high company in that visit at aachen a sally glorious but useless  the imperial generals were just sitting down to dinner when it broke out had intended a council of war over their wine in the granddukes tent what wont they let us have our dinner cried prince karl in petulant humor struggling to be mirthful he rather likes his dinner this prince karl i am told and does not object to his wine otherwise a hearty talky freeandeasy princeblack shallowset eyes face red and much marked with smallpox clapping on his hat faculties sharpened by hunger and impatience let him do his best for several hours to come till the sally abate and go its ways again leaving its cannon and trophies no sally could hope to rout 60000 men this furious sally almost equal to sahay had to return home again on the above terms upon which prince karl and the others got some snatch of dinner and the inexorable pressure of siege tightening itself closer and closer went on as before  the eyes of all europe are turned towards prag a big crisis clearly preparing itself there france or aid in france is some 500 miles away in dharcourt merely gathering magazines with his khevenhuller near is no help help not the question there the garrison of eger 100 miles to west of us across the mountains barely mans its own works other strong post or support of any kind in these countries we have now none we are 24000 and of available resource have the magazines in prag and our own right hands  the flower of the young nobility had marched in that oriflammenow standing at bay they and it in prag yonder french honor itself seems shut up there the thought of it agitates bitterly the days and nights of old fleury who is towards ninety now and always disliked war the french public toowe can fancy what a public the young nobility in prag has its spokesmen and spokeswomen at versailles whose complaint waxes louder shriller the whole world excited by rumor of those furious sallies is getting shrill and loud what can old fleury do but order maillebois leave dunkirk to its own luck march immediately for relief of prag and maillebois is already on march his various divisions august 9th20th crossing the rhine in dusseldorf countryof whom we shall hear   some time before the actual bombardment fleury seeing it inevitable had ordered belleisle to treat belleisle

belleisle responded nothing unpolite merely some alors monsieur and rode back to prag with a spirit all in white heatgradually heating all the 24000 white and keeping them so  in fact belleisle a highflown lion reduced to silence and now standing at bay much distinguishes himself in this siege which for his sake is still worth a moments memory from mankind he gathers himself into iron stoicism into concentration of endeavor suffers all things broglios domineering in the first place as if his own thin skin were that of a rhinoceros and is prepared to dare all things like an excellent soldier like an excellent citizen he contrives arranges leads covertly drives the domineering broglio by rule of contraries or otherwise according to the nature of the beast animates all men by his laconic words by his silences which are still more emphatic sechelles provident of the future has laid in immense supplies of indifferent biscuit beef was not attainable belleisle dismounts his 4000 cavalry

sitting the while in such haste to be at the ramparts again the 80000 townsfolk except some jews are against them to a man belleisle cares for everything there is strict charge on his soldiers to observe discipline observe civility to the townsfolk there is occasional hanging of a prag butcher or so convicted of spyship but the minimum of that we will hope     maillebois marches with an army

quits prag belleisle will not have to do his function by the medium of pigdriving but in the direct manner henceforth give me 6 or 8000 foot and what of the cavalry have horses still uneaten proposes

the other side plunge home upon prince karl and the grandduke beat them with your broglio to help in the rear that possibly was friedrichs thought as he watched now home at berlin again the contemporaneous theatre of war  but that was not the mailleboisbroglio methodnay it is said maillebois was privately forbidden to run risks broglio with his stretchedout hand 12000 some count him and indeed it is no matter sits quiet at toplitz far too oblique come then come o maillebois mailleboismanoeuvring prince karl aside or hunger doing it for himdid once push forward pragward by the pass of

immortal godsthough a part too majority by count of heads were dragging him to tartarus again exquisite unparalleled exclaimed good judges as fleury himself had anticipated on examining the

have been to see the king of prussia since i began this letter beginning of it dates september 1st i have courageously resisted his fine proposals he offers me a beautiful house in berlin a pretty estate but i prefer my secondfloor in madame du chatelets here he assures me of his favor of the perfect freedom i should haveand i am running to paris did not just yet run to my slavery and persecution i could fancy myself a small athenian refusing the bounties of the king of persia with this difference however one had liberty not slavery at athens and i am sure there were many cidevilles there instead of onehelas my cideville  2 to marquis dargenson worthy official gentleman not warminister now or afterwards warministers senior brothervoltaires old schoolfellows both these brothers in the college of louis le grand i have just been to see the king of prussia in these late days in fact quitted him only yesterday both of us after a week together leaving aix yesterday i have seen him as one seldom sees kingsmuch at my ease in my own room in the chimneynook whither the same man who has gained two battles would come and talk familiarly as scipio did with terence you will tell me i am not terence true but neither is he altogether scipio  i learned some extraordinary thingsthings not from friedrich at all mere dinnertable rumors about the 16000 english landing here 18000 he calls them and farther on 20000 with the other 16000 plus 6000 of hanoverianhessian sort expecting 20000 dutch to join themwho perhaps will not m de neipperg governor of luxemburg now is come hither to brussels but brings no dutch troops with him as he had hopeddutch perhaps wont rise after all this flogging and hoisting perhaps we may soon get a useful and glorious peace in spite of my lord stair and of m van haren the tyrtaeus of the statesgeneral famed van haren eyes in a fine dutch frenzy rolling whose causeofliberty verses let no man inquire after stair prints memoirs van haren makes odes and with so much prose and so much verse perhaps their high and slow mightinesses excellency fenelon sleeplessly busy persuading them and native gravitation sleepily ditto will sit quiet god grant it  the english want to attack us on our own soil actually stairs plan and we cannot pay them in that kind the match is too unfair if we kill the whole 20000 of them we merely send 20000 heretics towhat shall i saya lenfer and gain nothing if they kill us they even feed at our expense in doing it better have no quarrels except on locke and newton the quarrel i have on mahomet is happily only ridiculous adieu m le marquis  3 to the cardinal de fleury monseigneur to give your eminency as i am bound some account of my journey to aixlachapelle friedrichs guest there let us hear let us look  i could not get away from brussels till the 2d of this month on the road i met a courier from the king of prussia coming to reiterate his masters orders on me the king had me lodged near his own apartment and he passed for two consecutive days four hours at a time in my room with all that goodness and familiarity which forms as you know part of his character and which does not lower the kings dignity because one is duly careful not to abuse it be careful i had abundant time to speak with a great deal of freedom on what your eminency had prescribed to me and the king spoke to me with an equal frankness  first he asked me if it was true that the french nation was so angered against him if the king was and if you were i answeredmildly reprobatory yet conciliative hm no nothing permanent nothing to speak of he then deigned to speak to me at large of the reasons which had induced him to be so hasty with the peace extremely remarkable reasons dare not trust them to this paper brogliobelleisle discrepancies we guess distracted broglio proceduresthey have no concern with that pallandtletter storythey do not turn on the pretended secret negotiations at the court of vienna which are not pretended at all as i among others well know in regard to which your eminency has condescended to clear yourself by denying the truth poor eminency there was no help otherwise all i dare state is that it seems to me easy to lead back the mind of this sovereign whom the situation of his territories his interest and his taste would appear to mark as the natural ally of france  he said farther what may be relied on as true by his eminency fleury and my readers here that he passionately wished to see bohemia in the emperors hands small chance for it as things now go that he renounced with the best faith in the world all claim whatever on berg and julich and that in spite of the advantageous proposals which lord stair was making him he thought only of keeping silesia that he knew well enough the house of austria would one day wish to recover that fine province but that he trusted he could keep his conquest that he had at this time 130000 soldiers always ready that he would make of neisse glogau brieg fortresses as strong as wesel which he is now diligently doing and will soon have done that besides he was well informed the queen of hungary already owed 80000000 german crowns which is about 300 millions of our money about 12 millions sterling that her provinces exhausted and lying wide apart would not be able to make long efforts and that the austrians for a good while to come could not of themselves be formidable of themselves no but with britannic souproyal in quantity  my lord hyndford had spoken to him as if france were entirely discouraged and done for how false monseigneur and lord stair in his letters represented france a month ago as ready to give in lord stair has not ceased to press his majesty during this aix excursion even and in spite of what your eminency hears from the hague there was on the 30th of august an englishman at aix on the part of milord stair and he had speech with the king of prussia croyez moi in a little village called boschet burtscheid where are hot wells a quarter of a league from aix i have been assured moreover that the englishman returned in much discontent on the other hand general schmettau who was with the king elder schmettau graf samuel who does a great deal of envoying for his majesty sent at that very time to brussels for maps of the moselle and of the three bishoprics and purchased five copiesmeans to examine milord stairs proposed seat of war at any rate here is a pleasant friend to have on visit to you in the next apartment with such an eye and such a nose  monseigneur finely

least ruined leaving the tolpatchery under one festititz to caracole round the black horizon on the west farther as the moldau is rolling ice and lobkowitz is afraid of his pontoons he drags them out

good deal deranged just now the revenues having for two years and a half past been rather small amounting to only 400 crowns 60 pounds a year which could not be made to cover all the little expenses required in the adjustments of ladies this circumstance added to our cardplaying though small which we could not dispense with has led us into debts mine amount to 225 pounds 1500 crowns my sisters to 270 pounds 1800 crowns  we have not spoken of it to the queenmother though we are well sure she would have tried to assist us but as that could not have been done without some inconvenience to her and she would have retrenched in some of her own little entertainments i thought we should do better to apply direct to your majesty being persuaded you would have taken it amiss had we deprived the queen of her smallest pleasureand especially as we consider you my dear brother the father of the family and hope you will be so gracious as help us we shall never forget the kind acts of your majesty and we beg you to be persuaded of the perfect and tender attachment with which we are proud to be all our livesyour majestys most humble and most obedient sisters and servants  louiseulrique anneamelie

but answered that he could not for all that follow the wish of his imperial majesty that he broglio had later orders and must obey them upon which the imperial majesty nature irrepressibly asserting

karl in his bowels going at such a rate may judge now whether it was wise to lie in that loose posture scattered over two thousand square miles and snort on his judicious seckendorfs advices and urgencies as he did readers anticipate the issue and shall not be wearied farther with detail there are as we said three austrian armies pressing on this luckless bavaria and its french protectors khevenhuller from salzburg and the southern quarter pushing in his dauns lobkowitz hanging over us from the oberpfalz naabriver country on the north and prince karl on one or sometimes on both sides of the donau pricking sharply into the rear of us saying by bayonets burnt bridges bombshells off swift it will be better for you and broglio has lost head a mere whirlwind of flaming gases and your ablest comte de saxe in such position what can he do broglio writes to versailles that there will be no continuing in bavaria that he recommends an order to march homewardsmuch to the surprise of versailles  the court of versailles was much astonished at the message it got from broglio court of versailles had always calculated that broglio could keep bavaria and had gone into extensive measures for maintaining him there experienced old marechal de noailles has a new french army 70000 or more assembled in the upper rhine for that and the cognate objects of whom more specially anon noailles by order from court has detached 12000 who are now marching their best to reinforce broglioand indeed the court had already appointed the generals and staffofficers for broglios bavarian army and gratified many men by promotions which now went to smoke espagnac i 190  versailles however has to expedite the order come home then order or no order broglios posts are all crackling off again bursting aloft like a chain of powdermines broglio is plunging head foremost towards donauworth towards ingolstadt his place of arms seckendorf now welcome to join him but unable to do anything when joined blustering broglio has no steadfastness of mind explodes like an inflammable body in this crackling off of the posts and becomes a mere whirlwind of flaming gases old snuffling seckendorf born to ill success in his old days strong only in caution how is he to quench or stay this crackling of the posts broglio blusters reproaches bullies seckendorf quarrels with him outright as he may well do jarnibleu such a delirious whirlwind of a marechal mere bickering flames and sootand looks out chiefly to keep his own skin and that of his poor bavarians whole  the unhappy kaiser has run from munchen again to augsburg for some brief shelter cannot stay there either in the circumstances will he have to hurry back to frankfurt to bankruptcy and furnished lodgingsnay to the britannic majestys tender mercies whose army is now actually there those indignant prophesyings to broglio at the schloss of wolnzach have so soon come true and broglio and the french arewhat a staff to lean upon enough the poor kaiser after doleful council of war held at augsburg june 25th does on the morrow make off for frankfurt againwhither else britannic majestys intentions friends tell him friend wilhelm of

battle and treaty alike  add to which fine set of results simultaneously with them his britannic majesty third effort successful has got his sword drawn fairly out at last and in the air is making horrid circles with it ever since march last nay does he flatters himself a very considerable slash with it in this current month of june of which though loath we must now take some notice  the fact is though stair could not hoist the dutch and our doublequick britannic heroism had to drop dead in consequence carteret has done it carteret himself rushed over in that crisis a fiery emphatic man and chief minister arrived at the hague 5th october 1742 adelung iii a 294eager to please his masters humor said enemies yes doubtless but acting on his own turbid belief withal says fact and revolving big thoughts in his head about bringing friedrich over to the cause of liberty giving french ambition a lesson for once and the like carteret strongly pulleying all hands heaveohand no doubt those mailleboisbroglio events from prag assisting himdid bring the high mightinesses to their legs still in a staggering splayfooted posture but trying to steady themselves that is to say the high mightinesses did agree to go with us in the cause of liberty will now pay actual subsidies to her hungarian majesty at the rate of two for our three and will add so soon as humanly possible 20000 men to those windbound 40000 of ourswhich latter shall now therefore at once as pragmatic army that is the term fixed on get on march frankfurt way and strike home upon the french and other enemies of pragmatic sanction this is what noailles has been looking for this good while and diligently adjusting himself in those middlerhine countries to give account of  pragmatic army lifted itself accordinglystair and the most of his english from ghent where the wearisome headquarters had been hanoverians hessians from we will forget whereand in various streaks and streams certain austrians

general ligonier general heywood left with the reserve at brusselsand from the ashes of the old newspapers the main stages and particulars of this surprising expedition england marching as pragmatic army into distant parts can be riddled out though they require mostly to be flung in again shocking weather on the march mere boreas and icy tempests snow in some places two feet deep rhine much swollen when we come to it  the austrian chief generalwho lies about wiesbaden and consults with stair while the english are crossingis duke dahremberg father of the prince de ligne or prince of coxcombs as some call him little or nothing of military skill in dahremberg but neipperg is thought to have given much counsel such as it was with the hessians there was some difficulty hesitation on landgraf wilhelms part who pities the poor kaiser and would fain see him back at frankfurt and awaken the britannic magnanimities for him to frankfurt say you we cannot fight against the kaiserand they had to be left behind for some time but at length did come on though late for business as it chanced general of these hessians is prince george of hessen worthy stout gentleman whom wilhelmina met at the frankfurt gayeties lately georges elder brother wilhelm is manager or vicelandgraf this long while back and in seven or eight years hence became as had been expected actual landgraf old king of sweden dying childlessof which wilhelm we shall have to hear at hanau a town of his in those parts and perhaps slightly elsewhere in the course of this business a fat just man he too probably somewhat iracund not without troubles in his house his eldest son heirapparent of hessen let me remind readers has an english princess to wife princess mary king georges daughter wedded two years ago that added to the subsidies is surely a point of unionthough again there may such discrepancies rise a good while after this the eldest son becoming catholic foolish wretch to the horror of papathere rose still other noises in the world about hessen and its landgraves of good prince george who doubtless attended in war councils but probably said little we hope to hear nothing more whatever  from neuwied to frankfurt is but a few days march for the pragmatic army in a direct line not sixty miles frankfurt itself which is a reichsstadt imperial city they must not enter fear not city or country

hither asks the public everywhere to go into the donau countries and enclose broglio between two fires that had been and was still stairs fine idea but dahremberg had disapproved the methods dahremberg it seems is rather given to opposing stairand there rise uncertainties in this pragmatic army certain only hitherto the magazine in hanau and in secret it afterwards appeared the immediate real errand of this pragmatic army had lainin the chapter of mainz cathedral and an election that was going on there  the old kurmainz namely had just died and there was a new chief spiritual kurfurst to be elected by the canons there kurmainz is chairman of the reich an important personage analogous to speaker of the house of commons and ought to beby no means the kaisers young brother as the french and kaiser are proposing but a man with austrian leaningssay graf von ostein titular domcustos cathedral keeper here lately ambassador in london and known in select society for what he is not much of an archbishop of a spiritual or chief spiritual herr hitherto but capable of being made onewere the pragmatic army at his elbow it was on this errand that the pragmatic army had come hither or come so early and with their plans still unripe and truly they succeeded got their ostein chosen to their mind 21st march 1743 mainz vacant 22d april ostein elected adelung iii b 113 121 a new kurmainzwhose leanings and procedures were very manifest in the sequel and some of them important before long this was always reckoned one result of his britannic majestys pragmatic campaignand truly some think it was in strict arithmetic the only one though that is far from his majestys own opinion     friedrich has objections to the pragmatic army but in vain of friedrichs many endeavors to quench this war by union of independent german princes by mediation of the reich and otherwise all in vain  friedrich at an early stage had inquired of his britannic majesty politely but with emphasis what in the world he meant then by invading the german reich leading foreign armies into the reich in this unauthorized manner to which the britannic majesty had answered with what vague argument of words we will not ask but with a look that we can fancylook that would split a pitcher as the irish say friedrich persisted to call it an invasion of the german reich and spoke at first of flatly opposing it by a reichs army 30000 or even 50000 for brandenburgs contingent in such case but as the poor reich took no notice and the britannic majesty was positive friedrich had to content himself with protest for the present friedrichs remonstrance and georges response are in adelung iii b 132 date march 1743 date of friedrichs first stirring in the matter is january 1743 and earlier ib p 37 p 8 c  the exertions of friedrich to bring about a peace or at least to diminish not increase the disturbance are forgotten now wearisome to think of as they did not produce the smallest result but they have been incessant and zealous as those of a man to quench the fire which is still raging in his street and from which he himself is just saved cannot the reich be roused for settlement of this bavarianaustrian quarrel thought friedrich always and spent a great deal of earnest endeavor in that direction wished a reichs army of mediation to which i will myself furnish 30000 50000 if needed reich alas the reich is a horse fallen down to dieno use spurring at the reich it cannot for many months on friedrichs proposal though the question was far from new and had been two years on hand come to the decision well then yes the reich will try to moderate and mediate and as for a reichs mediationarmy or any practical step at all the question had been started in august 1741 by the kaiser himself 11th march 1743 again urged by him after friedrichs offer 10th may 1743 yes then we will try but and the result continued zero  is not germany are not all the german princes interested to have peace thinks friedrich a union of the independent german princes to recommend peace and even with hand on swordhilt to command it that would be the method of producing treaty of peace thinks he always and is greatly set on that method which we find has been and continues to be the soul of his many efforts in this matter a fact to be noted long poring in those mournful imbroglios of dryasdust where the fraction of living and important welters overwhelmed by wildernesses of the dead and nugatory one at length disengages this fact and readers may take it along with them for it proves illuminative of friedrichs procedures now and afterwards a fixed notion of friedrichs this of german princes uniting when the common dangers become flagrant a very lively notion with him at present he will himself cheerfully take the lead in such union but he must not venture alone see adelung iii a and b passim valori i 178 c c  the reich when appealed to with such degree of emphasis in this matterwe see how the reich has responded later on friedrich tried the swabian circle chief scene of these austrianbavarian tusslings which has like the other circles a kind of parliament and pretends to be a political unity of some sort cannot the swabian circle or swabian and frankish joined to which one might declare oneself protector in such case order their own captains with military force of their own say 20000 men to rank on the frontier and to inform peremptorily all belligerents and tumultuous persons french bavarian english austrian no thoroughfare we tell you no admittance here friedrich disappointed of the reich had taken up that smaller notion and he spent a good deal of endeavor on that tooof which we may see some glimpse as we proceed but it proves all futile the swabian circle too is a moribund horse all these horses dead or moribund  friedrich of course has thought much what kind of peace could be offered by a mediating party the kaiser has lost his bavaria yet he is the kaiser and must have a living granted him as such compensations aspirations claims of territory these will be manifold these are a world of floating vapor of greed of anger idle pretension but within all these there are the real necessities what the case does require if it is ever to be settled friedrich discerns this austrianbavarian necessity of compensation of new land to cut upon and where is that to come from  in january last friedrich intensely meditating this business had in private a brightenough idea that of secularizing those socalled sovereign bishoprics austrianbavarian by locality and nature passau salzburg regensburg idle opulent territories with functions absurd not usefuland of therefrom cutting compensation to right and to left this notion he by obscure channels put into the head of baron von haslang bavarian ambassador at london where it germinated rapidly and came to fruitwas officially submitted to lord carteret in his own house in two highly artistic forms one eveningand sets the diplomatic heads all wagging upon it adelung iii b 84 90 januarymarch 1743 with great hope at one time till rumor of it got abroad into the orthodox imagination into the gazetteer world and raised such a clamor in those months as seldom was secularize hah one sees the devilish heathen spirit of you and what kind of kaiser on the religious side we now have the happiness of having so that kaiser karl had to deny utterly never heard of such a thing carteret himself had in politeness to deny much more and for dire cause had haslang himself over the belly of facts never in my dreams i tell youand to get ambiguous certificate from carteret which the simple could interpret to that effect carterets letter ibid iii b 190  it was only in whispers that the name of friedrich was connected with this fine scheme and all parties were glad to get it soon buried again a bright idea but had come a century too soon of another carteret negotiation with kaiser karl famed as conferences of hanau which had almost come to be a treaty but did not and then failing that of a famous carteret treaty of worms which did come to perfection in these same localities shortly afterwards and which were infinitely interesting to our friedrich both the treaty and the failure of the treatywe propose to speak elsewhere in due time  as to friedrichs own endeavors and industries at regensburg and elsewhere for effective mediation of peace for the reich to mediate and have army of mediation for a union of swabian circles to do it for this and then for that to do itas to friedrichs own efforts and strugglings that way in all likely and in some unlikely quartersthey were and continued to be earnest incessant but without result like the spurring of horses really dead some time ago of which no reader wishes the details though the fact has to be remembered and so with slight indication for friedrichs sakebeing intent on the stage of eventswe must leave that shadowy

15th soon followed by carteret from the hague biographia britannica kippins carteret iii 277 a majesty prepared now for battle and for treaty alike kind of earthly jove arbiter of nations or victorious hercules of the pragmatic the sublime little man at herrenhausen he has a fine time grandly fugling about negotiating with wilhelm of hessen and others commanding his pragmatic army from the distance and then at last dashing off rather in haste heit is well known what enigmatic exploit he did at least the name of it is well known here from the imbroglios is a rough account parts of which are introducible for the sake of english readers     battle of dettingen  after some five leisurely weeks in herrenhausen george ii now an old gentleman of sixty with his martial fat boy the duke of cumberland and lord carteret his diplomatistinchief quitted that pleasant sojourn rather on a sudden for the actual seat of war by speedy journeys they got to frankfurt country to hanau june 19th whence still up the mayn twenty or thirty miles farther up to aschaffenburgwhere the pragmatic army after some dangerous manoeuvring on the opposite or south bank of the river has lain encamped some days and is in questionable posture whither his majesty in person has hastened up and truly if his majestys head contain any good counsel there is great need of it here just now  captains and men were impatient of that long loitering hanging idle about frankfurt all through may and they have at length started real businesswith more valor than discretion it is feared they are some 40 or 44000 strong english 16000 hanoverians the like number and of austrians by theory 20000 say in effect 12000 or even 8000 all paid by england they have hanau for magazine they have rearguard of 12000 the 6000 hessians and 6000 new hanoverians who at last are actually on march thither near arriving there forward said the captaincy said stair chiefly it was thought shall the whole summer waste itself to no purposeand are up the river thus far not on the most considerate terms  what this pragmatic army means to do that is and has been a great question for all the world especially for noailles and the frenchnot to say for the pragmatic itself get into lorraine think the french get into alsace and wrest it from us for behoof of her hungarian majestyplundered goods which indeed belong to the reich and her in a sense elssass alsace outerseat with its roadfortress strasburg plundered from the holy romish reich by louis xiv in a way no one can forget actually plundered as if by highway robbery or by highway robbery and attorneyism combined on the part of that great sovereign to strasburg to lorraine perhaps or to the three bishoprics metz toul verdunreaders recollect that siege of metz which broke the great heart of karl v who raged and fired as man seldom did with 50000 men against guise and the intrusive french for six weeks sound of his cannon heard at strasburg on winter nights 300 years ago to no purpose for his captains of the siege after trial and second trial solemnly shook their heads and the great kaiser breaking into tears had to raise the siege of metz and went his way never to smile more in this world and metz and toul and verdun remain with the french ever sinceto the three bishoprics possibly enough  or they may purpose for the donau countries where broglio is crackling off like trains of gunpowder and lend hand to prince karl thereby enclosing broglio fires this according to present aspects is between two the likeliest and perhaps had provenders and arrangements been made beforehand for such a march this had been the feasiblest and to my own notion it was some wild hope of doing this without provenders or prearrangements that had brought the pragmatic into its present quarters at aschaffenburg which are for the military mind a mystery to this day  early in the spring the french government had equipped noailles with 70000 men to keep watch and patrol about in the rhinemayn countries and look into those points which he has been vigilantly doingposted of late on the south or left bank of the maynand is especially vigilant since june 14th when the pragmatic army got on march across the mayn at hochst and took to offering him battle on his own south side of the river noaillesthough his force still 58000 after that broglio detachment of 12000 was greatly the strongerwould not fight preferred cutting off the enemys supplies capturing his riverboats provisionconvoys from hanau and settling him by hunger as the cheaper method impetuous stair was thwarted by flat protest of his german colleagues especially by dahremberg in forcing battle on those rash terms we austrians absolutely will not said dahremberg at last and withdrew or was withdrawing he for his part across the river again so that stair also was obliged to recross the river in indignant humor and now lies at aschaffenburg suffering the sad alternative short diet namely which will end in famine soon if these counsels prevail  stair and dahremberg do not well accord in their opinions nor it seems is anybody in particular absolute chief there are likewise heats and jealousies between the hanoverian and the english troops are not we come for all your goods yes damn you and for all our chattels tooand withal it is frightfully uncertain whether a high degree of intellect presides over these 44000 fighting men which may lead them to something or a low degree which can only lead them to nothingthe blame is all laid on stair too rash they say possibly enough too rash and possibly enough withal even to a sound military judgment in such unutterable puddle of jarring imbecilities rashness headlong courage offered the one chance there was of success who knows had all the 44000 been as rash as stair and his english but luck and sheer hard fighting might have favored him as skill could not in those sad circumstances stairs plan was beat noailles and you have done everything provisions opulent new regions and all else shall be added to you stairs plan might have answeredhad stair been the master to execute it which he was not dahrembergs also who protested wait till your 12000 join and you have your provisions was the orthodox plan and might have much to say for itself but the two plans collapsing into onethat was the clearly fatal method magnanimous stair never made the least explanation to an undiscerning public or parliament wrapt himself in strict silence and accepted in a grand way what had come to him his papers to voluminous extent are still in the family archivesnot inaccessible i think were the right student of them who would be a rare article among us to turn up clear it is the pragmatic army had come across again at aschaffenburg sunday june 16th and was found there by his majesty on the wednesday following with its two internecine plans fallen into mutual death a pragmatic army in truly dangerous circumstances  the english who were in and round aschaffenburg itself hanoverians and austrians encamping farther down had put a battery on the bridge of aschaffenburg hoping to be able to forage thereby on the other side of the mayn whereupon noailles had instantly clapt a redoubt under due cover of a wood at his end of the bridge no passage this way gentlemen except into the cannons throatso that marshal stair reconnoitring that way had his hat shot off and rapidly drew back again nay before long noailles at the village of seligenstadt some eight miles farther down throws two wooden or pontoon bridges over sketch of plan at p 257 can bring his whole army across at seligenstadt prohibits all manner of supply to us from hanau or our magazines by his arrangement therenotable little seligenstadt city of the blessed where eginhart and emma ever since charlemagnes time lie waiting the resurrection that is the place of these noailles contrivancesfurthermore we learn noailles has seized a post twenty miles farther up the river miltenberg the name of it and will prevent supplies from coming down to us out of branken or the neckar country we had forgotten or our collapse of plans had done it that an army moves on its stomach as the king of prussia says and that we have nothing to live upon in these parts  such has the unfortunate fact turned out to be when britannic majesty arrives and it can now be discovered clearly by any eyes however flat to the head and a terrible fact it is discordant generals accuse one another hungry soldiers cannot be kept from plundering for the horses there is unripe rye in quantity but what is there for the men my poor traditionary friends of the grey dragoons were wont i have heard to be heartrending on this point in after years famine being urgent discipline is not possible nor existence itself for a week longer george rather in obstinate hope than with any reasonable plan or exertion still tries it finds after repeated councils of war that he will have to give it up and go back to hanau where his living is wednesday night 26th june 1743 that is the final resolution inevitably come upon without argument and about one on thursday morning the army in two columns austrians to vanward well away from the river english as rearguard close on it gets in motion to execute said resolutionif the army can  if the army can but that is like to be a formidably difficult business with a noailles watching every step of you today and for ten days back in these sad circumstances eyes in him like a lynx they say and great skill in war only too cautious hardly is the army gone from aschaffenburg when noailles pushing across by the bridge seizes that postno retreat now for us thitherward his majesty who marches in the rear division has happily some artillery with him repels the assaults from behind which might have been more serious otherwise as it is there play cannon across the river upon himwhy not bend to right and get out of range asks the reader the spessart hills rise high and woody on the right and there is in many places no marching except within range noailles has five effective batteries at the various good points on his side of the riverand that is nothing to what he has got ready for us were we once at dettingen within wind of his two bridges a little beyond noailles has us in a perfect mousetrap souriciere as he felinely calls it and calculates on having annihilation ready for us at dettingen  dettingen short way above those pontoons at seligenstadt is near eight miles westward northwestward but let us use the briefer term from aschaffenburg dettingen is a poor peasant village of some size close on the mayn and on our side of it a brook coming down from the spessart mountains falls into the mayn there having formed for itself there and upwards a considerable dell or hollow way chiefly on the western or right bank of which stands the village with its barnyards and piggeries on both sides of the great highroad which here crosses the brook and will lead you to hanau twenty miles offor back to aschaffenburg and even to nurnberg and the donau countries if you persevere except that of the highroad dettingen brook has no bridge above the village after coming from the mountains the banks of it are boggy especially the western bank which spreads out into a scrubby waste of moor for some good space in which scrubby moor as elsewhere in this dell or hollow way itself where the village hangs with its hedges piggeries colegarthsthere is like to be bad enough marching for a column of men noailles as we said has two bridges thrown across the mayn just below and the last of his five batteries from the other side will command dettingen his plan of operation is this  by these bridges he has passed 24000 horse and foot across the river under his nephew the chivalrous duke of grammont these with due artillery and equipment are to occupy the village and to rank themselves in battleorder to leftward of it on the moor just mentionedwell behind that hollow way with its brook and bogsand one thing they must note well not to stir from that position till the english columns have got fairly into said hollow way and brook of dettingen and are plunging more or less distractedly across the entanglements there with cannon on their left flank and such a gullet to pass through one may hope they will be in rather an attackable condition across that gullet it is our intention they shall never get how can they if grammont do his duty  this is noailless plan one of the prettiest imaginable say military menhad the execution but corresponded noailles had seized aschaffenburg so soon as the english were out of it noailles from his batteries beyond the river salutes the english march with continuous shot and thunder which is very discomposing he sees confidently a really fair likelihood of capturing the britannic majesty and his pragmatic army unless they prefer to die on the ground seldom since that of the caudine forks did any army by illluck and illguidance get into such a pinfolddeath or flat surrender seemingly their one alternative  thus march these english that dewy morning thursday june 27th 1743 with cannon playing on their left flank and such a fate ahead of them had they known itvery short of breakfast too for most part but they have one fine quality and britannic george like all his welf race from henry the lion down to these days has it in an eminent degree they are not easily put into flurry into fear in all welf sovereigns and generally in teuton populations on that side of the channel or on this there is the requisite unconscious substratum of taciturn inexpugnability with depths of potential rage almost unquenchable to be found when you apply for it which quality will much stead them on the present occasion and indeed it is perhaps strengthened by their stupidity itself what neighbors call their stupiditywant of idle imagining idle flurrying nay want even of knowing is not one of the worst qualities just now they tramp on paying a minimum of attention to the cannon ignorant of what is ahead hoping only it may be breakfast in some form before the day quite terminate the day is still young hardly 8 oclock when their advanced parties find dettingen beset find a whole french army drawn up on the scrubby moor there and come galloping back with this interesting bit of news pause hereupon much consulting in fact endless hithering and thithering the affair being knotty fight yes now at last but how impetuous stair was not wanting to himself neipperg too they say was useful with advice dahremberg i should imagine good for little  some six hours followed of thriceintricate deploying planting of fieldpieces counterbatteries ranking reranking shuffling hither and then thither of horse and foot noailless cannonade proceeding all the while the english still considerably exposed to it and standing it like stones chivalrous grammont and with better reason the english much wishing these preliminaries were done a difficult business that of deploying here the pragmatic had no room jammed so against the spessart hills and obliged to lean from the river and noailless cannon had to rank itself in six some say in eight lines horse behind foot as well as on flank unsatisfactory to the military mind and i think had not done shuffling and reshuffling at 2 pmwhen the enemy came bursting on with a peremptory finish to it enough of that messieurs les anglais too much of it a great deal thought messieurs grimly in response and there ensued a really furious clash of host against host french chivalry maison du roi black mousquetaires the flower of their horse regiments dashing in right gallic frenzy on their natural enemieson the english that is who i find were mainly on the left wing there horse and foot and had mainly the austrians and they very mainly the work to doand did with an effort and luck helping manage to do it  grammont breaks orders thriceblamable grammont exclaim noailles and others sorrowfully wringing their hands even so grammont had waited seven mortal hours ones courage burning all the while courage perhaps rather burning downand not the least use coming of if grammont had in natural impatience gradually edged forward and in the end was being cannonaded and pricked into by the enemyand did at last with his maisonduroi dash across that essential hollow way and plunge in upon them on their own side of it and the english foot gave their volley too soon ad grammont did in effect partly repulse and disorder the front ranks of them and blazing up uncontrollable at sight of those first ranks in disorder did press home upon them more and more get wholly into the affair bringing on his infantry as well let us finish it wholly now that our hand is inand took one cannon from the enemy and did other feats  so furious was that first charge of his maisonduroi covering itself with gloryfor a short while maisonduroi broke three lines of the enemy three not five did in some places actually break through in others could not but galloped along the front three of their lines but the fourth line would not break much the contrary it advanced austrians and english with steady fire hotter and hotter upon this fourth line maisonduroi had itself to break pretty much altogether and rush home again in ruinous condition our front lines made lanes for them terribly maltreating them with musketry on right and left as they galloped through and this was the end of grammonts successes this charge of horse for his infantry had no luck anywhere and the essential crisis of the battle had been here it continued still a good while plenty of cannonading fusillading but in sporadic detached form a confused series of small shocks and knocks which were mostly or all unfortunate for grammont and which at length knocked him quite off the field he was now interlaced with the english moans noailles so that my cannon not to shoot grammont as well as the english had to cease firing well yes that is true m le marechal but that is not so important as you would have it the english had stood nine hours in this fire of yours by degrees leaning well away from it answering it with counterbatteriesand were not yet ruined by it when the grammont crisis came noailles should have dashed fresh troops across his bridges and tried to handle them well noailles did not do that or do anything but wring his hands  the fight lasted four hours ever hotter on the english part ever less hot on the french fire of anthracitecoal versus flame of dry wood which latter at last sinks ashyand ended in total defeat of the french the french infantry by no means behaved as their cavalry had done the gardes francaises fire burning ashy after seven hours of flaming when grammont ordered them up to take the english in flank would hardly come on at all or stand one push they threw away their arms and plunged into the river like a drove of swimmers getting drowned in great numbers so that their comrades nicknamed them canards du mein ducks of the mayn and in english messrooms there went afterwards a saying the french had in reality three bridges one of them not wooden and carpeted with blue cloth such the wit of military mankind   the english it appears did something by mere shouting partial huzzas and counterhuzzas between the infantries were going on at one time when stair happened to gallop up stop that said stair let us do it right silence then one and all when i give you signal and stair at the right moment lifting his hat there burst out such a thundergrowl edged with melodious ire in alt as quite seemed to strike a damp into the french says my authority and they never shouted more our ground in many parts was under rye hedgeless fields of rye chief graincrop of that sandy country we had already wasted above 120000 acres of it still in the unripe state so hungry were we man and horse since crossing to aschaffenburgfighting for your cause of liberty ye benighted ones  king friedrichs private accounts deformed by ridicule are that the britannic majesty his respectable old uncle finding the french there barring his way to breakfast understood simply that there must and should be fighting of the toughest but had no plan or counsel farther that he did at first ride up to see what was what with his own eyes but that his horse ran away with him frightened at the cannon upon which he hastily got down drew sword put himself at the head of his hanoverian infantry on the right wing and stoodleft foot drawn back sword pushed out in the form of a fencingmaster doing lungesteadily in that defensive attitude inexpugnable like the rocks till all was over and victory gained this is defaced by the spirit of ridicule and not quite correct britannic majestys horse one of those 500 fine animals did it is certain at last dangerously run away with him upon which he took to his feet and his hanoverians but he had been repeatedly on horseback in the earlier stages galloping about to look with his own eyes could they have availed him and was heard encouraging his people and speaking even in the english language steady my boys fire my brave boys give them fire they will soon run oeuvres de frederic iii 14 compare anonymous life of

no plan sans peur et sans avis as me might term it like a real hanoverian sovereign of england like england itself and its ways in those german wars a typical epitome of long sections of english history that attitude of lunge  the english officers also it is evident behaved in their usual waywithout knowledge of war without fear of death or regard to utmost peril or difficulty cheering their men and keeping them steady upon the throats of the french so far as might be and always after that first stumble with the french horse was mended they kept gaining ground thrusting back the enemy not over the dettingen brook and moorground only but knock after knock out of his woody or other coverts back and ever back towards welzheim kahl and those two bridges of his the flamy french ligneous fire burning lower and lower versus anthracitic glowing brighter and brighter found that they had a bad time of itfound in fact that they could not stand it and tumbled finally in great torrents across their bridges on the mayn many leaping into the river the english sitting dreadfully on the skirts of them so that had the english had their cavalry in readiness to pursue noailless army in the humor it had sunk to was ruined and the victory would have been conspicuously great but they had as too common nothing ready impetuous stair strove to get ready pushed out the grey dragoons for one item but the authorities refused stairs counsel as rash again and made no effectual pursuit at alltoo glad that they had brushed their battlefield triumphantly clear and got out of that fatal pinfold

wounded and bury our slain as well as his own we march through a pour of rain to hanau where our victuals are and 12000 new hessians and hanoverians by this time  noailles politely bandaged the wounded buried the dead noailles gathering his scattered battalions found that he had lost 2659 men no ruinous loss to himthe enemys being at least equal and all his wounded fallen prisoners of war no ruinous loss to noailles had it not been the loss of victorywhich was a sore blow to french feeling and adding itself to those broglio disgraces a new discouragement to most christian majesty victory indisputably lostbut is it not grammonts blame altogether grammont bears it as we saw and it is heavily laid on him but my own conjecture is forty thousand enraged people of english and other plattteutsch type would have been very difficult to pin up into captivity or death instead of breakfast in that manner and it is possible if poor grammont had not mistaken some other would have done

begin a quarrel but there need always two or more to end it again  most christian majesty is not so sensible of this fact as he afterwards became but what with broglio and the extinct oriflamme what with dettingen and the incipient pragmatic he is heartily disgusted and discouraged and wishes he had not thought of cutting germany in four july 26th most christian majesty applies to the german diet signifying that he did indeed undertake to help the kaiser according to treaties but was the farthest in the world from meaning to invade germany on his own score that he had and has no quarrel except with austria as kaisers enemy and is ready to be friends even with austria and now indeed intends to withdraw his troops wholly from the german territory and can therefore hope that all unpleasantness will cease between the german nation and him and that perhaps the kaiser will be able to make peace with her majesty of hungary on softer terms than at one time seemed likely if only the animosities

unexpected tone that it fixed everybodys attention and will very specially require to be noted by us in the course of a week or two  we said her hungarian majesty was getting crowned in bohemia getting personally homaged in upper austria about to get vicehomaged in bavaria itselfnothing but glorious pomp but loyalty loudly vocal in prag in linz and the onceafflicted countries at her return

britannic majesty stayed two whole months in hanau brushing himself up again after that fierce bout and considering with much dubitation what is the next thinggo in upon noailles who is still hanging about here with broglio coming on in the exploded state wreck broglio and him go in upon the french so urges stair always rash stair urgent to the edge of importunity english officers and martial boy urgently backing stair while the hanoverian officers and martial parent are steady to the other view so that in respect of war the next thing for two months coming was absolutely nothing and to the end of the campaign was nothing worth a moments notice from us but on the diplomatic side there were two somethings conferences at hanau with poor kaiser karl and treaty at worms with the king of sardinia whichas minus quantities or things less than nothingturned out to be highly considerable for his britannic majesty and us  hanau 7th july1st august 1743 poor kaiser karl had left augsburg june 26thwhile his broglio was ferrying at donauworth and his seckendorf treatying for armistice at niederschonfeldthe very day before dettingen what a piece of news to him that dettingen on his return to frankfurt  a few days after dettingen july 3d noailles who is still within call came across to see this poor stepson of fortune gives piteous account of him if any one were now curious on that head how he bitterly complains of broglio of the nosubsidies sent and is driven nearly desperatenot a penny in his pocket beyond all upon which latter clause noailles munificently advanced him a 6000 draught of 40000 crowns in my own name which doubtless the king in his compassion will see good to sanction campagnes de noailles amsterdam 1760 this is a sequel or rather vice versa to that which we have called des trois marechaux being of the same collection i 316328 his feelings on the loss of dettingen may be pictured but he had laid his account with such thingsprepared for the worst since that interview with broglio and conti one plan now left peace cost what it will  the poor kaiser had already as we saw got into hopes of bargaining with his britannic majesty and now he instantly sets about it while hanau is victorious headquarters britannic majesty is not himself very forward but carteret i rather judge had taken up the notion and on his majestys and carterets part there is actually the wish and attempt to pacificate the reich to do something tolerable for the poor kaiser as well as satisfactory to the hungarian majestysatisfactory or capable of being by the purseholder insisted on as such  and so the landgraf of hessen excellent wilhelm king georges friend and gossip is come over to that little town of hanau which is his own in the schloss of which king george is lodged and there between carteret and our landgrafthe king of prussias ambassador herr klinggraf and one or two selectly zealous official persons assisting or watchingwe have conferences of hanau going on in a zealous fashion all parties eager for peace to kaiser and reich and in good hope of bringing it about the wish ardent to a degree had been the kaisers first of all the scheme i guess was chiefly of carterets devising who in his magnificent mind regardless of expense thinks it may be possible and discerns well what a stroke it will be for the cause of liberty and how glorious for a britannic majestys adviser in such circumstances july 7th the conferences began and so frank and loyal were the parties in a weeks time matters were advanced almost to completion the fundamental outlines of a bargain settled and almost ready for signing  give me my bavaria again the kaiser had always said i am head of the reich and have nothing to live upon on one preliminary carteret had always been inexorable have done with your french auxiliaries send every soul of them home the german soil once cleared of them much will be possible till then nothing kaiser well give me back my bavaria my bavaria and something suitable to live upon as head of the reich some decent annual pension till bavaria come into paying conditioncannot you who are so wealthy and bavaria might be made a

kaiser carteret too is very glad exulting as he well may to have composed these worlddeliriums or concentrated them upon peccant france he with his single head and to have got a value out of that absurd pragmatic army after all a man of magnificent ideas who hopes to bring friedrich over to his mind to unite poor teutschland against such oriflamme invasions and intolerable interferences and to settle the account of france for a long while he is the only english minister who speaks german knows german situations interests ways or has the least real understanding of this huge german imbroglio in which england is voluntarily weltering and truly had carteret been king of england which he was notnay had king friedrich ever got to understand instead of misunderstand what carteret washere might have been a considerable affair  but it now at the eleventh hour came upon magnificent carteret now seemingly for the first time in its full force that he carteret was not the master that there was a bewildered parliament at home a poor peddling duke of newcastle leader of the same with his lords of the regency who could fatally put a negative on all this unless they were first gained over on the morrow july 15th carteret instead of signing as expected has topurpose a fortnights delay till he consult in england absolutely would not and could not sign till a courier to england went and returned to landgraf wilhelms to klinggrafs and the kaisers very great surprise disappointment and suspicion but carteret was inflexible will only take a fortnight said he and i can hope all will yet be well  the courier came back punctually in a fortnight his message was presented at hanau august 1stand ran conclusively to the effect no we noodle of newcastle and my other lords of regency do not consent much less will undertake to carry the thing through parliament by no manner of means so that carterets lately towering affair had to collapse ignominiously in that manner poor carteret protesting his sorrow his unalterable individual wishes and future endeavors not to speak of his britannic majestysand politely pressing on the poor kaiser a gift of 15000 pounds first weekly instalment of the annual pension that had in theory been set apart for him which the kaiser though indigent declined adelung iii b 206 209212 see coxe memoirs of pelham london 1829 i 75 469  the disgust of landgraf wilhelm was infinite who honest man saw in all this merely an artifice of carterets to undo the kaiser with his french allies to quirk him out of his poor help from the french and have him at their mercy shame on it cried landgraf wilhelm aloud and many others less aloud klinggraf and king friedrich among them what a carteret the landgraf turned away with indignation from perfidious england and began forming quite opposite connections you shall not even have my hired 6000 you perfidious thing done with such dexterity of art too thought the landgrafand continued to think till evidence turned up after many months carteret papers in british museum additional mss no 22529 may 1743january 1745 in no 22527 januaryseptember 1742 are other landgrafwilhelm pieces of correspondence this was friedrichs opinion toopermanently i believeand that of nearly all the world till the thing and the doer of the thing were contemptuously forgotten a piece of machiavelism on the part of carteret and perfidious albionequal in refined cunning to that of the ships with foul bottom which vanished from cadiz two years ago and were admired with a shudder by continental mankind who could see into millstones  this is the second stroke of machiavellian art by those islanders in their truly vulpine method stroke of art important for this history and worth the attention of english readersbeing almost of pathetic nature when one comes to understand it carteret for this hanau business had clangor enough to undergo poor man from germans and from english which was wholly unjust his trade say the englishor used to say till they forgot their considerable carteret altogetherwas that of rising in the world by feeding the mad german humors of little george a miserable trade yes my friendsbut it was not quite carterets if you will please to examine and none say carteret did not do his trade whatever it was with a certain greatnessat least till habits of drinking rather took him poor man impatient probably of such fortune long continued for he was thrown out next session of parliament by noodle of newcastle on those strange terms and never could get in again and is now forgotten and there succeeded him still more mournful phenomenasaid noodle or the poor pelhams namelyof whom as of strange minus quantities set to manage our affairs there is still some dreary remembrance in england well  carteret though there had been no duke of newcastle to run athwart this fine scheme would have had his difficulties in making her hungarian majesty comply her majestys great heart incurably grieved about silesia is bent on having if not restoration one day which is a hope she never quits at any rate some ample cannot be too ample equivalent elsewhere on the hanau scheme united teutschland with england for soul to it would have fallen vigorously on the throat of france and made france disgorge lorraine elsass the three bishopricsnot to think of burgundy and earlier plunders from the reichhere would have been cut and come again for her hungarian majesty and everybodybut diana in the shape of his grace of newcastle intervenes and all this has become chimerical and worse  it was while carterets courier was gone to england and not come back that king louis made the abovementioned mild almost penitent declaration to the reich good people let us have peace and all be as we were i for my share wish to be out of it i am for home and in effect was already home every frenchman in arms being by this time on his own side of the rhine as we shall presently observe  for the same day july 26th while that was going on at frankfurt and carterets returncourier was due in five days his britannic majesty at hanau had a splendid visittending not towards peace with france but quite the opposite way visit from prince karl with khevenhuller and other dignitaries doing us that honor till the evening of the 28th quitting their armywhich is now in these neighborhoods broglio

quarter of an equivalent for schlesienvery fine unless diana intervene diana or not french prospects or not her hungarian majesty fastens on bavaria with uncommon tightness of fist now that bavaria is swept clear well resolved to keep bavaria for equivalent till better come exacts by her deputy homage from the population there strict oath of fealty to her poor kaiser protesting his uttermost to no purpose kaisers poor printer at regensburg which is in bavaria getting tried and hanged for printing such protest she draughts forcibly the bavarian militias into her italian army is high and merciless on all handsin a word throttles poor bavaria as if to the choking of it outright so that the very gazetteers in foreign places gave voice though bavaria itself such a grasp on the throat of it was voiceless seckendorfs poor bargain for neutrality as a bavarian reicharmy her hungarian majesty disdains to confirm to confirm or even to reject treats seckendorf and his bavarian army little otherwise than as a stray dog which she has not yet shot and truly the old feldmarschall lies at wembdingen in most disconsolate moulting condition little or nothing to live uponthe english generous creatures had at one time flung him something fancying the armistice might be useful but now it must be the french that do it if anybody adelung iii b 204 22d august 206 c  hanau conferences having failed these things do not fail kaiser karl is become tragical to think of a spectacle of pity to landgraf wilhelm to king friedrich and serious onlookersand perhaps not of pity only but of pity and fear to some of themsullen austria taking its sweet revenges in this fashion readers who will look through these small chinks may guess what a worldwelter this was and how friedrich gazing into phase on phase of it as into oracles of fate which to him they were had a history in these months that will now never be known  august 16th came out her hungarian majestys response to that mild quasipenitent declaration of king louis to the reich and much astonished king louis and others and the very reich itself out of it says her hungarian majesty whom we with regret for brevitys sake translate from official into vulgate his most christian majesty wishes to be out of itdoes not he the what shall i call him crowned housebreaker taken in the fact you shall get out of it please heaven when you have made compensation for the damage done and till then not if it please heaven and in this strain lengthily official though indignant to a degree enumerates the wanton unspeakable mischiefs and outrages which austria a kind of sacred entity guaranteed by law of nature and eleven signatures of potentates has suffered from the most christian majestyand will have compensation for heaven now pointing the way in extenso in adelung iii b 201 et seqq  a most portentous document full of sombre emphasis in sonorous snuffling tone of voice enunciating with inflexible purpose a number of unexpected things very portentous to his prussian majesty among others forms a turningpoint or crisis both in the french war and in his prussian majestys history and ought to be particularly noted and dated by the careful reader it is here that we first publicly hear tell of compensation the necessity austria will have of compensationaustria does not say expressly for silesia but she says and means for loss of territory and for all other losses whatsoever compensation for the past and security for the future that is my full intention snuffles she in that slow metallic tone of hers irrevocable except by the gods  compensation for the past security for the future compensation what does her hungarian majesty mean asked all the world asked friedrich the now proprietor of silesia with peculiar curiosity it is the first time her hungarian majesty steps articulately forward with such extraordinary claim of damages as if she alone had suffered damagebut it is a fixed point at vienna and is an agitating topic to mankind in the coming months and years lorraine and the three bishoprics there would be a fine compensation then again what say you to bavaria in lieu of the silesia lost you have bavaria by the throat keep bavaria you give kurbaiern kaiser as they call him something in the netherlands to live upon will be better out of germany altogether with his french leanings or give him the kingdom of naplesif once we had conquered it again these were actual schemes successive simultaneous much occupying carteret and the high heads at vienna now and afterwards which came all to nothing but should were it not impossible be held in some remembrance by readers  another still more unexpected point comes out here in this singular document publicly for the first time austrias feelings in regard to the imperial election itself namely that austria considers and has all along considered the said election to be fatally vitiated by that exclusion of the bohemian vote to be in fact nullified thereby and that to her clear view the present socalled kaiser is an imaginary quantity and a mere kaiser of french shreds and patches der seynsollende kaiser snuffles austria in one passage your kaiser as you call him and in another passage instead of kaiser puts flatly kurbaiern this is a most extraordinary doctrine to an electoral romish reich is the holy romish reich to declare itself an enchanted wiggery then and do suicide for behoof of austria  august 16th this extraordinary document was delivered to the chancery of mainz and september 23d it was contrary to expectation brought to dictatur by said chanceryof which latter phrase and phenomenon here is the explanation to english readers  had the late kurmainz general archchairman speaker of the diet been still in office and existence certainly so shocking a document had never been allowed to come to dictaturto be dictated to the reichs clerks to have a first reading as we should call it or even to lie on the table with a theoretic chance that way but austria thanks to our little george and his pragmatic armament had got a new kurmainzby whom in open contempt of impartiality and in open leaning for austria with all his weight it was duly forwarded to dictature brought before an astonished diet reichstag and endlessly argued of in reichstag and reichwith small benefit to austria or the new kurmainz wise kindness to austria had been suppression of this piece not bringing of it to dictature at all but the new kurmainz called upon and conscious of face sufficient had not scrupled shame on you partial archchancellor exclaims all the worldrevoke such shamefully partial dictature this was the next question brought before the reich in which kurhanover britannic george was the one elector that opined no majority conclusive though as usual no settlement attainable this is the famous dictatursache dictature question which rages on us for about eleven months to come in those distracted old books and seems as if it would never end nor is there any saying when it would have endedhad not in august 1744 something else ended the king of prussias patience namely which enabled it to end on the kaisers then order adelung iii b 201 iv 198 c  it must be owned in general the conduct of maria theresa to the reich ever since the reich had ventured to reject her husband as kaiser and prefer another was all along of a high nature till now it has grown into absolute contumacy and a treating of the reichs elected kaiser as a merely chimerical personage no law of the reich had been violated against her hungarian majesty or husband what law asked all judges vicarius kursachsen sat in committee hatching for many months that question of the kurbohmen vote and by the prescribed methods brought it out in the negativeevery formality and regularity observed and nobody but your austrian deputy protesting upon it when requested to go home but the high maria had a notion that the reich belonged to her august family and her and that all elections to the contrary were an inconclusive thing fundamentally void every one of them  thus too long before this in regard to the reichsarchiv question the archives and indispensablest official records and papers of the reichthese had lain so long at vienna the high maria could not think of giving them up so difficult to extricate what papers are austrian specially from what are austrianimperialmust have time answered she always and neither the kaisers more and more pressing demands nor those of the late kurmainz backed by the reich and reiterated month after month and year after year could avail in the matter mere angry correspondences growing ever angrierthe archives of the reich lay irrecoverable at vienna detained on this pretext and on that nor were they ever given up but lay there till the reich itself had ended much more the kaiser karl vii these are high procedures  as if the reich had been ones own chattel as if a nonaustrian kaiser mere impossible and the reich and its laws had even officially become phantasmal that in fact was maria theresas inarticulate inborn notion and gradually as her successes on the field rose higher it became ever more articulate till this of the seynsollende kaiser put a crown on it justifiable if the reich with its laws were a chattel or rebellious vassal of austria not justifiable otherwise hear ye answered almost all the reich eight kurfursts with the one exception of kurhanover as we observed our solemnly elected kaiser karl vii is a thing of quirks and quiddities of french shreds and patches at present it seems the reich has no kaiser at all and will go ever deeper into anarchies and unnamabilities till it proceed anew to get oneof the right austrian typethe reich is a talking entity king friedrich is bound rather to silence so long as possible his thoughts on these matters are not given but sure enough they were continual too intense they could hardly be

broglios successor were not slow raising batteries everywhere raising lines 10000 elsass peasants and what notso that by the time prince karl was ready middle of august they lay intrenched and minatory at all passable points and karl could nowhere in that upperrhine country by any method get across nothing got across except once or twice for perhaps a day butcher trenck and his loose kennel

perhaps favoring the bravemay be called the unlikely one as poor carteret probably guesses or dreadshad he now any choice left but it was loves last shift and by aid of diana and otherwise that is the posture in which at mainz 11th october 1743 we leave the german question  compensation from france in particular is not to be had gratis it appears somewhere or other it must be had complaining once

fear nor to hope from france if you would like i will make a panegyric on louis xv without a word of truth in it but as to political business there is at present none to bring us together and neither is it i that am to speak first when they put a question to me it will be time to reply but you who are so much a man of sense you see well what a ridiculous business it would be if without ground

xxii 141144  worth reading this rather well very kingly and characteristic of the young friedrich saved by beaumarchais who did not give it in his famous kehl edition of voltaire but had it in autograph ever after and printed it in his decade philosophique 10 messidor an vii summer 1799 beaumarchais had several other pieces of the same sort which as bits of contemporary photographing one would have liked to see     friedrich visits baireuth on a particular errandvoltaire attending and privately reporting  this biribi document i suppose to have been delivered perhaps on the 7th and that friedrich had it but had not yet answered it when he wrote the following letter  potsdam 8th september 1743 friedrich to voltairei dare not speak to a son of apollo about horses and carriages relays and such things these are details with which the gods do not concern themselves and which we mortals take upon us you will set out on monday afternoon if you like the journey for baireuth and you will dine with me in passing if you please at potsdam here  the rest of my memoire paper before given is so blurred and in so bad a state i cannot yet send it youi am getting cantos 8 and 9 of la pucelle copied i at present have cantos 1 2 4 5 8 and 9 i keep them under three keys that the eye of mortal may not see them  i hear you supped yesternight in good company great gathering in some high house gone all asunder now  the finest wits of the canton all collected in your name people all who could not but be pleased with you all devout believers in voltaire unanimously took you for the god of their paradise  paradise that you may not be scandalized is taken here in a general sense for a place of pleasure and joy see the remark on the last verse of the mondain oeuvres de frederic xxii 144 voltaire lxxiii 100 scandalously misdated in edition 1818 xxxix 466 as to mondain and remark upon itthe ghost of what was once a sparkle of successful coteriespeech and epistolary allusiontake this in the mondain voltaire had written le paradis terrestre est ou je suis and as the priests made outcry had with airs of orthodoxy explained the phrase awayas friedrich now affects to do obliquely quizzing in the friedrich manner  voltaire is to go upon the baireuth journey then according to prayer whether voltaire ever got that allimportant word which he could show i cannot say though there is some appearance that friedrich may have dashed off for him the panegyric of louis in these very hours to serve his turn and have done with him under date 7th september day before the letter just read here are snatches from another to the same address  potsdam 7th september 1743 friedrich to voltaireyou tell me so much good of france and of its king it were to be wished all sovereigns had subjects like you and all commonwealths such citizensyou can show that i suppose what a pity france and sweden had not had military chiefs of your way of thinking but it is very certain say what you will that the feebleness of their generals and the timidity of their counsels have almost ruined in public repute two nations which not half a century ago inspired terror over europe scandalous peace that of fleury in 1735 abandoning king stanislaus cheating spain cheating sardinia to get lorraine and now this manner of abandoning the emperor respectable karl vii of your making sacrificing bavaria and reducing that worthy prince to the lowest povertypoverty i say not of a prince but into the frightfulest state for a private man ah monsieur  and yet your france is the most charming of nations and if it is not feared it deserves well to be loved a king worthy to command it who governs sagely and acquires for himself the esteem of all europethere wont that do may restore its ancient splendor which the broglios and so many others even more inept have a little eclipsed that is assuredly a work worthy of a prince endowed with such gifts to reverse the sad posture of affairs nobly repairing what others have spoiled to defend his country against furious enemies reducing them to beg peace instead of scornfully rejecting it when offered never was more glory acquirable by any king i shall admire whatsoever this great man ce grand homme louis xv not yet visibly tending to the dungheap let us hope better things may achieve in that way and of all the sovereigns of europe none will be less jealous of his success than ithere my spheral friend show that oeuvres de frederic xxii 139 see for what followed oeuvres de voltaire lxxiii 129 report to amelot 27th october  which the spheral friend does nor was it irony as the new commentators think not at all sincere enough what you call sincerevoltaire himself had a nose for irony this was what you call sincere panegyric in liberal measure why be stingy with your measure it costs half an hour it will end voltaires importunities and so may if anything oil the businesswheels withal for friedrich foresees business enough with louis and the french ministries though he will not enter on it with voltaire this journey to baireuth and anspach for example this is not for a visit to his sisters as friedrich labels it but has extensive purposes hidden under that titlemeetings with franconian potentates earnest survey earnest consultation on a state of things altogether grave for germany and friedrich though he understands whom to treat with about it whom to answer with a biribiri mon ami that austrian exorbitancy of a message to the diet has come out august 16th and is struggling to dictatur the austrian procedures in baiern are in their full flagrancy friedrich intends trying once more whether in such crisis there be absolutely no union of german princes possible nor even of any two or three of them in the swabian and franconian circles which he always thought the likeliest  the journey took effect tuesday 10th september rodenbeck i 93 not the day before as friedrich had been projecting went by halle straight upon baireuth and ended there on thursday as usual prince august wilhelm and prince ferdinand of brunswick were of it voltaire failed not to accompany what the complexion of it was especially what friedrich had meant by it and how ill he succeeded will perhaps be most directly visible through the following compressed excerpts from voltaires long letter to secretary amelot on the subjectif readers will be diligent with them friedrich after four days ran across to anspach on important business came back with mere failure and was provokingly quite silent on it stayed at baireuth some three days more thence home by gotha still on union business still mere failure by leipzig and arrived at potsdam september 25thleaving voltaire in wilhelminas charmed circle of which unhappily there is not a word said for about a week more voltaire directly on getting back to berlin resumes the thread of his journal to secretary amelot that is writes him another long letter  voltaire from berlin 3d october 1743 to secretary amelot   the king of prussia told me at baireuth on the 13th or 14th of last month he was glad our king had sent the kaiser moneyuseful that at any rate noailless 6000 pounds would not go far that he thought m le marechal de noailless explanation of a certain small rumor to the disadvantage of noailles in reference to the kaiser was satisfactory but added he it results from all your secret motions that you are begging peace from everybody and there may have been something in this rumor after all  he then told me he was going over to anspach to see what could be done for the common cause kaisers and ours that he expected to meet the bishop of wurzburg there and would try to stir the frankish and swabian circles into some kind of union and at setting off from baireuth september 16th on this errand he promised his brotherinlaw the margraf he would return with great schemes afoot and even with great success which proved otherwise to a disappointing degree   the margraf of anspach did say he would join a union of princes in favor of the kaiser if prussia gave example but that was all the bishop of wurzburg a feeble old creature never appeared at anspach nor even sent an apology and seckendorf with the imperial armyseckendorf caged up at wembdingen whom friedrich drove off from anspach twenty miles to see and consult was in a disconsolate moulting condition and could promise or advise nothing satisfactory during the dinner one took with him september 19th under a shady tree after muster of the troops rodenbeck p 93 four days running about on those errands had yielded his prussian majesty nothing whilst he prussian majesty was on this anspach excursion the margraf of baireuth who is lately made fieldmarshal of his circle spoke much to me of present affairs a young prince full of worth and courage who loves the french hates the austriansand would fain make himself generally useful to whom i suggested this and that does your lordship observe if it could ever come to anything  the king of prussia on returning to baireuth guess 20th september did not speak the least word of business to the margraf which much surprised the latter he surprised him still more by indicating some intention to retain forcibly at berlin the young duke of wurtemberg under pretext that madam his mother intended to have him taken to vienna for education to anger this young duke and drive his mother to despair was not the method for acquiring credit in the circle of swabia and getting the princes brought to unite  the duchess of wurtemberg who was there at baireuth by appointment to confer with the king of prussia sent to seek me i found her all dissolved in tears ah said shebut why is our dear wilhelmina left saying nothing invisible behind the curtains of envious chance and only a skirt of them lifted to show us this improper duchess once moreah said she the improper duchess at sight of me will the king of prussia be a tyrant then to pay me for intrusting my boys to him and giving him two regiments for money down will he force me to implore justice against him from the whole world i must have my child he shall not go to vienna it is in his own country that i will have him brought up beside me to put my son in austrian hands unless indeed your highness were driven into financial or other straits you know if i love franceif my design is not to pass the rest of my days there so soon as my son comes to majority ohone ohoo  in fine the quarrel was appeased the king of prussia told me he would be gentler with the mother would restore the son if they absolutely wished it but that he hoped the young prince would of himself like better to stay where he wasi trust your lordship will allow me to draw for those 300 ducats for a new carriage i have spent all i had running about these four months i leave this for brunswick and homewards on the evening of the 12th voltaire lxxiii 105109  and so the curtain drops on the baireuth journey on the berlin visit and indeed if that were anything on voltaires diplomatic career altogether the insignificant accidents the dull powers that be say no curious to reflect had they happened to say yesgo into the diplomatic line then you sharp climbing creature and become great by that method write no more you write only despatches and spyletters henceforthhow different a world for us and for all mortals that read and that do not read there had now been  voltaire fancies he has done his diplomacy well not without fruit and at brunswickcheered by the grand welcome he found therehas delightful outlooks might i dare to suggest them monseigneur of touring about in the german courts with some circular hortatorium or sublime beggingletter from the kaiser in his hand and by witchery of tongue urging wurtemberg brunswick baireuth anspach berlin to compliance with the imperial majesty and france ib lxxiii 133 would not that be sublime but that like the rest in spite of ones talent came to nothing talent success madame de chateauroux had in the interim taken a dislike to m amelot could not bear his stammering the fastidious improper female flung amelot overboardamelot and his luggage after him voltaires diplomatic hopes included and there was an end  how ravishing the thing had been while it lasted judge by these other stray symptoms hastily picked up partly at berlin partly at brunswick which show us the bright meridian and also the blaze almost still more radiant which proved to be sunset readers have heard of voltaires madrigals to certain princesses and must read these three againwhich are really incomparable in their kind not equalled in graceful felicity even by goethe and by him alone of poets approached in that respect at berlin autumn 1743 three

farther that friedrich had again pressed voltaire to come and live with him and choose his own terms and that voltaire as a second string to his bow should this fine diplomatic one fail had

the brussels region they came back to paris in december resigned i hope to inexorable fatethough with such diplomatic and other fine prospects flung to the fishes and little but gredins and confusions waiting you as formerly     chapter viifriedrich makes treaty with france and silently gets ready  though friedrich went upon the bantering tone with voltaire his private thoughts in regard to the surrounding scene of things were extremely serious and already it had begun to be apparent from those britannicaustrian procedures that some new alliance with france might well lie ahead for him during voltaires visit that extraordinary paper from vienna that the kaiser was no kaiser and that there must be compensation and satisfactory assurance had come into full glare of firstreading and the dictatursache and denunciation of an evidently partial kurmainz was awakening everywhere voltaire had not gone whenthrough podewils junior probably with help of the improper dutch female of rankfriedrich got to wit of another thing not less momentous to him and throwing fearful light on that of compensation and assurance this was the treaty of wormsdone by carteret and george september 13th during those languid rhine operations treaty itself not languid but a very lively thing to friedrich and to all the world concerning which a few words now  we have said according to promise and will say next to nothing of maria theresas italian war but hope always the reader keeps it in mind big warclouds waltzing hither and thither occasionally clashing into bloody conflict sardinian majesty and infant philip both personally in the field fierce men both traun browne lobkowitz lichtenstein austrians of mark successively distinguishing themselves spain too and france very diligentconti off thither then in their turns maillebois noailleshigh military figures but remote shadowy thundering inaudibly on this side and that whom we must not mention farther  the notable figure to us says one of my notes is charles emanuel second king of sardinia who is at the old trade of his family and shifts from side to side making the warbalance vibrate at a great rate now this scale now that kicking the beam for he holds the door of the alps bully bourbon on one side of it bully hapsburg on the other and inquires sharply you what will you give me and you to maria theresas affairs he has been superlatively useful for these two years past and truly she is not too punctual in the returns covenanted for it appears to charles emanuel that the queen of hungary elated in her high thought underrates his services of late that she practically means to give him very little of those promised slices from the lombard parts and that in the mean while much too big a share of the war has fallen upon his poor hands who should be doorholder only  accordingly he grumbles threatens he has been listening to france bourbon how much will you give me then and the answer is such that he informs the queen of hungary and the britannic majesty of his intention to close with bourbon since they on their side will do nothing considerable george and his carteret not to mention the hungarian majesty at all are thunderstruck at such a prospect bend all their energies towards this essential point of retaining charles emanuel which is more urgent even than getting elsass madam they say to her majesty we cannot save italy for you on other terms vigevanesco finale which is genoas part of piacenza when once got there must be some slice of the lombard parts to this charles emanuel justly angry whereat the high queen storms and in her high manner scolds little george as if he were the blamable partypretending friendship and yet abetting mere highway robbery or little better and his cash paid madam and his dettingen mousetrap fought well he has plenty of cashis it my cause then or his majestys and libertys posterity in modern england vainly endeavors to conceive this phenomenon yet sees it to be undeniable  and so there is a treaty of worms got concocted after infinite effort on the part of carteret robinson too laboring and steaming in vienna with boilers like to burst and george gets it signed 13th september already signed while friedrich was looking into seckendorf and wembdingen if friedrich had known it to this effect that charles emanuel should have annually down on the nail a handsome increase of subsidy 200000 pounds instead of 150000 pounds from england and ultimately beyond doubt some thinnish specified slices from the lombard parts and shall proceed fighting for not against english fleet cooperating english purse ditto regardless of expense with other fit particulars as formerly scholl ii 330335 adelung iii b 222226 coxe iii 296 maria theresa very angry looks upon herself as a martyr nobly complying to suffer for the whim of england and robinson has had such labors and endurances a steamengine on the point of bursting is but an emblem of him it was a necessary treaty for the cause of liberty as george and carteret and all english ministries and ministers diana of newcastle very specially in spite of pitt and a junior opposition party viewed liberty it was loves last shiftdiana having intervened upon those magnificent conferences of hanau lately nevertheless carteret was thrown out next year on account of it and posterity is unable to conceive it and asks always of little george what in the name of wonder had he to do there fighting for or against and hiring everybody he met to fight against everybody a king with eyes somewhat a fleurdetete yes and let us say his nation toowhich has sat down quietly for almost a century back under mountains of nonsense inwardly nothing but dim scepticism except in the stomachic regions and outwardly such a trinacria of hypocrisy unconscious for most part as never lay on an honest giant nation before was itself grown much of a fool and could expect no other kind of kings  but the point intensely interesting to friedrich in this treaty of worms was that in enumerating punctually the other treaties old and recent which it is to guarantee and stand upon the basis of there is nowhere the least mention of friedrichs breslauandberlin treaty thriceimportant treaty with her hungarian majesty on the silesian matter in settling all manner of adjoining and preceding matters there is nothing said of silesia at all singular indeed treaties enough from that of utrecht downward are wearisomely mentioned here but of the berlin treaty breslau treaty or any treaty settling silesiamuch less of any westminster treaty guaranteeing it to the king of prussiathere is not the faintest mention silesia then is not considered settled by the high contracting parties little george himself who guaranteed it in the hour of need little more than a year ago considers it fallen loose again in the new whirl of contingencies patience madam what was good to give is good to take on what precise day or month friedrich got notice of this expressive silence in the treaty of worms we do not know but from that day  friedrich recollects another thing one of many others that of those ulterior mountains which austria had bargained for as boundary to schlesien wild bare mountains good for what for invading schlesien from the austrian side if for nothing else conceivable the small riddle reads itself to him so with a painful flash of light oeuvres de frederic iii 34 looking intensely into this matter and putting things together friedrich gets more and more the alarming assurance of the fate intended him and that he will verily have to draw sword again and fight for silesia and as if for life from about the end of 1743 as i strive to compute there was in friedrich himself no doubt left of it though his ministers when he consulted them a good while afterwards were quite incredulous and spent all their strength in dissuading a new war now when the only question was how to do said war how to do it to make ready for doing it we must silently select the ways the methods silent warythen at last swift and the more like a lionspring like a bolt from the blue it will be the better that is friedrichs fixed thought  the problem was complicated almost beyond example the reich with a kaiser reduced to such a pass has its potentialities of help or of hindranceits thousandfold formulas inane mostly yet not inane wholly which interlace this matter everywhere as with real threads and with gossamer or apparent threadswhich it is essential to attend to wise head that could discriminate the dead formulas of such an imbroglio from the notdead and plant himself upon the living facts that do lie in the centre there we cannot have a reichs mediationarmy then nor a swabianfranconian army to defend their own frontier no it is evident none and there is no union of princes possible no party anywhere that will rise to support the kaiser whom all germany elected whom austria and foreign england have insulted ruined and officially designated as nonextant well not quite no none yes perhaps in some small degreeif prussia will step out with drawn sword and give signal the reich has its potentialities its formulas not quite dead but is a sad imbroglio  definite facts again are mainly twofold and of a much more central nature fact first a france which sees itself lamentably trodden into the mud by such disappointments and disgraces which on proposing peace has met insult and invasionfrance will be under the necessity of getting to its feet and striking for itself and indeed is visibly rising into something of determination to do itthere if prussia and the kaiser are to be helped at all there lies the one real help fact second friedrichs feelings for the poor kaiser and the poor insulted reich of which friedrich is a member feelings these which are not feigned as the english say but real and even indignant and about these he can speak and plead freely for himself and his silesia through the kaiser friedrichs feelings are pungently realand they are withal completely adjunct to the other set of feelings and go wholly to intensifying of them the evident truth being that neither he nor his silesia would be in danger were the kaiser safe  friedrichs abstruse diplomacies and delicate motions and handlings with the reich that is to say with the kaiser and the kaisers few friends in the reich and then again with the frenchwhich lasted for eight or nine months before closure october 1743 to june 1744are considered to have been a fine piece of steering in difficult waters but would only weary the reader who is impatient for results and arrivals ingenious herr professor rankewhose history of friedrich consists mainly of such matter excellently done and offers mankind a wondrously distilled astral spirit or ghostlike facsimile elegant gray ghost with stars dimtwinkling through of friedrichs and other peoples diplomatizings in this worldwill satisfy the strongest diplomatic appetite and to him we refer such as are given that way ranke neun bucher preussischer geschichte iii 74137 france and oneself as substance of help but for many reasons give it carefully a legal german form or coat that is friedrichs method as to finding help and he diligently prosecutes itand what is still luckier strives to be himself at all points ready and capable of doing with a minimum of help from others  before the year 1743 was out friedrich had got into serious diplomatic colloquy with france suggesting urging proposing hypothetically promising february 21st 1744 he secretly despatched rothenburg to paris who in a shining manner consults not only with the amelots belleisles but with the chateauroux herself who always liked friedrich and with louis xv in person and triumphantly brings matters to a bearing ready here on the french side so soon as your reich interests are made the most of so soon as your patriotic union of reichs princes is ready in march 1744 the reich side of the affair was likewise getting well forward we keep it mostly secret from the poor kaiser who is apt to blaband on may 22d 1744 friedrich with the kaiser and two other wellaffected parties only two as yet but we hope for more and invite all and sundry sign solemnly their union of frankfurt famous little fourfold outcome of so much diplomatizing ranke ubi supra treaty is in adelung iv 103105 for the wellaffected parties besides friedrich and the kaiser himself were as yet two only landgraf wilhelm of hessencassel disgusted with the late carteret astucities at hanau he is one and hires by and by his poor 6000 hessians to the french and kaiser instead of to the english which is all the help he can give landgraf wilhelm and for sole second to him the new kurpfalz who also has men to hire new kurpfalz our poor old friend is dead but here is a new one karl philip theodor by name of whom we shall hear again long afterwards who was wedded in the frankfurtcoronation time as readers might have noted to a granddaughter of the old and who is like the old a hereditary cousin of the kaisers and already helps him all he can  only these two as yet though the whole reich is invited to join these along with friedrich and the kaiser himself do now in their general patriotic union which as yet consists only of four covenant in six articles toin brief to support teutschlands oppressed kaiser in his just rights and dignities and to do with the house of austria all imaginable good offices not the least whisper of fighting towards inducing said high house to restore to the kaiser his reichsarchives his hereditary countries his necessary imperial furnishings called for by every law human and divinein which endeavor or innocently otherwise if any of the contracting parties be attacked the others will guarantee him and strenuously help all imaginable good offices nothing about fighting anywherestill less is there the least mention of france total silence on that head by friedrichs express desire but in a secret article to which france you may be sure will accede it is intimated that the way of good offices having some unlikelihoods it may become necessary to take arms in which tragic case they will besides hereditary baiern which is inalienable fixed as the rocks by reichslaw endeavor to conquer to reconquer for the kaiser his kingdom of bohmen withal as a proper outfit for teutschlands chief and that if so his prussian majesty who will have to do said conquest shall in addition to his schlesien have from it the circles of konigsgratz bunzlau and leitmeritz for his trouble this is the treaty of union secretarticle and all done at frankfurtonmayn 22d may 1744  done then and there but no part of it made public till august following 22d august 1744 by the kaiser adelung iv 154 when the upshot had come and the secret bohemian article not then made public nor ever afterwardsmuch the contrary though it was true enough but inconvenient to confess especially as it came to nothing a hypothetical thing that says friedrich carelessly wages moderate enough and proper to be settled beforehand though the work was never done to reach down quite over the mountains and have the elbe for silesian frontier this as an occasional vague thought or daydream in high moments was probably not new to friedrich and would have been very welcome to himhad it proved realizable which it did not that this was friedrichs real end in going to war again was at one time the opinion loudly current in england and other uninformed quarters but it is not now credible to anybody says herr ranke nor indeed worth talking of except as a memento of the angry eclipses and temporary dustclouds which rise between nations in an irritated uninformed condition  rapidly progressive in the rear of all this which was its legalizing german coat the french treaty which was the interior substance or muscular tissue perfected itself under rothenburg and was signed june 5th 1774 anniversary by accident of that first treaty of all june 5th 1741sanctioning by france that bohemian adventure if needful minutely setting forth how and under what contingencies what efforts made and what successes arrived at on the part of france his prussian majesty shall take the field and try austria not with all imaginable good offices longer but with harder medicine of which treaty we shall only say farther commiserating our poor readers that friedrich considerably more than kept his side of it and france very considerably less than hers so that had not there been punctual preparation at all points and good selfhelp in friedrich friedrich had come out of this new adventure worse than he did  long months ago the frenchas preliminary and rigorous sine qua non to these friedrich negotiationshad actually started work by declaring war on austria and declaring war on englandnot yet at war then after so much killing oh no reader mere allies of belligerents hitherto these declarations the french had made war on england 15th march 1744 on austria 27th april adelung iv 78 90 and the french were really pushing forward in an attitude of indignant energy to execute the same as shall be noticed by and by and through rothenburg through schmettau by many channels friedrich is assiduously in communication with them encouraging advising urging their affairs being in a sort his ever since the signing of those mutual engagements may 22d june 5th and now enough of that hypothetic diplomatic stuff  war lies ahead inevitable to friedrich he has gradually increased his army by 18000 inspection more minute and diligent than ever has been quietly customary of late walraves fortification works impregnable or nearly so the work at neisse most of all friedrich had resolved to see completedbefore that french treaty were signed a cautious young man though a rapid vividly awake on all sides and so the frenchaustrian frenchenglish game shall go on the big bowls bounding and rolling with velocities on courses partly computable to a quick eyeand at the right instant and juncture of hits not till that nor after that a quick hand shall bowl in with effect as he ventures to hope he knows well it is a terrible game but it is a necessary one not to be despaired of it is to be waited for with closed lips and played to ones utmost     chapter viiiperfect peace at berlin war all round  friedrich with the spectre of inevitable war daily advancing on him to him privately evident and certain if as yet to him only neglects in no sort the arts and business of peace but is present always with vivid activity in the common movement serious or gay and festive as the day brings it during these winter months of 1743 and still more through summer 1744 there are important warmovements going onthe french vehemently active again the austrians nothing behindhandwhich will require some slight notice from us soon but in berlin alongside of all this it is mere common business diligent as ever alternating with carnival gayeties with marryings givings in marriage in berlin there goes on under halcyon weather the peaceable tide of things sometimes in a high fashion as if berlin and its king had no concern with the foreign war  the plauen canal an important navigationwork canal of some thirty miles joining havel to elbe in a convenient manner or even joining oder to elbe is at its busiestit was begun june 1st 1743 all hands diligently digging there june 27th while some others of us were employed at dettingenthink of it and was finished june 5th 1745 busching erdbeschreibung vi 2192 this is one of several such works now afoot take another miscellaneous item or two  january 1744 friedrich appoints and briefly informs all his people of it that any prussian subject who thinks himself aggrieved may come and tell his story to the kings own self january 1744 rodenbeck i 98better have his story in firm succinct state i should imagine and such that it will hold water in telling it to the king but the king is ready to hear him heartily eager to get justice done him a suitable boon such permission till lawreform take effect and after lawreform had finished it was a thing found suitable and continued to the endcurious to a british reader to consider  again on friedrichs birthday 24th january 1744 the new academy of sciences had in the schloss of berlin its first session but of thisin the absence of maupertuis flattener of the earth who is still in france since that mollwitz adventure by and for behoof of whom when he did return and become perpetual first president many changes were madei will not speak at present nor indeed afterwards except on good chance risingthe new academy with its perpetual first president being nothing like so sublime an object now to readers and me as it then was to itself and perpetual president and royal patron vapid formey is perpetual secretary more power to him as the irish say poor goldstick pollnitz is an honorary memberabsent at this time in baireuth where those giggling marwitzes of wilhelminas have been contriving a marriage for the old fool of which another word soon if we have time time cannot be spent on those dim small objects but there are two marriages of a high order of purport somewhat historical there is barberina the dancer throwing a flash through the operatic and some other provinces let us restrict ourselves to these and the like of these and be brief upon them    the succession in russia and also in sweden shall not be hostile to us two royal marriages a russian and a swedish are accomplished at berlin with such view  marriage first of an eminently historical nature is altogether russian or german become russian though friedrich is much concerned in it we heard of the mad swedishrussian war and how czarina elizabeth was kind enough to choose a successor to the old childless swedish kinglandgraf of hessencassel by nature who has had a sorry time in sweden but kept merry and did not mind it much poor old soul czarina elizabeths one care was that the prince of denmark should not be chosen to succeed as there was talk of his being sweden denmark norway all grasped in one firm hand as in the old unionofcalmar times only with better management might be dangerous to russia dont choose him of denmark said elizabeth the victorious czarina and made it a condition of granting peace and mostly restoring finland to the infatuated swedes the person they did choosesatisfactory to the czarina and who ultimately did become king of swedenwas one adolf friedrich a holsteingottorp prince come of royal kin and cousinry to karl xii he is bishop of lubeck or of eutin so styled now in his thirtythird year and at least drawing the revenues of that see though i think not ecclesiastically given but living oftener in hamburg the then fashionable resort of those northern grandees on the whole a likely young gentleman accepted by parties concernedand surely good enough for the office as it now is of whom for a reason coming let readers take note in this place  above a year before this time czarina elizabeth a provident female and determined not to wed had pitched upon her own successor 7th november 1742 michaelis ii 627 one karl peter ulrich who was also of the same holsteingottorp set though with russian blood in him his grandfather was full cousin and chosen comrade to karl xii got killed in karls russian wars and left a poor son dependent on russian peter the greatwho gave him one of his daughters whence this karl peter ulrich an orphan dear to his aunt the czarina a karl peter ulrich who became tragically famous as czar peter federowitz or czar peter iii in the course of twenty years his father and mother are both dead loving aunt has snatched the poor boy out of holsteingottorp which is a narrow sphere into russia which is wide enough she has had him converted to the greek church named him peter federowitz heir and successorand now wishing to see him married has earnestly consulted friedrich upon it  friedrich is decidedly interested would grudge much to see an antiprussian princess for instance a saxon princess one of whom is said to be trying put into this important station after a little thought he fixesdoes the reader know upon whom readers perhaps here and there have some recollection of a prussian general who is titular prince of anhaltzerbst on his own score and is actual commandant of stettin in friedrichs service and has done a great deal of good fortification there and other good work instead of titular he has now lately by decease of an elder brother become actual or semiactual a brother joined with him in the poor heirship lives occasionally in the schloss of zerbst but is glad to retain stettin as a solid supplement his wife let the reader note farther is sister to the abovementioned adolf friedrich bishop of lubeck now heirapparent to swedenin whom as will soon appear we are otherwise interested wife seems to me an airy flighty kind of lady highpaced not too surepacedweak evidently in french grammar and perhaps in human sense withalbut they have a daughter sophiefrederike now near fifteen and very forward for her age comely to look upon wise to listen to is not she the suitable one thinks friedrich in regard to this matter her kindred is of the oldest old as albert the bear she has been frugally brought up spartanlike though as a princess by birth let her cease skipping ropes on the ramparts yonder with her young stettin playmates and prepare for being a czarina of the russias thinks he and communicates his mind to the czarina who answers excellent how did i never think of that myself  and so on or about newyears day 1744 while the commandant of stettin and his airy spouse are doing christmas at their old schloss of zerbst there suddenly come estafettes expresses from petersburg heralded by express from friedrichwith the astonishing proposal czarina wishing the honor of a visit from madam and daughter no doubt with such and such intentions in the rear friedrichs letters to madam of zerbst date of the first of them 30th december 1743 in oeuvres xxv 579589 madam nor daughter is nothing loaththe old commandant grumbles in his beard not positively forbidding and in this manner after a letter or two in imperfect grammar madam and daughter appear in carnival society at berlin charming objects both but do not stay long in fact stay only till their moneys and arrangements are furnished them upon which in all silence they make for petersburg for moscow travel rapidly arrive successfully in spite of the grim season at moscow 7th 18th february 1744 conversion to the greek religion change of name from sophiefrederike to catherinealexiewna let it be catherine said elizabeth my dear mothers namelittle brown czarinas whom we have seenall this was completed by the 12th of july following and in fine next year september 1st 1745 peter federowitz and this same catherinealexiewna secondcousins by blood were vouchsafed the nuptial benediction and with invocation of the russian heaven and russian earth were declared to be one flesh ranke iii 129 memoires de catherine ii catherines own very curious bit of autobiographypublished by mr herzen london 1859 pp 746though at last they turned out to be two fleshes as my reader well knows some eighteen or nineteen years hence we may look in upon them again if there be a moment to spare this is marriage first a purely russian one built together and launched on its course so to say by friedrich at berlin who had his own interest in it  marriage second done at berlin in the same months was of still more interesting sort to friedrich and us that of princess ulrique to the abovenamed adolf friedrich future king of sweden marriage which went on preparing itself by the side of the other and was of twin importance with it in regard to the russian question the swedish marriage was not heard of except in important whispers during the carnival time but a swedish minister had already come to berlin on it and was busy first in a silent and examining then in a speaking and proposing way it seems the czarina herself had suggested the thing as a counterpoliteness to friedrich so content with him at this time a thing welcome to friedrich and in due course june 1744 there comes express swedish embassy some rodenskjold or tessin with a very shining train of swedes to demand princess ulrique in marriage for our future king  to which there is assent by no means denial in the proper quarter whereupon after the widespread necessary fuglings and preliminaries there occurs all by procuration brother august wilhelm doing the bridegrooms part july 17th 1744 the marriage itself all done this last act and the foregoing ones and the following with a grandeur and a splendorunspeakable we may say in short heldengeschichte ii

by misrecollections and even by express fictions thrown in as garnish so that beyond the general impression given in a highrouged state there is nothing to be depended on one scene out of his many which represents to us on those terms the finale or actual departure of princess ulrique we shall offerwith corrections a few not allhaving nothing better or other on the subject  but in fine the day of departure did arriveeve of it did 25th july 1744 hour of starting to be 2 am tomorrow the king had nominated grandmarshal graf van gotter same gotter whom we saw at vienna once king had appointed gotter and two others not to say that two of the princesss brothers with her sister the margravine of schwedt were to accompany as far as schwedt six in all though ones poor memory fails one on some occasionsto escort the princess to stralsund where two swedish senators and different high lords and ladies awaited her her majesty the queenmother judging by the movements of her own heart that the moment of separation would produce a scene difficult to bear had ordered an opera to divert our chagrin and instead of supper a superb collation en ambigu kind of supperbreakfast i suppose in the great hall of the palace her majestys plan was the princess on coming from the opera should almost on flight taste a morsel take her travelling equipment embrace her kinsfolk dash into her carriage and go off like lightning herr graf von gotter was charged with executing this design and with hurrying the departure  but all these precautions were vain the incomparable ulrique was too dear to her family and to her country to be parted with forever without her meed of tears from them in those cruel instants on entering the operahall i noticed everywhere prevalent an air of sorrow of sombre melancholy the princess appeared in amazondress ridinghabit say of rosecolor trimmed with silver the little vest turned up with greenblue celadon and collar of the same a little bonnet english fashion of black velvet with a white plume to it her hair floating and tied with a rosecolored ribbon she was beautiful as love but this dress so elegant and so well setting off her charms only the more sensibly awakened our regrets to lose her and announced that the hour was come in which all this appeared among us for the last time at the second act young prince ferdinand youngest brother father of the jena ferdinand entered the royal box and flinging himself on the princesss neck with a burst of tears said ah my dear ulrique it is over then and i shall never see you more these words were a signal given to the grief which was shut in all hearts to burst forth with the greatest vehemence the princess replied only with sobs holding her brother in her arms the two queens could not restrain their tears the princes and princesses followed the example grief is epidemical it gained directly all the boxes of the first rank where the court and nobility were each had his own causes of regret and each melted into tears nobody paid the least attention farther to the opera and for my own share i was glad to see it end  an involuntary movement took me towards the palace i entered the kings apartments and found the royal family and part of the court assembled grief had reached its height everybody had his handkerchief out and i witnessed emotions quite otherwise affecting than those that theatric art can produce the king had composed an ode on the princesss departure bidding her his last adieus in the most tender and touching manner it begins with these words       partez ma soeur

it and fell into a faint no you sham not for it the king had almost done the like his tears flowed abundantly the princes and princesses were overcome with sorrow at last gotter judged it time to put an end to this tragic scene he entered the hall almost like boreas in the ballet of the rose that is to say with a crash he made one or two whirlwinds clove the press and snatched away the princess from the arms of the queenmother took her in his own and whisked her out of the hall all the world followed the carriages were waiting in the court and the princess in a moment found herself in hers i was in such a state i know not how we got down stairs i remember only that it was in a concert of lamentable sobbings madam the margrafin von schwedt who had been named to attend the princess to stralsund read schwedt on the swedish frontier this high lady and the two dames datours who were for sweden itself having sprung into the same carriage the door of it was shut with a slam the postillions cracked the carriage shot awayand hid the adorable ulrique from the eyes of king and court who remained motionless for some minutes overcome by their feelings bielfeld ii 107110  we said this marriage was like the other important for public affairs in fact security on the russian and swedish side is always an object with friedrich when undertaking war that the french bring about help me to bring about a triple alliance of prussia russia sweden this was a thing friedrich had bargained to see done before joining in the war ahead but by these two espousals friedrich hopes he has himself as good as done it of poor princess ulrique and her glorious reception in sweden after near miss of shipwreck in the swedish frigate from stralsund we shall say nothing more at present except that her glories all along were much dashed by chagrins and dangerous imminencies of shipwreckwhich latter did not quite overtake her but did her sons and grandsons being inevitable or nearly so in that element in the course of time  sister amelia whom some thought disappointed as perhaps in her foolish thought she might a little be was made abbess of quedlinburg which opulent benefice had

the peace offered them and grasping evidently at ones lorraines alsaces and three bishopricsa marked change comfortable to look at from friedrichs side most christian majesty from the sad bent

showed little other activity this year their troops were already in the netherlands since winter last led now by a fieldmarshal wade of whom one has heard to whom joined themselves certain austrians under duc dahremberg and certain dutch under some other man in cockedhat the whole of whom under marshal wades chief guidance did as good as nothing whatever inferior in force cried marshal wade an indolent incompetent old gentleman frightful to see in command of troops inferior in force cried he which was not at first quite the case and when by additions to himself and deductions of a most unexpected nature from his enemy he had become nearly double in force it was all the same marshal wade against whom indeed was marechal de saxe now in sole command as we shall see took shelter in safe places witnessing therefrom the swift destruction of the netherlands and would attempt nothing which indeed was perhaps prudent on the marshals part much money was spent and men enough did puddle themselves to death on the clay roads or bivouacking in the safe swamps but not the least stroke of battle was got out of them under this old marshal had perhaps a divided command though nominal chief

sixteenquitted berlin with great pomp for his own country on that errand friedrich had hoped hereby to settle the wurtemberg matters on a good footing and be sure of a friend in wurtemberg to the kaiser and himself which hope like everybodys hopes about this young gentleman was entirely disappointed said young gentleman having got into perverse haughty sulky illconditioned ways and made a bad life and reign of itbetter to lie mostly hidden from us henceforth at least for many years to come the excellent parting letter which friedrich gave him got abroad into the world was christened the mirror of princes and greatly admired by mankind it is indeed an almost faultless piece of its kind comprising in a flowing yet precise way with admirable frankness sincerity sagacity succinctness a whole duty of regnant man in oeuvres de frederic ix 47but i fear it would only weary the reader perfect advice having become so plentiful in our epoch with little but pavement to a certain locality the consequencethere is of the same months a testimonial to pollnitz which also got abroad and had its celebrity this as specimen of friedrich on the comic side will perhaps be less afflicting and it will rid us of pollnitz poor soul on handsome terms  goldstick pollnitz is at baireuth in these months fallen quite disconsolate since we last heard of him his fine marriage went awryrich lady very wisely drawing backand the foolish old creature has decided on rechanging his religion which he has changed already thrice or so in his vagabond straits for the purpose of retiring to a convent this time friedrich in candid brief manner rough but wise and not without some kindness for an old dog one is used to has answered nonsense that will never do but pollnitz persisting formally demanding leave to demit and lay down the goldstick with that viewfriedrich does at length send him certificate of leave which is drawn out with all the forms and was despatched through eichel to the proper board but which bears date april first and though officially valid is of quizzical natureperhaps already known to some readers having got into the newspapers and widely abroad at a subsequent time as authentic sample of friedrich in that kind here it accurately is with only one or two slight abridgments which are indicated  whereas the baron de pollnitz born at berlin at koln if it made any matter of honest parents so far as we knowafter having served our grandfather as gentleman of the chamber madam dorleans wicked regents mother a famed german lady in the same rank the king of spain in quality of colonel the deceased kaiser in that of captain of horse the pope as chamberlain the duke of brunswick as chamberlain duke of weimar as ensign our father as chamberlain and in fine us as grand master of the ceremonieshas in spite of such accumulation of honors become disgusted with the world and requests a parting testimony to support his good reputation  we remembering his important services to the house in diverting for nine years long the late king our father and doing the honors of our court during the now reign cannot refuse such request but do hereby certify that the said baron has never assassinated robbed on the highway poisoned forcibly cut purses or done other atrocity or legal crime at our court but has always maintained gentlemanly behavior making not more than honest use of the industry and talents he has been endowed with at birth imitating the object of the drama that is correcting mankind by gentle quizzing following in the matter of sobriety boerhaaves

letters of friedrich to pollnitz who was always rather kind to the poor old dog though bantering him a good deal     two conquests for prussia a gaseous and a solid conquest first barberina the dancer  early in may the berlin public first saw its barberina dance and wrote ecstatic latin epigrams about that miracle of nature and art rodenbeck pp 111 190miracle alas not entirely omissible by us here is her story as the books give it slightly mythical i judge in some of its nonessential parts but good enough for the subject  barberina the dancer had cost friedrich some trouble the pains he took with her elegant pirouettings and poussettings and the heavy salary he gave her are an unexpected item in his history he wished to favor the arts yes but did he reckon operadancing a chief one among them he had indeed built an operahouse and gave free admissions supporting the cost himself and among his other governings governed the dancer and singer troops of that establishment took no little trouble about his operayet perhaps he privately knew its place after all wished to encourage strangers of opulent condition to visit his capital say the cunning ones it may be so and at any rate he probably wished to act the king in such matters and not grudge a little money he really loved music even opera music and knew that his people loved it to the rough natural man all rhythm even of a barberinas feet may be didactic beneficial do not higgle let us do what is to be done in a liberal style his agent at venicefor he has agents everywhere on the outlook for himreports that here is a female dancer of the first quality who has shone in london paris and the capital cities and might answer well but whose terms will probably be dear engage her answers friedrich and she is engaged on pretty terms she will be free in a month or two and then start zimmermann fragmente uber friedrich den grossen leipzig 1790 i 8892 collini ubi infra denina c compare rodenbeck p 191  wellbut barberina had as is usual subsidiary trades to her dancing in particular a young english gentleman had followed her up and down says zimmermann and was still here in venice passionately attached to her which fact especially which young english gentleman should have been extremely indifferent to me but for a circumstance soon to be mentioned the young english gentleman clear against barberinas prussian scheme passionately opposes the same passionately renews his own offersinduces barberina to inform the prussian agent that she renounces her engagement in that quarter prussian agent answers that it is not renounceable that he has legal writing on it and that it must be kept barberina rises into contumacy will laugh at all writing and compulsion prussian agent applies to doge and senate on the subject in his kings name who answer politely but do nothing how happy to oblige so great a king but and so it lasts for certain months barberina and the young english gentleman contumacious in venice and doge and senate merely wishing we may get her  meanwhile a venetian ambassador happens to be passing through berlin in his way to or from some hyperborean state arrives at some hotel in berlinfinds on the morrow that his luggage is arrested by royal order that he or at least it cannot get farther neither advance nor return till barberina do come impossible signor a bargain is a bargain and states ought to have lawcourts that enforce contracts entered into in their territories the venetian doge and senate do now lay hold of barberina pack her into postchaises off towards berlin under the charge of armed men with the proper transitpapersas it were under the address for his majesty of prussia this side uppermostand thus she actually is conveyed date or month uncertain by innspruck or the splugen i cannot say which over mountain over valley from country to country and from stage to stage till she arrives at berlin ambassador with baggage having been let go so soon as the affair was seen to be safe  as for the young english gentleman passionately attached he followed it is understood faithful constant as shadow to the sun always a stage behind arrived in berlin two hours after his barberina still passionately attached and now as the rumor goes was threatening even to marry her and so save the matter supremely indifferent to my readers and me but here now is the circumstance that makes it mentionable the young english is properly a young scotch gentleman james mackenzie the name of hima grandson of the celebrated advocate sir george mackenzie and younger brother of a personage who as earl of bute became extremely conspicuous in this kingdom in after years that makes it mentionableif only in the shape of myth for friedrich according to rumor being still like to lose his dancer in that manner warned the young gentlemans friends and had him peremptorily summoned home and the light fantastic toe left free in that respect which procedure the indignant young gentleman thinks my author never forgave continuing a hater of friedrich all his days and instilling the same sentiment into the earl of bute at a period which was very critical as we shall see this is my authors the often fallacious though not mendacious dr zimmermanns rather deliberate account a man not given to mendacity though filled with much vague wind which renders him fallacious in historical points  readers of walpoles george the third know enough of this mackenzie earls brother mackinsy and the sorrowful difficulties about his scotch lawoffice or benefice in which matter mackinsy behaves always in a high way and only the ministerial outs and inns higgle pedlerlike vigilant of the liberties of england as they call them in the end mackinsy kept his lawoffice or got it restored to him 3000 pounds a year without excess of work a man much the gentleman according to the rule then current in contemplative rare moments the man looking back through the dim posterns of the mind might see afar off a certain pirouetting figure once far from indifferent and not yet quite melted into cheerless gray smoke as so much of the rest isto mr mackinsy and us i have made in the scotch mackenzie circles what inquiry was due find no evidence but various likelihoods that this of the barberina and him is fact and a piece of his biography as to the inference deduced from it in regard to friedrich and the earl of bute on a critical occasionthat rests entirely with zimmermann and the candid mind inclines to admit that probably it is but rumor and conjecture streetdust sticking to the doctors shoes and demanding merely to be well swept out again heigho  barberina though a dancer did not want for more essential graces very sprightly very pretty and intelligent not without piquancy and pungency the king himself has been known to take tea with her in mixed society though nothing more and with passionate young gentlemen she was very successful not long after her coming to berlin she made conquest of cocceji the celebrated chancellors son who finding no other resource at length privately married her voltaires collini when he came to berlin in 1750 recommended by a signora sister of the barberinas found the barberina and her mother dining daily with this cocceji as their guest collini mon sejour aupres de voltaire a paris 1807 pp 1319 signora barberina privately informed collini how the matter was signorina still dancing all the samethough she had money in the english funds withal and friedrich had been so generous as give her the fixing of her own salary when she came to him thissideuppermost in the way we described she had fixed too modestly thinks collini on 5000 thalers about 750 pounds a year having heart and head as well as heels poor little soul perhaps her notablest feat in history after all was her leading this collini as she now did into the service of voltaire to be voltaires secretary as will be seen whereby we have obtained a loyal little book more credible than most others about that notable man  at a subsequent period barberina decided on declaring her marriage with cocceji she drew her money from the english funds purchased a fine mansion and went to live with the said cocceji there giving up the opera and public pirouettes but this did not answer either coccejis mother scorned irreconcilably the opera alliance friedrich who did not himself like it in his chancellors son promoted the young man to some higher post in the distant silesian region but there alas they themselves quarrelled divorced one another and rumor again was busy you cocceji yourself are but a schoolmasters grandson barberina one easily supposes might have a temper withal and it is i if you will recollect that drew money from the english funds barberina married again and to a nobleman of sixteen quarters this time and with whom at least there was no divorce successful with passionate gentlemen having money from the english funds her last name was grafinni really know not what her descendants probably still live with sixteen quarters in those parts it was thus she did her lifejourney waltzing and walking successfully holding her own against the world history declares itself ashamed of spending so many words on such a subject but the dancer of friedrich and the authoress prime or proximate of collinis voltaire claims a passing remembrance let us if we can easily help it never speak of her more     conquest second is ostfriesland of a solid nature  may 25th 1744 just while barberina began her pirouettings at berlin poor karl edzard prince of east friesland long a weak malingering creature died rather suddenly childless and the last of his house which had endured there about 300 years our clever wilhelmina at baireuth though readers have forgotten the small circumstance had married a superfluous sisterinlaw of hers to this karl edward and they say it was some fond hope of progeny suddenly dashed into nothingness that finished the poor man that night of may 25th in any case his territory falls to prussia by reichs settlement of long standing 16831694 which had been confirmed anew to the late king friedrich wilhelmwe remember how he returned with it honest man from that kladrup journey in 1732 and was sniffed at for bringing nothing better and in the interim his royal hanover cousins coveting east friesland had clapt up an erbverbruderung with the poor prince there father i think of the one just dead a thing ultra vires argued lawyers private quasiclandestine and posterior in a sense to reichs conclusum 1694  on which ground however george ii now sued fricdrich at reichs lawfriedrich we need not say having instantly taken possession of ostfriesland and there ensued arguing enough between them for years coming very great expenditure of parchment and of mutual barking at the moon done always by proxy and easy to do which doubtless increased the mutual illfeeling but had no other effect friedrich who had been well awake to ostfriesland for some time back and had given his official people cocceji his minister of justice chancellor by and by and one or two subordinates their precise instructions laid hold of it with a maximum of promptitude thereby quashing a great deal of much more dangerous litigation than uncle georges  in all germany not excepting even mecklenburg there had been no more anarchic spot than ostfriesland for the last sixty or seventy years a country with parliamentarylife in extraordinary vivacity rising indeed to the suicidal or internecine pitch in two or three directions and next to no regentlife at all a country that had loved freedom not wisely but too well ritter party princes party towns partyalways two or more internecine parties false parliament you traitors we false you traitorsthe parish constable by general consent kept walking but for government there was this of the parliamentary eloquences three at once and freedoms battle fancy it bequeathed from sire to son the late karl edzard never once was in embden his chief town though he lived within a dozen miles of itand then still more questionable all these energetic little parties had applied to the neighboring governments and had each its small foreign battalion to protect us and our just franchises imperial reichssafeguard battalion dutch battalion danish battalionprussian it first of all was year 1683 town of embden inviting the great elector but it is not so now the prussians had needed to be quietly swift on that 25th day of may 1744  and truly they were so cocceji having all things ready leading partymen already secured to him troops within call and the like the prussiansembden towncouncils inviting their astonished dutch battalion not to be at homemarched quietly into embden next day and took possession of the guns marched to aurich official metropolis danes and imperial safeguard saying nothing and in short within a week had in their usual exact fashion got firm hold of chaotic ostfriesland and proceeded to manage it in like sortwith effects soon sensible and steadily continuing their parliamentarylife friedrich left in its full vigor tax yourselves what revenue you like and see to the outlay of it yourselves allow me as landesherr some trifle of overplus how much then furthermore a few recruitsor recruitmoney in lieu if you like better and it was astonishing how the parliamentary vitality not shortened of its least franchise or coerced in any particular but merely stroked the right way of the hair by a gently formidable hand with good head guiding sank almost straightway into dovelife and never gave friedrich any trouble whatever else it might do the management was good the opportunity also was good in one sitting the prussian agent arbitrating between embden and the ritters settled their controversy which had lasted fifty years the poor country felt grateful which it might well do as if for the laying of goblins for the ending of longcontinued local typhoon friedrichs first visit in 1751 was welcomed with universal jubilation and poor ostfriesland thanked him in still more solid ways when occasion rose ranke iii 370382  it is not an important countryonly about the size of cheshire wet like it and much inferior to it in cheese in resources for leather and livestock though it perhaps excels again in cloverseeds rapeseeds flanders horses and the flax products the clear overplus it yielded to friedrich as sovereign administrator and defender was only 3200 pounds for recruitmoney 6000 pounds no recruits in corpore in all little more than 9000 pounds a year but it had its uses too embden bigger than chester and with a better harbor was a place of good trade and brought friedrich into contact with seamatters in which as we shall find he did make some creditable incipiencies raising expectations in the world and might have carried it farther had not new wars far worse than this now at hand interrupted him  friedrich was at pyrmont taking the waters while this of friesland fell out he had gone thither may 20th was just arrived there four days before the death of karl edzard rodenbeck p 102 his officials well preinstructed managed the ostfriesland question mainly themselves friedrich was taking the waters ostensibly nothing more but he was withal and still more earnestly consulting with a french excellency who also had felt a need of the waters about the french campaign for this season whether coigny was strong enough in the middlerhine countries how their grand army of the netherlands shaped to prosper and other the like interesting points ranke iii 165 166 frankfurt union is just signed may 22d most christian majesty is himself under way to the netherlands himself going to command there as we shall see good answers friedrich but dont weaken coigny think of prince karl on that side dont detach from coigny and reduce his 60000 to 40000  plenty of mutual consulting as they walk in the woods there and how profoundly obscure to certain official parties much concerned judge from the following small document preserved by accident

drunk himself into direct madness and being confined on that account which if true may have a great effect upon the fate of europe at this critical time yes indeed if true those letters say that at a review he caused two men to be taken out of the line and shot without any cause assigned for it and ordered a third to be murdered in the same manner but the major of the regiment venturing to intercede for him his majesty drew his sword and would have killed the officer too if he perceiving his madness had not taken the liberty to save himself by disarming the king who was immediately shut up and the queen his mother has taken the regency upon herself till his recovery papae i do not give you this news for certain but it is generally believed in town lord chesterfield says he is only
