88714222	the red eric by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the tale begins with the engaging of a tailand the captain delivers his opinions on various subjects  captain dunning stood with his back to the fireplace in the backparlour of a temperance coffeehouse in a certain town on the eastern seaboard of america  the name of that town is unimportant and for reasons with which the reader has nothing to do we do not mean to disclose it  captain dunning besides being the owner and commander of a south sea whaleship was the owner of a large burly body a pair of broad shoulders a pair of immense red whiskers that met under his chin a short red little nose a large firm mouth and a pair of lightblue eyes which according to their owners mood could flash like those of a tiger or twinkle sweetly like the eyes of a laughing child  but his eyes seldom flashed they more frequently twinkled for the captain was the very soul of kindliness and goodhumour  yet he was abrupt and sharp in his manner so that superficial observers sometimes said he was hasty  captain dunning was so to speak a sample of three primary colours red blue and yellowa walking fragment as it were of the rainbow his hair and face especially the nose were red his eyes coat and pantaloons were blue and his waistcoat was yellow  at the time we introduce him to the reader he was standing as we have said with his back to the fireplace although there was no fire the weather being mild and with his hands in his breeches pockets  having worked with the said hands for many long years before the mast until he had at last worked himself behind the mast in other words on to the quarterdeck and into possession of his own ship the worthy captain conceived that he had earned the right to give his hands a long rest accordingly he stowed them away in his pockets and kept them there at all times save when necessity compelled him to draw them forth  very odd remarked captain dunning looking at his black straw hat which lay on the table before him as if the remark were addressed to itvery odd if having swallowed the cow i should now be compelled to worry at the tail  as the black straw hat made no reply the captain looked up at the ceiling but not meeting with any response from that quarter he looked out at the window and encountered the gaze of a seaman flattening his nose on a pane of glass and looking in  the captain smiled  ah heres a tail at last he said as the seaman disappeared and in another moment reappeared at the door with his hat in his hand  it may be necessary perhaps to explain that captain dunning had just succeeded in engaging a firstrate crew for his next whaling voyage which was the cow he professed to have swallowed with the exception of a cook which was the tail at which he feared he might be compelled to worry  youre a cook are you he asked as the man entered and nodded  yes sir answered the tail pulling his forelock  and an uncommonly illfavoured rascallylooking cook you are thought the captain but he did not say so for he was not utterly regardless of mens feelings  he merely said ah and then followed it up with the abrupt question  do you drink  yes sir and smoke too replied the tail in some surprise  very good then you can go said the captain shortly  eh exclaimed the man  you can go repeated the captain  you wont suit  my ship is a temperance ship and all the hands are teetotalers  i have found from experience that men work better and speak better and in every way act better on tea and coffee than on spirits  i dont object to their smoking but i dont allow drinkin aboard my ship so you wont do my man  goodmorning  the tail gazed at the captain in mute amazement  ah you may look observed the captain replying to the gaze but you may also mark my words if you will  ive not sailed the ocean for thirty years for nothing  ive seen men in hot seas and in coldon grog and on teaand i know that coffee and tea carry men through the hardest work better than grog  i also know that theres a set o men in this world who look upon teetotalers as very soft chapsold wives in fact  very good here the captain waxed emphatic and struck his fist on the table now look here young man im an old wife and my ships manned by similar old ladies so you wont suit  to this the seaman made no reply but feeling doubtless as he regarded the masculine specimen before him that he would be quite out of his element among such a crew of females he thrust a quid of tobacco into his cheek put on his hat turned on his heel and left the room shutting the door after him with a bang  he had scarcely left when a tap at the door announced a second visitor  hum  another tail i suppose  come in  if the newcomer was a tail he was decidedly a long one being six feet three in his stockings at the very least  you wants a cook i blieve said the man pulling off his hat  i do  are you one  yes i jist guess i am  bin a cook for fifteen year  been to sea as a cook inquired the captain  i jist have  once to the south seas twice to the north an once round the world  cook all the time  ive roasted and stewed and grilled and fried and biled right round the arth i have  being apparently satisfied with the mans account of himself captain dunning put to him the questiondo you drink  ay like a fish for i drinks nothin but water i dont  bin born and raised in the state of maine dye see an never tasted a drop all my life  very good said the captain who plumed himself on being a clever physiognomist and had already formed a good opinion of the man  do you ever swear  never but when i cant help it  and whens that  when im fit to bust  then replied the captain you must learn to bust without swearin cause i dont allow it aboard my ship  the man evidently regarded his questioner as a very extraordinary and eccentric individual but he merely replied ill try and after a little further conversation an agreement was come to the man was sent away with orders to repair on board immediately as everything was in readiness to up anchor and away next morning  having thus satisfactorily and effectually disposed of the tail captain dunning put on his hat very much on the back of his head knit his brows and pursed his lips firmly as if he had still some important duty to perform then quitting the hotel he traversed the streets of the town with rapid strides    chapter two  important personages are introduced to the readerthe captain makes insane resolutions fights a battle and conquers  in the centre of the town whose name we have declined to communicate there stood a housea small houseso small that it might have been more appropriately perhaps styled a cottage  this house had a yellowpainted face with a green door in the middle which might have been regarded as its nose and a window on each side thereof which might have been considered its eyes  its nose was as we have said painted green and its eyes had green venetian eyelids which were half shut at the moment captain dunning walked up to it as if it were calmly contemplating that seamans general appearance  there was a small garden in front of the house surrounded on three sides by a low fence  captain dunning pushed open the little gate walked up to the nose of the house and hit it several severe blows with his knuckles  the result was that the nose opened and a servantgirl appeared in the gap  is your mistress at home inquired the captain  guess she isboth of em replied the girl  tell both of em im here then said the captain stepping into the little parlour without further ceremony and is my little girl in  yes shes in  then send her here too an look alive lass  so saying captain dunning sat down on the sofa and began to beat the floor with his right foot somewhat impatiently  in another second a merry little voice was heard in the passage the door burst open a fairhaired girl of about ten years of age sprang into the room and immediately commenced to strangle her father in a series of violent embraces  why ailie my darling one would think you had not seen me for fifty years at least said the captain holding his daughter at armslength in order the more satisfactorily to see her  its a whole week papa since you last came to see me replied the little one striving to get at her fathers neck again and im sure it seems to me like a hundred years at least  as the child said this she threw her little arms round her father and kissed his large weatherbeaten visage all overeyes mouth nose chin whiskers and in fact every attainable spot  she did it so vigorously too that an observer would have been justified in expecting that her soft delicate cheeks would be lacerated by the rough contact but they were not  the result was a heightening of the colour nothing more  having concluded this operation she laid her cheek on the captains and endeavoured to clasp her hands at the back of his neck but this was no easy matter  the captains neck was a remarkably thick one and the garments about that region were voluminous however by dint of determination she got the small fingers intertwined and then gave him a squeeze that ought to have choked him but it didnt many a strong man had tried that in his day and had failed signally  youll stay a long time with me before you go away to sea again wont you dear papa asked the child earnestly after she had given up the futile effort to strangle him  how like murmured the captain as if to himself and totally unmindful of the question while he parted the fair curls and kissed ailies forehead  like what papa  like your motheryour beloved mother replied the captain in a low sad voice  the child became instantly grave and she looked up in her fathers face with an expression of awe while he dropped his eyes on the floor  poor alice had never known a mothers love  her mother died when she was a few weeks old and she had been confided to the care of two maiden auntsexcellent ladies both of them good beyond expression correct almost to a fault but prim starched and extremely selfpossessed and judicious so much so that they were injudicious enough to repress some of the best impulses of their natures under the impression that a certain amount of dignified formality was essential to good breeding and good morals in every relation of life  dear good starched misses dunning if they had had their way boys would have played cricket and football with polite urbanity and girls would have kissed their playmates with gentle solemnity  they did their best to subdue little alice but that was impossible  the child would rush about the house at all unexpected and often inopportune seasons like a furiously insane kitten and she would disarrange their collars too violently every evening when she bade them goodnight  alice was intensely sympathetic  it was quite enough for her to see any one in tears to cause her to open up the floodgates of her eyes and weepshe knew not and she cared not why  she threw her arms round her fathers neck again and hugged him while bright tears trickled like diamonds from her eyes  no diamonds are half so precious or so difficult to obtain as tears of genuine sympathy  how would you like to go with me to the whalefishery inquired captain dunning somewhat abruptly as he disengaged the childs arms and set her on his knee  the tears stopped in an instant as alice leaped with the happy facility of childhood totally out of one idea and thoroughly into another  oh i should like it so much  and how much is so much ailie inquired the captain  ailie pursed her mouth and looked at her father earnestly while she seemed to struggle to give utterance to some fleeting idea  think she said quickly think something good as much as ever you can  have you thought  yes answered the captain smiling  then continued ailie its twenty thousand million times as much as that and a great deal more  the laugh with which captain dunning received this curious explanation of how much his little daughter wished to go with him to the whalefishery was interrupted by the entrance of his sisters whose sense of propriety induced them to keep all visitors waiting at least a quarter of an hour before they appeared lest they should be charged with unbecoming precipitancy  here you are lassies how are ye cried the captain as he rose and kissed each lady on the cheek heartily  the sisters did not remonstrate  they knew that their brother was past hope in this respect and they loved him so they suffered it meekly  having admitted that they were wellas well at least as could be expected considering the cataract of trials that perpetually descended upon their devoted headsthey sat down as primly as if their visitor were a perfect stranger and entered into a somewhat lengthened conversation as to the intended voyage commencing of course with the weather  and now said the captain rubbing the crown of his straw hat in a circular manner as if it were a beaver im coming to the point  both ladies exclaimed what point george simultaneously and regarded the captain with a look of anxious surprise  the point replied the captain about which ive come here today it aint a point o the compass nevertheless ive been steerin it in my minds eye for a considerable time past  the fact is here the captain hesitated iive made up my mind to take my little alice along with me this voyage  the misses dunning wore unusually tall caps and their countenances were by nature uncommonly long but the length to which they grew on hearing this announcement was something preternaturally awful  take ailie to sea exclaimed miss martha dunning in horror  to fish for whales added miss jane dunning in consternation  brother youre mad they exclaimed together after a breathless pause and youll do nothing of the kind they added firmly  now the manner in which the misses dunning received this intelligence greatly relieved their eccentric brother  he had fully anticipated and very much dreaded that they would at once burst into tears and being a tenderhearted man he knew that he could not resist that without a hard struggle  a flood of womans tears he was wont to say was the only sort of salt water storm he hadnt the heart to face  but abrupt opposition was a species of challenge which the captain always accepted at onceoffhand  no human power could force him to any course of action  in this latter quality captain dunning was neither eccentric nor singular  im sorry you dont like my proposal my dear sisters said he but im resolved  you wont said martha  you shant cried jane  i will replied the captain  there was a pause here of considerable length during which the captain observed that marthas nostrils began to twitch nervously  jane observing the fact became similarly affected  to the captains practised eye these symptoms were as good as a barometer  he knew that the storm was coming and took in all sail at once mentally to be ready for it  it came  martha and jane dunning were for once driven from the shelter of their wonted proprietythey burst simultaneously into tears and buried their respective faces in their respective pockethandkerchiefs which were immaculately clean and had to be hastily unfolded for the purpose  now now my dear girls cried the captain starting up and patting their shoulders while poor little ailie clasped her hands sat down on a footstool looked up in their facesor rather at the backs of the hands which covered their facesand wept quietly  its very cruel georgeindeed it is sobbed martha you know how we love her  very true remarked the obdurate captain but you dont know how i love her and how sad it makes me to see so little of her and to think that she may be learning to forget meor at least added the captain correcting himself as ailie looked at him reproachfully through her tearsat least to do without me  i cant bear the thought  shes all i have left to me and  brother interrupted martha looking hastily up did you ever before hear of such a thing as taking a little girl on a voyage to the whalefishing  no never replied the captain what has that got to do with it  both ladies held up their hands and looked aghast  the idea of any man venturing to do what no one ever thought of doing before was so utterly subversive of all their ideas of proprietysuch a desperate piece of profane originalitythat they remained speechless  george said martha drying her eyes and speaking in tones of deep solemnity did you ever read robinson crusoe  yes i did when i was a boy an that wasnt yesterday  and did you continued the lady in the same sepulchral tone did you note how that manthat beacon if i may use the expression set up as a warning to deter all wilful boys and men from reckless and wicked and wandering and obstreperous coursesdid you note i say how that man that beacon was shipwrecked and spent a dreary existence on an uninhabited and dreadful island in company with a low dissolute black unclothed companion called friday  yes answered the captain seeing that she paused for a reply  and all continued martha in consequence of his resolutely and obstinately and wilfully and wickedly going to sea  well it couldnt have happened if he hadnt gone to sea no doubt  then argued martha will you can you george contemplate the possibility of your only daughter coming to the same dreadful end  george not exactly seeing the connection rubbed his nose with his forefinger and repliedcertainly not  then you are bound continued martha in triumph by all that is upright and honourable by all the laws of humanity and propriety to give up this wild intentionand you must  there cried miss jane emphatically as if the argument were unanswerableas indeed it was being incomprehensible  the last words were unfortunate  they merely riveted the captains determination  you talk a great deal of nonsense martha he said rising to depart ive fixed to take her so the sooner you make up your minds to it the better  the sisters knew their brothers character too well to waste more time in vain efforts but martha took him by the arm and said earnestlywill you promise me my dear george that when she comes back from this voyage you will never take her on another  yes dear sister replied the captain somewhat melted i promise that  without another word martha sat down and held out her arms to ailie who incontinently rushed into them  propriety fled for the nonce discomfited  miss marthas curls were disarranged beyond repair and miss marthas collar was crushed to such an extent that the very laundress who had washed and starched and ironed it would have utterly failed to recognise it  miss jane looked on at these improprieties in perfect indifferencenay when after her sister had had enough the child was handed over to her she submitted to the same violent treatment without a murmur  for once nature was allowed to have her way and all three had a good hearty satisfactory cry in the midst of which captain dunning left them and proceeding on board his ship hastened the preparations for his voyage to the southern seas    chapter three  the teapartyaccidents and incidents of a minor kindglynn proctor gets into trouble  on the evening of the day in which the foregoing scenes were enacted the misses dunning prepared a repast for their brother and one or two of his officers who were to spend the last evening in port there and discuss various important and unimportant matters in a sort of semiconviviobusiness way  an event of this kind was always of the deepest interest and productive of the most intense anxiety to the amiable though starched sisters first because it was of rare occurrence and second because they were never quite certain that it would pass without some unhappy accident such as the upsetting of a teacup or a kettle or the scalding of the cat not to mention visitors legs  they seemed to regard a teaparty in the light of a firearma species of blunderbussa thing which it was to be hoped would go off well and certainly if loading the table until it groaned had anything to do with the manner of its going off there was every prospect of its doing so with preeminent success upon that occasion  but besides the anxieties inseparable from the details of the pending festivities the misses dunning were overwhelmed and weighed down with additional duties consequent upon their brothers sudden and unexpected determination  little ailie had to be got ready for sea by the following morning  it was absolute and utter insanity  no one save a madman or a seacaptain could have conceived such a thing much less have carried it into effect tyrannically  the misses dunning could not attempt any piece of duty or work separately  they always acted together when possible and might in fact without much inconvenience have been born siamese twins whatever martha did jane attempted to do or to mend wherever jane went martha followed  not by any means that one thought she could improve upon the work of the other their conduct was simply the result of a desire to assist each other mutually  when martha spoke jane echoed or corroborated and when jane spoke martha repeated her sentences word for word in a scarcely audible whispernot after the other had finished but during the course of the remarks  with such dispositions and propensities it is not a matter to be wondered at that the good ladies while arranging the teatable should suddenly remember some forgotten article of ailies wardrobe and rush simultaneously into the childs bedroom to rectify the omission or when thus engaged be filled with horror at the thought of having left the buttered toast too near the fire in the parlour  it is really quite perplexing said martha sitting down with a sigh and regarding the teatable with a critical gaze quite perplexing im sure i dont know how i shall bear it  it is too bad of george darling ailiedear me jane how crookedly you have placed the urn it is really too bad  too bad indeed yes isnt it echoed jane in reference to the captains conduct while she assisted martha who had risen to readjust the urn  oh exclaimed martha with a look of horror  what cried jane who looked and felt equally horrified although she knew not yet the cause  the eggs  the eggs  yes the eggs  you know every one of the last dozen we got was bad and weve forgot to send for more said martha  for more so we have cried jane and both ladies rushed into the kitchen gave simultaneous and hurried orders to the servantgirl and sent her out of the house impressed with an undefined feeling that life or death depended on the instant procuring of two dozen fresh eggs  it may be as well to remark here that the misses dunning although stiff and starched and formal had the power of speeding nimbly from room to room when alone and when occasion required without in the least degree losing any of their stiffness or formality so that we do not use the terms rush rushed or rushing inappropriately nevertheless it may also be remarked that they never acted in a rapid or impulsive way in company however small in numbers or unceremonious in character the company might bealways excepting the servantgirl and the cat to whose company from long habit they had become used and therefore indifferent  the sisters were on their knees stuffing various articles into a large trunk and ailie was looking on by way of helping with very red and swollen eyes and the girl was still absent in quest of eggs when a succession of sounding blows were administered to the green door and a number of gruff voices were heard conversing without  there cried martha and jane with bitter emphasis looking in each others faces as if to say we knew it  before that girl was sent away for these eggs we each separately and privately prophesied that they would arrive and that we should have to open the door  and you see so it has happened and we are not ready  but there was no time for remark  the case was desperate  both sisters felt it to be so and acted accordingly while ailie having been forbidden to open the door sat down on her trunk and looked on in surprise  they sprang up washed their hands simultaneously in the same basin with the same piece of soap broken in two dried them with the same towel darted to the mirror put on two identically similar clean tall caps leaped downstairs opened the door with slow dignity of demeanour and received their visitors in the hall with a calmness and urbanity of manner that contrasted rather strangely with their flushed countenances and heaving bosoms  hallo  ailie exclaimed the captain as his daughter pulled down his head to be kissed  why you take a fellow all aback like a white squall  are you ready my pet  kit stowed and anchor tripped  come this way and let us talk about it  dear me martha you and janelook as if you had been running a race eh  here are my messmates come to talk a bit with you  my sisters martha and janedr hopley  dr hopley bowed politely my first mate mr millons mr millons also bowed somewhat loosely and rokenstim rokens my chief harpooner mr rokens pulled his forelock and threw back his left leg apparently to counterbalance the bend in his body he didnt want to come said he warnt accustomed to ladies society but i told him you warnt ladiesai dont mean thatnot ladies o the highflyin fashionable sort that give themselves airs you know  come along ailie  while the captain ran on in this strain hung up his hat kissed ailie and ran his fingers through his shaggy locks the misses dunning performed a mingled bow and courtsey to each guest as his name was mentioned and shook hands with him after which the whole party entered the parlour where the cat was discovered enjoying a preliminary meal of its own at one of the pats of butter  a united shriek from martha and jane a nautical howl from the guests and a rolledup pockethandkerchief from rokens sent that animal from the table as if it had received a galvanic shock  i ax yer parding ladies said mr rokens whose aim had been so perfect that his handkerchief not only accelerated the flight of the cat but carried away the violated pat of butter along with it  i ax yer parding but them brutes is sich thievesi could roast em alive so i could  the harpooner unrolled his handkerchief and picking the pat of butter from its folds with his fingers threw it into the fire  thereafter he smoothed down his hair and seated himself on the extreme edge of a chair as near the door as possible  not that he had any intention whatever of taking to flight but he deemed that position to be more suited to his condition than any other  in a few minutes the servantgirl returned with the eggs  while she is engaged in boiling them we shall introduce captain dunnings friends and messmates to the reader  dr hopley was a surgeon and a particular friend of the captains  he was an american by birth but had travelled so much about the world that he had ceased to guess and calculate and to speak through his nose he was a man about forty tall bigboned and muscular though not fat and besides being a gentlemanly man was a goodnatured quiet creature and a clever enough fellow besides but he preferred to laugh at and enjoy the jokes and witticisms of others rather than to perpetrate any himself  dr hopley was intensely fond of travelling and being possessed of a small independence he indulged his passion to the utmost  he had agreed to go with captain dunning as the ships doctor simply for the sake of seeing the whalefishery of the south seas having already in a similar capacity encountered the dangers of the north  dr hopley had few weaknesses  his chief one was an extravagant belief in phrenology  we would not be understood to imply that phrenology is extravagant but we assert that the doctors belief in it was extravagant assigning as he did to every real and ideal facility of the human mind a local habitation and a name in the cranium with a corresponding depression or elevation of the surface to mark its whereabouts  in other respects he was a commonplace sort of a man  mr millons the first mate was a short hale thickset man without any particularly strong points of character  he was about thirtyfive and possessed a superabundance of fair hair and whiskers with a large broad chin a firm mouth rather fiercelooking eyes and a hasty but by no means a bad temper  he was a trustworthy matteroffact seaman and a good officer but not bright intellectually  like most men of his class his look implied that he did not underestimate his own importance and his tones were those of a man accustomed to command  tim rokens was an old salt a bluff strong castiron man of about fortyfive years of age who had been at sea since he was a little boy and would not have consented to live on dry land though he had been offered command of a seaport town all to himself as he was wont to affirm emphatically  his visage was scarred and knotty as if it had been long used to being pelted by stormsas indeed it had  there was a scar over his left eye and down his cheek which had been caused by a slash from the cutlass of a pirate in the china seas but although it added to the rugged effect of his countenance it did not detract from the frank kindly expression that invariably rested there  tim rokens had never been caught out of temper in his life  men were wont say he had no temper to lose  whether this was true or no we cannot presume to say but certainly he never lost it  he was the best and boldest harpooner in captain dunnings ship and a sententious deliverer of his private opinion on all occasions whatsoever  when we say that he wore a rough blue pilotcloth suit and had a large black beard with a sprinkling of silver hairs in it we have completed his portrait  whats come of glynn inquired captain dunning as he accepted a large cup of smoking tea with one hand and with the other handed a plate of buttered toast to dr hopley who sat next him  i really cannot imagine replied miss martha  no cannot imagine whispered miss jane  he promised to come and to be punctual continued miss martha punctual whispered miss j but something seems to have detained him  perhaps  here miss martha was brought to an abrupt pause by observing that mr rokens was about to commence to eat his egg with a teaspoon  allow me mr rokens she said handing that individual an ivory eggspoon  oh cernly maam  by all means replied rokens taking the spoon and handing it to miss jane under the impression that it was intended for her  i beg pardon it is for yourself mr rokens said martha and jane together  thankee maam replied rokens growing red as he began to perceive he was a little off his course somehow  ive no occasion for two an this one suits me oncommon  ah you prefer big spoons to little ones my man dont you said captain dunning coming to the rescue  let him alone martha hes used to take care of himself  doctor can you tell me now which is the easiest of digestiona hard egg or a soft one  thus appealed to dr hopley paused a moment and frowned at the teapot as though he were about to tax his brain to the utmost in the solution of an abstruse question in medical science  well now he replied stirring his tea gently and speaking with much deliberation that depends very much upon circumstances  some digestions can manage a hard egg best others find a soft one more tractable  and then the state of the stomach at the time of eating has to be taken into account  i should say now that my little friend ailie here to judge from the rosy colour of her cheeks could manage hard or soft eggs equally well couldnt you eh  ailie laughed as she replied im sure i dont know doctor hopley but i like soft ones best  to this captain dunning said of course you do my sensible little pet although it would be difficult to show wherein lay the sensibility of the preference and then addedtheres rokens now wouldnt you doctorjudging from his rosy not to say purple cheeksconclude that he wasnt able to manage even two eggs of any kind  wot me exclaimed mr rokens looking up in surprise as indeed he well might having just concluded his fourth and being about to commence his fifth egg to the no small anxiety of martha and jane into whose limited and innocent minds the possibility of such a feat had never entered  wot me  why capting if they was biled as hard as the head of a marlinespike  the expanding grin on the captains face and a sudden laugh from the mate apprised the bold harpooner at this point of his reply that the captain was jesting so he felt a little confused and sought relief by devoting himself assiduously to egg number 5  it fared ill with tim rokens that evening that he had rashly entered into ladies society for he was a nervous man in refined company though cool and firm as a grounded iceberg when in the society of his messmates or when towing with the speed of a steamboat in the wake of a spermwhale  egg number 5 proved to be a bad one  worse than that egg number 5 happened to belong to that peculiar class of bad eggs which go off with a little crack when hit with a spoon and sputter their unsavoury contents around them  thus it happened that when mr rokens feeling confused and seeking relief in attention to the business then in hand hit egg number 5 a smart blow on the top a large portion of its contents spurted over the fair white tablecloth a small portion fell on mr rokens vest and a minute yellow globule thereof alighted on the fair marthas hand eliciting from that lady a scream and as a matter of course an echo from jane in the shape of a screamlet  mr rokens flushed a deep indianred and his nose assumed a warm blue colour instantly  oh maam i ax yer parding  pray dont mention ita mere accident  im so sorry you have got a badoh  the little scream with which miss martha interrupted her remark was caused by mr rokens who had just observed the little yellow globule above referred to seizing her hand and wiping away the speck with the identical handkerchief that had floored the cat and swept away the pat of butter  immediately thereafter feeling heated he wiped the perspiration from his forehead and unwittingly transferred the spot thereto in the form of a yellow streak whereat ailie and the first mate burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter  even miss martha smiled although she rather objected to jesting as being a dangerous amusement and never laughed at the weaknesses or misfortunes of others however ludicrous they might be when she could help it  how can you brother she said reproachfully shaking her head at the captain who was winking at the doctor with one eye in a most obstreperous manner  do try another egg mr rokens the others i am sure are fresh  i cannot imagine how a bad one came to be amongst them  ah try another my lad echoed the captain  pass em up this way mr millons  by no manner o means ill eat this un replied the harpooner commencing to eat the bad egg with apparent relish  i like em this waybetter than nothin anyhow  bless ye marm yeve no notion wot sort o things ive lived on aboard ship  rokens came to an abrupt pause in consequence of the servantgirl at a sign from her mistresses for she always received duplicate orders seizing his plate and carrying it off bodily  it was immediately replaced by a clean one and a fresh egg  while rokens somewhat nervously tapped the head of number 6 miss martha in order to divert attention from him asked mr millons if seafare was always salt junk and hard biscuit  oh no madam answered the first mate  weve sometimes salt pork and vegetables now and agin and peasoup and plumduff  plumduff ailie interrupted the captain in order to explain is just a puddin with few plums and fewer spices in it  something like a whitepainted cannonshot with brown spots on it here and there  is it good inquired ailie  oh aint it remarked mr rokens who had just concluded number 6 and felt his selfpossession somewhat restored  yes miss it is but it aint equal to whalesbrain fritters it aint thems firstchop  have whales got brains inquired miss martha in surprise  brains echoed miss jane in amazement  yes madam they ave answered the first mate who had hitherto maintained silence but having finished tea was now ready for any amount of talk and whats more remarkable still theyve got several barrels of oil in their skulls besides  dear me exclaimed the sisters  yes ladies capital oil it is too fetches a igher price hin the markit than the other sort  by the bye millons didnt you once fall into a whales skull and get nearly drowned in oil inquired the doctor  i did answered the first mate with the air of a man who regarded such an event as a mere trifle that upon consideration might almost be considered as rather a pleasant incident than otherwise in ones history  nearly drowned in oil exclaimed the sisters while ailie opened her eyes in amazement and mr rokens became alarmingly purple in the face with suppressed chuckling  its true remarked rokens in a hoarse whisper to miss martha putting his hand up to his mouth the better to convey the sound to her ears i seed him tumble in and helped to haul him out  lets have the story millons cried the captain pushing forward his cup to be replenished its so long since i heard it that ive almost forgotten it  another cup o tea martha my dearnot quite so strong as the last and three times as sweet  ill drink success to the cup that cheers but dont inebriate  go ahead millons  nothing rejoiced the heart of mr millons more than being asked to tell a story  like most men who are excessively addicted to the habit his stories were usually very long and very dry but he had a bluff goodnatured way of telling them that rendered his yarns endurable on shore and positively desirable at sea  fortunately for the reader the story he was now requested to relate was not a long one  it aint quite a story he beganand in beginning he cleared his throat with emphasis thrust his thumbs into the armholes of his vest and tilted his chair on its hindlegsit aint quite a story its a hanecdote a sort of hincident so to speak and this is ow it appened  many years ago wen i was a very young man or a big boy i was on a voyage to the south seas after whales  tim rokens was my messmate then and has bin so almost ever since off and on  mr rokens nodded assent to this statement well we came up with a big whale and fixed an iron cleverly in him at the first throw  an iron inquired miss martha to whose mind flat and italian irons naturally occurred  yes madam an iron we call the arpoons irons  well away went the fish like all alive not down but straight forard takin out the line at a rate that nearly set the boat on fire and away we went along with it  it was a chase that  for six hours off and on we stuck to that whale and pitched into im with arpoons and lances but he seemed to have the lives of a catnothin would kill im  at last the arpooner gave him a thrust in the life an up went the blood and water and the fish went into the flurries and came nigh capsizin the boat with its tail as it lashed the water into foam  at last it gave in and we had a four hours pull after that to tow the carcase to the ship for there wasnt a catspaw of wind on the water  wen we came alongside we got out the tackles and before beginning to flense that means maam to strip off the blubber we cut a hole in the top o the skull to get out the oil that was there for you must know that the spermwhale has got a sort of ollow or big cavern in its ead wich is full o the best oil quite pure that dont need to be cleared but is all ready to be baled out and stowed away in casks well wen the ole was cut in its skull i went down on my knees on the edge of it to peep in when my knees they slipped on the blubber and in i went eadforemost souse into the whales skull and began to swim for life in the oil  of course i began to roar for elp like a bull and rokens there oo appened to be near e let down the hend of a rope but my ands was so slippy with oil i couldnt ketch old of it so e auls it up agin and lets down a rope with a ook at the hend and i got old of this and stuck it into the waistband o my trousers and gave the word eave away my earties and sure enough so they did and pulled me out in a trice  and thats ow it was and i lost a suit o clos for nothing on arth would take the oil out and i didnt need to use pomatum for six months after  no more you did cried rokens who had listened to the narrative with suppressed delight no more you did  i never see sich a glazed rat as you wos when you comed out o that hole in all my life an he wos jist like a eel it wos all we could do to keep old on im marm he was so slippery  while the captain was laughing at the incident and rokens was narrating some of the minute details in the halfunwilling yet halfwilling ears of the sisters the door opened and a young man entered hastily and apologised for being late  the fact is miss dunning had i not promised faithfully to come i should not have made my appearance at all tonight  why glynn what has kept you lad interrupted the captain  i thought you were a man of your word  ay thats the question capting said rokens who evidently regarded the new arrival with no favourable feelings its always the way with them gentlemen sailors till theyre got into blue water and brought to their bearins  mr rokens had wisdom enough to give forth the last part of his speech in a muttered tone for the youth was evidently a favourite with the captain as was shown by the hearty manner in which he shook him by the hand  messmates this is glynn proctor a friend o mine said captain dunning in explanation he is going with us this voyage before the mast so youll have to make the most of him as an equal tonight for i intend to keep him in his proper place when afloat  he chooses to go as an ordinary seaman against my advice the scamp so ill make him keep his head as low as the rest when aboard  youll to keep your time better too than you have done tonight lad continued the captain giving his young friend a slap on the shoulder  what has detained you eh  necessity captain replied the youth with a smile as he sat down to table with an offhand easy air that savoured of recklessness and i am prepared to state upon oath if need be that necessity is not the mother of invention  if she had been she would have enabled me to invent a way of escape from my persecutors in time to keep my promise to miss dunning  persecutors glynn exclaimed martha to whom do you refer  to the police of this good city  police echoed the captain regarding his young friend seriously while the doctor and the first mate and tim rokens listened in some surprise  why the fact is said glynn that i have just escaped from the hands of the police and if it had not been that i was obliged to make a very wide detour in order to reach this house without being observed i should have been here long ago  boy boy your hasty disposition will bring you into serious trouble one of these days said the captain shaking his head  what mischief have you been about  ay there you goits my usual fate cried glynn laughing  if i chance to get into a scrape you never think of inquiring whether it was my fault or my misfortune  this time however it was my misfortune and if miss dunning will oblige me with a cup of tea ill explain how it happened  little more than two hours ago i left the ship to come here to tea as i had promised to do  nikel sling the longlegged cook you engaged this morning went ashore with me  as we walked up the street together i observed a big porter passing along with a heavy deal plank on his shoulder  the street was somewhat narrow and crowded at that part and sling had turned to look in at a shopwindow just as the big fellow came up  the man shouted to my shipmate to get out o the way but the noise in the street prevented him from hearing  before i could turn to touch the cooks arm the fellow uttered an oath and ran the end of the plank against his head  poor sling was down in an instant  before i well knew what i was about i hit the porter between the eyes and down he went with a clatter and the plank above him  in a moment three policemen had me by the collar  i tried to explain but they wouldnt listen  as i was being hurried away to the lockup it flashed across me that i should not only lose my tea and your pleasant society this evening but be prevented from sailing tomorrow so i gave a sudden twist tripped up the man on my left overturned the one on my right and bolted  they ran well the rascals and shouted like maniacs but i got the start of em dived down one street up another into a bylane over a backgarden wall in at the backdoor of a house and out at the front took a round of two or three miles and came in here from the west and whatever other objections there may be to the whole proceeding i cannot say that it has spoiled my appetite  and so sir said captain dunning you call this your misfortune  surely captain said glynn putting down his cup and looking up in some surprisesurely you cannot blame me for punishing the rascal who behaved so brutally without the slightest provocation to my shipmate  hear hear cried rokens involuntarily  i do blame you lad replied the captain seriously  in the first place you had no right to take the law into your own hands  in the second place your knocking down the man did no good whatever to your shipmate and in the third place youve got yourself and me and the ship into a very unsatisfactory scrape  rokens face which had hitherto expressed approval of glynns conduct began to elongate as the captain went on in this strain and the youths recklessness of manner altogether disappeared as inquired how so captain  i have escaped as you see and poor sling of course was not to blame so hell be all safe aboard and well i hope by this time  there youre mistaken boy  they will have secured sling and made him tell the name of his ship and also the name of his pugnacious comrade  and do you think hed be so mean as to tell asked glynn indignantly  you forget that the first act in this nice little melodrama was the knocking down of sling so that he could not know what happened after and the police would not be so soft as to tell him why they wanted such information until after they had got it  poor glynn looked aghast and rokens was overwhelmed  it seems to me id better go and see about this said millons rising and buttoning his coat with the air of a man who had business to transact and meant to transact it  right millons answered the captain  im sorry to break up our evening so soon but we must get this man aboard by hook or crook as speedily as possible  you had better go too doctor  rokens and i will take care of this young scamp who must be made a nigger of in order to be got on board for his face once seen by these sharp limbs of justice is not likely soon to be forgotten  glynn proctor was indeed a youth whose personal appearance was calculated to make a lasting impression on most people  he was about eighteen years of age but a strong welldeveloped muscular frame a firm mouth a large chin and an eagle eye gave him the appearance of being much older  he was above the middle height but not tall and the great breadth of his shoulders and depth of his chest made him appear shorter than he really was  his hair was of that beautiful hue called nutbrown and curled close round his wellshaped head  he was a model of strength and activity  glynn proctor had many faults  he was hasty and reckless  he was unsteady too and preferred a roving idle life to a busy one but he had redeeming qualities  he was bold and generous  above all he was unselfish and therefore speedily became a favourite with all who knew him  glynns history is briefly told  he was an englishman  his father and mother had died when he was a child and left him in charge of an uncle who emigrated to america shortly after his brothers death the uncle was a good man after a fashion but he was austere and unlovable  glynn didnt like him so when he attained the age of thirteen he quietly told him that he meant to bid him goodbye and go seek his fortune in the world  the uncle as quietly told glynn that he was quite right and the sooner he went the better  so glynn went and never saw his uncle again for the old man died while he was abroad  glynn travelled far and encountered many vicissitudes of fortune in his early wanderings but he was never long without occupation because men liked his looks and took him on trial without much persuasion  to say truth glynn never took the trouble to persuade them  when his services were declined he was wont to turn on his heel and walk away without a word of reply and not unfrequently he was called back and employed  he could turn his hand to almost anything but when he tired of it he threw it up and sought other work elsewhere  in the course of his peregrinations he came to reside in the city in which our story finds him  here he had become a compositor in the office of a daily newspaper and happening to be introduced to the misses dunning soon became a favourite with them and a constant visitor at their house  thus he became acquainted with their brother becoming disgusted with the constant work and late hours of the printingoffice he resolved to join captain dunnings ship and take a voyage to southern seas as an ordinary seaman  glynn and little alice dunning were great friends and it was a matter of extreme delight to both of them that they were to sail together on this their first voyage  having been made a nigger ofthat is having had his face and hands blackened in order to avoid detectionglynn sallied forth with the captain and rokens to return to their ship the red eric which lay in the harbour not ten minutes walk from the house  they passed the police on the wharf without creating suspicion and reached the vessel    chapter four  the escape  well millons what news inquired the captain as he stepped on deck  bad news sir i fear replied the first mate  i found on coming aboard that no one knew anything about sling so i went ashore at once and urried up to the hospital were sure enough i found im lyin with his ead bandaged and lookin as if e were about gone  they asked me if i knew what ship e belonged to as the police wanted to know  so i told em i knew well enough but i wasnt going to tell if it would get the poor fellow into a scrape  why dont you ask himself says i  they told me e was past speaking so i tried to make im understand but e only mumbled in reply  wen i was about to go e seemed to mumble very ard so i put down my ear to listen and e wispered quite distinct tho very lowall right my eartie  im too cute for em by a long way go aboard an say nothin  so i came away and ive scarce been five minutes aboard before you arrived  my own opinion is that es crazed and dont know what es sayin  oh ejaculated captain dunning  he said that did he  then my opinion is that hes not so crazed as you think  tell the watch mr millons to keep a sharp lookout  so saying captain dunning descended to the cabin and rokens to the forecastle in sea phraseology the foksail while glynn proctor procured a basin and a piece of soap and proceeded to rub the coat of charcoal off his face and hands  halfanhour had not elapsed when the watch on deck heard a loud splash near the wharf as if some one had fallen into the water  immediately after a confused sound of voices and rapid footsteps was heard in the street that opened out upon the quay and in a few seconds the end of the wharf was crowded with men who shouted to each other and were seen in the dim starlight to move rapidly about as if in search of something  wot can it be said tim rokens in a low voice to a seaman who leaned on the ships bulwarks close to him  deserter mayhap suggested the man  while rokens pondered the suggestion a light plash was heard close to the ships side and a voice said in a hoarse whisper heave us a rope will ye  look alive now  guess ill go under in two minits if ye dont  oho exclaimed rokens in a low impressive voice as he threw over the end of a rope and with the aid of the other members of the watch hauled nikel sling up the side and landed him dripping and panting on the deck  wysling what on airth exclaimed one of the men  its luckyi amon airth panted the tall cook seating himself on the breech of one of the maindeck carronades and wringing the water from his garments  an its well im not at the bottom o this ere arbour  but where did ye come from an why are they arter ye lad inquired rokens  wy cause they dont want to part with me and ive gin them the slip i guess  when nikel sling had recovered himself so as to talk connectedly he explained to his wondering shipmates how that after being floored in the street he had been carried up to the hospital and on recovering his senses found mr millons standing by the bedside conversing with the young surgeons  the first words of their conversation showed him that something was wrong so with remarkable selfpossession he resolved to counterfeit partial delirium by which means he contrived to give the first mate a hint that all was right and declined without creating suspicion to give any intelligible answers as to who he was or where he had come from  the blow on his head caused him considerable pain but his mind was relieved by one of the young surgeons who remarked to another in going round the wards that the skull of that long chap wasnt fractured after all and he had no doubt he would be dismissed cured in a day or two  so the cook lay quiet until it was dark  when the housesurgeon had paid his last visit and the nurses had gone their rounds in the accidentward and no sound disturbed the quiet of the dimlylighted apartment save the heavy fitful breathing and occasional moans and restless motions of the sufferers nikel sling raised himself on his elbow and glanced stealthily round on the rows of painworn and haggard countenances around him  it was a solemn sight to look upon especially at that silent hour of the night  there were men there with almost every species of painful wound and fracture  some had been long there wasting away from day to day and now lay quiet though suffering from sheer exhaustion  others there were who had been carried in that day and fidgeted impatiently in their unreduced strength yet nervously in their agony or in some cases where the fear of death was on them clasped their hands and prayed in whispers for mercy to him whose name perhaps they had almost never used before except for the purpose of taking it in vain  but such sights had little or no effect on the cook who had rubbed hard against the worlds roughest sides too long to be easily affected by the sight of human suffering especially when exhibited in men  he paused long enough to note that the nurses were out of the way or dozing and then slipping out of bed he stalked across the room like a ghost and made for the outer gateway of the hospital  he knew the way having once before been a temporary inmate of the place  he reached the gate undiscovered tripped up the porters heels opened the wicket and fled towards the harbour followed by the porter and a knot of chance passersby  the pursuers swelled into a crowd as he neared the harbour  besides being longlimbed nikel sling was nimble  he distanced his pursuers easily and as we have seen swam off and reached his ship almost as soon as they gained the end of the wharf  the above narration was made much more abruptly and shortly than we have presented it for oars were soon heard in the water and it behoved the poor hunted cook to secrete himself in case they should take a fancy to search the vessel  just as the boat came within a few yards of the ship he hastily went below  boat ahoy shouted tim rokens wot boats that  the men lay on their oars  have you a madman on board your ship inquired the gatekeeper of the hospital whose wrath at the unceremonious treatment he had received had not yet cooled down  no answered rokens laying his arms on the bulwarks and looking down at his questioner with a sly leer no we hant but youve got a madman aboord that boat  whos that inquired the warder who did not at first understand the sarcasm  why yourself to be sure replied rokens an the sooner you takes yourself off an comes to an anchor in a loonatick asylum the better for all parties consarned  no but im in earnest my man  as far as that goes interrupted the imperturbable rokens so am i  the man continued the gatekeeper has run out of the hospital with a smashed head i calclate stark starin mad and gone off the end o the warf into the water  you dont mean it shouted rokens starting with affected surprise now you are a fine fellow aint you to be talkin here an wastin time while a poor fellermortal is bein drownded or has gone and swummed off to seapraps without chart compass or rudder  hallo lads tumble up there  man overboard tumble up tumble up  in less than three minutes halfadozen men sprang up the hatchway hauled up the gig which swung astern tumbled into it and began to pull wildly about the harbour in search of the drowning man  the shouts and commotion roused the crews of the nearest vessels and ere long quite a fleet of boats joined in the search  wos he a big or a little feller inquired rokens panting from his exertions as he swept up to the boat containing the hospital warder round which several of the other boats began to congregate  a big fellow i guess with legs like steeples  he was sloping when they floored him  a thief i expect he must ha bin  a thief echoed rokens in disgust why didnt ye say so at first if hes a thief hes born to be hanged so hes safe and snug aboard his ship long ago ill be bound  goodnight tye friend and better luck next time  a loud laugh greeted the ears of the discomfited warder as the crews of the boats dipped their oars in the water and pulled towards their respective ships  next morning about daybreak little alice dunning came on board her fathers ship accompanied by her two aunts who for once became utterly and publicly regardless of appearances and contemptuous of all propriety as they sobbed on the childs neck and positively refused to be comforted  just as the sun rose and edged the horizon with a gleam of liquid fire the red eric spread her sails and stood out to sea    chapter five  day dreams and adventures among the cloudsa chase a battle and a victory  early morning on the ocean  there is poetry in the idea there is music in the very sound  as there is nothing new under the sun probably a song exists with this or a similar title if not we now recommend it earnestly to musicians  ailie dunning sat on the bulwarks of the red eric holding on tightly by the mizzenshrouds and gazing in openeyed openmouthed inexpressible delight upon the bright calm sea  she was far far out upon the bosom of the atlantic now  seasicknesswhich during the first part of the voyage had changed the warm pink of her pretty face into every imaginable shade of greenwas gone and the hue of health could not now be banished even by the rudest storm  in short she had become a thorough sailor and took special delight in turning her face to windward during the wild storm and drinkingin the howling blast as she held on by the rigid shrouds and laughed at the dashing sprayfor little ailie was not easily frightened  martha and jane dunning had made it their first care to implant in the heart of their charge a knowledge of our saviours love and especially of his tenderness towards and watchful care over the lambs of his flock  besides this little ailie was naturally of a trustful disposition  she had implicit confidence in the strength and wisdom of her father and it never entered into her imagination to dream that it was possible for any evil to befall the ship which he commanded  but although ailie delighted in the storm she infinitely preferred the tranquil beauty and rest of a great calm especially at the hour just before sunrise when the freshness brightness and lightness of the young day harmonised peculiarly with her elastic spirit  it was at this hour that we find her alone upon the bulwarks of the red eric  there was a deep solemn stillness around that irresistibly and powerfully conveyed to her mind the idea of rest  the long gentle undulation of the deep did not in the least detract from this idea  so perfect was the calm that several masses of clouds in the sky which shone with the richest saffron light were mirrored in all their rich details as if in a glass  the faintest possible idea of a line alone indicated in one direction where the water terminated and the sky began  a warm golden haze suffused the whole atmosphere and softened the intensity of the deepblue vault above  there was indeed little variety of object to gaze upononly the water and the sky  but what a world of delight did not ailie find in that vast sky and that pure ocean that reminded her of the sea of glass before the great white throne of which she had so often read in revelation  the towering masses of clouds were so rich and thick that she almost fancied them to be mountains and valleys rocks and plains of golden snow  nay she looked so long and so ardently at the rolling mountain heights in the sky above and their magical counterparts in the sky below that she soon as it were thought herself into fairyland and began a regular journey of adventures therein  such a scene at such an hour is a source of gladsome peaceful delight to the breast of man in every stage of life but it is a source of unalloyed bounding exhilarating romantic unspeakable joy only in the years of childhood when the mind looks hopefully forward and before it has begunas alas it must begin sooner or laterto gaze regretfully back  how long ailie would have sat in motionless delight it is difficult to say  the man at the wheel having nothing to do had forsaken his post and was leaning over the stern either lost in reverie or in a vain effort to penetrate with his vision the blue abyss to the bottom  the members of the watch on deck were either similarly engaged or had stowed themselves away to sleep in quiet corners among blocks and cordage  no one seemed inclined to move or speak and she would probably have sat there immovable for hours to come had not a hand fallen gently on her shoulder and by the magic of its simple contact scattered the bright dreams of fairyland as the fingertouch destroys the splendour of the soapbubble  oh  glynn exclaimed ailie looking round and heaving a deep sigh ive been awayfar far awayyou cant believe how far  away ailie  where have you been asked glynn patting the childs head as he leaned over the gunwale beside her  in fairyland  up in the clouds yonder  out and in and up and down oh youve no idea  just look  she pointed eagerly to an immense towering cloud that rose like a conspicuous landmark in the centre of the landscape of the airy world above  do you see that mountain  yes ailie the one in the middle you mean dont you  yes well  well continued the child eagerly and hurriedly as if she feared to lose the thread of memory that formed the warp and woof of the delicate fabric she had been engaged in weaving well i began there i went in behind it and i met a fairynot really you know but i tried to think i met one so i began to speak to her and then i made her speak to me and her voice was so small and soft and sweet  she had on silver wings and a stara bright star in her foreheadand she carried a wand with a star on the top of it too  so i asked her to take me to see her kingdom and i made her say she wouldand do you know glynn i really felt at last as if she didnt wait for me to tell her what to say but just went straight on answering my questions and putting questions to me in return  wasnt it funny  well we went on and on and onthe fairy and meup one beautiful mountain of snow and down another talking all the time so pleasantly until we came to a great dark cave so i made up my mind to make a lion come out of it but the fairy said no let it be a bear and immediately a great bear came out  wasnt it strange  it really seemed as if the fairy had become real and could do things of her own accord  the child paused at this point and looking with an expression of awe into her companions face saiddo you think glynn that people can think so hard that fairies really come to them  glynn looked perplexed  no ailie i suspect they cantnot because we cant think hard enough but because there are no fairies to come  oh im so sorry replied the child sadly  why inquired glynn  because i love them so muchof course i mean the good ones  i dont like the bad onesthough theyre very useful because theyre nice to kill and punish and make examples of and all that when the good ones catch them  so they are said the youth smiling  i never thought of that before  but go on with your ramble in the clouds  well began ailie but where was i  just going to be introduced to a bear  oh yes wellthe bear walked slowly away and then the fairy called out an elephant and after that a noceros  a noceros interrupted glynn whats that  oh you know very well  a beast with a thick skin hanging in folds and a horn on its nose  ah a rhinocerosi see  well go on ailie  then the fairy told a camel to appear and after that a monkey and then a hippopotamus and they all came out one after another and some of them went away and others began to fight  but the strangest thing of all was that every one of them was so like the pictures of wild beasts that are hanging in my room at home  the elephant too i noticed had his trunk broken exactly the same way as my toy elephants one was  wasnt it odd  it was rather odd replied glynn but where did you go after that  oh then we went on and on again until we came to  its your turn at the wheel lad aint it inquired mr millons coming up at that moment and putting an abrupt termination to the walk in fairyland  it is sir answered glynn springing quickly to the wheel and relieving the man who had been engaged in penetrating the oceans depths  the mate walked forward the released sailor went below and ailie was again left to her solitary meditationsfor she was enough of a sailor now in heart to know that she ought not to talk too much to the steersman even though the weather should be calm and there was no call for his undivided attention to the duties of his post  while nature was thus as it were asleep and the watch on deck were more than half in the same condition there was one individual in the ship whose faculties were in active play whose steam as he himself would have remarked was up  this was the worthy cook nikel sling whose duties called him to his post at the galleyfire at an early hour each day  we have often thought that a cooks life must be one of constant selfdenial and exasperation of spirit  besides the innumerable anxieties in reference to such important matters as boiling over and overboiling being done to a turn or overdone or singed or burned or capsized he has the diurnal misery of being the first human being in his little circle of life to turn out of a morning and must therefore experience the discomfortthe peculiar discomfortof finding things as they were left the night before  any one who does not know what that discomfort is has only to rise an hour before the servants of a household whether at sea or on shore to find out  cook too has generally if not always to light the fire and that especially in frosty weather is not agreeable  moreover cook roasts himself to such an extent and at mealtimes in nine cases out of ten gets into such physical and mental perturbation that he cannot possibly appreciate the luxuries he has been occupied all the day in concocting add to this that he spends all the morning in preparing breakfast all the forenoon in preparing dinner all the afternoon in preparing tea and supper and all the evening in clearing up and perhaps all the night in dreaming of the meals of the following day and mentally preparing breakfast and we think that we have clearly proved the truth of the proposition with which we startednamely that a cooks life must be one of constant selfdenial and exasperation of spirit  but this is by the way and was merely suggested by the fact that while all other creatures were enjoying either partial or complete repose nikel sling was washing out pots and pans and kettles and handling murderouslooking knives and twopronged tormentors with a demoniacal activity that was quite appalling  beside him on a little stool close to the galleyfire sat tim rokens not that mr rokens was coldfar from it  he was to judge from appearances much hotter than was agreeable  but tim had come there and sat down to light his pipe and being rather phlegmatic when not actively employed he preferred to be partially roasted for a few minutes to getting up again  we ought remarked tim rokens puffing at a little black pipe which seemed inclined to be obstinate we ought to be gittin among the fish by this time  manys the one ive seed in them ere seas  i rather guess we should replied the cook pausing the midst of his toils and wiping the perspiration from his forehead with an immense bundle of greasy oakum  but ive seed us keep dodgin about for weeks i have later in the year than this without clappin eyes on a fin what sort o baccy dye smoke rokens  dun know  got it from a spanish smuggler for an old claspknife why  cause it smells like rotten straw an wont improve the victuals guess youd better take yourself off old chap  wot a crossgrained crittur ye are said rokens as he rose to depart  at that moment there was heard a cry that sent the blood tingling to the extremities of every one on board the red eric  thar she blows thar she blows shouted the man in the crowsnest  the crowsnest is a sort of cask or nest fixed at the top of the mainmast of whaleships in which a man is stationed all day during the time the ships are on the fishingground to look out for whales and the cry thar she blows announced the fact that the lookout had observed a whale rise to the surface and blow a spout of steamy water into the air  no conceivable eventunless perhaps the blowingup of the ship itself could have more effectually and instantaneously dissipated the deep tranquillity to which we have more than once referred  had an electric shock been communicated through the ship to each individual the crew could not have been made to leap more vigorously and simultaneously many days before they had begun to expect to see whales  every one was therefore on the qui vive so that when the wellknown signal rang out like a startling peal in the midst of the universal stillness every heart in the ship leaped in unison  had an observant man been seated at the time in the forecastle he would have noticed that from out of the ten or fifteen hammocks that swung from the beams there suddenly darted ten or fifteen pairs of legs which rose to the perpendicular position in order to obtain leverage to fetch way  instantly thereafter the said legs descended and where the feet had been ten or fifteen heads appeared  next moment the men were tumbling up the forehatch to the deck where the watch had already sprung to the boattackles  where away sang out captain dunning who was among the first on deck  off the weather bow sir three points  how far  about two miles  thar she blows  call all hands shouted the captain  starboard watch ahoy roared the mate in that curious hoarse voice peculiar to boatswains of menofwar  tumble up lads tumble up whale in sight  bear a hand my hearties  the summons was almost unnecessary  the starboard watch waswith the exception of one or two uncommonly heavy sleepersalready on deck pulling on its ducks and buckling its belts  thar she breaches thar she blows again came from the crowsnest in the voice of a stentor  well done dick barnes youre the first to raise the oil remarked one of the men implying by the remark that the said dick was fortunate enough to be the first to sight a whale  where away now roared the captain who was in a state of intense excitement  a mile an a half to leeward sir  clear away the boats shouted the captain  masthead ahoy  dye see that whale now  ay ay sir  thar she blows  bear a hand my hearties cried the captain as the men sprang to the boats which were swinging at the davits  get your tubs in  clear your falls  look alive lads  standby to lower  all ready  all ready sir  thar she blows came again from the masthead with redoubled energy spermwhales sir theres a school of em  a school of them whispered ailie who had left her post at the mizzenshrouds and now stood by her fathers side looking on at the sudden hubbub in unspeakable amazement  do whales go to school she said laughing  out of the road ailie my pet cried her father hastily  youll get knocked over  lower away lads lower away  down went the starboard larboard and waistboats as if the falls had been cut and almost before you could wink the men literally tumbled over the side into them took their places and seized their oars  here glynn come with me and ill show you a thing or two said the captain  jump in lad look sharp  glynn instantly followed his commander into the starboard boat and took the aft oar  tim rokens being the harpooner of that boat sat at the bow oar with his harpoons and lances beside him and the whaleline coiled in a tub in the boats head  the captain steered  and now commenced a race that taxed the boats crews to the utmost for it is always a matter keenly contested by the different crews who shall fix the first harpoon in the whale  the larboard boat was steered by mr millons the first mate the waistboat by mr markham the second matethe latter an active man of about fiveandtwenty whose size and physical strength were herculean and whose disposition was somewhat morose and gloomy  now lads give way  thats it thats the way  bend your backs now do bend your backs cried the captain as the three boats sprang from the ships side and made towards the nearest whale with the white foam curling at their bow  several more whales appeared in sight spouting in all directions and the men were wild with excitement  thats it  go it lads shouted mr millons as the waistboat began to creep ahead  lay it on give way  what dye say boys shall we beat em  captain dunning stood in the sternsheets of the starboard boat almost dancing with excitement as he heard these words of encouragement  give way boys he cried  they cant do it  that whales oursso it is  only bend your backs  a steady pull  pull like steamtugs thats it  bend the oars  double em up  smash em in bits do  without quite going the length of the captains last piece of advice the men did their work nobly  they bent their strong backs with a will and strained their sinewy arms to the utmost  glynn in particular to whom the work was new and therefore peculiarly exciting and interesting almost tore the rowlocks out of the boat in his efforts to urge it on and had the oar not been made of the toughest ash there is no doubt that he would have obeyed the captains orders literally and have smashed it in bits  on they flew like racehorses  now one boat gained an inch on the others then it lost ground again as the crew of another put forth additional energy and the three danced over the glassy sea as if the inanimate planks had been suddenly endued with life and inspired with the spirit that stirred the men  a large spermwhale lay about a quarter of a mile ahead rolling lazily in the trough of the sea  towards this the starboard boat now pulled with incredible speed leaving the other two gradually astern  a number of whales rose in various directions  they had got into the midst of a shoal or school of them as the whalemen term it and as several of these were nearer the other boats than the first whale was they diverged towards them  there go flukes cried rokens as the whale raised its huge tail in the air and soundedin other words dived  for a few minutes the men lay on their oars uncertain in what direction the whale would come up again but their doubts were speedily removed by its rising within a few yards of the boat  now rokens cried the captain now for it give him the iron  give way lads spring boys  softly now softly  in another instant the boats bow was on the whales head and rokens buried a harpoon deep in its side  stern all thundered the captain  the men obeyed and the boat was backed off the whale just in time to escape the blow of its tremendous flukes as it dived into the sea the blue depths of which were instantly dyed red with the blood that flowed in torrents from the wound  down it went carrying out the line at a rate that caused the chocks through which it passed to smoke  in a few minutes the line ceased to run out and the whale returned to the surface  it had scarcely showed its nose when the slack of the line was hauled in and a second harpoon was fixed in its body  infuriated with pain the mighty fish gave vent to a roar like a bull rolled half over and lashed the sea with his flukes till all round for many yards it was churned into red slimy foam  then he turned round and dashed off with the speed of a locomotive engine tearing the boat through the waves behind it the water curling up like a white wall round the bows  she wont stand that long muttered glynn proctor as he rested on his oar and looked over his shoulder at the straining line  that she will boy said the captain and more than that if need be youll not be long of havin a chance of greasin your fingers ill warrant  in a few minutes the speed began to slacken and after a time they were able to haul in on the line  when the whale again came to the surface a third harpoon was cleverly struck into it and a spout of blood from its blowhole showed that it was mortally wounded  in throwing the harpoon tim rokens slipped his foot and went down like a stone headforemost into the sea  he came up again like a cork and just as the boat flew past fortunately caught hold of glynn proctors hand  it was well that the grasp was a firm one for the strain on their two arms was awful  in another minute tim was in his place ready with his lance to finish off the whale at its next rise  up it came again foaming breaching and plunging from wave to wave flinging torrents of blood and spray into the air  at one moment he reared his blunt gigantic head high above the sea the next he buried his vast and quivering carcase deep in the gory brine carrying down with him a perfect whirlpool of red foam  then he rose again and made straight for the boat  had he known his own power he might have soon terminated the battle and come off the victor but fortunately he did not  tim rokens received his blunt nose on the point of his lance and drove him back with mingled fury and terror  another advance was made and a successful lancethrust delivered  thats into his life cried the captain  so it is replied rokens  and so it was  a vital part had been struck  for some minutes the huge leviathan lashed and rolled and tossed in the trembling waves in his agony while he spouted up gallons of blood with every throe then he rolled over on his back and lay extended a lifeless mass upon the waters  now lads three cheers for our first whale  hip hip hip  the cheer that followed was given with all the energy and gusto inspired by a first victory and it was repeated again and again and over again before the men felt themselves sufficiently relieved to commence the somewhat severe and tedious labour of towing the carcase to the ship  it was a hard pull for the whale had led them a long chase and as the calm continued those left aboard could not approach to meet the boats the exhausted men were cheered however on getting aboard late that night to find that the other boats had been equally successful each of them having captured a spermwhale    chapter six  disagreeable changessagacious conversations and a terrible accident  a striking and by no means a pleasant change took place in the general appearance of the red eric immediately after the successful chase detailed in the last chapter  before the arrival of the whales the decks had been beautifully clean and white for captain dunning was proud of his ship and fond of cleanliness and order  a few hours after the said arrival the decks were smeared with grease oil and blood and everything from stem to stern became from that day filthy and dirty  this was a sad change to poor ailie who had not imagined it possible that so sudden and disagreeable an alteration could take place  but there was no help for it the duties of the fishery in which they were engaged required that the whales should not only be caught but cut up boiled down to oil and stowed away in the hold in casks  if the scene was changed for the worse a few hours after the cuttingup operations were begun it became infinitely more so when the tryworks were set going and the meltingfires were lighted and huge volumes of smoke begrimed the masts and sails and rigging  it was vain to think of clearing up had they attempted that the men would have been overtasked without any good being accomplished  there was only one course open to those who didnt like it and that wasto grin and bear it  cutting out and trying in are the terms used by whalemen to denote the processes of cutting off the flesh or blubber from the whales carcase and reducing it to oil  at an early hour on the following morning the first of these operations was commenced  ailie went about the decks looking on with mingled wonder interest and disgust  she stepped about gingerly as if afraid of coming in contact with slimy objects and with her nose and mouth screwed up after the fashion of those who are obliged to endure bad smells  the expression of her face under the circumstances was amusing  as for the men they went about their work with relish and total indifference as to consequences  when the largest whale had been hauled alongside ropes were attached to his head and tail and the former was secured near the stern of the ship while the latter was lashed to the bow the cuttingtackle was then attached  this consisted of an arrangement of pulleys depending from the maintop with a large blubberhook at the end thereof  the cutting was commenced at the neck and the hook attached then the men hove on the windlass and while the cutting was continued in a spiral direction round the whales body the tackle raised the mass of flesh until it reached the fixed blocks above  this mass when it could be hauled up no higher was then cut off and stowed away under the name of a blanketpiece  it weighed upwards of a ton  the hook being lowered and again attached the process was continued until the whole was cut off  afterwards the head was severed from the body and hoisted on board in order that the oil contained in the hollow of it might be baled out  from the head of the first whale ten barrels of oil were obtained  the blubber yielded about eighty barrels  when the cutting out was completed and the remnants of bone and flesh were left to the sharks which swarmed round the vessel revelling in their unusually rich banquet the process of trying in commenced trying in is the term applied to the melting of the fat and the stowing of it away in barrels in the form of oil and an uncommonly dirty process it is  the large blanketpieces were cut into smaller portions and put into the trypots which were kept in constant operation  at night the ship had all the appearance of a vessel on fire and the scene on deck was particularly striking and unearthly  one night several of the men were grouped on and around the windlass chatting singing and spinning yarns  ailie dunning stood near them lost in wonder and admiration for the ears and eyes of the child were assailed in a manner never before experienced or dreamed of even in the most romantic mood of cloudwandering  it was a very dark night darker than usual and not a breath of wind ruffled the sea which was like a sheet of undulating glassfor be it remembered there is no such thing at any time as absolute stillness in the ocean  at all times even in the profoundest calm the long slow gentle swell rises and sinks with unceasing regularity like the bosom of a man in deep slumber  dense clouds of black smoke and occasional lurid sheets of flame rose from the tryworks which were situated between the foremast and the mainhatch  the tops of the masts were lost in the curling smoke and the black waves of the sea gleamed and flashed in the red light all round the ship  one man stood in front of the meltingpot pitching in pieces of blubber with a twopronged pitchfork  two comrades stood by the pots stirring up their contents and throwing their figures into wild uncouth attitudes while the fire glared in their greasy faces and converted the front of their entire persons into deep vermilion  the oil was hissing in the trypots the rough weatherbeaten faces of the men on the windlass were smeared and their dirtywhite ducks saturated with oil  the decks were bloodstained huge masses of flesh and blubber lay scattered about sparks flew upwards in splendid showers as the men raked up the fires the decks bulwarks railings tryworks and windlass were covered with oil and slime and glistening in the red glare  it was a terrible murderouslooking scene and filled ailies mind with mingled feelings of wonder disgust and awe as she leaned on a comparatively clean spot near the foremast listening to the men and gazing at the rolling smoke and flames  aint it beautiful said a short fat little seaman named gurney who sat swinging his legs on the end of the windlass and pointed as he spoke with the head of his pipe to a more than usually brilliant burst of sparks and flame that issued that moment from the works  beautiful exclaimed a longlimbed shambling fellow named jim scroggles why that aint the word at all  now i calls it splendiferous  scroggles looked round at his comrades as if to appeal to their judgment as to the fitness of the word but not receiving any encouragement he thrust down the glowing tobacco in his pipe with the end of his little finger and reiterated the word splendiferous with marked emphasis  did ye ever see that word in johnson inquired gurney  whos johnson said scroggles contemptuously  wot dont ye know who johnson is cried gurney in surprise  in course i dont how should i retorted scroggles  theres ever so many johnsons in the world which on em all do you mean  why i mean johnson wot wrote the dikshnarythe great lexikragofer  oh its him you mean is it  in course ive knowed him ever since i wos at school  a general laugh interrupted the speaker  at school cried nickel sling who approached the group at that moment with a carving knife in his handhe seldom went anywhere without an instrument of office in his handat school  wal now that beats creation  if ye wos im sartin ye only larned to forgit all ye orter to have remembered  id take a bet now ye wosnt at school as long as ive been settin on this here windlass  yer about right sling it ud be unpossible for me to be as long as you anywhere cause everybody knows im only five fut two whereas youre six fut four  hear hear shouted dick barnesa man with a huge black beard who the reader may perhaps remember was the first to raise the oil itll be long before you make another joke like that gurney  come now give us a song gurney do theres the capns darter standin by the foremast awaitin to hear ye  give us long long ago  ah thats it give us a song cried the men  come theres a good fellow  well its so long ago since i sung that song shipmates replied gurney that ive bin and forgot it but tim rokens knows it wheres rokens  hes in the watch below  in sea parlance the men whose turn it is to take rest after their long watch on deck are somewhat facetiously said to belong to the watch below  ah thats a pity so we cant have that ere partickler song  but ill give ye another if ye dont object  no no  all right go ahead gurney  is there a chorus to it  ay in course there is  wots a song without a chorus  wots plumduff without the plums  wots a ship without a elm  its my opinion shipmates that a song without a chorus is no better than it should be  its wus nor nothin  it puts them wot listens in the blues an the man wot sings into the stewsan sarve him right  i wouldnt no i wouldnt give the fagend o nothin mixed in bucket o salt water for a song without a chorusthats flat so here goes  having delivered himself of these opinions in an extremely vigorous manner and announced the fact that he was about to begin gurney cleared his throat and drew a number of violent puffs from his pipe in quick succession in order to kindle that instrument into a glow which would last through the first verse and the commencement of the chorus this he knew was sufficient for the men when once fairly started on the chorus would infallibly go on to the end with or without his assistance and would therefore afford him time for a few restorative whiffs  it haint got no name lads  never mind gurneyall rightfire away    oh i once knowd a man as hadnt got a nose   an this is how he come to hadnt   one cold winter night he went and got it froze   by the pain he was wellnigh maddend   chorus  wellnigh maddend   by the pain he was wellnigh maddend    next day it swoll up as big as my head   an it turnd like a piece of putty   it kivered up his mouth oh yes so it did   so he could not smoke his cutty   chorus  smoke his cutty   so he could not smoke his cutty    next day it grew black and the next day blue   an tough as a junk of leather   oh he yelled so he did fit to pierce ye through   an then it fell off altogether   chorus  fell off altogether   an then it fell off altogether    but the morial is wot youve now got to hear   an its goodas sure as a gun   an youll never forget it my messmates dear   for this song it haint got none   chorus  haint got none   for this song it haint got none  the applause that followed this song was most enthusiastic and evidently gratifying to gurney who assumed a modest deprecatory air as he proceeded to light his pipe which had been allowed to go out at the third verse the performer having become so engrossed in his subject as to have forgotten the interlude of puffs at that point  well sung gurney  who made it inquired phil briant an irishman who besides being a jackofalltrades and an ablebodied seaman was at that time actingassistant to the cook and steward the lattera half spaniard and half negro of californian extractionbeing unwell  im bound not to tell replied gurney with a conscious air  ah then yer right my boy for its below the average entirely  come phil none o yer chaff cried dick barnes that song desarves somethin arter it  suppose now phil that you wos to go below and fetch the breadkid  couldnt do it replied phil looking solemn on no account wotiver  oh nonsense why not  cause its unpossible  why if i did sure that surly compound o all sorts o human blood would pitch into me with the carvinknife  who  tarquin cried dick barnes naming the steward  ay sure enough that sametarquins his name an its kuriously befittin the haythen for of all the crossgrained mixtures o buffalo bear bandicoot and crackadile i iver seed hes out o sight  did i hear any one mention my name inquired the steward himself who came aft at that moment  he was a wild spanishlike fellow with a handsomeenough figure and a swart countenance that might have been goodlooking but for the thickish lips and nose and the bad temper that marked it  since getting into the tropics the sailors had modified their costumes considerably and as each man had in some particular allowed himself a slight play of fancy their appearance when grouped together was varied and picturesque  most of them wore no shoes and the caps of some were to say the least peculiar  tarquin wore a broadbrimmed straw hat with a conical crown and a red silk sash tied round his waist  yes tarquin replied barnes we wos engaged in makin freeaneasy remarks on you and phil briant there gave us to understand that you wouldnt let us have the breadkid up  now its my opinion you aint goin to be so hard on us as that you will let us have it up to comfort our hearts on this fine night wont you  the steward whose green visage showed that he was too ill to enter into a dispute at that time turned on his heel and walked aft remarking that they might eat the bottom out o the ship for all he cared  there now you misbemannered patlander go and get it or well throw you overboard cried scroggles twisting his long limbs awkwardly as he shifted his position on the windlass  now then shipmates dont go for to ax it said briant remaining immovable  dont i know wots best for ye  let me spaake to ye now did any of ye iver study midsin  no cried several with a laugh  sure i thought not continued phil with a patronising air or yed niver ask for the breadkid out o saisin  now i was in the medical way meself wanceay ye may laugh but its thruei wos prentice to a pothecary an ive mixed up more midsins than would pisen the whole popilation of owld irelandbarrin the praists av coorse  and didnt i hear the convarse o all the doctors in the place  and wasnt the word alwaysbe rigglar with yer mailsdont ait avic more nor three times a day and not too much now  be sparin  hah ye longwinded grampus interrupted dick barnes impatiently an warnt the doctors right  three times a day for sick folk and six timesor morefor them wots well  hear hear cried the others while two of them seized briant by the neck and thrust him forcibly towards the afterhatch  bring up the kid now an if ye come without it look out for squalls  och worse luck sighed the misused assistant as he disappeared  in a few minutes phil returned with the kid which was a species of tray filled with broken seabiscuit which when afloat goes by the name of bread  this was eagerly seized for the appetites of sailors are always sharp except immediately after meals  a quantity of the broken biscuit was put into a strainer and fried in whaleoil and the men sat round the kid to enjoy their luxurious feast and relate their adventuresall of which were more or less marvellous and many of them undoubtedly true  the more one travels in this world of ours and the more one reads of the adventures of travellers upon whose narratives we can place implicit confidence the more we find that men do not now require as they did of old to draw upon their imaginations for marvellous tales of wild romantic adventure in days gone by travellers were few foreign lands were almost unknown  not many books were written and of the few that were very few were believed  in the present day men of undoubted truthfulness have roamed far and wide over the whole world their books are numbered by hundreds and much that was related by ancient travellers but not believed has now been fully corroborated  more than that it is now known that men have every where received as true statements which modern discovery has proved to be false and on the other hand they have often refused to believe what is now ascertained to be literally true  we would suggest in passing that a lesson might be learned from this factnamely that we ought to receive a statement in regard to a foreign land not according to the probability or the improbability of the statement itself but according to the credibility of him who makes it  ailie dunning had a trustful disposition she acted on neither of the above principles  she believed all she heard poor thing and therefore had a head pretty well stored with mingled fact and nonsense  while the men were engaged with their meal dr hopley came on deck and found her leaning over the stern looking down at the waves which shone with sparkling phosphorescent light  an almost imperceptible breeze had sprung up and the way made by the vessel as she passed through the water was indicated by a stream of what appeared lambent blue flame  looking at the fish ailie as usual said the doctor as he came up what are they saying to you tonight  im not looking at the fish answered ailie im looking at the fireno not the fire papa said it wasnt fire but its so like it i can scarcely call it anything else  what is it doctor  it is called phosphorescence replied the doctor leaning over the bulwarks and looking down at the fiery serpent that seemed as if it clung to the ships rudder  but i dare say you dont know what that means  you know what fireflies and glowworms are  oh yes ive often caught them  well there are immense numbers of very small and very thin jellylike creatures in the sea so thin and so transparent that they can scarcely be observed in the water  these medusae as they are called possess the power of emitting light similar to that of the firefly  in short ailie they are the fireflies and glowworms of the ocean  the child listened with wonder and for some minutes remained silent before she could again speak there occurred one of those incidents which are generally spoken of as most unexpected and sudden but which nevertheless are the result of natural causes and might have been prevented by means of a little care  the wind as we have said was light so light that it did not distend the sails the boom of the spankersail hung over the stern and the spankerbraces lay slack along the seat on which ailie and the doctor knelt  a little gust of wind came it was not stronga mere puff but the man at the wheel was not attending to his duty the puff light as it was caused the spanker to jibethat is to fly over from one side of the ship to the otherthe heavy boom passed close over the steersmans head as he cried look out  the braces tautened and in so doing they hurled dr hopley violently to the deck and tossed ailie dunning over the bulwarks into the sea  it happened at that moment that glynn proctor chanced to step on deck  hallo whats wrong cried the youth springing forward catching the doctor by the coat as he was about to spring overboard and pulling him violently back under the impression that he was deranged  the doctor pointed to the sea and with a look of horror gasped the word ailie  in an instant glynn released his hold plunged over the stern of the ship and disappeared in the waves    chapter seven  the rescuepreparations for a storm  it is impossible to convey by means of words an adequate idea of the terrible excitement and uproar that ensued on board the red eric after the events narrated in the last chapter  from those on deck who witnessed the accident there arose a cry so sharp that it brought the whole crew from below in an instant  but there was no confusion  the men were well trained  each individual knew his post and whalemen are accustomed to a sudden and hasty summons  the peculiarity of the present one it is true told every man in an instant that something was wrong but each mechanically sprang to his post while one or two shouted to ascertain what had happened or to explain  but the moment captain dunnings voice was heard there was perfect silence  clear away the starboardquarterboat he cried in a deep firm tone  ay ay sir  standby the fallslower away  there was no occasion to urge the sailors they sprang to the work with the fervid celerity of men who knew that life or death depended on their speed  in less time than it takes to relate the boat was leaping over the long ocean swell as it had never yet done in chase of the whale and in a few seconds passed out of the little circle of light caused by the fires and into the gloom that surrounded the ship  the wind had been gradually increasing during all these proceedings and although no time had been lost and the vessel had been immediately brought up into the wind ailie and glynn were left struggling in the dark sea a long way behind ere the quarterboat could be lowered and now that it was fairly afloat there was still the danger of its failing to hit the right direction of the objects of which it was in search  after leaping over the stern glynn proctor the moment he rose to the surface gave a quick glance at the ship to make sure of her exact position and then struck out in a straight line astern for he knew that wherever ailie fell there she would remain struggling until she sank  glynn was a fast and powerful swimmer  he struck out with desperate energy and in a few minutes the ship was out of sight behind him  then he paused suddenly and letting his feet sink until he attained an upright position trod the water and raised himself breasthigh above the surface at the same time listening intently for he began to fear that he might have overshot his mark  no sound met his straining ear save the sighing of the breeze and the ripple of the water as it lapped against his chest  it was too dark to see more than a few yards in any direction  glynn knew that each moment lost rendered his chance of saving the child terribly slight  he shouted ailie in a loud agonising cry and swam forward again with redoubled energy continuing the cry from time to time and raising himself occasionally to look round him  the excitement of his mind and the intensity with which it was bent on the one great object rendered him at first almost unobservant of the flight of time  but suddenly the thought burst upon him that fully ten minutes or a quarter of an hour had elapsed since ailie fell overboard and that no one who could not swim could exist for half that time in deep water he shrieked with agony at the thought and fancying that he must have passed the child he turned round and swam desperately towards the point where he supposed the ship lay  then he thought what if i have turned just as i was coming up with her  so he turned about again but as the hopelessness of his efforts once more occurred to him he lost all presence of mind and began to shout furiously and to strike out wildly in all directions  in the midst of his mad struggles his hand struck an object floating near him  instantly he felt his arm convulsively grasped and the next moment he was seized round the neck in a gripe so violent that it almost choked him  he sank at once and the instinct of selfpreservation restored his presence of mind  with a powerful effort he tore ailie from her grasp and quickly raised himself to the surface where he swam gently with his left hand and held the struggling child at armslength with his right  the joy caused by the knowledge that she had still life to struggle infused new energy into glynns wellnigh exhausted frame and he assumed as calm and cheerful a tone as was possible under the circumstances when he exclaimedailie ailie dont struggle dear ill save you if you keep quiet  ailie was quiet in a moment  she felt in the terror of her young heart an almost irresistible desire to clutch at glynns neck but the wellknown voice reassured her and her natural tendency to place blind implicit confidence in others served her in this hour of need for she obeyed his injunctions at once  now dear said glynn with nervous rapidity dont grasp me else we shall sink  trust me  ill never let you go  will you trust me  ailie gazed wildly at her deliverer through her wet and tangled tresses and with great difficulty gasped the word yes while she clenched the garments on her labouring bosom with her little hands as if to show her determination to do as she was bid  glynn at once drew her towards him and rested her head on his shoulder the child gave vent to a deep broken sigh of relief and threw her right arm round his neck but the single word ailie uttered in a remonstrative tone caused her to draw it quickly back and again grasp her breast  all this time glynn had been supporting himself by that process wellknown to swimmers as treading water and had been so intent upon his purpose of securing the child that he failed to observe the light of a lantern gleaming in the far distance on the sea as the boat went ploughing hither and thither the men almost breaking the oars in their desperate haste and the captain standing in the sternsheets pale as death holding the light high over his head and gazing with a look of unutterable agony into the surrounding gloom  glynn now saw the distant light and exerting his voice to the utmost gave vent to a prolonged cry  ailie looked up in her companions face while he listened intently  the moving light became stationary for a moment and a faint reply floated back to them over the waves  again glynn raised his voice to the utmost and the cheer that came back told him that he had been heard  but the very feeling of relief at the prospect of immediate deliverance had wellnigh proved fatal to them both for glynn experienced a sudden relaxation of his whole system and he felt as if he could not support himself and his burden a minute longer  ailie he said faintly but quickly we shall be saved if you obey at once if not we shall be drowned  lay your two hands on my breast and let yourself sink down to the very lips  glynn turned on his back as he spoke spread out his arms and legs to their full extent let his head fall back until it sank leaving only his lips nose and chin above water and lay as motionless as if he had been dead  and now came poor ailies severest trial  when she allowed herself to sink and felt the water rising about her ears and lipping round her mouth terror again seized upon her but she felt glynns breast heaving under her hands so she raised her eyes to heaven and prayed silently to him who is the only true deliverer from dangers  her selfpossession was restored and soon she observed the boat bearing down on the spot and heard the men as they shouted to attract attention  ailie tried to reply but her tiny voice was gone and her soul was filled with horror as she saw the boat about to pass on  in her agony she began to struggle  this roused glynn who had rested sufficiently to have recovered a slight degree of strength  he immediately raised his head and uttered a wild cry as he grasped ailie again with his arm  the rowers paused the light of the lantern gleamed over the sea and fell upon the spray tossed up by glynn  next moment the boat swept up to themand they were saved  the scene that followed baffles all description  captain dunning fell on his knees beside ailie who was too much exhausted to speak and thanked god in the name of jesus christ again and again for her deliverance  a few of the men shouted others laughed hysterically and some wept freely as they crowded round their shipmate who although able to sit up could not speak except in disjointed sentences  glynn however recovered quickly and even tried to warm himself by pulling an oar before they regained the ship but ailie remained in a state of partial stupor and was finally carried on board and down into the cabin and put between warm blankets by her father and dr hopley  meanwhile glynn was hurried forward and dragged down into the forecastle by the whole crew who seemed unable to contain themselves for joy and expressed their feelings in ways that would have been deemed rather absurd on ordinary occasions  change yer clos avic at wance cried phil briant who was the most officious and violent in his offers of assistance to glynn  och but its wet ye are darlin  give me a howld  this last request had reference to the right leg of glynns trousers which happened to be blue cloth of a rather thin quality and which therefore clung to his limbs with such tenacity that it was a matter of the utmost difficulty to get them off  thats your sort phila long pull and a strong pull and a pull all together cried dick barnes hurrying forward with a bundle of garments in his arms  heres dry clos for him  have a care phil shouted gurney who stood behind glynn and held him by the shoulders itll give way  niver a taste replied the reckless irishman  but the result proved that gurney was right for the words had scarce escaped his lips when the garment parted at the knee and phil briant went crashing back among a heap of tin pannikins pewter plates blocks and cordage  a burst of laughter followed of course but the mens spirits were too much roused to be satisfied with this so they converted the laugh into a howl and prolonged it into a cheer as if their comrade had successfully performed a difficult and praiseworthy deed  hold on lads cried glynn  im used up i cant stand it  here you are shouted nickel sling pushing the men violently aside and holding a steaming tumbler of hot brandyandwater under glynns nose  down with it thats the stuff to get up the steam fit to bust yer biler i calclate  the men looked on for a moment in silence while glynn drank as if they expected some remarkable chemical change to take place in his constitution  och aint it swate inquired phil briant who having gathered himself up now stood rubbing his shoulder with the fragment of the riven garment  av i wasnt a taytotaler its meself would like some of that same  in a few minutes our hero was divested of his wet garments rubbed perfectly dry by his kind messmates and clad in dry costume after which he felt almost as well as if nothing unusual had happened to him the men meanwhile cut their jokes at him or at each other as they stood round and watched assisted or retarded the process  as for tim rokens who had been in the boat and witnessed the rescue he stood gazing steadfastly at glynn without uttering a word keeping his thumbs the while hooked in the armholes of his vest and his legs very much apart  by degreesas he thought on what had passed and the narrow escape poor little ailie had had and the captains tears things he had never seen the captain shed before and had not believed the captain to have possessedas he pondered these things we say his knotty visage began to work and his castiron chin began to quiver and his shaggy brows contracted and his nose besides becoming purple began to twist as if it were an independent member of his face and he came in short to that climax which is familiarly expressed by the words bursting into tears  but if anybody thinks the act on the part of tim rokens bore the smallest resemblance to the generally received idea of that sorrowful affection anybody we take leave to tell him is very much mistaken the bold harpooner did it thushe suddenly unhooked his right hand from the armhole of his vest and gave his right thigh a slap which produced a crack that would have made a small pistol envious then he uttered a succession of ferocious roars that might have quite well indicated pain or grief or madness or a drunken cheer and unhooking the left hand he doubled himself up and thrust both knuckles into his eyes the knuckles were wet when he pulled them out of his eyes but he dried them on his pantaloons bolted up the hatchway and rushing up to the man at the wheel demanded in a voice of thunderhows er head  sousoueastandbyeast replied the man in some surprise  sousoueastandbyeast repeated mr rokens in a savage growl of authority as if he were nothing less than the admiral of the channel fleet  thats two points and a half off yer course sir  luff luff youyou  at this point tim rokens turned on his heel and began to walk up and down the deck as calmly as if nothing whatever had occurred to disturb his equanimity  the captain wants glynn proctor said the second mate looking down the forehatch  ay ay sir answered glynn ascending and going aft  ailie wants to see you glynn my boy said captain dunning as the former entered the cabin and i want to speak to you myselfto thank you glynn  ah lad you cant know what a fathers heart feels whengo to her boy  he grasped the youths hand and gave it a squeeze that revealed infinitely more of his feelings than could have been done by words  glynn returned the squeeze and opening the door of ailies private cabin entered and sat down beside her crib  oh glynn i want to speak to you i want to thank you  i love you so much for jumping into the sea after me began the child eagerly and raising herself on one elbow while she held out her hand  ailie interrupted glynn taking her hand and holding up his finger to impose silence you obeyed me in the water and now i insist on your obedience out of the water  if you dont ill leave you youre still too weak to toss about and speak loud in this way  lie down my pet  glynn kissed her forehead and forced her gently back on the pillow  well ill be good but dont leave me yet glynn  im much better indeed i feel quite strong  oh it was good of you  there you go again  i love you said ailie  ive no objection to that replied glynn but dont excite yourself but tell me ailie how was it that you managed to keep afloat so long the more i think of it the more i am filled with amazement and in fact im half inclined to think that god worked a miracle in order to save you  i dont know said ailie looking very grave and earnest as she always did when our makers name happened to be mentioned  does god work miracles still  men say not replied glynn  im sure i dont quite understand what a miracle is continued ailie although aunt martha and aunt jane have often tried to explain it to me  is floating on your back a miracle  no said glynn laughing it isnt  well thats the way i was saved  you know ever since i can remember i have bathed with aunt martha and aunt jane and they taught me how to floatand its so nice you cant think how nice it isand i can do it so easily now that i never get frightened  but ohwhen i was tossed over the side of the ship into the sea i was frightened just  i dont think i ever got such a fright  and i splashed about for some time and swallowed some water but i got upon my back somehow  i cant tell how it was for i was too frightened to try to do anything  but when i found myself floating as i used to do long ago i felt my fear go away a little and i shut my eyes and prayed and then it went away altogether and i felt quite sure you would come to save me and you did come glynn and i know it was god who sent you  but i became a good deal frightened again when i thought of the sharks and  now ailie stop said glynn  youre forgetting your promise and exciting yourself again  so she is and i must order you out master glynn said the doctor opening the door and entering at that moment  glynn rose patted the childs head and nodded cheerfully as he left the little cabin  the captain caught him as he passed and began to reiterate his thanks when their conversation was interrupted by the voice of mr millons who put his head in at the skylight and saidsquall coming sir i think  so so cried the captain running upon deck  ive been looking for it  call all hands mr millons and take in sailevery rag except the stormtrysails  glynn hurried forward and in a few minutes every man was at his post the sails were furled and every preparation made for a severe squall for captain dunning knew that that part of the coast of africa off which the red eric was then sailing was subject to sudden squalls which though usually of short duration were sometimes terrific in their violence  is everything snug mr millons  all snug sir  then let the men standby till its over  the night had grown intensely dark but away on the starboardquarter the heavens appeared of an ebony blackness that was quite appalling this appearance that rose on the sky like a shroud of crape quickly spread upwards until it reached the zenith  then a few gleams of light seemed to illuminate it very faintly and a distant hissing noise was heard  a dead calm surrounded the ship which lay like a log on the water and the crew knowing that nothing more could be done in the way of preparation awaited the bursting of the storm with uneasy feelings  in a few minutes its distant roar was heardlike muttered thunder  on it came with a steady continuous roar as if chaos were about to be restored and the crashing wreck of elements were being hurled in mad fury against the yet unshattered portions of creation  another second and the ship was on her beamends and the sea and sky were white as milk as the wind tore up the waves and beat them flat and whirled away broad sheets of driving foam    chapter eight  the storm and its results  although the red eric was thrown on her beamends or nearly so by the excessive violence of the squall the preparations to meet it had been so well made that she righted again almost immediately and now flew before the wind under bare poles with a velocity that was absolutely terrific  ailie had been nearly thrown out of her berth when the ship lay over and now when she listened to the water hissing and gurgling past the little port that lighted her cabin and felt the staggering of the vessel as burst after burst of the hurricane almost tore the masts out of her she lay trembling with anxiety and debating with herself whether or not she ought to rise and go on deck  captain dunning well knew that his child would be naturally filled with fear for this was the first severe squall she had ever experienced so as he could not quit the deck himself he called glynn proctor to him and sent him down with a message  well ailie said glynn cheerfully as he opened the door and peeped in how dye get on dear  the captain has sent me to say that the worst o this blast is over and youve nothing to fear  i am glad to hear that glynn replied the child holding out her hand while a smile lighted up her face and smoothed out the lines of anxiety from her brow  come and sit by me glynn and tell me what like it is  i wish so much that i had been on deck  was it grand glynn  it was uncommonly grand it was even terriblebut i cannot sit with you more than a minute else my shipmates will say that im skulking  skulking glynn  what is that  why itsits shirking work you know said glynn somewhat puzzled  ailie laughed  but you forget that i dont know what shirking means you must explain that too  how terribly green you are ailie  no am i exclaimed the child in some surprise  what can have done it  im not sick  glynn laughed outright at this and then proceeded to explain the meaning of the slang phraseology he had used  green you must know means ignorant he began  how funny  i wonder why  well i dont know exactly  perhaps its because when a fellows asked to answer questions he dont understand hes apt to turn either blue with rage or yellow with fearor both and that you know would make him green  ive heard it said that it implies a comparison of men to plantsvery young ones you know that are just up just born as it were and have not had much experience of life are green of coursebut i like my own definition best  it may perhaps be scarcely necessary to remark that our hero was by no means singular in this little preference of his own definition to that of any one else  well and what does skulking mean and shirking work persisted ailie  it means hiding so as to escape duty my little catechist but  hallo  glynn glynn proctor roared the first mate from the deckwheres that fellow  skulking ill be bound  lay aloft there and shake out the foretopsail  look alive  ay ay sir was the ready response as the men sprang to obey  there you have it now ailie explained and illustrated cried glynn starting up  here i am at this minute in a snug dry berth chatting to you and in half a minute more ill be out on the end o the foreyard holding on for bare life with the wind fit to tear off my jacket and blow my ducks into ribbons and the rain and spray dashing all over me fit to blot me out altogether  theres a pretty little idea to turn over in your mind ailie while im away  glynn closed the door at the last word and as he had prophesied was within half a minute in the unenviable position above referred to  the force of the squall was already broken and the men were busy setting closereefed topsails but the rain that followed the squall bid fair to blot them out as glynn said altogether  it came down not in drops but in masses which were caught up by the fierce gale and mingled with the spray and hurled about and on with such violent confusion that it seemed as though the whole creation were converted into wind and water and had engaged in a war of extermination the central turmoil of which was the red eric  but the good ship held on nobly  although not a fast sailer she was an excellent seaboat and danced on the billows like a seamew  the squall however was not over  before the topsails had been set many minutes it burst on them again with redoubled fury and the maintopsail was instantly blown into ribbons  glynn and his comrades were once more ordered aloft to furl the remaining sails but before this could be done the foretopmast was carried away and in falling it tore away the jibboom also  at the same moment a tremendous sea came rolling on astern in the uncertain light it looked like a dark moving mountain that was about to fall on them  luff luff a littlesteady roared the captain who saw the summit of the wave toppling over the stern and who fully appreciated the danger of being pooped which means having a wave launched upon the quarterdeck  steady it is replied the steersman  look out shouted the captain and several of the men simultaneously  every one seized hold of whatever firm object chanced to be within reach next moment the black billow fell like an avalanche on the poop and rushing along the decks swept the waistboat and all the loose spars into the sea  the ship staggered under the shock and it seemed to every one on deck that she must inevitably founder but in a few seconds she recovered the water gushed from the scuppers and sides in cataracts and once more they drove swiftly before the gale  in about twenty minutes the wind moderated and while some of the men went aloft to clear away the wreck of the topsails and make all snug others went below to put on dry garments  that was a narrow escape mr millons remarked the captain as he stood by the starboardrails  it was sir replied the mate  its a good job too sir that none o the ands were washed overboard  it is indeed mr millons weve reason to be thankful for that but im sorry to see that weve lost our waistboat  weve lost our spare sticks sir said the mate with a lugubrious face while he wrung the brine out of his hair and i fear weve nothink left fit to make a noo foretopmast or a jibboom  true mr millons we shall have to run to the nearest port on the african coast to refit luckily we are not very far from it  meanwhile tell mr markham to try the well it is possible that we may have sprung a leak in all this straining and see that the wreck of the foretopmast is cleared away  i shall go below and consult the chart if any change in the weather takes place call me at once  yes sir answered the mate as he placed his hand to windward of his mouth in order to give full force to the terrific tones in which he proceeded to issue his captains commands  captain dunning went below and looking into ailies berth nodded his wet head several times and smiled with his damp visage benignlywhich acts however well meant and kindly they might be were under the circumstances quite unnecessary seeing that the child was sound asleep  the captain then dried his head and face with a towel about as rough as the mainsail of a seventyfour and with a violence that would have rubbed the paint off the figurehead of the red eric  then he sat down to his chart and having pondered over it for some minutes he went to the foot of the companionladder and roared uplay the course nornoreastandbynorhalfnor mr millons  to which mr millons replied in an ordinary tone ay ay sir and then roaredlay her head nornoreastandbynorhalfnor in an unnecessarily loud and terribly fierce tone of voice to the steersman as if that individual were in the habit of neglecting to obey orders and required to be perpetually threatened in what may be called a tone of implication  the steersman answered in what to a landsman would have sounded as a rather amiable and forgiving tone of voicenornoreastandbynorhalfnor it is sir and thereupon the direction of the ships head was changed and the red eric according to tim rokens bowled along with a stiff breeze on the quarter at the rate of ten knots for the west coast of africa    chapter nine  rambles on shore and strange things and ceremonies witnessed there  variety is charming  no one laying claim to the smallest amount of that very uncommon attribute commonsense will venture to question the truth of that statement  variety is so charming that men and women boys and girls are always all of them hunting after it  to speak still more emphatically on this subject we venture to affirm that it is an absolute necessity of animal nature  were any positive and shortsighted individual to deny this position and sit down during the remainder of his life in a chair and look straight before him in order to prove that he could live without variety he would seek it in change of position  if he did not do that he would seek it in change of thought  if he did not do that he would die  fully appreciating this great principle of our nature and desiring to be charmed with a little variety tim rokens and phil briant presented themselves before captain dunning one morning about a week after the storm and asked leave to go ashore  the reader may at first think the men were mad but he will change his opinion when we tell him that four days after the storm in question the red eric had anchored in the harbour formed by the mouth of one of the rivers on the african coast where white men trade with the natives for barwood and ivory and where they also carry on that horrible traffic in negroes the existence of which is a foul disgrace to humanity  go ashore echoed captain dunning  why if you all go on at this rate well never get ready for sea  however you may go but dont wander too far into the interior and look out for elephants and wild men o the woods boyskeep about the settlements  ay ay sir and thankee replied the two men touching their caps as they retired  please sir i want to go too said glynn proctor approaching the captain  what more wanting to go ashore  yes and so do i cried ailie running forward and clasping her fathers rough hand i did enjoy myself so much yesterday that i must go on shore again today and i must go with glynn  hell take such famous care of me now wont you let me go papa  upon my word this looks like preconcerted mutiny  however i dont mind if i do let you go but have a care glynn that you dont lose sight of her for a moment and keep to the shore and the settlements ive no notion of allowing her to be swallowed by an alligator or trampled on by an elephant or run away with by a gorilla  never fear sir  you may trust me ill take good care of her  with a shout of delight the child ran down to the cabin to put on her bonnet and quickly reappeared carrying in her hand a basket which she purposed to fill with a valuable collection of plants minerals and insects  these she meant to preserve and carry home as a surprise to aunts martha and jane both of whom were passionately fond of mineralogy delighted in botany luxuriated in entomology doted on conchology and raved about geologyall of which sciences they studied superficially and specimens of which they collected and labelled beautifully and stowed away carefully in a little cabinet which they termed not jocularly but seriously their bureau of omnology  it was a magnificent tropical morning when the boat left the side of the red eric and landed glynn and ailie tim rokens and phil briant on the wharf that ran out from the yellow beach of the harbour in which their vessel lay  the sun had just risen  the air was cool comparatively and motionless so that the ocean lay spread out like a pure mirror and revealed its treasures and mysteries to a depth of many fathoms  the sky was intensely blue and the sun intensely bright while the atmosphere was laden with the delightful perfume of the woodsa perfume that is sweet and pleasant to those long used to it how much more enchanting to nostrils rendered delicately sensitive by long exposure to the scentless gales of ocean  one of the sailors who had shown symptoms of weakness in the chest during the voyage had begged to be discharged and left ashore at this place  he could ill be spared but as he was fit for nothing the captain agreed to his request and resolved to procure a negro to act as cooks assistant in the place of phil briant who was too useful a man to remain in so subordinate a capacity  the sick man was therefore sent on shore in charge of tim rokens  on landing they were met by a portuguese slavedealer an american trader a dozen or two partiallyclothed negroes and a large concourse of utterly naked little negro children who proved to demonstration that they were of the same nature and spirit with white children despite the colour of their skins by taking intense delight in all the amusements practised by the fairskinned juveniles of more northern landsnamely scampering after each other running and yelling indulging in mischief spluttering in the waters rolling on the sand staring at the strangers making impudent remarks and punching each others heads  if the youth of america ever wish to prove that they are of a distinct race from the sable sons of africa their only chance is to become paragons of perfection and give up all their wicked ways  oh exclaimed ailie half amused half frightened as glynn lifted her out of the boat oh how funny  dont they look so very like as if they were all painted black  goodday to you gentlemen cried the trader as he approached the landing  got your foretop damaged i see  plenty of sticks here to mend it  be glad to assist you in any way i can  was away in the woods when you arrived else id have come to offer sooner  the trader who was a tall sallow man in a blue cotton shirt sailors trousers and a broadbrimmed straw hat addressed himself to glynn whose gentlemanly manner led him to believe he was in command of the party  thank you replied glynn weve got a little damagelost a good boat too but well soon repair the mast  we have come ashore just now however mainly for a stroll  ay put in phil briant who was amusing the black childrenand greatly delighting himself by nodding and smiling ferociously at them with a view to making a favourable impression on the natives of this new country  ay sir an sure weve comed to land a sick shipmate who wants to see the doctor uncommon  have ye sich an article in these parts  no not exactly replied the trader but i do a little in that way myself perhaps i may manage to cure him if he comes up to my house  we wants a nigger too said rokens who while the others were talking was extremely busy filling his pipe  at this remark the trader looked knowing  oh he said thats your game is it  theres your man there ive nothing to do with such wares  he pointed to the portuguese slavedealer as he spoke  seeing himself thus referred to the slavedealer came forward hat in hand and made a polite bow  he was a man of extremely forbidding aspect  a long dark visage which terminated in a black peaked beard and was surmounted by a tallcrowned broadbrimmed straw hat stood on the top of a long rawboned thin sinewy shrivelled but powerful frame that had battled with and defeated all the fevers and other diseases peculiar to the equatorial regions of africa  he wore a short lightcoloured cotton jacket and pantaloonsthe latter much too short for his limbs but the deficiency was more than made up by a pair of wellington boots  his natural look was a scowl  his assumed smile of politeness was so unnatural that tim rokens thought as he gazed at him he would have preferred greatly to have been frowned at by him even ailie who did not naturally think ill of any one shrank back as he approached and grasped glynns hand more firmly than usual  goot morning gentlmn  you was vish for git nigger i suppose  well we wos replied tim with a faint touch of sarcasm in his tone can you get un for us  yees sare as many you please replied the slavedealer with a wink that an ogre might have envied  have great many ob em stay vid me always  ah then they must be fond o bad company remarked briant in an undertone to live along wid such a alligator  well then said tim rokens who had completed the filling of his pipe and was now in the full enjoyment of it lets see the feller an ill strike a bargain with him if he seems a likely chap  you will have strike de bargin vid me said the dealer  i vill charge you ver leetle suppose you take full cargo  the whole party who were ignorant of the mans profession started at this remark and looked at the dealer in surprise  wot exclaimed tim rokens withdrawing his pipe from his lips do you sell niggers  yees to be surely replied the man with a peculiarly saturnine smile  a slavedealer exclaimed briant clenching his fists  even so sare  at this briant uttered a shout and throwing forward his clenched fists in a defiant attitude exclaimed between his set teeth  arrah come on  most men have peculiarities  phil briant had many but his most striking peculiarity and that which led him frequently into extremely awkward positions was a firm belief that his special callingin an amateur point of viewwas the redressing of wrongsnot wrongs of a particular class or wrongs of an excessively glaring and offensive nature but all wrongs whatsoever  it mattered not to phil whether the wrong had to be righted by force of argument or force of arms  he considered himself an accomplished practitioner in both lines of businessand in regard to the latter his estimate of his powers was not very much too high for he was a broadshouldered deepchested longarmed fellow and had acquired a scientific knowledge of boxing under a celebrated bruiser at the expense of a few hardearned shillings an occasional bottle of poteen and many a severe thrashing  justice to phils amiability of character requires however that we should state that he never sought to terminate an argument with his fists unless he was invited to do so and even then he invariably gave his rash challenger fair warning and offered to let him retreat if so disposed  but when injustice met his eye or when he happened to see cruelty practised by the strong against the weak his blood fired at once and he only deigned the short emphatic remarkcome on sometimes preceded by arrah sometimes not  generally speaking he accepted his own challenge and went on forthwith  of all the iniquities that draw forth the groans of humanity on this sad earth slavery in the opinion of phil briant was the worst  he had never come in contact with it not having been in the southern states of america  he knew from hearsay that the coast of africa was its fountain but he had forgotten the fact and in the novelty of the scene before him it did not at first occur to him that he was actually face to face with a live slavedealer  let me go roared the irishman as he struggled in the iron grip of tim rokens and the not less powerful grasp of glynn proctor  och let me go  doo darlints  ill only give him wanjist wan  let me go will ye  not if i can help it said glynn tightening his grasp  wot a cross helephant it is muttered rokens as he thrust his hand into his comrades neckcloth and quietly began to choke him as he dragged him away towards the residence of the trader who was an amused as well as surprised spectator of this unexpected ebullition of passion  at length phil briant allowed himself to be forced away from the beach where the slavedealer stood with his arms crossed on his breast and a sarcastic smile playing on his thin lips  had that portuguese trafficker in human flesh known how quickly briant could have doubled the size of his long nose and shut up both his eyes he would probably have modified the expression of his countenance but he didnt know it so he looked after the party until they had entered the dwelling of the trader and then sauntered up towards the woods which in this place came down to within a few yards of the beach  the settlement was a mere collection of rudelyconstructed native huts built of bamboos and roofed with a thatch of palmleaves  in the midst of it stood a pretty whitepainted cottage with greenedged windows and doors and a verandah in front  this was the dwelling of the trader and alongside of it under the same roof was the store in which were kept the guns beads powder and shot etcetera etcetera which he exchanged with the natives of the interior for elephants tusks and barwood from which latter a beautiful dye is obtained also ebony indiarubber and other products of the country  here the trader entertained tim rokens and phil briant with stories of the slavetrade and here we shall leave them while we follow glynn and ailie who went off together to ramble along the shore of the calm sea  they had not gone far when specimens of the strange creatures that dwell in these lands presented themselves to their astonished gaze  there were birds innumerable on the shore on the surface of the ocean and in the woods  the air was alive with them many being similar to the birds they had been familiar with from infancy while others were new and strange  to her immense delight ailie saw many living specimens of the birdofparadise the graceful plumes of which she had frequently beheld on very high and important festal occasions nodding on the heads of aunt martha and aunt jane  but the prettiest of all the birds she saw there was a small creature with a breast so red and bright that it seemed as it flew about like a little ball of fire  there were many of them flying about near a steep bank in holes of which they built their nests  she observed that they fed upon flies which they caught while skimming through the air and afterwards learned that they were called beeeaters  oh look exclaimed ailie in that tone of voice which indicated that a surprising discovery had been made  ailie was impulsive and the tones in which she exclaimed oh were so varied emphatic and distinct that those who knew her well could tell exactly the state of her mind on hearing the exclamation  at present her oh indicated surprise mingled with alarm  eh what where cried glynn throwing forward his musketfor he had taken the precaution to carry one with him not knowing what he might meet with on such a coast  the snake lookoh  at that moment a huge black snake about ten feet long showed itself in the grass  glynn took aim at once but the piece being an old flintlock missed fire  before he could again take aim the loathsomelooking reptile had glided into the underwood which in most places was so overgrown with the rank and gigantic vegetation of the tropics as to be quite impenetrable  ha hes gone ailie cried glynn in a tone of disappointment as he put fresh priming into the pan of his piece  we must be careful in walking here it seems  this wretched old musket  lucky for us that our lives did not depend on it  i wonder if it was a poisonous serpent  perhaps it was said ailie with a look of deep solemnity as she took her companions left hand and trotted along by his side  are not all serpents poisonous  oh dear no  why there are some kinds that are quite harmless  but as i dont know which are and which are not we must look upon all as enemies until we become more knowing  presently they came to the mouth of a riverone of those sluggish streams on the african coast which suggest the idea of malaria and the whole family of low fevers  it glided through a mangrove swamp where the tree seemed to be standing on their roots which served the purpose of stilts to keep them out of the mud  the river was oily and sluggish and hotlooking and its mudbanks were slimy and liquid so that it was not easy to say whether the water of the river was mud or the mud on the bank was water  it was a place that made one involuntarily think of creeping monsters and crawling objects and slimy things  look oh oh such a darling pet exclaimed ailie as they stood near the banks of this river wondering what monster would first cleave the muddy waters and raise its hideous head  she pointed to the bough of a dead tree near which they stood and on which sat the darling pet referred to  it was a very small monkey with white whiskers a dumpy little thing that looked at them with an expression of surprise quite equal in intensity to their own  seeing that it was discovered the darling pet opened its little mouth and uttered a succession of ohs that rendered ailies exclamations quite insignificant by comparison  they were sharp and short and rapidly uttered while at the same time two rows of most formidable teeth were bared along with the gums that held them  at this ailie and her companion burst into a fit of irrepressible laughter whereupon the darling pet put itself into such a passion grinned and coughed and gasped and shook the tree and writhed and glared to such an extent that glynn said he thought it would burst and ailie agreed that it was very likely  finding that this terrible display of fury had no effect on the strangers the darling pet gave utterance to a farewell shriek of passion and bounding nimbly into the woods disappeared  oh what a funny beast said ailie sitting down on a stone and drying her eyes which had filled with tears from excessive laughter  indeed it was said glynn  its my opinion that a monkey is the funniest beast in the world  no glynn a kittens funnier said ailie with a degree of emphasis that showed she had considered the subject well and had fully made up her mind in regard to it long ago  i think a kittens the very funniest beast in all the whole world  well perhaps it is said glynn thoughtfully  did you ever see three kittens together asked ailie  no i dont think i ever did  i doubt if i have seen even two together  why  oh because they are so very very funny  sit down beside me and ill tell you about three kittens i once had  they were very littleat least they were little before they got big  glynn laughed  oh you know what i mean  they were able to play when they were very little you know  yes yes i understand  go on  well two were grey and one was white and grey but most of it was white and when they went to play one always hid itself to watch and then the other two began and came up to each other with little jumps and their backs up and tails curved and hair all on end glaring at each other and pretending that they were so angry  do you know glynn i really believe they sometimes forgot it was pretence and actually became angry  but the fun was that when the two were just going to fly at each other the third one who had been watching used to dart out and give them such a frighta real fright you knowwhich made them jump oh three times their own height up into the air and they came down again with a fuff that put the third one in a fright too so that they all scattered away from each other as if they had gone quite mad  whats that  its a fish i think said glynn rising and going towards the river to look at the object that had attracted his companions attention its a shark i do believe  in a few seconds the creature came so close that they could see it quite distinctly and on a more careful inspection they observed that the mouth of the river was full of these ravenous monsters  soon after they saw monsters of a still more ferocious aspect for while they were watching the sharks two crocodiles put up their snouts and crawled sluggishly out of the water upon a mudbank where they lay down apparently with the intention of taking a nap in the sunshine  they were too far off however to be well seen  isnt it strange glynn that there are such ugly beasts in the world said ailie  i wonder why god made them  so do i said glynn looking at the childs thoughtful face in some surprise  i suppose they must be of some sort of use  oh yes of course they are rejoined ailie quickly  aunt martha and aunt jane used to tell me that every creature was made by god for some good purpose and when i came to the crocodile in my book they said it was certainly of use too though they did not know what  i remember it very well because i was so surprised to hear that aunt martha and aunt jane did not know everything  no doubt aunt martha and aunt jane were right said glynn with a smile  i confess however that crocodiles seem to me to be of no other use than to kill and eat up everything that comes within the reach of their terrible jaws  but indeed now i think of it the very same may be said of man for he kills and eats up at least everything that he wants to put into his jaws  so he does said ailie isnt it funny  isnt what funny asked glynn  that we should be no better than crocodilesat least i mean about eating  you forget ailie we cook our food  oh so we do  i did not remember to think of that  thats a great difference indeed  leaving glynn and his little charge to philosophise on the resemblance between men and crocodiles we shall now return to tim rokens and phil briant whom we left in the traders cottage  the irate irishman had been calmed down by reason and expostulation and had again been roused to great indignation several times since we left him by the account of things connected with the slavetrade given him by the trader who although he had no interest in it himself did not feel very much aggrieved by the sufferings he witnessed around him  you dont mane to tell me now that whalers comes in here for slaves do ye said briant placing his two fists on his two knees and thrusting his head towards the trader who admitted that he meant to say that and that he meant moreover to add that the thing was by no means of rare occurrencethat whaling ships occasionally ran into that very port on their way south shipped a cargo of negroes sold them at the nearest slavebuying port they could make on the american coast and then proceeded on their voyage no one being a whit the wiser  you dont mean it remarked tim rokens crossing his legs and devoting himself to his pipe with the air of a man who mourned the depravity of his species but did not feel called upon to disturb his equanimity very much because of it  phil briant clenched his teeth and glared  indeed i do mean it reiterated the trader  would you believe it there was one whaler put in here and what does he do but go and invite a lot o free blacks aboard to have a blowout and no sooner did he get them down into the hold then he shut down the hatches sailed away and sold em every one  ah morther couldnt i burst groaned phil an ov coorse they left a lot o fatherless children and widders behind em  they did but all the widders are married again and most of the children are grown up  briant looked as if he did not feel quite sure whether he ought to regard this as a comforting piece of information or the reverse and wisely remained silent  and now you must excuse me if i leave you to ramble about alone for some time as i have business to transact meanwhile ill introduce you to a nigger who will show you about the place and one who if i mistake not will gladly accompany you to sea as stewards assistant  the trader opened a door which led to the back part of his premises and shouted to a stout negro who was sawing wood there and who came forward with alacrity  ho  neepeelootambo go take these gentlemen round about the village and let them see all that is to be seen  yes massa  and theyve got something to say to you about going to seawould you like to go  the negro grinned and as his mouth was of the largest possible size it is not exaggeration to say that the grin extended from ear to ear but he made no other reply  well please yourself  youre a free manyou may do as you choose  neepeelootambo who was almost naked having only a small piece of cloth wrapped round his waist and loins grinned again displaying a double row of teeth worthy of a shark in so doing and led his new friends from the house  now said tim rokens turning to the negro and pointing along the shore well go along this way and jaw the matter over  business first and pleasure if ye can get it arterwardsthems my notions nipnipnippiwhats your name  coo tumble i think suggested briant  ay nippiloo bumblewot a jawbreaker so git along old boy  the negro who was by no means an old boy but a stalwart man in the prime of life stepped out and as they walked along both rokens and briant did their best to persuade him to ship on board the red eric but without success  they were somewhat surprised as well as chagrined having been led to expect that the man would consent at once  but no alluring pictures of the delights of seafaring life or the pleasures and excitements of the whalefishery had the least effect on their sable companion  even sundry shrewd hints thrown out by phil briant that the steward had always command o the wittles and that his assistant would only have to help himself when convanient failed to move him  well nippibootumble cried tim rokens who in his disappointment unceremoniously contracted his name its my opinionprivate opinion markeethat youre a ass an youll come for to repent of it  troth nippibumble hes about right added briant coaxingly  come now avic wots the raisin ye wont go  sure we aint blackguards enough to ax ye to come for to be sold its all fair and above board why wont ye now  the negro stopped and turning towards them drew himself proudly up then as if a sudden thought had occurred to him he advanced a step and held up his forefinger to impose silence  you no tell what i go to say at least not for one two day  niver a word honour bright said phil in a confidential tone while rokens expressed the same sentiment by means of an emphatic wink and nod  you mus know said the negro earnestly me expecs to be made a king  a wot exclaimed both his companions in the same breath and very much in the same tone  a king  wot said rokens dye mean a ruler of this here country  neepeelootambo nodded his head so violently that it was a marvel it remained on his shoulders  yis  ho ho ho xpecs to be a king  and when are ye to be crowned bumble inquired briant rather sceptically as they resumed their walk  oh me no say me goin to be king me only xpecs dat  werry good returned rokens but wot makes ye for to expect it  aha  me berry clebber fellowknow most ebbery ting  me hab dood good service to dis here country  me can fight

make king till dey do it  i not more sure ob it dan the nigger dat walk dare before you  neepeelootambo pointed as he spoke to a negro who certainly had a more kingly aspect than any native they had yet seen  he was a perfect giant considerably above six feet high and broad in proportion  he wore no clothing on the upper part of his person but his legs were encased in a pair of old canvas trousers which had been made for a man of ordinary stature so that his huge bony ankles were largely exposed to view  just as phil and rokens stopped to take a good look at him before passing on a terrific yell issued from the bushes and instantly after a negro ran towards the black giant and administered to him a severe kick on the thigh following it up with a cuff on the side of the head at the same time howling something in the native tongue which our friends of course did not understand  this man was immediately followed by three other blacks one of whom pulled the giants hair the other pulled his nose and the third spat in his face  it is needless to remark that the sailors witnessed this unprovoked assault with unutterable amazement  but the most remarkable part of it was that the fellow instead of knocking all his assailants down as he might have done without much trouble quietly submitted to the indignities heaped upon him nay he even smiled upon his tormentors who increased in numbers every minute running out from among the bushes and surrounding the unoffending man and uttering wild shouts as they maltreated him  wots he bin doin inquired rokens turning to his black companion but rokens received no answer for neepeelootambo was looking on at the scene with an expression so utterly woebegone and miserable that one would imagine he was himself suffering the rough usage he witnessed  arrah ye dont appear to be chairful said briant laughing as he looked in the negros face  this is a quare counthrie an no mistakeit seems to be always blowin a gale o surprises  wots wrong wid ye bumble  the negro groaned  sure that may be a civil answer but its not o much use  hallo what air they doin wid the poor cratur now  as he spoke the crowd seized the black giant by the arms and neck and hair and dragged him away towards the village leaving our friends in solitude  a very purty little scene remarked phil briant when they were out of sight very purty indade av we only knowed wot its all about  if the surprise of the two sailors was great at what they had just witnessed it was increased tenfold by the subsequent behaviour of their negro companion  that eccentric individual suddenly checked his groans gave vent to a long deep sigh and assuming a resigned expression of countenance rose up and saidho  it all ober now massa  i do believe remarked rokens looking gravely at his shipmate that the fellers had an attack of the mollygrumbles ans got better all of a suddint  no massa dat not it  but me willin to go wid you now to de sea  eh willin to

straight away to de palace and crown him an oh arter dat dey become very purlite to him  him know dat well nuff and so him not be angry just now  ah me did xpec to hab bin kick and spitted on dis berry day  poor neepeelootambo uttered the last words in such a deeply touching tone and seemed to be so much cast down at the thought that his chance of being kicked and spitted upon had passed away for ever that phil briant burst into a hearty fit of laughter and tim rokens exhibited symptoms of internal risibility though his outward physiognomy remained unchanged  och  bumble youll be the death o me cried briant  an are they acrownin of him now  yis massa  dat what dey go for to do jist now  troth then ill go an inspict the coronation  come along bumble me darlint and show us the way  in a few minutes neepeelootambo conducted his new friends into a large rudelyconstructed hut which was open on three sides and thatched with palmleaves  this was the palace before referred to by him  here they found a large concourse of negroes whose main object at that time seemed to be the creation of noise for besides yelling and hooting they beat a variety of native drums some of which consisted of bits of board and others of old tin and copper kettles  forcing their way through the noisy throng they reached the inside of the hut into which they found that ailie dunning and glynn proctor had pushed their way before them  giving them a nod of recognition they sat down on a mat by their side to watch the proceedings which by this time were nearly concluded  the new kingwho was about to fill the throne rendered vacant by the recent death of the old king of that regionwas seated on an elevated stool looking very dignified despite the rough ordeal through which he had just passed  when the noise above referred to had calmed down an old greyheaded negro rose and made a speech in the language of the country after which he advanced and crowned the new king who had already been invested in a long scarlet coat covered with tarnished gold lace and cut in the form peculiar to the last century  the crown consisted of an ordinary black silk hat considerably the worse for wear  it looked familiar and commonplace enough in the eyes of their white visitors but being the only specimen of the article in the district it was regarded by the negroes with peculiar admiration and deemed worthy to decorate the brows of royalty  having had this novel crown placed on the top of his woolly pate which was much too large for it the new king hit it an emphatic blow on the top partly with a view to force it on and partly no doubt with the design of impressing his new subjects with the fact that he was now their rightful sovereign and that he meant thenceforth to exercise all the authority and avail himself of all the privileges that his high position conferred on him  he then rose and made a pretty long speech which was frequently applauded and which terminated amid a most uproarious demonstration of loyalty on the part of the people  if you wish to gladden the heart of a black man reader get him into the midst of an appalling noise  the negros delight is to shout and laugh and yell and beat tin kettles with iron spoons  the greater the noise the more he enjoys himself  great guns and musketry gongs and brass bands kettledrums and smashing crockery crashing railwayengines blending their utmost whistles with the shrieks of a thousand pigs being killed all going at once full blast and as near to him as possible is a species of elysium to the sable son of africa on their occasions of rejoicing negroes procure and produce as much noise as is possible so that the white visitors were soon glad to seek shelter and find relief to their ears on board ship  but even there the sounds of rejoicing reached them and long after the curtain of night had enshrouded land and sea the hideous din of royal festivities came swelling out with the soft warm breeze that fanned ailies cheek as she stood on the quarterdeck of the red eric watching the wild antics of the naked savages as they danced round their bright fires and holding her fathers hand tightly as she related the days adventures and told of the monkeys crocodiles and other strange creatures she had seen in the mangroveswamps and on the mudbanks of the slimy river    chapter ten  an inland journeysleeping in the woodswild beasts everywheresad fate of a gazelle  the damage sustained by the red eric during the storm was found to be more severe than was at first supposed  part of her false keel had been torn away by a sunken rock over which the vessel had passed and scraped so lightly that no one on board was aware of the fact yet with sufficient force to cause the damage to which we have referred  a slight leak was also discovered and the injury to the top of the foremast was neither so easily nor so quickly repaired as had been anticipated  it thus happened that the vessel was detained on this part of the african coast for nearly a couple of weeks during which time ailie had frequent opportunities of going on shore sometimes in charge of glynn sometimes with tim rokens and occasionally with her father  during these little excursions the child lived in a world of romance not only were the animals and plants and objects of every kind with which she came in contact entirely new to her except in so far as she had made their acquaintance in pictures but she invested everything in the roseate hue peculiar to her own romantic mind  true she saw many things that caused her a good deal of pain and she heard a few stories about the terrible cruelty of the negroes to each other which made her shudder but unpleasant thoughts did not dwell long on her mind she soon forgot the little annoyances or frights she experienced and revelled in the enjoyment of the beautiful sights and sweet perfumes which more than counterbalanced the bad odours and ugly things that came across her path  ailies mind was a very inquiring one and often and long did she ponder the things she saw and wonder why god made some so very ugly and some so very pretty and to what use he intended them to be put  of course in such speculative inquiries she was frequently very much puzzled as also were the companions to whom she propounded the questions from time to time but she had been trained to believe that everything that was made by god was good whether she understood it or not and she noticed particularly and made an involuntary memorandum of the fact in her own mind that ugly things were very few in number while beautiful objects were absolutely innumerable  the trader who rendered good assistance to captain dunning in the repair of his ship frequently overheard ailie wishing so much that she might be allowed to go far into the wild woods and one day suggested to the captain that as the ship would have to remain a week or more in port he would be glad to take a party an excursion up the river in his canoe and show them a little of forest life saying at the same time that the little girl might go too for they were not likely to encounter any danger which might not be easily guarded against  at first the captain shook his head remembering the stories that were afloat regarding the wild beasts of those regions  but on second thoughts he agreed to allow a wellarmed party to accompany the trader the more so that he was urged thereto very strongly by dr hopley who being a naturalist was anxious to procure specimens of the creatures and plants in the interior and being a phrenologist was desirous of examining what glynn termed the bumpological developments of the negro skull  on still further considering the matter captain dunning determined to leave the first mate in charge of the ship head the exploring party himself and take ailie along with him  to say that ailie was delighted would be to understate the fact very much  she was wild with joy and went about all the day after her fathers decision was announced making every species of insane preparation for the canoe voyage clasping her hands and exclaiming oh what fun while her bright eyes sparkled to such an extent that the sailors fairly laughed in her face when they looked at her  preparations were soon made  the party consisted of the captain and his little child glynn proctor of course dr hopley tim rokens phil briant jim scroggles the trader and neepeelootambo which last had been by that time regularly domesticated on board and was now known by the name of king bumble which name being as good as his own and more pronounceable we shall adopt from this time forward  the very morning after the proposal was made the above party embarked in the traders canoe and plying their paddles with the energy of men bent on what is vulgarly termed going the whole hog they quickly found themselves out of sight of their natural element the ocean and surrounded by the wild rich luxuriant vegetation of equatorial africa  now remarked tim rokens as they ceased paddling and ran the canoe under the shade of a broad palmtree that overhung the river in order to take a short rest and a smoke after a steady paddle of some milesnow this is wot i calls glorious so it is  aint it  pass the baccy this way  this double remark was made to king bumble who passed the tobaccopouch to his friend after helping himself and admitted that it was mugnifercent  here have i bin asittin in this here canoe continued rokens for more nor two hours an to my sartin knowledge ive seed with my two eyes twelve sharks for i counted em every one at the mouth of the river and two crocodiles and the snout of a hopplepittimus is that wot ye calls it  rokens addressed his question to the captain but phil briant who had just succeeded in getting his pipe to draw beautifully answered instead  och no said he thats not the way to pronounce it at all at all its a huppipuppiputtimus  i dun know said rokens shaking his head gravely it appears to me theres too many huppi puppies in that word  this debate caused ailie infinite amusement for she experienced considerable difficulty herself in pronouncing that name and had a very truthful picture of the hippopotamus hanging at that moment in her room at home  isnt tim rokens very funny papa she remarked in a whisper looking up in her fathers face  hush my pet and look yonder  there is something funnier if i mistake not  he pointed as he spoke to a ripple in the water on the opposite side of the river close under a bank which was clothed with rank broadleaved and sedgy vegetation  in a few seconds a large crocodile put up its head not farther off than twenty yards from the canoe which apparently it did not see and opening its tremendous jaws afforded the travellers a splendid view of its teeth and throat  briant afterwards asserted that he could see down its throat and could almost tell what it had had for dinner  plaze sir may i shoot him cried briant seizing his loaded musket and looking towards the captain for permission  its of no use while in that position remarked the trader who regarded the hideouslooking monster with the calm unconcern of a man accustomed to such sights  you may try said the captain with a grin  almost before the words had left his lips phil took a rapid aim and fired  at the same identical moment the crocodile shut his jaws with a snap as if he had an intuitive perception that something uneatable was coming  the bullet consequently hit his forehead off which it glanced as if it had struck a plate of castiron  the reptile gave a wabble expressive of lazy surprise and sank slowly back into the slimy water  the shot startled more than one huge creature for immediately afterwards they heard several flops in the water near them but the tall sedges prevented their seeing what animals they were  a whole troop of monkeys too went shrieking away into the woods showing that those nimble creatures had been watching all their movements although until that moment they had taken good care to keep themselves out of sight  never fire at a crocodiles head said the trader as the party resumed their paddles and continued their ascent of the stream you might as well fire at a stone wall  its as hard as iron  the only place thats sure to kill it just behind the foreleg  the niggers always spear them there  what do they spear them for asked dr hopley  they eat em replied the trader and the meats not so bad after you get used to it  ha exclaimed glynn proctor i should fancy the great difficulty is to get used to it  if you ever chance to go for a week without tasting fresh meat replied the trader quietly youll not find it so difficult as you think  that night the travellers encamped in the woods and a wild charmingly romantic scene their night bivouac wasso thought ailie and so too would you have thought reader had you been there  king bumble managed to kindle three enormous fires for the triple purpose of keeping the party warmfor it was cold at nightof scaring away wild beasts and of cooking their supper  these fires he fed at intervals during the whole night with huge logs and the way in which he made the sparks fly up in among the strange big leaves of the tropical trees and parasitical plants overhead was quite equal if not superior to a display of regular fireworks  then bumble and glynn built a little platform of logs on which they strewed leaves and grass and over which they spread a curtain or canopy of broad leaves and boughs  this was ailies couch  it stood in the full blaze of the centre fire and commanded a view of all that was going on in every part of the little camp and when ailie lay down on it after a good supper and was covered up with a blanket and further covered over with a sort of gauze netting to protect her from the mosquitoes which were very numerouswhen all this was done we say and when in addition to this she lay and witnessed the jovial laughter and enjoyment of his majesty king bumble as he sat at the big fire smoking his pipe and the supreme happiness of phil briant and the placid joy of tim rokens and the exuberant delight of glynn and the semiscientific enjoyment of dr hopley as he examined a collection of rare plants and the quiet comfort of the trader and the awkward shambling loosejointed pleasure of long jim scroggles and the beaming felicity of her own dear father who sat not far from her and turned occasionally in the midst of the conversation to give her a nodshe felt in her heart that then and there she had fairly reached the very happiest moment in all her life  ailie gazed in dreamy delight until she suddenly and unaccountably saw at least six fires and fully halfadozen bumbles and eight or nine glynns and no end of fathers and thousands of trees and millions of sparks all jumbled together in one vast complicated and magnificent pyrotechnic display and then she fell asleep  it is a curious fact and one for which it is not easy to account that however happy you may be when you go to sleep out in the wild woods you invariably awake in the morning in possession of a very small amount of happiness indeed  probably it is because one in such circumstances is usually called upon to turn out before he has had enough sleep perhaps it may be that the fires have burnt low or gone out altogether and the gloom of a forest before sunrise is not calculated to elevate the spirits  be this as it may it is a fact that when ailie was awakened on the following morning about daybreak and told to get up she felt sulkypositively and unmistakably sulky  we do not say that she looked sulky or acted sulkilyfar from it but she felt sulky and that was a very uncomfortable state of things  we dwell a little on this point because we do not wish to mislead our young readers into the belief that life in the wild woods is all delightful together  there are shadows as well as lights theresome of them alas so deep that we would not like even to refer to them while writing in a sportive vein  but it is also a fact that when ailie was fairly up and once more in the canoe and when the sun began to flood the landscape with his golden light and turn the water into liquid fire her temporary feelings of discomfort passed away and her sensation of intense enjoyment returned  the scenery through which they passed on the second day was somewhat varied  they emerged early in the day upon the bosom of a large lake which looked almost like the ocean  here there were immense flocks of waterfowl and among them that strange ungainly bird the pelican here too there were actually hundreds of crocodiles  the lake was full of little mud islands and on all of them these hideous and gigantic reptiles were seen basking lazily in the sun  several shots were fired at them but although the balls hit they did not penetrate their thick hides until at last one took effect in the soft part close behind the foreleg  the shot was fired by the trader and it killed the animal instantly  it could not have been less than twenty feet long but before they could secure it the carcass sank in deep water  what a pity remarked glynn as the eddies circled round the spot where it had gone down  ah so it is replied the doctor but he would have been rather large to preserve and carry home as a specimen  i ax yer parding sir said tim rokens addressing dr hopley but im curious to know if crocodiles has got phrenoligy  no doubt of it replied the doctor laughing  crocodiles have brains and brains when exercised must be enlarged and developed especially in the organs that are most used hence corresponding development must take place in the skull  i should think doctor remarked the captain who was somewhat sceptical that their bumps of combativeness must be very large  probably they are continued the doctor something like my friend phil briant here  i would venture to guess now that his organ of combativeness is welldevelopedlet me see  the doctor who sat close beside the irishman caused him to pull in his paddle and submit his head for inspection  ah then dont operate on me doctor dear  ive a mortial fear o operations iver since me owld grandmothers pig got its foreleg took off at the hipjint  hold your tongue paddy  now the bump lies herejust undereh why you havent got so much aswhat  plaize i think its lost in fat sur remarked briant in a plaintive tone as if he expected to be reprimanded for not having brought his bump of combativeness along with him  well resumed the doctor passing his fingers through briants matted locks i suppose youre not so combative as we had fancied  thrue for you interrupted phil  but strange enough i find your organ of veneration is very large very large indeed singularly so for a man of your character but i cannot feel it easily you have such a quantity of hair  which is it doctor dear inquired phil  this one i am pressing now  arrah dont press so hard plaze its hurtin me ye are  shure thats the place where i run me head slap up agin the spankerboom four days ago  av thats me bump o vineration it wos three times as big an twice as hard yisterdayit wos indade  interruptions in this world of uncertainty are not uncommon and in the african wilds they are peculiarly frequent  the interruption which occurred on the present occasion to dr hopleys reply was we need scarcely remark exceedingly opportune  it came in the form of a hippopotamus which rose so close to the boat that ailie got a severe start and tim rokens made a blow at its head with his paddle  it did not seem to notice the boat but after blowing a quantity of water from its nostrils and opening its horrible mouth as if it were yawning it slowly sank again into the flood  wot an orrible crittur exclaimed jim scroggles in amazement at the sight  the howdacious willain remarked rokens  is that another on ahead said glynn pointing to an object floating on the water about a hundred yards up the river for they had passed the lake and were now ascending another stream  dye see it ailie look  the object sank as he spoke and ailie looked round just in time to see the tail of a crocodile flop the water and follow its owner to the depths below  oh oh exclaimed ailie with one of those peculiar intonations that told glynn she saw something very beautiful and that induced the remainder of the crew to rest on their paddles and turn their eyes in the direction indicated  they did not require to ask what she saw for the childs finger directed their eyes to a spot on the bank of the river where under the shadow of a spreading bush with gigantic leaves stood a lovely little gazelle  the graceful creature had trotted down to the stream to drink and did not observe the canoe which had been on the point of rounding a bank that jutted out into the river where its progress was checked  the gazelle paused a moment looked round to satisfy itself that no enemy was near and then put its lips to the water  alas for the timid little thing  there were enemies near it and round it in all directions  there were leopards and serpents of the largest size in the woods and man upon the riveralthough on this occasion it chanced that most of the men who gazed in admiration at its pretty form were friends  but its worst enemy a crocodile was lurking close under the mudbank at its feet  scarcely had its parched lips reached the stream when a black snout darted from the water and the next instant the gazelle was struggling in the crocodiles jaws  a cry of horror burst from the men in the boat and every man seized a musket but before an aim could be taken the struggle was over the monster had dived with its prey and nothing but a few streaks of red foam floated on the troubled water  ailie did not move  she stood with her hands tightly clasped and her eyes starting almost out of their sockets  at last her feelings found vent  she threw her arms round her fathers neck and burying her face in his bosom burst into a passionate flood of tears    chapter eleven  native doings and a cruel murderjim scroggles sees wonders and has a terrible adventure  it took two whole days and nights to restore ailie to her wonted cheerful state of mind after she had witnessed the death of the gazelle  but although she sang and laughed and enjoyed herself as much as ever she experienced the presence of a new and strange feeling that ever after that day tinged her thoughts and influenced her words and actions  the child had for the first time in her life experienced one of those rude shocksone of those rough contacts with the stern realities of life which tend to deepen and intensify our feelings  the mind does not always grow by slow imperceptible degrees although it usually does so there are periods in the career of every one when the mind takes as it were a sharp run and makes a sudden and stupendous jump out of one region of thought into another in which there are things new as well as old  the present was such an occasion to little ailie dunning  she had indeed seen bloody work before in the cuttingup of a whale  but although she had been told it often enough she did not realise that whales have feelings and affections like other creatures  besides she had not witnessed the actual killing of the whale and if she had it would probably have made little impression on her beyond that of temporary excitementnot even that perhaps had her father been by her side  but she sympathised with the gazelle  it was small and beautiful and lovable  her heart had swelled the moment she saw it and she had felt a longing desire to run up to it and throw her arms round its soft neck so that when she saw it suddenly struggling and crushed in the tremendous jaws of the horrible crocodile every tender feeling in her breast was lacerated every fibre of her heart trembled with a conflicting gush of the tenderest pity and the fiercest rage from that day forward new thoughts began to occupy her mind and old ideas presented themselves in different aspects  we would not have the reader suppose for a moment that ailie became an utterly changed creature  to an unobservant eyesuch as that of jim scroggles for instanceshe was the same in all respects a few days after as she had been a few hours before the event  but new elements had been implanted in her breast or rather seeds which had hitherto lain dormant were now caused to burst forth into plants by the allwise author of her being  she now felt for the first timeshe could not tell whythat enjoyment was not the chief good in life  of course she did not argue or think out all this clearly and methodically to herself  her mind on most things material as well as immaterial was very much what may be termed a jumble but undoubtedly the above processes of reasoning and feeling or something like them were the result to ailie of the violent death of that little gazelle  the very next day after this sad event the travellers came to a native village at which they stayed a night in order to rest and procure fresh provisions  the trader was wellknown at this village but the natives all of whom were black of course and nearly naked had never seen a little white girl before so that their interest in and wonder at ailie were quite amusing to witness  they crowded round her laughing and exclaiming and gesticulating in a most remarkable manner and taking special notice of her lightbrown glossy hair which seemed to fill them with unbounded astonishment and admiration as well it might for they had never before seen any other hair except the coarse curly wool on their own pates and the long lank hair of the trader which happened to be coarse and black  the child was at first annoyed by the attentions paid her but at last she became interested in the sooty little naked children that thronged round her and allowed them to handle her as much as they pleased until her father led her to the residence of the chief or king of the tribe here she was well treated and she began quite to like the people who were so kind to her and her friends  but she chanced to overhear a conversation between the doctor and tim rokens which caused her afterwards to shrink from the negroes with horror  she was sitting on a bank picking wildflowers some hours after the arrival of her party and teaching several black children how to make necklaces of them when the doctor and rokens happened to sit down together at the other side of a bush which concealed her from their view  tim was evidently excited for the tones of his voice were loud and emphatic  yes he said in reply to some questions put to him by the doctor yes i seed em do it not ten minutes agone with my own two eyes oh but i would like to have em up in a rowevery black villain in the placean a cutlass in my hand anan wouldnt i whip off their heads  no i wouldnt oh no by no means wotiver  there was something unusually fierce in rokens voice that alarmed ailie  i was jist takin a turn continued the sailor down by the creek yonder when i heerd a great yellin goin on and saw the trader in the middle of a crowd o black fellows ashakin his fists so i made sail of course to lend a hand if hed got into trouble  he was scoldin away in the native lingo as if hed bin a born nigger  wots all to do says i  theyre goin to kill a little boy says he quite fierce like cause they took it into their heads hes bewitched  an sayin that he sot to agin in the other lingo but the king came up an told him that the boy had to be killed cause he had a devil in him and had gone and betwitched a number o other people an before he had done speakin up comes two fellers draggin the poor little boy between them  the king axed him if he wos betwitched and the little chapfrom sheer fright i do believesaid he wos  of coorse i couldnt understand em but the trader explained it all arter  well no sooner had he said that than they all gave a yell and rushed upon the poor boy with their knives and cut him to pieces  its as sure as im sittin here cried rokens savagely as his wrath rose again at the bare recital of the terrible deed he had witnessed  i would ha knocked out the kings brains there and then but the trader caught my hand and said in a great fright that if i did it would not only cost me my life but likely the whole party so that cooled me and i come away an im goin to ax the captin wot we shud do  we can do nothing said the doctor sadly  even suppose we were strong enough to punish them what good would it do  we cant change their natures  they are superstitious and are firmly persuaded they did right in killing that poor boy  the doctor pondered for a few seconds and then added in a low voice as if he were weighing the meaning of what he said clergymen would tell us that nothing can deliver them from this bondage save a knowledge of the true god and of his son jesus christ that the bible might be the means of curing them if bibles were only sent and ministers to preach the gospel  then why aint bibles sent to em at once asked rokens in a tone of great indignation supposing that the doctor was expressing his own opinion on the subject  is there nobody to look arter these matters in christian lands  oh yes there are many bible societies and both bibles and missionaries have been sent to this country but its a large one and the societies tell us their funds are limited  then why dont they git more funds continued rokens in the same indignant tone as his mind still dwelt upon the miseries and wickedness that he had seen and that might be prevented why dont they git more funds and send out heaps o bibles an no end o missionaries  tim rokens said the doctor looking earnestly into his companions face if i were one of the missionaries i might ask you how much money you ever gave to enable societies to send bibles and missionaries to foreign lands  tim rokens was for once in his life completely taken aback  he was by nature a stolid man and not easily put out  he was a shrewd man too and did not often commit himself  when he did he was wont to laugh at himself and so neutralise the laugh raised against him  but here was a question that was too serious for laughter and yet one which he could not answer without being selfcondemned  he looked gravely in the doctors face for two minutes without speaking then he heaved a deep sigh and said slowly and with a pause between each word  doctor hopleyinevergavearapinallmylife  so then my man said the doctor smiling youre scarcely entitled to be indignant with others  wot you remark doctor is true iamnot  having thus fully and emphatically condemned himself and along with himself all mankind who are in a similar category tim rokens relapsed into silence deliberately drew forth his pipe filled it lit it and began to smoke  none of the party of travellers slept well that night except perhaps the trader who was accustomed to the ways of the negroes and king bumble who had been born and bred in the midst of cruelties  most of them dreamed of savage orgies and massacres of innocent children so that when daybreak summoned them to resume their journey they arose and embarked with alacrity glad to get away from the spot  during that day and the next they saw a great number of crocodiles and hippopotami besides strange birds and plants innumerable  the doctor filled his botanicalbox to bursting  ailie filled her flowerbasket to overflowing  glynn hit a crocodile on the back with a bullet and received a lazy stare from the ugly creature in return as it waddled slowly down the bank on which it had been lying and plumped into the river  the captain assisted ailie to pluck flowers when they landed which they did from time to time and helped to arrange and pack them when they returned to the canoe  tim rokens did nothing particularly worthy of record but he gave utterance to an immense number of sententious and wise remarks which were listened to by bumble with deep respect for that sable gentleman had taken a great fancy for the bold harpooner and treasured up all his sayings in his heart  phil briant distinguished himself by shooting an immense serpent which the doctor who cut off and retained its head pronounced to be an anaconda  it was full twenty feet long and part of the body was cut up roasted and eaten by bumble and the trader though the others turned from it with loathing  it be more cleaner dan one pig anyhow remarked bumble on observing the disgust of his white friends an you no objic to eat dat  clainer than a pig ye spalpeen cried phil briant that only shows yer benighted haithen ignerance  sure i lived in the same cabin wid a pig for many a yearnot not to mintion a large family o cocks and hensan a clainer baste than that pig didnt stop in that cabin  that doesnt say much for your own cleanliness or that of your family remarked glynn  och yeve bin to school no doubt havent ye retorted phil  i have replied glynn  shure i thought so  its there ye must have larned to be so oncommon cliver  dont you iver be persuaded for to go to school bumble if ye iver git the chance  its a mighty lot o taichin theyd give ye but niver a taste o edication  tin to wan theyd cram ye till ye turned white i the face an that wouldnt suit yer complexion ye know king bumble be no manes  as for the trader he acted interpreter when the party fell in with negroes and explained everything that puzzled them and told them anecdotes without end about the natives and the wild creatures and the traffic of the regions through which they passed  in short he made himself generally useful and agreeable  but the man who distinguished himself most on that trip was jim scroggles  that lanky individual one day took it into his wise head to go off on a short ramble into the woods alone  he had been warned by the trader along with the rest of the party not to venture on such a dangerous thing but being an absent man the warning had not reached his intellect although it had fallen on his ear  the party were on shore cooking dinner when he went off without arms of any kind and without telling whither he was bound  indeed he had no defined intentions in his own mind  he merely felt inclined for a ramble and so went away intending to be back in halfanhour or less  but jim scroggles had long legs and loved locomotion  moreover the woods were exceedingly beautiful and fragrant and comparatively cool for it happened to be the coolest season of the year in that sultry region else the party of europeans could not have ventured to travel there at all  wandering along beneath the shade of palmtrees and largeleaved shrubs and other tropical productions with his hands in his breeches pockets and whistling a variety of popular airs which must have not a little astonished the monkeys and birds and other creaturessuch of them at least as had any taste for or knowledge of musicjim scroggles penetrated much farther into the wilds than he had any intention of doing  there is no saying how far in his absence of mind he might have wandered had he not been caught and very uncomfortably entangled in a meshwork of wild vines and thorny plants that barred his further progress  jim had encountered several such before in his walk but had forced his way through without more serious damage than a rent or two in his shirt and pantaloons and several severe scratches to his hands and face but scroggles had lived a hard life from infancy and did not mind scratches  now however he could not advance a step and it was only by much patient labour and by the free use of his claspknife that he succeeded at length in releasing himself  he left a large portion of one of the legs of his trousers and several bits of skin on the bushes as a memorial of his visit to that spot  jims mind was awoken to the perception of three factsnamely that he had made himself late for dinner that he would be the means of detaining his party and that he had lost himself  here was a pretty business  being a man of slow thought and much deliberation he sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree and looking up as men usually do when soliloquising exclaimed  my eye heres a go  wot is to be done  a very small monkey with an uncommonly wrinkled and melancholy cast of visage which chanced to be seated on a branch hard by peering down at the lost mariner replied  o ooo o oo as much as to say ah my boy thats just the question  jim scroggles shook his head partly as a rebuke to the impertinent little monkey and partly as an indication of the hopelessness of his being able to return a satisfactory answer to his own question  at last he started up exclaiming wotever comes on it theres no use o sitting here and walked straight forward at a brisk pace  then he suddenly stopped shook his head again and said if i goes on like this an it shud turn out to be the wrong course arter allwotll come ont  being as unable to answer this question as the former he thrust both hands into his pockets looked at the ground and began to whistle  when he looked up again he ceased whistling very abruptly and turned deadly paleperhaps we should say yellow  and no wonder for there straight before him not more than twenty yards off stood a creature which to his ignorant eyes appeared to be a fiend incarnate but which was in reality a largesized and very ancient sheego monkey  it stood in an upright position like a man and was above four feet high  it had a bald head grey whiskers and an intensely black wrinkled face and at the moment jim scroggles eyes encountered it that face was working itself into such a variety of remarkable and hideous contortions that no description however graphic could convey a correct notion of it to the readers mind  seen behind the bars of an iron cage it might perhaps have been laughable but witnessed as it was in the depths of a lonely forest it was appalling  jim scroggles knees began to shake  he was fascinated with horror the huge ape was equally fascinated with terror  it worked its wrinkled visage more violently than ever  jim trembled all over  in another second the sheego displayed not only all its teethand they were tremendousbut all its gums and they were fearful to behold besides being scarlet  roused to the utmost pitch of fear the sheego uttered a shriek that rang through the forest like a deathyell  this was the culminating point  jim scroggles turned and fled as fast as his long and trembling legs could carry him  the sheego at the same instant was smitten with an identically similar impulse  it turned uttered another yell and fled in the opposite direction and thus the two ran until they were both out of breath what became of the monkey we cannot tell but jim scroggles ran at headlong speed straight before him crashing through brake and bush in the full belief that the sheego was in hot pursuit until he came to a mangrove swamp here his speed was checked somewhat for the trees grew in a curious fashion that merits special notice  instead of rising out of the ground the mangroves rose out of a sea of mud and the roots stood up in a somewhat arched form supporting their stem as it were on the top of a bridge  thus had the ground beneath been solid a man might have walked under the roots  in order to cross the swamp jim scroggles had to leap from root to roota feat which although difficult he would have attempted without hesitation but jim was agitated at that particular moment  his step was uncertain at a time when the utmost coolness was necessary  at one point the leap from one root to the next was too great for him  he turned his eye quickly to one side to seek a nearer stem in doing so he encountered the gaze of a serpent  it was not a large one probably about ten feet long but he knew it to be one whose bite was deadly  in the surprise and fear of the moment he took the long leap came short of the root by about six inches and alighted up to the waist in the soft mud  almost involuntarily he cast his eyes behind him and saw neither sheego nor serpent  he breathed more freely and essayed to extricate himself from his unpleasant position  stretching out his hands to the root above his head he found that it was beyond his reach  the sudden fear that this produced caused him to make a violent struggle and in his next effort he succeeded in catching a twig it supported him for a moment then broke and he fell back again into the mud  each successive struggle only sank him deeper  as the thick adhesive semiliquid clung to his lower limbs and rose slowly on his chest the wretched man uttered a loud cry of despair  he felt that he was brought suddenly face to face with death in its most awful form  the mud was soon up to his armpits  as the hopelessness of his condition forced itself upon him he began to shout for help until the dark woods resounded with his cries but no help came and the cold drops of sweat stood upon his brow as he shrieked aloud in agony and prayed for mercy    chapter twelve  jim scroggles rescued and glynn and ailie losta capture upset chase escape and happy return  the merciful manner in which god sends deliverance at the eleventh hour has been so often experienced and recognised that it has originated the wellknown proverb mans extremity is gods opportunity and this proverb is true not only in reference to mans soul but often also in regard to his temporal affairs  while the wretched sailor was uttering cries for help which grew feebler every moment as he sank deeper and deeper into what now he believed should be his grave his comrades were hastening forward to his rescue  alarmed at his prolonged absence they had armed themselves and set out in search of him headed by the trader and led by the negro who tracked his steps with that unerring certainty which seems peculiar to all savages  the shrieks uttered by their poor comrade soon reached their ears and after some little difficulty owing to the cries becoming faint and at last inaudible they discovered the swamp where he lay and revived his hope and energy by their shouts  they found him nearly up to the neck in mud and the little of him that still remained above ground was scarcely recognisable  it cost them nearly an hour with the aid of poles and ropes extemporised out of their garments to drag jim from his perilous position and place him on solid ground and after they had accomplished this it took more than an hour longer to clean him and get him recruited sufficiently to accompany them to the spot where they had left the canoe  the poor man was deeply moved and when he fully realised the fact that he was saved he wept like a child and then thanked god fervently for his deliverance  as the night was approaching and the canoe with ailie in it had been left in charge only of glynn proctor jims recovery was expedited as much as possible and as soon as he could walk they turned to retrace their steps  man knows not what a day or an hour will bring forth  for many years one may be permitted to move on the even tenor of his way without anything of momentous import occurring to mark the passage of his little span of time as it sweeps him onward to eternity  at another period of life events it may be of the most startling and abidingly impressive nature are crowded into a few months or weeks or even days  so it was now with our travellers on the african river  when they reached the spot where they had dined no one replied to their shouts  the canoe glynn and the child were gone  on making this terrible discovery the whole party were filled with indescribable consternation and ran wildly hither and thither up and down the banks of the river shouting the names of glynn proctor and ailie until the woods rang again  captain dunning was almost mad with anxiety and horror  his imagination pictured his child in every conceivable danger  he thought of her as drowned in the river and devoured by crocodiles as carried away by the natives into hopeless captivity or perhaps killed by wild beasts in the forest  when several hours had elapsed and still no sign of the missing ones could be discovered he fell down exhausted on the rivers bank and groaned aloud in his despair  but ailie was not lost  the heavenly father in whom she trusted still watched over and cared for her and glynn proctors stout right arm was still by her side to protect her  about halfanhour after the party had gone off in search of their lost companion a large canoe full of negroes came sweeping down the river glynn and ailie hid themselves in the bushes and lay perfectly still hoping they might be passed by  but they forgot that the blue smoke of their fire curled up through the foliage and revealed their presence at once  on observing the smoke the savages gave a shout and running their canoe close in to the bank leaped ashore and began to scamper through the wood like baboons  only a few minutes passed before they discovered the two hiders whom they surrounded and gazed upon in the utmost possible amazement shouting the while with delight as if they had discovered a couple of new species of monkey  glynn was by nature a reckless and hasty youth he felt the power of a young giant within him and his first impulse was to leap upon the newcomers and knock them down right and left fortunately for ailies sake as well as his own he had wisdom enough to know that though he had possessed the power of ten giants he could not hope singly to overcome twenty negroes all of whom were strong active and lithe as panthers  he therefore assumed a goodhumoured freeandeasy air and allowed himself and ailie to be looked at and handled without ceremony  the savages were evidently not illdisposed towards the wanderers  they laughed a great deal and spoke to each other rapidly in what to glynn was of course an unknown tongue  one who appeared to be the chief of the party passed his long black fingers through ailies glossy curls with evident surprise and delight  he then advanced to glynn and said something like  holliboobogaddlebumpumpeepidaddledumps  to which glynn replied very naturally i dont understand you  of course he did not  and he might have known well enough that the negro could not understand him  but he deemed it wiser to make a reply of some kind however unintelligible than to stand like a post and say nothing  again the negro spoke and again glynn made the same reply whereupon the black fellow turned round to his comrades and looked at them and they in reply to the look burst again into an immoderate fit of laughter and cut a variety of capers the very simplest of which would have made the fortune of any merryandrew in the civilised world had he been able to execute it  this was all very well no doubt and exceedingly amusing not to say surprising but it became quite a different matter when after satisfying their curiosity these dark gentlemen coolly collected the property of the white men stowed it away in the small canoe and made signs to glynn and ailie to enter  glynn showed a decided objection to obey on which two stout fellows seized him by the shoulders and pointed sternly to the canoe as much as to say hobbidoddlehoogumtolywhack which being interpreted no doubt meant if you dont go quietly well force you  again the young sailors spirit leaped up  he clenched his fists his brow flushed crimson and in another instant whatever might have been the consequence the two negroes would certainly have lain recumbent on the sward had it not suddenly occurred to glynn that he might by appearing to submit win the confidence of his captors and at the first nightencampment quietly make his escape with ailie in his arms  glynn was at that romantic age when young men have a tendency to think themselves capable of doing almost anything with or without ordinary facilities and in the face of any amount of adverse circumstance  he therefore stepped willingly and even cheerfully into the canoe in which his and his comrades baggage had been already stowed and seating himself in the stern took up the steeringpaddle  he was ordered to quit that post however in favour of a powerful negro and made to sit in the bow and paddle there  ailie was placed with great care in the centre of the canoe among a heap of soft leopardskins for the savages evidently regarded her as something worth preservinga rare and beautiful specimen perhaps of the white monkey  this done they leaped into their large canoe and attaching the smaller one to it by means of a rope paddled out from the bank and descended the stream  oh  glynn exclaimed ailie in a whisperfor she felt that things were beginning to look seriouswhat are we to do  indeed my pet i dont know replied glynn looking round and encountering the gaze of the negro in the stern at whom he frowned darkly and received a savage grin by way of reply  i would like so much to say something to you continued ailie but im afraid he will know what i say  never fear ailie hes as deaf as a post to our language  out with it  could you not she said in a halfwhisper cut the rope and then paddle away back while they are paddling down the river  glynn laughed in spite of himself at this proposal  and what my pretty one he said what should we do with the fellow in the stern  besides the rascals in front might take it into their heads to paddle after us you know and what then  im sure i dont know said ailie beginning to cry  now dont cry my darling said glynn looking over his shoulder with much concern  ill manage to get you out of this scrape somehownow see if i dont  the youth spoke so confidently that the child felt somehow comforted so drying her eyes she lay back among the leopardskins where giving vent to an occasional sob she speedily fell fast asleep  they continued to advance thus in silence for nearly an hour crossed a small lake and again entered the river  after descending this some time the attention of the whole party was attracted to a group of hippopotami gambolling in the mudbanks and in the river a short distance ahead  at any other time glynn would have been interested in the sight of these uncouth monsters but he had seen so many within the last few days that he was becoming comparatively indifferent to them and at that moment he was too much filled with anxiety to take any notice of them  the creatures themselves however did not seem to be so utterly indifferent to the strangers  they continued their gambols until the canoes were quite near and then they dived  now hippopotami as we have before hinted are clumsy and stupid creatures so much so that they occasionally run against and upset boats and canoes quite unintentionally  knowing this the natives in the large canoe kept a sharp lookout in order to steer clear of them  they had almost succeeded in passing the place when a huge fellow like a sugarpunchean rose close to the small canoe and grazed it with his tail  apparently he considered this an attack made upon him by the boat for he wheeled round in a rage and swam violently towards it the negro and glynn sprang to their feet on the instant and the former raised his paddle to deal the creature a blow on the head  before he could do so glynn leaped lightly over ailie who had just awakened caught the savage by the ankles and tossed him overboard  he fell with a heavy splash just in front of the cavernous jaws of the hippopotamus in fact he had narrowly escaped falling headfirst into the creatures open throat  the nearness of the animal at the time was probably the means of saving the negros life for it did not observe where he had vanished to as he sank under its chin and was pushed by its forelegs right under its body  in its effort to lay hold of the negro the hippopotamus made a partial dive and thus passed the small canoe  when it again rose to the surface the large canoe met its eye  at this it rushed drove its hammerlike skull through the light material of which it was made and then seizing the broken ends in its strong jaws upset the canoe and began to rend it to pieces in its fury  before this occurred the crew had leaped into the water and were now swimming madly to the shore  at the same moment glynn cut the line that fastened the two canoes together and seizing his paddle urged his craft up the river as fast as possible  but his single arm could not drive it with much speed against the stream and before he had advanced a dozen yards one of the natives overtook him and several more followed close behind  glynn allowed the first one to come near and then gave him a tremendous blow on the head with the edge of the paddle  the young sailor was not in a gentle frame of mind at that time by any means  the blow was given with a will and would probably have fractured the skull of a white man but that of a negro is proverbially thick  the fellow was only stunned and fell back among his comrades who judiciously considering that such treatment was not agreeable and ought not to be courted put about and made for the shore  glynn now kept his canoe well over to the left side of the stream while the savages ran along the right bank yelling ferociously and occasionally attempting to swim towards him but without success  he was somewhat relieved and sent them a shout of defiance which was returned of course with interest  still he felt that his chance of escape was poor  he was becoming exhausted by the constant and violent exertion that was necessary in order to make head against the stream the savages knew this and bided their time  as he continued to labour slowly up glynn came to the mouth of a small stream which joined the river  he knew not where it might lead to but feeling that he could not hold out much longer he turned into it without any very definite idea as to what he would attempt next  the stream was sluggish  he advanced more easily and after a few strokes of the paddle doubled round a point and was hid from the eyes of the negroes who immediately set up a yell and plunged into the river intending to swim over but fortunately it was much too rapid in the middle and they were compelled to return  we say fortunately because had they succeeded in crossing they would have found glynn in the bushes of the point behind which he had disappeared in a very exhausted state though prepared to fight to the last with all the energy of despair  as it was he had the extreme satisfaction of seeing his enemies after regaining the right bank set off at a quick run down the river  he now remembered having seen a place about two miles further down that looked like a ford and he at once concluded his pursuers had set off to that point and would speedily return and easily recapture him in the narrow little stream into which he had pushed  to cross the large river was impossiblethe canoe would have been swamped in the rapid  but what was to hinder him from paddling close in along the side and perhaps reach the lake while the negroes were looking for him up the small stream  he put this plan into execution at once and ailie took a paddle in her small hands and did her utmost to help him  it wasnt much poor thing but to hear the way in which glynn encouraged her and spoke of her efforts one would have supposed she had been as useful as a fullgrown man  after a couple of hours hard work they emerged upon the lake and here glynn felt that he was pretty safe because in the still water no man could swim nearly as fast as he could paddle  besides it was now getting dark so he pushed out towards a rocky islet on which there were only a few small bushes resolved to take a short rest there and then continue his flight under cover of the darkness  while glynn carried ashore some biscuit which was the only thing in the boat they could eat without cooking ailie broke off some branches from the low bushes that covered the little rocky islet and spread them out on a flat rock for a couch this done she stood on the top of a large stone and gazed round upon the calm surface of the beautiful lake in the dark depths of which the stars twinkled as if there were another sky down there  now ailie said glynn come along and have supper  its not a very tempting one but we must content ourselves with hard fare and a hard bed tonight as i dare not light a fire lest the negroes should observe it and catch us  im sorry for that replied the child for a fire is so nice and cheery and it helps to keep off the wild beasts too doesnt it  well it does but there are no wild beasts on such a small rock as this and the sides are luckily too steep for crocodiles to crawl up  shall we sleep here till morning asked ailie munching her hard biscuit and drinking her tin pannikinful of cold water with great relish for she was very hungry  oh no replied glynn  we must be up and away in an hour at farthest  so as i see youre about done with your luxurious supper i propose that you lie down to rest  ailie was only too glad to accede to this proposal  she lay down on the branches and after glynn had covered her with a blanket he stretched himself on a leopardskin beside her and both of them fell asleep in five minutes  the mosquitoes were very savage that night but the sleepers were too much fatigued to mind their vicious attacks  glynn slept two hours and then he wakened with a start as most persons do when they have arranged before going to sleep to rise at a certain hour  he rose softly carried the provisions back to the canoe and in his sleepy condition almost stepped upon the head of a huge crocodile which ignorant of their presence had landed its head on the islet in order to have a snooze  then he roused ailie and led her more than half asleep down to the beach and lifted her into the canoe after which he pushed off and paddled briskly over the still waters of the starlit lake  ailie merely yawned during all these proceedings said dear me is it time toyeaow oh im so sleepy mumbled something about papa wondering what had become of jim scroggles and about her being convinced thatyeaowthe ship must have lost itself among the whales and monkeys and then dropping her head on the leopardskins with a deep sigh of comfort she returned to the land of nod  glynn proctor worked so well that it was still early in the morning and quite dark when he arrived at the encampment where they had been made prisoners  his heart beat audibly as he approached the dark landingplace and observed no sign of his comrades  the moment the bow of the canoe touched the shore he sprang over the side and without disturbing the little sleeper drew it gently up the bank and fastened the bowrope to a tree then he hurried to the spot where they had slept and found all the fires out except one of which a few dull embers still remained but no comrade was visible  it is a felicitous arrangement of our organs of sense that where one organ fails to convey to our inward man information regarding the outward world another often steps in to supply its place and perform the needful duty  we have said that glynn proctor saw nothing of his comradesalthough he gazed earnestly all round the campfor the very good reason that it was almost pitchdark but although his eyes were useless his ears were uncommonly acute and through their instrumentality he became cognisant of a sound  it might have been distant thunder but was too continuous and regular for that  it might have been the distant rumbling of heavy wagons or artillery over a paved road but there were neither wagons nor roads in those african wilds it might have been the prolonged choking of an alligatorit might in fact have been anything in a region like that where everything almost was curious and new and strange and wild and unaccountable and the listener was beginning to entertain the most uncomfortable ideas of what it probably was when a gasp and a peculiar snort apprised him that it was a human snoreat least if not a human snore it was that of some living creature which indulged to a very extravagant degree in that curious and altogether objectionable practice  stepping cautiously forward on tiptoe glynn searched among the leaves all round the fire following the direction of the sounds but nothing was to be found and he experienced a slight feeling of supernatural dread creeping over him when a peculiarly loud metallic snore sounded clear above his head  looking up he beheld by the dull red light of the almost extinct fire the form of phil briant halfseated halfreclining on the branch of a tree not ten feet from the ground and clasping another branch tightly with both arms  at that moment ailie who had awakened ran up and caught glynn by the hand  hallo  briant exclaimed glynn  a very loud snore was the reply  briant  phil briant i say hallo  phil shouted glynn  arrah howld yer noise will ye muttered the still sleeping mansnoooore  a fall a fallall hands ahoy tumble up there tumble up shouted glynn in the nautical tones which he well knew would have their effect upon his comrade  he was right  they had more than their usual effect on him  the instant he heard them phil briant shouteday ay sir and throwing his legs over the side of what he supposed to be his hammock he came down bodily on what he supposed to be the deck with a whack that caused him to utter an involuntary but tremendous howl  oh och oh murther oh whirra he cried as he lay halfstunned oh its kilt i am entirelydead as mutton at last an no mistake sure i might have knowd itoch worse luck  didnt yer poor owld mother tell ye phil that yed come to a bad endshe did  are ye badly hurt said glynn stooping over his friend in real alarm  at the sound of his voice briant ceased his wails rose into a sitting posture shaded his eyes with his hand a most unnecessary proceeding under the circumstances and stared at him  its me phil all right and ailie  weve escaped and got safe back again  its jokin ye are said briant with the imbecile smile of a man who only half believes what he actually sees  im draimin thats it  go away avic an dont be botherin me  its quite true though i assure you my boy  ive managed to give the niggers the slip and heres ailie too all safe and ready to convince you of the fact  phil briant looked at one and then at the other in unbounded amazement for a few seconds after which he gave a short laugh as if of pity for his own weakness and his face assumed a mild aspect as he said softly its all a draim av coorse it is  he even turned away his eyes for a moment in order to give the vision time to dissipate  but on looking round again there it was as palpable as ever  faith in the fidelity of his own eyesight returned in a moment and phil briant forgetting his bodily pains sprang to his feet with a roar of joy seized ailie in his arms and kissed her embraced glynn proctor with a squeeze like that of a loving bear and then began to dance an irish jig quite regardless of the fact that the greater part of it was performed in the fire the embers of which he sent flying in all directions like a display of fireworks  he cheered too now and then like a maniacoh happy day ive found ye have i after all me trouble too  hooray an wan chair more for luck  av me sowl only dont lape clane out o me body its meselfll be thankful  but sureim forgittin  briant paused suddenly in the midst of his uproarious dance and seized a burning stick which he attempted to blow into a flame with intense vehemence of action  having succeeded he darted towards an open space a few yards off in the centre of which lay a large pile of dry sticks to these he applied the lighted brand and the next instant a glare of ruddy flame leaped upwards and sent a shower of sparks high above the forest trees into the sky  he then returned panting a good deal but much composed and saidnow darlints come an help me to gather the bits o stick somebodys bin scatterin them all over the place they have bad luck to them an then yell sit down and talk a bit an tell me all about it  but whats the fire for asked ailie  ay ye may say that added glynn we dont need such a huge bonfire as that to cook our supper with  och be aisy do  itll do its work small doubt o that  the capn poor man ye know is amost deranged an theyre every one o them off at this good minute scourin the woods lookin for ye  o then its sore hearts weve had this day  an wan was sent wan way an wan another an the capn hisself he wint up the river and before he goes he says to me says he briant youll stop here and watch the camp for maybe theyll come wanderin back to it av theyve bin and lost theirselves an mind ye dont lave it or go to slape  an if they do come or ye hear any news o them jist you light up a great fire an ill be on the lookout an well all on us come back as fast as we can  now thats the truth an the whole truth an nothin but the truth as the judge said to the witness when he swore at him  this was a comforting piece of information to glynn and ailie so without further delay they assisted their overjoyed comrade to collect the scattered embers of the fire and boil the kettle  in this work they were all the more energetic that the pangs of hunger were beginning to remind them of the frugal and scanty nature of their last meal  the bonfire did its work effectually  from all parts of the forest to which they had wandered the party came dropping in one by one to congratulate the lost and found pair  last of all came captain dunning and tim rokens for the harpooner had vowed he would stick to the capn through thick and thin  tim kept his word faithfully  through thick tangled brakes and thin mudswamps did he follow his wretched commander that night until he could scarcely stand for fatigue or keep his eyes open for sleep and when the captain rushed into the camp at last and clasped his sobbing child to his heart tim rokens rushed in along with him halted beside him thrust his hands into his pockets and looked on while his eyes blinked with irresistible drowsiness and his mudbespattered visage beamed with excessive joy    chapter thirteen  philosophical remarks on lifea monkey shot and a monkey foundjacko described  such is life  there is deep meaning in that expression though it is generally applied in a bantering manner to life in all its phases under all its peculiar and diversified circumstances  taking a particular view of things in general we may say of life that it is composed of diverse and miscellaneous materialsthe grave and the gay the sad and the comic the extraordinary and the commonplace the flat and the piquant the heavy and the light the religious and the profane the bright and the dark the shadow and the sunshine  all these and a great deal more similar as well as dissimilar enter into the composition of what we familiarly term life  these elements too are not arranged according to order at least order that is perceptible to our feeble human understandings  that there does exist both order and harmony is undeniable but we cannot see it  the elements appear to be miscellaneously intermingledto be accidentally thrown together yet while looking at them in detail there seems to us a good deal of unreasonable and chaotic jumble in regarding them as a whole or as a series of wholes it becomes apparent that there is a certain harmony of arrangement that may be termed kaleidoscopically beautiful and when in the course of events we are called to the contemplation of something grand or lovely followed rather abruptly by something curiously contemptible or absurd we are tempted to give utterance to the thoughts that are too complicated and deep for rapid analysis in the curt expression such is life  the physician invites his friends to a social reunion  he chats and laughs at the passing jest or takes part in the musicthe glee or the comic song  a servant whispers in his ear  ten minutes elapse and he is standing by the bed of death  he watches the flickering flame he endeavours to relieve the agonised frame he wipes the cold sweat from the pale brow and moistens the dry lips or pours words of true earnest tender comfort into the ears of the bereaved  the contrast here is very violent and sudden  we have chosen perhaps the most striking instance of the kind that is afforded in the experience of men yet such in a greater or less degree is life in the case of every one born into this wonderful world of ours and such undoubtedly it was intended to be  there is a time for all things  we were made capable of laughing and crying therefore these being sinless indulgences in the abstract we ought to laugh and cry  and one of our great aims in life should be to get our hearts and affections so trained that we shall laugh and cry at the right time  it may be well to remark in passing that we should avoid if possible doing both at once  now such being life we consider that we shall be doing no violence to the harmonies of life if we suddenly and without further preface transport the reader into the middle of next day and a considerable distance down the river up which we have for some time been travelling  here he or she will find ailie and her father and the whole party in fact floating calmly and pleasantly down the stream in their canoe  now this is wot i do enjoy said rokens laying down his paddle and wiping the perspiration from his brow its the pleasantest sort o thing ive known since i went to sea  to judge from the profuse perspiration that flowed from his brow and from the excessive redness of his face one would suppose that rokens experience of pleasant sort o things had not hitherto been either extensive or deep  but the man meant what he said and a wellknown proverb clears up the mysterywhats one mans meat is anothers poison  hard work violent physical exertion and excessive heat were rokens delight and whatever may be the opinion of flabbymuscled flat individuals there can be no reasonable doubt that rokens meant it when he added emphatically its fussrate tiptop a1 on lloyds thats a fact  phil briant on hearing this laid down his paddle also wiped his forehead with the sleeve of his coat and exclaimedditto says i  whereupon glynn laughed and jim scroggles grunted this being his method of laughing and the captain shook his head and said  praps it is my lads a pleasant sort o thing but the sooner were out of it the better  ive no notion of a country where the natives murder poor little boys in cold blood and carry off your goods and chattels at a moments notice  the captain looked at ailie as he spoke thereby implying that she was part of the goods and chattels referred to  shure its a fact an without sayin by yer lave too added briant who had a happy facility of changing his opinion on the shortest notice to accommodate himself to circumstances  oh the monkey screamed ailie  now as ailie screamed this just as briant ceased to speak and moreover pointed or appeared to point straight into that individuals face it was natural to suppose that the child was becoming somewhat personalthe more so that briants visage when wrinkled up and tanned by the glare of a tropical sun was not unlike to that of a large baboon  but every one knew that ailie was a gentle wellbehaved creatureexcept perhaps when she was seized with one of her gleeful fits that bordered sometimes upon mischiefso that instead of supposing that she had made a personal attack on the unoffending irishman the boats crew instantly directed their eyes close past briants face and into the recesses of the wood beyond where they saw a sight that filled them with surprise  a largeleaved tree of the palm species overhung the banks of the river and formed a support to a wild vine and several brightflowering parasitical plants that drooped in graceful luxuriance from its branches and swept the stream which at that place was dark smooth and deep on the top of this tree in among the branches sat a monkeyat least so ailie called it but the term ape or baboon would have been more appropriate for the creature was a very large one and if the expression of its countenance indicated in any degree the feelings of its heart also a very fierce onean exceedingly ferocious one indeed this monkeys face was as black as coal and its two deepseated eyes were if possible blacker than coal  its head was bald but the rest of its body was plentifully covered with hair  now this monkey was evidently caughttaken by surprisefor instead of trying to escape as the canoe approached it sat there chattering and exhibiting its teeth to a degree that was quite fiendish not to say under the circumstancesunnecessary  as the canoe dropped slowly down the river it became obvious that this monkey had a baby for a very small and delicate creature was seen clinging round the big ones waist with its little hands grasping tightly the long hair on the mothers sides its arms being much too short to encircle her body  ailies heart leapt with an emotion of tender delight as she observed that the baby monkeys face was white and sweetlooking yes we might even go the length of saying that for a monkey it was actually pretty  but it had a subdued sorrowful look that was really touching to behold  it seemed as though that infantine monkey had in the course of its brief career been subjected to every species of affliction to every imaginable kind of heartcrushing sorrow and had remained deeply meek and humble under it all  only for one brief instant did a different expression cross its melancholy face  that was when it first caught sight of the canoe  then it exposed its very small teeth and gums after the fashion of its mother but repentance seemed to follow instantly for the sad look mixed with a dash of timidity resumed its place and it buried its face in its mothers bosom  at that moment there was a loud report  a bullet whistled through the air and struck the old monkey in the breast  we are glad to say for the credit of our sailors that a howl of indignation immediately followed and more than one fist was raised to smite the trader who had fired the shot  but captain dunning called the men to order in a peremptory voice while every eye was turned towards the tree to observe the effect of the shot  as for ailie she sat breathless with horror at the cruelty of the act  the old monkey gave vent to a loud yell clutched her breast with her hands sprang wildly into the air and fell to the ground  her leap was so violent that the young one was shaken off and fell some distance from its poor mother which groaned once or twice and then died  the baby seemed unhurt  gathering itself nimbly up it ran away from the men who had now landed but who stood still by the captains orders to watch its motions  looking round it observed its mothers form lying on the ground and at once ran towards it and buried its little face in her breast at which sight ailie began to cry quietly  in a few seconds the little monkey got up and gently pawed the old one then on receiving no sign of recognition it uttered a faint wail something like weeweeweeweeoo and again hid its face in the breast of its dead parent  ah the poor cratur said briant in a tone of voice that betrayed his emotion  o why did ye kill her  me ketch im said bumble looking inquiringly at the captain  oh do answered ailie with a sob  the negro deemed this permission sufficient for he instantly sprang forward and throwing a piece of net over the little monkey secured it  now the way in which that baby monkey struggled and kicked and shrieked when it found itself a prisoner was perfectly wonderful to see  it seemed as if the strength of fifty little monkeys had been compressed into its diminutive body and king bumble had to exert all his strength in order to hold the creature while he carried it into the canoe  once safely there and in the middle of the stream it was let loose  the first thing it did on being set free was to give a shriek of triumph for monkeys like men when at last allowed to do that which they have long struggled in vain to accomplish usually take credit for the achievement of their own success  its next impulse was to look round at the faces of the men in search of its mother but the poor mother was now lying dead covered with a cloth in the bottom of the canoe so the little monkey turned from one to another with disappointment in its glance and then uttered a low wail of sorrow  glynn proctor affirmed positively that it looked twice at phil briant and even made a motion towards him but we rather suspect that glynn was jesting  certain it is however that it looked long and earnestly at ailie and there is little doubt that young though it was it was able to distinguish something in her tender gaze of affection and pity that proved attractive  it did not however accept her invitation to go to her although given in the most persuasive tones of her silver voice and when any of the men tried to pat its head it displayed such a row of sharp little teeth and made such a fierce demonstration of its intention to bite that they felt constrained to leave it alone  at last ailie held her hand towards it and said  wont it come to me dear sweet pet  do come ill be as kind to you almost as your poor mother  the monkey looked at the child but said nothing  come monkey dear puggy do come repeated ailie in a still more insinuating voice  the monkey still declined to come but it looked very earnestly at the child and trembled a good deal and said oooowee oooowee  as ailie did not quite understand this she said poor thing and again held out her hand  try it with a small taste o mate suggested briant  right said the captain  hand me the biscuitbag glynn  there now ailie try it with that  ailie took the piece of biscuit offered to her by her father and held it out to the monkey who advanced with nervous caution and very slowly scratching its side the while  putting out its very small hand it touched the biscuit then drew back the hand suddenly and made a variety of sounds accompanied by several peculiar contortions of visage all of which seemed to say dont hurt me now dont deceive me pray  again it put forth its hand and took the biscuit and ate it in a very great hurry indeed that is to say it stuffed it into the bags in its cheeks  ailie gave it a bit more biscuit which it received graciously and devoured voraciously whereupon she put forth her hand and sought to pat the little creature on the head  the attempt was successful  with many slight grins as though to say take care now else ill bite the small monkey allowed ailie to pat its head and stroke its back then it permitted her to take hold of its hand and draw it towards her in a few minutes it showed evident symptoms of a desire to be patted again and at length it drew timidly towards the child and took hold of her hand in both of its delicate pink paws  ailie felt quite tenderly towards the creature and stroked its head again whereupon it seemed suddenly to cast aside all fear  it leaped upon her knee put its slender arms as far round her neck as possible said oooowee several times in a very sad tone of voice and laid its head upon her bosom  this was too much for poor ailie she thought of the dead mother of this infant monkey and wept as she stroked its hairy little head and shoulders  from that time forward the monkey adopted ailie as its mother and ailie adopted the monkey as her child  now the behaviour of that monkey during the remainder of that voyage was wonderful  oh you know it was altogether preposterous to say the very least of it  affection which displayed itself in a desire to conciliate the favour of every one was ingrained in its bones while deception which was evinced in a constant effort to appear to be intent upon one thing when it was really bent upon another was incorporated with its marrow  at first it was at war with every one excepting of course ailie its adopted mother but soon it became accustomed to the men and in the course of a few days would go to any one who called it  phil briant was a particular favourite so was rokens with whose black beard it played in evident delight running its slender fingers through it disentangling the knots and the matted portions which the owner of the beard had never yet been able to disentangle in a satisfactory way for himself and otherwise acting the part of a barber and hairdresser to that bold mariner much to his amusement and greatly to the delight and admiration of the whole party  to say that that small monkey had a face would be to assert what was unquestionably true but what also was very far short of the whole truth  no one ever could make up his mind exactly as to how many faces it had  if you looked at it at any particular time and then shut your eyes and opened them a moment after that monkey as far as expression went had another and a totally different face  repeat the operation and it had a third face continue the process and it had a fourth face and so on until you lost count altogether of its multitudinous faces now it was grave and pensive anon it was blazing with amazement again it bristled with indignation then it glared with anger and presently it was all sereneblended love and wrinkles  of all these varied expressions that of commingled surprise and indignation was the most amusing because these emotions had the effect of not only opening its eyes and its mouth to the form of three excessively round os but also raised a small tuft of hair just above its forehead into a bristling position and threw its brow into an innumerable series of wrinkles this complex expression was of frequent occurrence for its feelings were tender and sensitive so that it lived in the firm belief that its new friends always excepting ailie constantly wished to insult it and was afflicted with a chronic state of surprise at the cruelty and of indignation at the injustice of men who could wantonly injure the feelings of so young and especially so small a monkey  when the men called it it used to walk up to them with calm deliberate condescension in its air when ailie held out her hand it ran on its two legs and being eager in its affections it held out its arms in order to be caught up  as to food that monkey was not particular  it seemed to be omnivorous  certain it is that it never refused anything but more than once it was observed quietly to throw away things that it did not relish  once in an unguarded moment it accepted and chewed a small piece of tobacco after which it made a variety of entirely new faces and became very sick indeedso sick that its adopted mother began to fear she was about to lose her child but after vomiting a good deal and moaning piteously for several days it gradually recovered and from that time entertained an unquenchable hatred for tobacco and for the man who had given it to him who happened to be jim scroggles  ailie being of a romantic temperament named her monkey albertino but the sailors called him jacko and their name ultimately became the wellknown one of the little foundling for ailie was not obstinate so seeing that the sailors did not or could not remember albertino she soon gave in and styled her pet jacko to the end of the chapter with which piece of information we shall conclude this chapter    chapter fourteen  rencontre with slavetraderson board againa start a misfortune a ghost story a mistake and an invitation to dinner  on the evening of the second day after the capture of jacko as the canoe was descending the river and drawing near to the seacoast much to the delight of everyonefor the heat of the interior had begun to grow unbearablea ships boat was observed moored to the wharf near the slavestation which they had passed on the way up  at first it was supposed to be one of the boats of the red eric but on a nearer approach this proved to be an erroneous opinion  wot can it be adoin of here inquired tim rokens in an abstracted tone of voice as if he put the question to himself and therefore did not expect an answer  no doubt its a slavers boat replied the trader they often come up here for cargoes of niggers  och the blackguards exclaimed phil briant all his blood rising at the mere mention of the horrible traffic couldnt we land capting and give them a lickin  ill engage meself to put six at laste o the spalpeens on their beamends  no phil we shant land for that purpose but well land for some gunpowder an a barrel or two of plantains so give way lads  in another moment the bow of the canoe slid upon the mudbank of the river close to the slavers boat which was watched by a couple of the most villainouslooking men that ever took part in that disgraceful traffic  they were evidently portuguese sailors and the scowl of their bronzed faces when they saw the canoe approach the landingplace showed that they had no desire to enter into amicable converse with the strangers  at this moment the attention of the travellers was drawn to a gang of slaves who approached the wharf chained together by the neck and guarded by the crew of the portuguese boat  ailie looked on with a feeling of dread that induced her to cling to her fathers hand while the men stood with folded arms compressed lips and knitted brows  on the voyage up they had landed at this station and had seen the slaves in their places of confinement  the poor creatures were apparently happy at that time and seemed totally indifferent to their sad fate but their aspect was very different now  they were being hurried away they knew not whither by strangers whom they had been taught to believe were monsters of cruelty besides being cannibals and who had purchased them for the purpose of killing them and eating their bodies  the wild terrified looks of the men and the subdued looks and trembling gait of the women showed that they expected no mercy at the hands of their captors  they hung back a little as they drew near to the boat whereupon one of their conductors who seemed to be in command of the party uttered a fierce exclamation in portuguese and struck several of the men and women indiscriminately severe blows with his fists  in a few minutes they were all placed in the boat and the crew had partly embarked when phil briant unable to restrain himself muttered between his teeth to the portuguese commander as he passed  ye imp o darkness av i only had ye in the ring for tshwo minitsjist tshwoah thin wouldnt i polish ye off  fat you say sare cried the man turning fiercely towards briant and swearing at him in bad english  say is it  oh then theres a translation for ye thats understood in all lingos  phil shook his clenched fist as close as possible to the nose of the portuguese commander without actually coming into contact with that hooked and prominent organ  the man started back and drew his knife at the same time calling to several of his men who advanced with their drawn knives  ho cried briant and a jovial smile overspread his rough countenance as he sprang to a clear spot of ground and rolled up both sleeves of his shirt to the shoulders thereby displaying a pair of arms that might at a rapid glance have been mistaken for a pair of legsthats yer game is it wont i stave in yer planks wont i shiver yer timbers and knock out yer daylights bless yer purty faces  i didnt think ye had it in ye come on darlintstoothpicks and allas many as ye like the more the betterwan at a time or all at wance it dont matter not the laste be no manes  while briant gave utterance to these liberal invitations he performed a species of revolving dance and flourished his enormous fists in so ludicrous a manner that despite the serious nature of the fray the two parties were likely to be speedily engaged in his comrades could not restrain their laughter  go it pat cried one  true blue shouted another  silence cried captain dunning in a voice that enforced obedience get into the canoe briant  och capting exclaimed the wrathful irishman reproachfully sure ye wouldnt spile the fun  go to the canoe sir  ah capting dear jist wan round  go to the canoe i say  ill do it all in four minits an wan quarter av yell only shut yer eyes pleaded phil  obey orders will you cried the captain in a voice there was no mistaking  briant indignantly thrust his fists into his breeches pockets and rolled slowly down towards the canoe asto use one of his own favourite expressionssulky as a bear with a broken head  meanwhile the captain stepped up to the portuguese sailors and told them to mind their own business and let honest men alone adding that if they did not take his advice he would first give them a licking and then pitch them all into the river  this last remark caused briant to prick up his ears and withdraw his fists from their inglorious retirement in the fond hope that there might still be work for them to do but on observing that the portuguese acting on the principle that discretion is the better part of valour had taken the advice and were returning to their own boat he relapsed into the sulks and seated himself doggedly in his place in the canoe  during all this little scene which was enacted much more rapidly than it had been described master jacko having escaped from the canoe had been seated near the edge of the wharf looking on apparently with deep interest  just as the portuguese turned away to embark in their boat ailies eye alighted on her pet at the same moment the foot of the portuguese commander alighted on her pets tail  now the tails of all animals seem to be peculiarly sensitive  jackos certainly was so for he instantly uttered a shriek of agony which was as quickly responded to by its adopted mother in a scream of alarm as she sprang forward to the rescue  when one unintentionally treads on the tail of any animal and thereby evokes a yell he is apt to start and tripin nine cases out of ten he does trip  the portuguese commander tripped upon this occasion  in staggering out of the monkeys way he wellnigh tumbled over ailie and in seeking to avoid her he tumbled over the edge of the wharf into the river  the difference between the appearance of this redoubtable slavebuying hero before and after his involuntary immersion was so remarkable and great that his most intimate friend would have failed to recognise him he went down into the slimy liquid an illfavoured portuguese clad in white duck he came up a worsefavoured monstrosity clothed in mud even his own rascally comrades grinned at him for a moment but their grins changed into a scowl of anger when they heard the peals of laughter that burst from the throats of their enemies  as for briant he absolutely hugged himself with delight  och yeve got it ye have he exclaimed at intervals  happy day whod ha thought it to see him tumbled in the mud after all by purty little ailie and jacko  come here to me jacko owld coon  oh ye swate cratur  briant seized the monkey and squeezed it to his breast and kissed it yes he actually kissed its nose in the height of his glee and continued to utter incoherent exclamations and to perpetrate incongruous absurdities until long after they had descended the river and left the muddy portuguese and his comrades far behind them  towards evening the party were once more safe and sound on board the red eric where they found everything repaired and the ship in a fit state to proceed to sea immediately  his majesty king bumble was introduced to the steward then to the cook and then to the caboose  master jacko was introduced to the ships crew and to his quarters which consisted of a small box filled with straw and was lashed near the foot of the mizzenmast  these introductions having been made the men who had accompanied their commander on his late excursion into the interior went forward and regaled their messmates for hours with anecdotes of their travels in the wilds of africa  it is wellknown and generally acknowledged that all sublunary things pleasant as well as unpleasant must come to an end  in the course of two days more the sojourn of the crew of the red eric on the coast of africa came to a termination  having taken in supplies of fresh provisions the anchor was weighed and the ship stood out to sea with the first of the ebb tide  it was near sunset when the sails were hoisted and filled by a gentle land breeze and the captain had just promised ailie that he would show her blue water again by breakfasttime next morning when a slight tremor passed through the vessels hull causing the captain to shout with a degree of vigour that startled everyone on board all hands ahoy lower away the boats mr millons were hard and fast aground on a mudbank  the boats were lowered away with all speed and the sails dewed up instantly but the red eric remained as immovable as the bank on which she had run aground there was therefore no recourse but to wait patiently for the rising tide to float her off again  fortunately the bank was soft and the wind light else it might have gone ill with the good ship  there is scarcely any conceivable condition so favourable to quiet confidential conversation and storytelling as the one in which the men of the whaleship now found themselves  the night was calm and dark but beautiful for a host of stars sparkled in the sable sky and twinkled up from the depths of the dark ocean  the land breeze had fallen and there was scarcely any sound to break the surrounding stillness except the lipping water as it kissed the black hull of the ship  a dim scarce perceptible light rendered every object on board mysterious and unaccountably large  wot a night for a ghost story observed jim scroggles who stood with a group of the men who were seated on and around the windlass  i dont blieve in ghosts said dick barnes stoutly in a tone of voice that rendered the veracity of his assertion to say the least of it doubtful  nother do i remarked nikel sling who had just concluded his culinary operations for the day and sought to employ his brief interval of relaxation in social intercourse with his fellows  being engaged in ministering to the animal wants of his comrades all day he felt himself entitled to enjoy a little of the feast of reason and the flow of soul at night  no more duv i added phil briant firmly at the same time hitting his thigh a slap with his open hand that caused all round him to start  you dont dont you said tim rokens addressing the company generally and looking round gravely while he pushed the glowing tobacco into his pipe with the point of a marlinespike  to this there was a chorus of noes but a close observer would have noticed that nearly the whole conversation was carried on in low tones and that many a glance was cast behind as if these bold sceptics more than half expected all the ghosts that did happen to exist to seize them then and there and carry them off as a punishment for their unbelief  tim rokens drew a few whiffs of his pipe and looked round gravely before he again spoke then he put the following momentous question with the air of a man who knew he could overturn his adversary whatever his reply should be  an why dont ye blieve in em  we cannot say positively that tim rokens put the question to jim scroggles but it is certain that jim scroggles accepted the question as addressed to him and answered in reply  cause why  i never seed a ghost an nobody never seed a ghost an i dont blieve in what i cant see  jim said this as if he thought the position incontestable  tim regarded him with a prolonged stare but for some time said nothing  at last he emitted several strong puffs of smoke and said  young man did you ever see your own mind  no in course not  did anybody else ever see it  cernly not  then of course you dont believe in it added rokens while a slight smile curled his upper lip  the men chuckled a good deal at jims confusion while he in vain attempted to explain that the two ideas were not parallel by any means at this juncture phil briant came to the rescue  ah now git out said he  i agree with jim intirely an tim rokens isnt quite so cliver as he thinks  now look here lads heres how it stands xactly  jim says he never seed his own mindvery good and he says as how nobody else niver seed it nother well and wot then  dont you observe its cause he hant got none at all to see  he hant got even the ghost of one so how could ye expect anybody to see it  oh hold yer noise paddy exclaimed dick barnes an lets have a ghost story from tim rokens  he blieves in ghosts anyhow an could give us a yarn about em i knows if he likes  come along now tim like a good fellow  ay thats it cried briant give us a stiff un now  dont be afeard to skear us old boy  oh i can give ye a yarn about ghosts cernly said tim rokens looking into the bowl of his pipe in order to make sure that it was sufficiently charged to last out the story  ill tell ye of a ghost i once seed and knocked down  knocked down cried nikel sling in surprise why i allers thought as how ghosts was spirits an couldnt be knocked down or cotched neither  not at all replied rokens ghosts is made of all sorts o things brass and iron and linen and buntin and timber it wos a brass ghost the feller that im goin to tell ye about  i say sling interrupted briant av ghosts wos spirits as you thought they wos would they be allowed into the state of maine  oh phil shut up do  now then tim fire away  well then began rokens with great deliberation it was on a vednesday night as it happened  i had bin out at supper with a friend that night and wed had a glass or two o grog for ye see lads it was some years ago afore i tuk to temprance  i had a long way to go over a great dark moor afore i could git to the place where i lodged so i clapped on all sail to git over the moor seein the moon would go down soon but it wouldnt do the moon set when i wos in the very middle of the moor and as the road wasnt over good i wos in a state o confumble lest i should lose it altogether  i looks round in all directions but i couldnt see nothincause why there wasnt nothin to be seen  it was orrid dark i can tell ye  jist one or two stars ashinin like halfadozen farden dips in a great church they only made darkness wisible  i began to feel all over a curous sort o peculiar unaccountableness which it aint easy to explain but is most oncommon disagreeable to feel  it wos very still toodesperate still the beatin o my own heart sounded quite loud and i heerd the tickin o my watch goin like the click of a church clock  oh it was awful  at this point in the story the men crept closer together and listened with intense earnestness  suddently continued rokensfor things in sich circumstances always comes suddentlysuddently i seed somethin black jump up right ahead o me  here rokens paused  wot was it inquired gurney in a solemn whisper  it was resumed rokens slowly the stump of a old tree  oh i thought it had been the ghost said gurney somewhat relieved for that fat little jacktar fully believed in apparitions and always listened to a ghost story in fear and trembling  no it wasnt the ghost it was the stump of a tree  well i set sail again an presently i sees a great white thing risin up ahead o me  hah that was it whispered gurney  no that wasnt it retorted rokens that was a hinn a whitepainted hinn as stood by the roadside and right glad wos i to see it i can tell ye shipmates for i wos gittin tired as well as frightened  i soon roused the landlord by kickin at the door till it nearly comed off its hinges and arter gettin another glass o grog i axed the landlord to show me my bunk as i wanted to turn in  it was a queer old house that hinn wos  a great ramblin place with no end o staircases and passages  a dreadful gloomy sort o place  no one lived in it except the landlord a darkfaced surly fellow as one would like to kick out of his own door and his wife who wos little better than hisself  they also had a hostler but he slept with the cattle in a houthouse  ye wont be feard says the landlord as he hove ahead through the long passages holdin the candle high above his head to show the way to sleep in the far end o the house  its the old bit the new bits undergoin repairs  youll find it comfortable enough though its raither gusty bein old ye see but the weather aint cold so ye wont mind it  oh niver a bit says i quite bold like i dont care a rap for nothin  there aint no ghosts is there  well im not sure many travellers wot has stayed here has said to me theyve seed em particklerly in the old part o the buildin but they seems to be quite harmless and never hurts any one as lets em alone i never seed em myself an theres cernly not more nor halfadozen on emhallo  at that moment shipmates a strong gust o cold air came rushin down the passage we was in and blowd out the candle  ah its gone out said the landlord just wait here a moment and ill light it and with that he shuffled off and left me in the blackest and most thickest darkness i ever wos in in all my life  i didnt dare to move for i didnt know the channels dye see and might ha run myself aground or against the rocks in no time  the wind came moanin down the passage as if all the six ghosts the landlord mentioned and a dozen or two o their friends besides was adyin of stommickcomplaint  im not easy frightened lads but my knees did feel as if the bones in em had turned to water and my hair began to git up on end for i felt it risin  suddenly i saw somethin comin along the passage towards me  thats the ghost now interrupted gurney in a tremulous whisper  rokens paused and regarded his fat shipmate with a look of contemptuous pity then turning to the others he said  it wos the landlord acomin back with the candle  he begged pardon for leavin me in the dark so long and led the way to a room at the far end o the passage  it was a big oldfashioned room with a treemendius high ceiling and no furniture cept one chair one small table and a low campbed in a corner  heres your room says the landlord its wellaired  i may as well mention that the latch of the door aint just the thing  it sometimes blows open with a bang but when you know it may happen you can be on the lookout for it you know and so youll not be taken by surprise  goodnight  with that the fellow set the candle down on the small table at the bedside and left me to my cogitations  i heerd his footsteps echoin as he went clankin along the passages then they died away an i was alone  now i tell ye wot it is shipmates ive bin in miny a fix but i niver wos in sich a fix as that  the room was empty and big so big that the candle could only light up about a quarter of it leavin the rest in gloom  there was one or two old picturs on the walls one on em a portrait of a old admiral with a blue coat and brass buttons and white veskit  it hung just opposite the fut o my bunk an i could hardly make it out but i saw that the admiral kep his eye on me wheriver i turned or moved about the room an twice or thrice if not more i saw him wink with his weather eye  yes he winked as plain as i do myself  says i to myself says i tim rokens youre a british tar an a whaler an a harpooner so tim my boy dont you go for to be a babby  with that i smoked a pipe and took off my clos and tumbled in and feeling a little bolder by this time i blew out the candle  in gittin into bed i knocked over the snuffers wich fell with an awful clatter and my heart lep into my mouth as i lep under the blankets and kivered up my head  howsever i was uncommon tired so before my head was well on the pillow i went off to sleep  how long i slep i cant go for to say but wen i wakened it wos pitchdark  i could only just make out the winder by the pale starlight that shone through it but the moment i set my two eyes on it wot does i see  i seed a sight that made the hair on my head stand on end and my flesh creep up like a muffin  it was a  a ghost whispered gurney while his eyes almost started out of his head  before tim rokens could reply something fell with a heavy flop from the yard over their heads right in among the men and vanished with a shriek  it was jacko who in his nocturnal rambles in the rigging had been shaken off the yard on which he was perched by a sudden lurch of the vessel as the tide began to move her about  at any time such an event would have been startling but at such a time as this it was horrifying  the men recoiled with sharp cries of terror and then burst into laughter as they observed what it was that had fallen amongst them but the laughter was subdued and by no means hearty  ill be the death o that brute yet said gurney wiping the perspiration from his forehead but go on rokens what was it you saw  it was the ghost replied rokens as the men gathered round him againa long thin ghost standin at my bedside  the light was so dim that i couldnt well make it out but i saw that it was white or palelike and that it had on a pointed cap like the cap o an old witch  i thought i should ha died outright and i lay for full five minits tremblin like a leaf and starin full in its face  at last i started up in despair not knowin well wot to do and the moment i did so the ghost disappeared  i thought this was very odd but you may be sure i didnt find fault with it so after lookin all round very careful to make quite sure that it was gone i lay down again on my back  well would ye blieve it shipmates at that same moment up starts the ghost again as bold as iver  and up starts i in a fright but the moment i was up the ghost was gone  now tim rokens says i to myself always keepin my eye on the spot where id last seed the ghost this is queer this is quite remarkable  youre dreamin my lad an the sooner ye put a stop to that ere sort o dreamin the better  havin said this i tried to feel reckless and lay down again and up started the ghost again with its long thin white body an the pointed cap on its head  i noticed too that it wore its cap a little on one side quite jaunty like  so wheniver i sot up that ere ghost disappeared and wheniver i lay down it bolted up again close beside me at last i lost my temper and i shouts out quite loud shiver my timbers says i ghost or no ghost ill knock in your daylights if ye carry on like that any longer and with that i up fist and let drive straight out at the spot where its breadbasket should ha bin  down it went that ghost did with a clatter that made the old room echo like an empty church  i guv it a rap i did sich as it hadnt had since it was bornif ghosts be born at allan my knuckles paid for it too for they was skinned all up then i lay down tremblin and then i dun know how it was i went to sleep  next mornin i got up to look for the ghost and sure enough i found his remains  his pale body lay in a far corner o the room doubled up and smashed to bits and his pointed cap lay in another corner almost flat  that ghost concluded rokens with slow emphasisthat ghost was the candle it wos  the candle exclaimed several of the men in surprise  yes the candle and brass candlestick with the stinguisher atop ot ye see lads the candle stood close to the side o my bed on the table an when i woke up and i saw it there it seemed to me like a big thing in the middle o the room instead o a little thing close to my nose an when i sot up in my bed of coorse i looked right over the top of it and saw nothin an when i lay down of coorse it rose up in the very same place  an let me tell you shipmates added tim in conclusion with the air of a philosopher all ghosts is o the same sort theyre most of em made o wood or brass or some sich stuff as ive good cause to remimber for i had to pay the price o that ere ghost before i left that there hinn on the lonesome moor and for the washin of the blankets too as wos all kivered with blood nixt mornin from my smashed knuckles  theres a morial contained in most things lads if ye only try for to find it out an the morial of my story is this dont ye go for to blieve that everything ye dont xactly understand is a ghost until yeve got to know more about it  while tim rokens was thus recounting his ghostly experiences and moralising thereon for the benefit of his comrades the silent tide was stealthily creeping up the sides of the red eric and placing her gradually on an even keel  at the same time a british manofwar was creeping down upon that innocent vessel with the murderous intention of blowing her out of the water if possible  in order to explain this latter fact we must remind the reader of the boat and crew of the portuguese slaver which was encountered by the party of excursionists on their trip down the river  the vessel to which that boat belonged had been for several weeks previous creeping about off the coast watching her opportunity to ship a cargo of slaves and at the same time to avoid falling into the hands of a british cruiser which was stationed on the african coast to prevent the villainous traffic  the portuguese ship which was very similar in size and shape to the red eric had hitherto managed to elude the cruiser and had succeeded in taking a number of slaves on board ere she was discovered  the cruiser gave chase to her on the same afternoon as that on which the red eric grounded on the mudbank off the mouth of the river  darkness however favoured the slaver and when the land breeze failed she was lost sight of in the intricacies of the navigation at that part of the coast  towards morning while it was yet dark the red eric floated and captain dunning who had paced the deck all night with a somewhat impatient tread called to the matenow mr millons man the boats and let some of the hands standby to trim the sails to the first puff of wind  ay ay sir answered the mate as he sprang to obey  now it is a curious fact that at that identical moment the captain of the cruiser addressed his first lieutenant in precisely the same words for he had caught a glimpse of the whalers topmasts against the dark sky and mistook them very naturally for those of the slaver  in a few seconds the manofwar was in full pursuit  i say dr hopley remarked captain dunning as he gazed intently into the gloom astern did you not hear voices and as i live theres a large ship bearing right down on us  it must be a slaver replied the doctor probably the one that owned the boat we saw up the river  ship on the larboard bow shouted the lookout on the forecastle  hallo ships ahead and astern remarked the captain in surprise there seems to be a school of em in these waters  at this moment the oars of the boats belonging to the ship astern were heard distinctly and a light puff of wind at the same time bulged out the sails of the red eric which instantly forged ahead  ship ahoy shouted a voice from the boats astern in a tone of authority heaveto you rascal or ill sink you  captain dunning turned to the doctor with a look of intense surprise  why doctor thats the usual hail of a pirate or something like it what it can be doing here is past my comprehension  i would as soon expect to find a whale in a washtub as a black flag in these waters port port a little turning to the steersmansteadyso  we must run for it anyhow for were in no fightin trim  the best answer to give to such a hail is silence  contrary to expectation the boats did not again hail but in a few minutes the dark hull of the british cruiser became indistinctly visible as it slipped swiftly through the water before the freshening breeze and neared the comparatively slowgoing whaler rapidly  soon it came within easy range and while captain dunning looked over the taffrail with a troubled countenance trying to make her out the same voice came hoarsely down on the night breeze issuing the same peremptory command  turn up the hands mr millons and serve out pistols and cutlasses get the carronades on the forecastle and quarterdeck loaded mr markham and look alive we must show the enemy a bold front whoever he is  as the captain issued these orders the darkness was for an instant illuminated by a bright flash the roar of a cannon reverberated over the sea a roundshot whistled through the rigging of the red eric and the next instant the foretopsailyard came rattling down upon the deck  immediately after the cruiser ranged up alongside and the order to heaveto was repeated with a threat that was calculated to cause the hair of a man of peace to stand on end  the effect on captain dunning was to induce him to give the order  point the guns there lads and aim high i dont like to draw first bloodeven of a pirate  ship ahoy  who are you and where from inquired captain dunning through the speakingtrumpet  her british majestys frigate firebrand  if you dont heaveto sir instantly ill give you a broadside  who are you and where bound  whew whistled captain dunning to vent his feelings of surprise ere he replied the red eric south sea whaler outward bound  having given this piece of information he ordered the topsails to be backed and the ship was hoveto  meanwhile a boat was lowered from the cruiser and the captain thereof speedily leaped upon the whalers quarterdeck  the explanation that followed was not by any means calculated to allay the irritation of the british captain  he had made quite sure that the red eric was the slaver of which he was in search and the discovery of his mistake induced him to make several rather severe remarks in reference to the crew of the red eric generally and her commander in particular  why didnt you heaveto when i ordered you he said and so save all this trouble and worry  because replied captain dunning drily im not in the habit of obeying orders until i know that he who gives em has a right to do so but tis a pity to waste time talking about such trifles when the craft you are in search of is not very far away at this moment  what mean you sir inquired the captain of the cruiser quickly  i mean that yonder vessel scarcely visible now on the lee bow is the slaver in all likelihood  the captain gave but one hasty glance in the direction pointed to by captain dunning and next moment he was over the side of the ship and the boat was flying swiftly towards his vessel  the rapid orders given on board the cruiser soon after showed that her commander was eagerly in pursuit of the strange vessel ahead and the flash and report of a couple of guns proved that he was again giving orders in his somewhat peremptory style  when daylight appeared captain dunning was still on deck and glynn proctor stood by the wheel  the post of the latter however was a sinecure as the wind had again fallen  when the sun rose it revealed the three vessels lying becalmed within a short distance of each other and several miles off shore  so so exclaimed the captain taking the glass and examining the other vessels  i see its all up with the slaver  serves him right dont it glynn  it does replied glynn emphatically  i hope they will all be hanged isnt that the usual way of serving these fellows out  well not exactly lad  they dont go quite that lengthmores the pity if they did there would be less slavetrading but the rascals will lose both ship and cargo  i wonder said glynn how they can afford to carry on the trade when they lose so many ships as i am told they do every year  you wouldnt wonder boy if you knew the enormous prices got for slaves  why the profits on one cargo safely delivered will more than cover the loss of several vessels and cargoes  you may depend ont they would not carry it on if it did not pay  humph ejaculated glynn giving the wheel a savage turn as if to express his thorough disapprobation of the slavetrade and his extreme disgust at not being able by the strength of his own right arm at once to repress it  and whos to pay for our foretopsailyard he inquired abruptly as if desirous of changing the subject  ourselves i fear replied the captain  we must take it philosophically and comfort ourselves with the fact that it is the foretopsailyard and not the bowsprit or the mainmast that was carried away  its not likely the captain of the cruiser will pay for it at any rate  captain dunning was wrong  that same morning he received a polite note from the commander of the said cruiser requesting the pleasure of his company to dinner in the event of the calm continuing and assuring him that the carpenter and the sailmaker of the manofwar should be sent on board his ship after breakfast to repair damages  captain dunning therefore like an honest straightforward man as he was admitted that he had been hasty in his judgment and stated to glynn proctor emphatically that the commander of the firebrand was a trump    chapter fifteen  new scenesa fight prevented by a whalea stormblown off the yardarmwreck of the red eric  five weeks passed away and really when one comes to consider the matter it is surprising what a variety of events may be compressed into five weeks what an amount of space may be passed over what an immense change of scene and circumstance may be experienced in that comparatively short period of time  men and women who remain quietly at home do not perhaps fully realise this fact  five weeks to them does not usually seem either very long or very short  but let those quiet ones travel let them rush away headlong by the aid of wind and steam to the distant and wonderful parts of this wonderful world of ours and ten to one they will afterwards tell you that the most wonderful discovery they had made during their travels is the fact that a miniature lifetime apparently can be compressed into five weeks  five weeks passed away and in the course of that time the foretopsailyard of the red eric had been repaired the red eric herself had passed from equatorial into southern seas alice dunning had become very seasick which caused her to look uncommonly green in the face and had got well again which caused her to become fresh and rosy as the early morning jacko had thoroughly established his reputation as the most arrant and accomplished thief that ever went to sea king bumble had been maligned and abused again and again and over again despite his protestations of innocence by grimfaced tarquin the steward for having done the deeds which were afterwards discovered to have been committed by jacko fat little gurney had sung innumerable songs of his own composing in which he was ably supported by glynn proctor dr hopley had examined phrenologically all the heads on board with the exception of that of tarquin who would not submit to the operation on any account and had shot and skinned and stuffed a variety of curious seabirds and caught a number of remarkable seafish and had microscopically examinedto the immense interest of ailie and consequently of the captaina great many surprising animalcules called medusae which possessed the most watery and the thinnest possible bodies yet which had the power of emitting a beautiful phosphoric light at night so as to cause the whole ocean sometimes to glow as if with liquid fire phil briant had cracked more jokes good bad and indifferent than would serve to fill a whole volume of closelyprinted pages and had told more stories than would be believed by most people tim rokens and the other harpooners had with the assistance of the various boats crews slain and captured several large whales and nikel sling had prepared and assisted to consume as many breakfasts dinners and suppers as there are days in the period of time above referred toin short those five weeks which we thus dismiss in five minutes might if enlarged upon be expanded into material to fill five volumes such as this which would probably take about five years to writeanother reason for cutting this matter short all this shows how much may be compressed into little space how much may be done and seen in little time and therefore how much value men ought to attach to little things  five weeks passed away as we have already remarked and at the end of that time the red eric found herself one beautiful sunny afternoon becalmed on the breast of the wide ocean with a strange vessel also a whaler a few miles distant from her and a couple of spermwhales sporting playfully about midway between the two ships  jim scroggles on that particular afternoon found himself in the crowsnest at the masthead roaring thar she blows with a degree of energy so appalling that one was almost tempted to believe that that longlegged individual had made up his mind to compress his life into one grand but brief minute and totally exhaust his powers of soul and body in the reiterated vociferation of that one faculty of the spermwhale allowance must be made for jim seeing that this was the first time he had been fortunate enough to raise the oil since he became a whaler  the usual scene of bustle and excitement immediately ensued  the men sprang to their appointed places in a moment the tubs harpoons etcetera were got ready and in a few minutes the three boats were leaping over the smooth swell towards the fish  while this was taking place on board the red eric a precisely similar scene occurred on board the other whaleship and a race now ensued between the boats of the two ships for each knew well that the first boat that harpooned either of the whales claimed it  give way my lads whispered captain dunning eagerly as he watched the other boats we shall be firstwe shall be first only bend your backs  the men needed not to be urged they were quite as anxious as their commander to win the races and bent their backs as he expressed it until the oars seemed about to break  glynn sat on the after thwart and did good service on this occasion  it soon became evident that the affair would be decided by the boats of the two captains both of which took the lead of the others but as they were advancing in opposite directions it was difficult to tell which was the fleeter of the two  when the excitement of the race was at its height the whales went down and the men lay on their oars to wait until they should rise again  they lay in anxious suspense for about a minute when the crew of captain dunnings boat was startled by the sudden apparition of a waterspout close to them by which they were completely drenched  it was immediately followed by the appearance of the huge blunt head of one of the whales which rose like an enormous rock out of the sea close to the starboardquarter  the sight was received with a loud shout and tim rokens leaped up and grasped a harpoon but the whale sheered off  a spare harpoon lay on the sternsheets close to glynn who dropped his oar and seized it almost without knowing what he was about he hurled it with tremendous force at the monsters neck into which it penetrated deeply  the harpoon fortunately happened to be attached to a large buoy called by whalers a drogue which was jerked out of the boat like a cannonshot as the whale went down carrying harpoon and drogue along with it  well done lad cried the captain in great delight youve made a noble beginning  now lads pull gently ahead she wont go far with such an ornament as that dangling at her neck  a capital dart couldnt have done it half so well myself even in my young days  glynn felt somewhat elated at this unexpected piece of success to do him justice however he took it modestly  in a few minutes the whale rose but it had changed its course while under water and now appeared close to the leading boat of the other ship  by the laws of the whalefishery no boat of one vessel has a right to touch a whale that has been struck by the boat of another vessel so long as the harpoon holds fast and the rope remains unbroken or so long as the float to which the harpoon is connected remains attached nevertheless in defiance of this wellknown law the boat belonging to the captain of the strange ship gave chase and succeeded in making fast to the whale  to describe the indignation of captain dunning and his men on witnessing this act is impossible  the former roared rather than shouted give way lads and the latter bent their backs as if they meant to pull the boat bodily out of the water and up into the atmosphere  meanwhile all the other boats were in hot pursuit of the second whale which had led them a considerable distance away from the first  what do you mean by striking that fish shouted captain dunning when after a hard pull he came up with the boat the crew of which had just succeeded in thrusting a lance deep into a mortal part of the huge animal which soon after rolled over and lay extended on the waves  what right have you to ask replied the captain of the strange ship an illfavoured powerful man whose countenance was sufficient to condemn him in any society save that of ruffians  dont you see your drogue has broke loose  i see nothing of the sort  its fast at this moment so youll be good enough to cut loose and take yourself off as fast as you please  to this the other made no reply but turning to his men said make fast there lads signal the other boats and pull away for the ship look sharp you lubbers  och captain dear muttered phil briant baring both arms up to the shoulders only give the word do now  captain dunning who was already boiling with rage needed no encouragement to make an immediate attack on the stranger neither did his men require an order they plunged their oars into the water ran right into the other boat sprang to their feet seized lances harpoons and knives and in another moment would have been engaged in a deadly struggle had not an unforeseen event occurred to prevent the fray  this was the partial recovery of the whale which apparently resolved to make one final struggle for life turned over and over lashed the sea into foam and churned it up with the blood which spouted in thick streams from its numerous wounds  both boats were in imminent danger and the men sprang to their oars in order to pull out of the range of the monsters dying struggles  in this effort the strange boat was successful but that of captain dunning fared ill  a heavy blow from the whales tail broke it in two and hurled it into the air whence the crew descended amid a mass of harpoons lances oars and cordage into the bloodstained water  the fish sheered away for some distance dragging the other boat along with it and then rolled over quite dead  fortunately not one of the crew of the capsized boat was hurt  all of them succeeded in reaching and clinging to the shattered hull of their boat but there they were destined to remain a considerable time as the boat of the stranger having secured the dead fish proceeded leisurely to tow it towards their ship without paying the slightest attention to the shouts of their late enemies  a change had now come over the face of the sky  clouds began to gather on the horizon and a few light puffs of air swept over the sea which enabled the strange vessel to bear down on her boat and take the whale in tow  it also enabled the red eric to beat up but more slowly towards the spot where their disabled boat lay and rescue their comrades from their awkward position  it was some time before the boats were all gathered together  when this was accomplished the night had set in and the stranger had made off with her illgotten prize the other whale having sounded and the chase being abandoned  now of all the disgustin things that ever happened to me this is the worst remarked captain dunning in a very sulky tone of voice as he descended to the cabin to change his garments ailie having preceded him in order to lay out dry clothes  oh my darling papa what a fright i got she exclaimed running up and hugging him wet as he was for the seventh time despite his efforts to keep her off  i was looking through the spyglass at the time it happened and when i saw you all thrown into the air i cried oh  i cant tell you how i cried  you dont need to tell me ailie my pet for your red swelledup eyes speak for themselves  but go you puss and change your own frock youve made it as wet as my coat nearly besides i cant undress you know while you stand there  ailie said im so very very thankful and then giving her father one concluding hug which completely saturated the frock went to her own cabin  meanwhile the crew of the captains boat were busy in the forecastle stripping off their wet garments and relating their adventures to the men of the other boats who until they reached the ship had been utterly ignorant of what had passed  it is curious that tim rokens should open the conversation with much the same sentiment if not exactly the same phrase as that expressed by the captain  now boys said he slapping his wet limbs ill tell ye wot it is of all the aggrawations as has happened to me in my life this is out o sight the wust  to think o losin that there whale the very biggest i ever saw  ah  rokens man interrupted glynn as he pulled off his jacket the loss is greater to me than to you for that was my first whale  true boy replied the harpooner in a tone of evidently genuine sympathy i feel for ye  i knows how i should ha taken on if it had happened to me  but cheer up lad you know the old proverb theres as good fish in the sea as ever came out ot  youll be the death o many sich yet ill bet my best iron  sure the wust of it all is that we dont know who was the big thief as got that fish away with him said phil briant with a rueful countenance  dont we though cried gurney who had been in the mates boat i axed one o the men o the strangers boatsfor we run up close alongside durin the chaseand he told me as how she was the termagant of new york so we can be down on em yet if we live long enough  humph observed rokens and dye suppose hed give ye the right name  hed no reason to do otherwise  he didnt know of the dispute between the other boats  theres truth in that remarked glynn as he prepared to go on deck but it may be a year or more before we foregather  no i give up all claim to my first fish from this date  all hands ahoy shouted the mate tumble up there  reef topsails look alive  the men ran hastily on deck completing their buttoning and belting as they went and found that something very like a storm was brewing  as yet the breeze was moderate and the sea not very high but the night was pitchy dark and a hot oppressive atmosphere boded no improvement in the weather  lay out there some of you and close reef the topsails cried the mate as the men ran to their several posts  the ship was running at the time under a comparatively small amount of canvas for as their object was merely to cruise about in those seas in search of whales and they had no particular course to steer it was usual to run at night under easy sail and sometimes to layto  it was fortunate that such was the case on the present occasion for it happened that the storm which was about to burst on them came with appalling suddenness and fury  the wind tore up the sea as if it had been a mass of white feathers and scattered it high in air  the mizzentopsail was blown to ribbons and it seemed as if the other sails were about to share the same fate  the ship flew from billow to billow after recovering from the first rude shock as if she were but a dark cloud on the sea and the spray flew high over her masts drenching the men on the topsailyards while they laboured to reef the sails  we shall have to take down these tgallantmasts mr millons said the captain as he stood by the weatherbulwarks holding on to a belayingpin to prevent his being washed away  shall i give the order sir inquired the first mate  you may replied the captain  just as the mate turned to obey a shriek was heard high above the whistling of the fierce wind  did you hear that said the captain anxiously  i did replied the mate  i feari trust  the remainder of the sentence was either suppressed or the howling of the wind prevented its being heard  just then a flash of lightning lit up the scene and a terrific crash of thunder seemed to rend the sky  the flash was momentary but it served to reveal the men on the yards distinctly  they had succeeded in closereefing the topsails and were hurrying down the rigging  the mate came close to the captains side and said did you see sir the way them men on the mainyard were scramblin down  the captain had not time to reply ere a shout man overboard was heard faintly in the midst of the storm and in another instant some of the men rushed aft with frantic haste shouting that one of their number had been blown off the yard into the sea  down your helm roared the captain standby to lower away the boats  the usual prompt ay ay sir was given but before the men could reach their places a heavy sea struck the vessel amidships poured several tons of water on the decks and washed all the loose gear overboard  let her away cried the captain quickly  the steersman obeyed the ship fell off and again bounded on her mad course like a wild horse set free  its of no use sir said the mate as the captain leaped towards the wheel which the other had already gained no boat could live in that sea for a moment  the poor fellows gone by this time  he must be more than halfamile astern already  i know it returned the captain in a deep sad voice  get these masts down mr millons and see that everything is made fast  who is it did you say  the men cant tell sir one of em told me e thinks it was young boswell  it was too dark to see is face but is figure was that of a stout young fellow  a stout young fellow muttered the captain as the mate hurried forward  can it have been glynn  his heart sank within him at the thought and he would have given worlds at that moment had he possessed them to have heard the voice of our hero whom almost unwittingly he had begun to love with all the affection of a father  while he stood gazing up at the rigging attempting to pierce the thick darkness he felt his sleeve plucked and looking down observed ailie at his side  my child he cried grasping her by the arm convulsively you here how came you to leave your cabin dear  go down go down you dont know the danger you run  stayi will help you  if one of those seas comes on board it would carry you overboard like a fleck of foam  i didnt know there was much danger papa  glynn told me there wasnt she replied as her father sprang with her to the companionladder  how when where child  did glynn speak to you within the last ten minutes  yes he looked down the hatch just as i was coming up and told me not to be afraid and said i must go below and not think of coming on deck but i heard a shriek papa and feared something had happened so i came to ask what it was  i hope no one is hurt  my darling ailie replied the captain in an agitated voice go down to your berth and pray for us just now  there is not much danger but in all times of danger whether great or slight we should pray to our father in heaven for we never know what a day or an hour may bring forth  i will speak to you about everything tomorrow tonight i must be on deck  he kissed her forehead pushed her gently into the cabin shut the door and coming on deck fastened the companionhatch firmly down  in a short time the ship was prepared to face the worst  the topsails were closereefed the topgallantmasts sent down on deck the spanker and jib were furled and soon after the mainsail and foresail were also furled  the boats were taken in and secured on deck and the ship went a little more easily through the raging sea but as the violence of the gale increased sail had to be further reduced and at last everything was taken in except the main spencer and foretopmaststaysail  i wouldnt mind this much said the captain as he and the first mate stood close to the binnacle if i only knew our exact position  but weve not had an observation for several days and i dont feel sure of our whereabouts  there are some nasty coral reefs in these seas  did you find out who the poor fellow is yet  its young boswell i fear mr markham is mustering the men just now sir  as he spoke the second mate came aft and confirmed their fears  the man who had thus been summoned in a moment without warning into the presence of his maker had been a quiet modest youth and a favourite with every one on board  at any other time his death would have been deeply felt but in the midst of that terrible storm the men had no time to think  indeed they could not realise the fact that their shipmate was really gone  mr markham said the captain as the second mate turned away send a hand in to the chains to heave the lead  i dont feel at all easy in my mind so near these shoals as we must be just now  while the order was being obeyed the storm became fiercer and more furious  bright gleams of lightning flashed repeatedly across the sky lighting up the scene as if with brightest moonlight and revealing the horrid turmoil of the raging sea in which the ship now laboured heavily the rapidity with which the thunder followed the lightning showed how near to them was the dangerous and subtle fluid and the crashing bursting reports that shook the ship from stem to stern gave the impression that mountains were being dashed to atoms against each other in the air  all the sails still exposed to the fury of the gale were blown to shreds the foretopmast and the jibboom were carried away along with them and the red eric was driven at last before the wind under bare poles  the crew remained firm in the midst of this awful scene each man stood at his post holding on by any fixed object that chanced to be within his reach and held himself ready to spring to obey every order no voice could be heard in the midst of the howling winds the lashing sea and the rending sky  commands were given by signs as well as possible during the flashes of lightning but little or nothing remained to be done  captain dunning had done all that a man thoroughly acquainted with his duties could accomplish to put his ship in the best condition to do battle with the storm and he now felt that the issue remained in the hands of him who formed the warring elements and whose will alone could check their angry strife  during one of the vivid flashes of lightning the captain observed glynn proctor standing near the starboard gangway and waiting for the next flash he made a signal to him to come to the spot where he stood glynn understood it and in a few seconds was at his commanders side  glynn my boy said the latter you wont be wanted on deck for some time  theres little to be done now  go down and see what ailies about poor thing  shell need a little comfort  say i sent you  without other reply than a nod of the head glynn sprang to the companionhatch followed by the captain who undid the fastenings to let him down and refastened them immediately for the sea was washing over the stern continually  glynn found the child on her knees in the cabin with her face buried in the cushions of one of the sofas  he sat down beside her and waited until she should have finished her prayer but as she did not move for some time he laid his hand gently on her shoulder  she looked up with a happy smile on her face  oh glynn is that you  im so glad she said rising and sitting down beside him  your father sent me down to comfort you my pet said glynn taking her hand in his and drawing her towards him  i have got comfort already replied the child im so very happy now  how so ailie who has been with you  god has been with me  you told me glynn that there wasnt much danger but i felt sure that there was  oh  i never heard such terrible noises and this dreadful tossing is worse than ever i felt ita great deal  so i went down on my knees and prayed that god for christs sake would save us  i felt very frightened glynn  you cant think how my heart beat every time the thunder burst over us  but suddenlyi dont know how it wasthe words i used to read at home so often with my dear aunts came into my mind you know them glynn call upon me in the time of trouble and i will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me  i dont know where i read them  i forget the place in the bible now but when i thought of them i felt much less frightened  do you think it was the holy spirit who put them into my mind  my aunts used to tell me that all my good thoughts were given to me by the holy spirit  then i remembered the words of jesus i will never leave thee nor forsake thee and i felt so happy after that  it was just before you came down  i think we shall not be lost  god would not make me feel so happy if we were going to be lost would he  i think not ailie replied glynn whose conscience reproached him for his ignorance of the passages in gods word referred to by his companion and who felt that he was receiving rather than administering comfort  when i came down i did not very well know how i should comfort you for this is certainly the most tremendous gale i ever saw but somehow i feel as if we were in less danger now  i wish i knew more of the bible ailie  im ashamed to say i seldom look at it  oh thats a pity isnt it glynn said ailie with earnest concern expressed in her countenance for she regarded her companions ignorance as a great misfortune it never occurred to her that it was a sin  but its very easy to learn it she added with an eager look  if you come to me here every day we can read it together  i would like to have you hear me say it off and then i would hear you  before he could reply the vessel received a tremendous shock which caused her to quiver from stem to stern  she must have been struck by lightning cried glynn starting up and hurrying towards the door  ailies frightened look returned for a few minutes but she did not tremble as she had done before  just as glynn reached the top of the ladder the hatch was opened and the captain thrust in his head  glynn my boy said he in a quick firm tone we are ashore perhaps we shall go to pieces in a few minutes  god knows  may he in his mercy spare us  you cannot do much on deck  ailie must be looked after till i come down for her  glynn i depend upon you  these words were uttered hurriedly and the hatch was shut immediately after  it is impossible to describe accurately the conflicting feelings that agitated the breast of the young sailor as he descended again to the cabin  he felt gratified at the trust placed in him by the captain and his love for the little girl would at any time have made the post of protector to her an agreeable one but the idea that the ship had struck the rocks and that his shipmates on deck were struggling perhaps for their lives while he was sitting idly in the cabin was most trying and distressing to one of his ardent and energetic temperament  he was not however kept long in suspense  scarcely had he regained the cabin when the ship again struck with terrific violence and he knew by the rending crash overhead that one or more of the masts had gone over the side  the ship at the same moment slewed round and was thrown on her beamends  so quickly did this occur that glynn had barely time to seize ailie in his arms and save her from being dashed against the bulkhead  the vessel rose again on the next wave and was hurled on the rocks with such violence that every one on board expected her to go to pieces immediately  at the same time the cabin windows were dashed in and the cabin itself was flooded with water  glynn was washed twice across the cabin and thrown violently against the ships sides but he succeeded in keeping a firm hold of his little charge and in protecting her from injury  hallo glynn shouted the captain as he opened the companionhatch come on deck quick bring her with you  glynn hurried up and placed the child in her fathers arms  the scene that presented itself to him on gaining the deck was indeed appalling  the first grey streak of dawn faintly lighted up the sky just affording sufficient light to exhibit the complete wreck of everything on deck and the black frothcapped tumult of the surrounding billows  the rocks on which they had struck could not be discerned in the gloom but the white breakers ahead showed too clearly where they were  the three masts had gone over the side one after another leaving only the stumps of each standing  everything above boardboats binnacle and part of the bulwarkshad been washed away  the crew were clinging to the belayingpins and to such parts of the wreck as seemed likely to hold together longest  it seemed to poor ailie as she clung to her fathers neck that she had been transported to some fardistant and dreadful scene for scarcely a single familiar object remained by which her ocean home the red eric could be recognised  but ailie had neither desire nor opportunity to remark on this tremendous change  every successive billow raised the doomed vessel and let her fall with heavy violence on the rocks  her stout frame trembled under each shock as if she were endued with life and shrank affrighted from her impending fate and it was as much as the captain could do to maintain his hold of the weatherbulwarks and of ailie at the same time  indeed he could not have done it at all had not glynn stood by and assisted him to the best of his ability  it wont last long lad said the captain as a larger wave than usual lifted the shattered hull and dashed it down on the rocks washing the deck from stern to stem and for a few seconds burying the whole crew under water  may the almighty have mercy on us no ship can stand this long  perhaps the tide is falling suggested glynn in an encouraging voice and i think i see something like a shore ahead  it will be daylight in halfanhour or less  the captain shook his head  theres little or no tide here to rise or fall i fear  before halfanhour we shall  he did not finish the sentence but looking at ailie with a gaze of agony he pressed her more closely to his breast  i think we shall be saved whispered the child twining her arms more closely round her fathers neck and laying her wet cheek against his  just then tim rokens crept aft and said that he saw a low sandy island ahead and a rocky point jutting out from it close to the bows of the ship  he suggested that a rope might be got ashore when it became a little lighter  phil briant came aft to make the same suggestion not knowing that rokens had preceded him  in fact the men had been consulting as to the possibility of accomplishing this object but when they looked at the fearful breakers that boiled in white foam between the ships bow and the rocky point their hearts failed them and no one was found to volunteer for the dangerous service  is any one inclined to try it inquired the captain  theres niver a wan of us but ud try it capen if you gives the order answered briant  the captain hesitated  he felt disinclined to order any man to expose himself to such imminent danger yet the safety of the whole crew might depend on a rope being connected with the shore  before he could make up his mind glynn who saw what was passing in his mind exclaimedill do it captain and instantly quitting his position hurried forward as fast as circumstances would permit  the task which glynn had undertaken to perform turned out to be more dangerous and difficult than at first he had anticipated  when he stood at the lee bow fastening a small cord round his waist and looking at the turmoil of water into which he was about to plunge his heart wellnigh failed him and he felt a sensation of regret that he had undertaken what seemed now an impossibility  he did not wonder that the men had one and all shrunk from the attempt  but he had made up his mind to do it  moreover he had said he would do it and feeling that he imperilled his life in a good cause he set his face as a flint to the accomplishment of his purpose  well was it for glynn proctor that day that in early boyhood he had learned to swim and had become so expert in the water as to be able to beat all his young companions  he noticed on looking narrowly at the foaming surge through which he must pass in order to gain the rocky point that many of the submerged rocks showed their tops above the flood like black spots when each wave retired  to escape these seemed impossibleto strike one of them he knew would be almost certain death  dont try it boy said several of the men as they saw glynn hesitate when about to spring and turn an anxious gaze in all directions its into death yell jump if ye do  glynn did not reply indeed he did not hear the remark for at that moment his whole attention was riveted on a ledge of submerged rock which ever and anon showed itself like the edge of a knife extending between the ship and the point  along the edge of this the retiring waves broke in such a manner as to form what appeared to be dead watertossed indeed and foamclad but not apparently in progressive motion  glynn made up his mind in an instant and just as the first mate came forward with an order from the captain that he was on no account to make the rash attempt he sprang with his utmost force off the ships side and sank in the raging sea  words cannot describe the intense feeling of suspense with which the men on the lee bow gazed at the noblehearted boy as he rose and buffeted with the angry billows  every man held his breath and those who had charge of the line stood nervously ready to haul him back at a moments notice  on first rising to the surface he beat the waves as if bewildered and while some of the men cried hes struck a rock others shouted to haul him in but in another second he got his eyes cleared of spray and seeing the ships hull towering above his head he turned his back on it and made for the shore  at first he went rapidly through the surge for his arm was strong and his young heart was brave but a receding wave caught him and hurled him some distance out of his coursetossing him over and over as if he had been a cork  again he recovered himself and gaining the water beside the ledge he made several powerful and rapid strokes which carried him within a few yards of the point  hes safe said rokens eagerly  no hes missed it cried the second mate who with gurney and dick barnes payed out the rope  glynn had indeed almost caught hold of the farthestout ledge of the point when he was drawn back into the surge and this time dashed against a rock and partially stunned  the men had already begun to haul in on the rope when he recovered and making a last effort gained the rocks up which he clambered slowly  when beyond the reach of the waves he fell down as if he had fainted  this however was not the case he was merely exhausted as well as confused by the blows he had received on the rocks and lay for a few seconds quite still in order to recover strength during which period of inaction he thanked god earnestly for his deliverance and prayed fervently that he might be made the means of saving his companions in danger  after a minute or two he rose unfastened the line from his waist and began to haul it ashore  to the other end of the small line the men in the ship attached a thick cable the end of which was soon pulled up and made fast to a large rock  tim rokens was now ordered to proceed to the shore by means of the rope in order to test it  after this a sort of swing was constructed with a noose which was passed round the cable  to this a small line was fastened and passed to the shore  on this swingingseat ailie was seated and hauled to the rocks tim rokens shinning along the cable at the same time to guard her from accident  then the men began to land and thus one by one the crew of the red eric reached the shore in safety and when all had landed captain dunning standing in the midst of his men lifted up his voice in thanksgiving to god for their deliverance  but when daylight came the full extent of their forlorn situation was revealed  the ship was a complete wreck the boats were all gone and they found that the island on which they had been cast was only a few square yards in extenta mere sandbank utterly destitute of shrub or tree and raised only a few feet above the level of the ocean    chapter sixteen  the sandbankthe wrecked crew make the best of bad circumstances  it will scarcely surprise the reader to be told that after the first emotions of thankfulness for deliverance from what had appeared to the shipwrecked mariners to be inevitable death a feeling amounting almost to despair took possession of the whole party for a time  the sandbank was so low that in stormy weather it was almost submerged it was a solitary coral reef in the midst of the boundless sea  not a tree or bush grew upon it and except at the point where the ship had struck there was scarcely a rock large enough to afford shelter to a single man  without provisions without sufficient shelter without the means of escape and almost without the hope of deliverance it seemed to them that nothing awaited them but the slow lingering pains and horrors of death by starvation  as those facts forced themselves more and more powerfully home to the apprehension of the crewwhile they cowered for shelter from the storm under the lee of the rocky point they gave expression to their feelings in different ways  some sat down in dogged silence to await their fate others fell on their knees and cried aloud to god for mercy while a few kept up their own spirits and those of their companions by affecting a cheerfulness which however in some cages was a little forced  ailie lay shivering in her fathers arms for she was drenched with salt water and very cold  her eyes were closed and she was very pale from exposure and exhaustion but her lips moved as if in prayer  captain dunning looked anxiously at dr hopley who crouched beside them and gazed earnestly in the childs face while he felt her pulse  its almost too much for her i fear said the captain in a hesitating husky voice  the doctor did not answer for a minute or two then he said as if muttering to himself rather than replying to the captains remark if we could only get her into dry clothes or had a fire or even a little brandy but he did not finish the sentence and the captains heart sank within him and his weatherbeaten face grew pale as he thought of the possibility of losing his darling child  glynn had been watching the doctor with intense eagerness and with a terrible feeling of dread fluttering about his heart  when he heard the last remark he leaped up and criedif brandy is all you want you shall soon have it  and running down to the edge of the water he plunged in and grasped the cable intending to clamber into the ship which had by this time been driven higher on the rocks and did not suffer so much from the violence of the breakers  at the same instant phil briant sprang to his feet rushed down after him and before he had got a yard from the shore seized him by the collar and dragged him out of the sea high and dry on the land  glynn was so exasperated at this unceremonious and at the moment unaccountable treatment that he leaped up and in the heat of the moment prepared to deal the irishman a blow that would very probably have brought the experiences of the ring to his remembrance but briant effectually checked him by putting both his own hands into his pockets thrusting forward his face as if to invite the blow and exclaiming  och now hit fair glynn darlint put it right in betwane me two eyes  glynn laughed hysterically in spite of himself  what mean you by stopping me he asked somewhat sternly  shure i mane that ill go for the grog meself  yeve done more nor yer share o the work this mornin an its but fair to give a poor fellow a chance  more be token ye mustnt think that nobody cant do nothin but yeself  its phil briant thatll shin up a rope with any white man in the world or out of it  youre right phil said rokens who had come to separate the combatants  go aboord my lad an ill engage to hold this here young alligator fast till ye come back  you dont need to hold me tim retorted glynn with a smile but dont be long about it phil  you know where the brandy is keptlook alive  briant accomplished his mission successfully and despite the furious waves brought the brandy on shore in safety  as he emerged like a caricature of old neptune dripping from the sea it was observed that he held a bundle in his powerful grasp  it was also strapped to his shoulders  why what have you got there inquired the doctor as he staggered under the shelter of the rocks  arrah give a dhrop to the child an dont be wastin yer breath replied briant as he undid the bundle  sure ive brought a few trifles for her outside as well as her in  and he revealed to the glad father a bundle of warm habiliments which he had collected in ailies cabin and kept dry by wrapping them in several layers of tarpaulin  god bless you my man said the captain grasping the thoughtful irishman by the hand  now ailie my darling pet look up and swallow a drop o this  heres a capital rigout o dry clothes too  a few sips of brandy soon restored the circulation which had wellnigh been arrested and when she had been clothed in the dry garments ailie felt comparatively comfortable and expressed her thanks to phil briant with tears in her eyes  a calm often succeeds a storm somewhat suddenly especially in southern latitudes  soon after daybreak the wind moderated and before noon it ceased entirely though the sea kept breaking in huge rolling billows on the sandbank for many hours afterwards  the sun too came out hot and brilliant shedding a warm radiance over the little seagirt spot as well as over the hearts of the crew  human nature exhibits wonderful and sudden changes  men spring from the depths of despair to the very summit of lighthearted hope and very frequently too without a very obvious cause to account for the violent change  before the day after the storm was far advanced every one on the sandbank seemed to be as joyous as though there was no danger of starvation whatever  there was however sufficient to produce the change in the altered aspect of affairs  for one thing the warm sun began to make them feel comfortableand really it is wonderful how ready men are to shut their eyes to the actual state of existing things if they can only enjoy a little present comfort  then the ship was driven so high up on the rocks as to be almost beyond the reach of the waves and she had not been dashed to pieces as had at first been deemed inevitable so that the stores and provisions in her might be secured and the party be thus enabled to subsist on their ocean prison until set free by some passing ship  under the happy influence of these improved circumstances every one went about the work of rendering their island home more comfortable in good almost in gleeful spirits  phil briant indulged in jests which a few hours ago would have been deemed profane and gurney actually volunteered the song of the man wot got his nose froze but every one declined to listen to it on the plea that it reminded them too forcibly of the cold of the early morning  even the saturnine steward tarquin looked less ferocious than usual and king bumble became so loquacious that he was ordered more than once to hold his tongue and to shut up  the work they had to do was indeed of no light nature  they had to travel to and fro between the ship and the rocks on the ropecable a somewhat laborious achievement in order to bring ashore such things as they absolutely required  a quantity of biscuit tea coffee and sugar were landed without receiving much damage then a line was fastened to a cask of salt beef and this with a few more provisions was drawn ashore the first day and placed under the shelter of the largest rock on the point  on the following day it was resolved that a raft should be constructed and everything that could in any way prove useful be brought to the sandbank and secured  for captain dunning well knew that another storm might arise as quickly as the former had done and although the ship at present lay in comparatively quiet water the huge billows that would be dashed against her in such circumstances would be certain to break her up and scatter her cargo on the breast of the alldevouring sea  in the midst of all this activity and bustle there sat one useless and silent but exceedingly grave and uncommonly attentive spectator namely jacko the monkey  that sly and sagacious individual seeing that no one intended to look after him had during the whole of the recent storm wisely looked after himself  he had ensconced himself in a snug and comparatively sheltered corner under the afterpart of the weatherbulwarks  but when he saw the men one by one leaving the ship and proceeding to the shore by means of the rope he began to evince an anxiety as to his own fate which had in it something absolutely human jacko was the last man so to speak to leave the red eric  captain dunning resolving with the true spirit of a brave commander to reserve that honour to himself had seen the last man he thought out of the ship and was twothirds of the distance along the rope on his way to land when jim scroggles who was always either in or out of the way at the most inopportune moments came rushing up from below whither he had gone to secure a favourite brass fingerring and scrambled over the side  it would be difficult to say whether jims head or feet or legs or knees or arms went over the side firstthey all got over somehow nobody knew howand in the getting over his hat flew off and was lost for ever  seeing this and feeling no doubt the momentous truth of that wellknown adage now or never master jacko uttered a shriek bounded from his position of fancied security and seized jim scroggles firmly by the hair resolved apparently to live or perish along with him  as to simply clambering along that cable to the shore  jacko would have thought no more of it than of eating his dinner  had he felt so disposed he could have walked along it or hopped along it or thrown somersaults along it  but to proceed along it while it was at one moment thirty feet above the sea rigid as a bar of iron and the next moment several feet under the mad turmoil of the raging billowsthis it was that filled his little bosom with inexpressible horror and induced him to cling with a tight embrace to the hair of the head of his bitterest enemy  having gained the shore jacko immediately took up his abode in the warmest spot on that desolate sandbank which was the centre of the mass of cowering and shivering men who sought shelter under the lee of the rocks where he was all but squeezed to death but where he felt comparatively warm nevertheless  when the sun came out he perched himself in a warm nook of the rock near to ailie and dried himself after which as we have already hinted he superintended the discharging of the cargo and the arrangements made for a prolonged residence on the sandbank  och but yer a queer cratur remarked briant as he passed chucking the monkey under the chin  ooooooeeo replied jacko  very thrue no doubtbut i havent time to spake to ye jist yet lad replied briant with a laugh as he ran down to the beach and seized a barrel which had just been hauled to the waters edge  what are you going to do with the wood papa asked ailie  the captain had seized an axe at the moment and began vigorously to cut up a rough plank which had been driven ashore by the waves  im going to make a fire my pet to warm your cold toes  but my toes are not cold papa youve no idea how comfortable i am  ailie did indeed look comfortable at that moment for she was lying on a bed of dry sand with a thick blanket spread over her  well then it will do to warm jackos toes if yours dont want it and besides we all want a cup of tea after our exertions  the first step towards that end you know is to make a fire  so saying the captain piled up dry wood in front of the place where ailie lay and in a short time had a capital fire blazing and a large tin kettle full of fresh water boiling thereon  it may be as well to remark here that the water had been brought in a small keg from the ship for not a single drop of fresh water was found on the sandbank after the most careful search  fortunately however the watertanks of the red eric still contained a large supply  during the course of that evening a sort of shed or tent was constructed out of canvas and a few boards placed against the rock this formed a comparatively comfortable shelter and one end of it was partitioned off for ailies special use  no one was permitted to pass the curtain that hung before the entrance to this little boudoir except the captain who claimed a right to do what he pleased and glynn who was frequently invited to enter in order to assist its fair occupant in her multifarious arrangements and jacko who could not be kept out by any means that had yet been hit upon except by killing him but as ailie objected to this he was suffered to take up his abode there and to do him justice he behaved very well while domiciled in that place  it is curious to note how speedily little children and men too sometimes contrive to forget the unpleasant or the sad or it may be the dangerous circumstances in which they may chance to be placed while engaged in the minute details incident to their peculiar position ailie went about arranging her little nest under the rock with as much zeal and cheerful interest as if she were playing at houses in her own room at home  she decided that one corner was peculiarly suited for her bed because there was a small rounded rock in it which looked like a pillow so glynn was directed to spread the tarpaulin and the blankets there  another corner exhibited a crevice in the rock which seemed so suitable for a kennel for jacko that the arrangement was agreed to on the spot  we say agreed to because ailie suggested everything to glynn and glynn always agreed to everything that ailie suggested and stood by with a hammer and nails and a few pieces of plank in his hands ready to fulfil her bidding no matter what it should be  so jacko was sent for to be introduced to his new abode but jacko was not to be found for the very good reason that he had taken possession of the identical crevice some time before and at that moment was enjoying a comfortable nap in its inmost recess  then ailie caused glynn to put up a little shelf just over her head which he did with considerable difficulty because it turned out that nails could not easily be driven into the solid rock  after that a small cave at the foot of the apartment was cleaned out and ailies box placed there  all this and sundry other pieces of work were executed by the young sailor and his little friend with an amount of cheerful pleasantry that showed they had in the engrossing interest of their pursuit totally forgotten the fact that they were cast away on a sandbank on which were neither food nor water nor wood except what was to be found in the wrecked ship and around which for thousands of miles rolled the great billows of the restless sea    chapter seventeen  life on the sandbankailie takes possession of fairylandglynn and bumble astonish the little fishes  in order that the reader may form a just conception of the sandbank on which the crew of the red eric had been wrecked we shall describe it somewhat carefully  it lay in the southern ocean a little to the west of the longitude of the cape of good hope and somewhere between 2000 and 3000 miles to the south of it  as has been already remarked the bank at its highest point was little more than a few feet above the level of the ocean the waves of which in stormy weather almost and the spray of which altogether swept over it  in length it was barely fifty yards and in breadth about forty  being part of a coral reef the surface of it was composed of the beautiful white sand that is formed from coral by the dashing waves  at one end of the bankthat on which the ship had struckthe reef rose into a ridge of rock which stood a few feet higher than the level of the sand and stretched out into the sea about twenty yards with its points projecting here and there above water  on the centre of the bank at its highest point one or two very small blades of green substance were afterwards discovered  so few were they however and so delicate that we feel justified in describing the spot as being utterly destitute of verdure  ailie counted those green blades many a time after they were discovered  there were exactly thirtyfive of them twentysix were comparatively speaking large seven were of medium size and two were extremely smallso small and thin that ailie wondered they did not die of sheer delicacy of constitution on such a barren spot  the greater part of the surface of the bank was covered with the fine sand already referred to but there were one or two spots which were covered with variouslysized pebbles and an immense number of beautiful small shells  on such a small and barren spot one would think there was little or nothing to admire  but this was not the case  those persons whose thoughts are seldom allowed to fix attentively on any subject are apt to fall into the mistake of supposing that in this world there are a great many absolutely uninteresting things  many things are indeed uninteresting to individuals but there does not exist a single thing which has not a certain amount of interest to one or another cast of mind and which will not afford food for contemplation and matter fitted to call forth our admiration for its great and good creator  we know a valley so beautiful that it has been for generations past and will probably be for generations to come the annual resort of hundreds of admiring travellers  the valley cannot be seen until you are almost in it  the country immediately around it is no way remarkable it is even tame  many people would exclaim at first sight in reference to it how uninteresting  it requires a close view a minute inspection to discover the beauties that lie hidden there  so was it with our sandbank  ailies first thoughts were oh how dreary how desolate and in some respects she was right but she dwelt there long enough to discover things that charmed her eye and her imagination and caused her sometimes to feel as if she had been transported to the realms of fairyland  we do not say observe that the crew of the red eric were ever blessed with such dreams  jim scroggles for instance had no eye for the minute beauties or wonders of creation  jim according to his own assertion could see about as far through a millstone as most men  he could apostrophise his eye on certain occasions and tell itas though its own power of vision were an insufficient medium of informationthat that wos a stunnin iceberg or that that wos a gale and a half fit to tear the masts out o the ship amost  but for any less majestic object in nature jim scroggles had nothing to say either to his eye or his nose or his shipmates  as was jim scroggles so were most of the other men  hence they grumbled a good deal at their luckless condition  but upon the whole they were pretty cheerfulespecially at mealtimesand considering their circumstances they behaved very well  glynn proctor was a notable exception to the prevailing rule of indifference to small things  by nature he was of a superior stamp of mind to his comrades besides he had been better educated and more than all he was at that time under the influence of ailie dunning  she admired what she admired he liked what she liked he looked with interest at the things which she examined  had ailie sat down beside the stock of an old anchor and looked attentively at it glynn would have sat down and stared at it too in the firm belief that there was something there worth looking at  glynn laughed aloud sometimes at himself to think how deeply interested he had become in the child for up to that time he had rather avoided than courted the society of children and he used to say to ailie that the sailors would begin to call her his little sweetheart if he spent so much of his time with her to which ailie would reply by asking what a sweetheart was whereat glynn would laugh immoderately whereupon ailie would tell him not to be stupid but to come and play with her  all the sailors even including the taciturn tarquin had a tender feeling of regard for the little girl who shared their fortunes at that time but with the exception of glynn none were capable of sympathising with her in her pursuits  tim rokens her father and dr hopley did to some extent but these three had their minds too deeply filled with anxiety about their critical position to pay her much attention beyond the kindest concern for her physical wants  king bumble too we beg his pardon showed considerable interest in her  the sable assistant of nikel sling shone conspicuous at this trying time for his activity goodhumour and endurance and in connection with phil briant gurney and jacko kept up the spirits of the shipwrecked men wonderfully  close under the rocks on the side farthest removed from the spot where the rude tent was pitched there was a little bay or creek not more than twenty yards in diameter which ailie appropriated and called fairyland  it was an uncommonly small spot but it was exceedingly beautiful and interesting  the rocks although small were so broken and fantastically formed that when ailie crept close in amongst them and so placed herself that the view of the sandbank was entirely shut out and nothing was to be seen but little pools of crystal water and rocklets with their margin of dazzling white sand and the wreck of the ship in the distance with the deep blue sea beyond she quite forgot where she actually was and began to wander in the most enchanting daydreams  but when as often happened there came towering thick masses of snowy clouds like mountain peaks and battlements in the bright blue sky her delight was so great that she could find no words to express it  at such timessometimes with glynn by her side sometimes aloneshe would sit in a sunny nook or in a shady nook if she felt too warm and invite innumerable hosts of fairies to come and conduct her through interminable tracts of purewhite cloud region and order such unheardof wild creatures each usually wanting a tail or a leg or an ear to come out of the dark caves that had they been all collected in one garden for exhibition to the public that zoological garden would have been deemed out of sight the greatest of all the wonders of the world  when a little wearied with those aerial journeys she would return to fairyland and leaning over the brinks of the pools peer down into their beautiful depths for hours at a time  ailies property of fairyland had gardens too of the richest possible kind full of flowers of the most lovely and brilliant hues  but the flowers were scentless and alas she could not pluck them for those gardens were all under water they grew at the bottom of the sea  yes reader if the land was barren on that ocean islet the pools there made up for it by presenting to view the most luxuriant marine vegetation  there were forests of branching coral of varied hues there were masses of fanshaped sponges there were groves of green and red seaweeds and beds of red and white and orange and striped creatures that stuck to the rocks besides little fish with bright coloured backs that played there as if they really enjoyed living always under water which is not easy for us you know to realise  and above all the medium of water between ailie and these things was so pure and pellucid when no breeze fanned the surface that it was difficult to believe unless you touched it there was any water there at all  while ailie thus spent her time or at least her leisure time for she was by no means an idler in that busy little isle the men were actively engaged each day in transporting provisions from the red eric to the sandbank and in making them as secure as circumstances would admit of for this purpose a raft had been constructed and several trips a day were made to and from the wreck so that in the course of a few days a considerable stock of provisions was accumulated on the bank  this was covered with tarpaulin and heavy casks of salt junk were placed on the corners and edges to keep it down  ill tell ye wot it is messmates remarked gurney one day as they sat down round their wood fire to dine in front of their tent were purvisioned for six months at least an if the weather only keeps fine ive no objection to remain wotiver  maybe said briant yell have to remain that time whether ye object or not  by no means paddy retorted gurney i could swum off to sea and be drownded if i liked  no ye couldnt avic said briant  why not demanded gurney  cause ye havent the pluck replied phil  ill pluck the nose off yer face said gurney in affected anger  no ye wont cried phil cause av ye do ill spile the soup by heavin it all over ye  oh exclaimed gurney with a look of horror listen to him messmates he calls it soupthe nasty kettle o dirty water  well well its lucky we haint got nothin better to compare it with  but i say lads interposed jim scroggles seriously wotll we do if it comes on to blow a gale and blows away all our purvisions  ay boys cried dick barnes that eres the question as hamlet remarked to his grandfathers ghost wot is to come on us supposin it comes on to blow sich a snorin gale asll blow the whole sandbank away carryin us and our prog overboard along with it  wots that there soup made of demanded tim rokens  salt junk and peas replied nikel sling  ah  i thought there was somethin else in it said tim carelessly for it seems to perdooce oncommon bad jokes in them wot eats of it  now tim dont you go for to be sorcostic but tell us a story  me tell a story  no no lads theres glynn proctor hes the boy for you  where is he  hes aboard the wreck just now  the capn sent him for charts and quadrants and suchlike cooriosities  come gurney tell you one if tim wont  how wos it now that you so mistook yer trade as to come for to go to sea  i cant very well tell ye answered gurney who having finished dinner had lit his pipe and was now extended at full length on the sand leaning on one arm  ye see lads ive had more or less to do with the sea i have since ever i comed into this remarkable worldnot that i ever to my knowledge knew one less coorous for i never was up in the stars no more i spose was ever any o you  i was born at sea dye see  i dont xactly know how i comed for to be born there but i wos told that i wos and if them as told me spoke truth i spose i wos  i was washed overboard in gales three times before i comed for to know myself at all  when i first came alive so to speak to my own certain knowledge i wos asitting on the top of a hencoop aboard an east indiaman roarin like a mad bull as had lost his senses cause why the hens wos puttin their heads through the bars o the coops and pickin at the calves o my legs as fierce as if theyd suddenly turned cannibals and rather liked it  from that time i began a life o misery  my life before that had bin pretty much the same it seems but i didnt know it so it didnt matter  dye know lads when ye dont know a thing its all the same as if it didnt exist an so in coorse it dont matter  oh exclaimed the first mate who came up at the moment ave hany o you fellows got a notebook in which we may record that horacular and truly valuable hobserwation  no one happening to possess a notebook gurney was allowed to proceed with his account of himself  ships has bin my houses all along up to this here date  i dont believe lads as ever i wos above two months ashore at a time all the coorse of my life an mostly not as long as that  the smell o tar and the taste o salt water wos the fust things i iver comed acrossxcept the line i comed across that jist about the time i wos born so im toldand the smell o tar and taste o salt waters wot ive bin used to most o my life and moreover wot i likes best  one old gentleman as took a fancy to me wen i wos a boy said to me one fine day wen i chanced to be ashore visitin my mothersays he my boy would ye like to go with me and live in the country and be a gardner  wot says i keep a garding and plant taters and hoe flowers an cabidges yes says he at least somethin o that sort  no thankee says i i blong to the sea i do i wouldnt leave that ere no more nor i would quit my first love if i had one  im a sailor i am out and out through and throughtrue blue and no mistake an no one need go for to try to cause me for to forsake my purfession and live on shore like a turnipthats wot i says to that old genlemen  yes lads ive roamed the wide ocean as the song says far an near  ive bin tattooed by the new zealanders and ive danced with the hottentots and ate puppy dogs with the chinese and fished whales in the north seas and run among the ice near the south pole and fowt with pirates and done service on boord of menowar and merchantmen and junks and bumboats but i never concluded gurney looking round with a sigh i never came for to be located on a sandbank in the middle of the ocean  no more did any on us added rokens moreover if were not picked up soon by a ship o some sort were not likely to be located here long for we cant live on salt junk for ever we shall all die o the scurvy  there was just enough of possible and probable truth in the last remark to induce a feeling of sadness among the men for a few minutes but this was quickly put to flight by the extraordinary movements of phil briant that worthy had left the group round the fire and had wandered out to the extreme end of the rocky point where he sat down to indulge possibly in sad or mayhap hopeful reflections  he was observed to start suddenly up and gaze into the sea eagerly for a few seconds then he cut a caper slapped his thigh and ran hastily towards the tent  what now where away phil cried one of the men  briant answered not but speedily reappeared at the opening of the tent door with a fishingline and hook  hastening to the point of rock he opened a small species of shellfish that he found there wherewith he baited his hook and then cast it into the sea  in a few minutes he felt a twitch which caused him to return a remarkably vigorous twitch as it were in reply  the fish and the sailor for some minutes acted somewhat the part of electricians in a telegraph office when the fish twitched briant twitched when the fish pulled and paused briant pulled and paused and when the fish held on hard briant pulled hard and finally pulled him ashore and a very nice plump rockcodling he was  there were plenty of them so in a short time there was no lack of fresh fish and rokens fear that they would have to live on salt junk was not realised  fishing for rockcodlings now became one of the chief recreations of the men while not engaged in bringing various necessaries from the wreck but for many days at first they found their hands fully occupied in making their new abode habitable in enlarging and improving the tent which soon by degrees came to merit the name of a hut and in inventing various ingenious contrivances for the improvement of their condition it was not until a couple of weeks had passed that time began to hang heavy on their hands and fishing became a general amusement  they all fished except jacko  even ailie tried it once or twice but she did not like it and soon gave it up  as for jacko he contented himself with fishing with his hands in a sly way among the provision casks at which occupation he was quite an adept and many a nice titbit did he fish up and secrete in his private apartment for future use  like many a human thief jacko was at last compelled to leave the greater part of his illgotten and hoarded gains behind him  one day glynn and ailie sat by the margin of a deep pool in fairyland gazing down into its clear depths  the suns rays penetrated to the very bottom revealing a thousand beauties in form and colour that called forth from ailie the most extravagant expressions of admiration she wound up one of those eloquent bursts by saying  oh glynn how very very much i do wish i could go down there and play with the dear exquisite darling little fishes  youd surprise them i suspect said glynn  its rather too deep a pool to play in unless you were a mermaid  how deep is it glynn  bout ten feet i think  so much  it does not look like it  what a very pretty bit of coral i see over there close to the white rock do you see it  it is bright pink  oh i would like so much to have it  would you cried glynn jumping up and throwing off his jacket then here goes for it  so saying he clasped his hands above his head and bending forward plunged into the pool and went straight at the piece of pink coral headforemost like an arrow  glynn was lightly clad  his costume consisted simply of a pair of white canvas trousers and a blue striped shirt with a silk kerchief round his neck so that his movements in the water were little if at all impeded by his clothes  at the instant he plunged into the water king bumble happened to approach and while ailie stood petrified with fear as she saw glynn struggling violently at the bottom of the pool her sable companion stood looking down with a grin from ear to ear that displayed every one of his white teeth  dont be fraid missie ally said the negro hims know wot hims doin ho yis  before ailie could reply glynn was on the surface spluttering and brushing the hair from his forehead with one hand while with the other he hugged to his breast the piece of pink coral  hereithais  my breathohis amost goneailiecatch hold cried he as he held out the coveted piece of rock to the child and scrambled out of the pool  oh thank you glynn but why did you go down so quick and stay so long  i got such a fright  you bin pay your spects to de fishes said bumble with a grin  yes i have bumble and they say that if you stare at them any longer with your great goggle eyes theyll all go mad with horror and die right off  have you caught any codlings bumble  yis me hab an me hab come for to make a preeposol to missie ally  a what bumble  a preeposola digestion  i suppose you mean a suggestion eh  yis dat the berry ting  well out with it  dis am it  me ketch rockcoddles well me put em in bucket ob water an bring em to you missie ally an you put em into dat pool and tame em an hab great fun with em  eeh wot you tink  oh it will be so nice  how good of you to think about it bumble do get them as quick as you can  bumble looked grave and hesitated  why whats wrong inquired glynn  oh noting  me only tink me not take the trouble to put em into dat pool where de fishes speak so imperently ob me  stop me will go an ask if dey sorry for wot dey hab say  so saying the negro uttered a shout sprang straight up into the air doubled his head down and his heels up and cleft the water like a knife  glynn uttered a cry something between a yell and a laugh and sprang after him falling flat on the water and dashing the whole pool into foam and there the two wallowed about like two porpoises to the unbounded delight of ailie who stood on the brink laughing until the tears ran down her cheeks and to the unutterable horror no doubt of the little fish  the rockcodlings were soon caught and transferred to the pool in which after that neither glynn nor bumble were suffered to dive or swim and ailie succeeded by means of regularly feeding them in making the little fish less afraid of her than they were at first  but while ailie and glynn were thus amusing themselves and trying to make the time pass as pleasantly as possible captain dunning was oppressed with the most anxious forebodings  they had now been several weeks on the sandbank  the weather had during that time been steadily fine and calm and their provisions were still abundant but he knew that this could not last  moreover he found on consulting his charts that he was far out of the usual course of ships and that deliverance could only be expected in the shape of a chance vessel  oppressed with these thoughts which however he carefully concealed from every one except tim rokens and the doctor the captain used to go on the point of rocks every day and sit there for hours gazing out wistfully over the sea    chapter eighteen  matters grow worse and worsethe mutinycommencement of boatbuilding and threatening storms  one afternoon about three weeks after the red eric had been wrecked on the sandbank captain dunning went out on the point of rocks and took up his accustomed position there  habit had now caused him to go to the point with as much regularity as a sentinel  but on the present occasion anxiety was more deeply marked on his countenance than usual for dark threatening clouds were seen accumulating on the horizon an unnatural stillness prevailed in the hot atmosphere and on the glassy sea and everything gave indication of an approaching storm  while he sat on a low rock with his elbows on his knees and his chin resting in his hands he felt a light touch on his shoulder and looking round found ailie standing by his side  catching her in his arms he pressed her fervently to his heart and for the first time spoke to her in discouraging tones  my own darling said he parting the hair from her forehead and gazing at the child with an expression of the deepest sadness i fear we shall never quit this dreary spot  ailie looked timidly in her fathers face for his agitated manner more than his words alarmed her  wont we leave it dear papa said she to go up yonder and she pointed to a gathering mass of clouds overhead which although heavy with dark shadows had still a few bright sunny points of resemblance to the fairy realms in which she delighted to wander in her daydreams  the captain made no reply but shutting his eyes and drawing ailie close to his side he uttered a long and fervent prayer to god for deliverance if he should see fit or for grace to endure with christian resignation and fortitude whatever he pleased to send upon them  when he concluded and again looked up dr hopley was standing beside them with his head bowed upon his breast  i fear doctor said the captain that i have broken my resolution not to alarm my dear ailie by word or look  yet why should i conceal from her the danger of our position  her prayers for help ought to ascend as well as ours to him who alone can deliver us from evil at any time but who makes us to feel as well as know the fact at such times as these  but i am not afraid papa said ailie quickly  im never afraid when you are by me and ive known we were in danger all along for ive heard everybody talking about it often and often and ive always prayed for deliverance and surely it must come for has not jesus said if we ask anything in his name he will give it to us  true darling but he means only such things as will do us good  of course papa if i asked for a bad thing i would not expect him to give me that  deliverance from death said the doctor is a good thing yet we cannot be sure that god will grant our prayer for that  there are worse things than death doctor replied the captain it may be sometimes better for men to die than to live  it seems to me that we ought to use the words if it please the lord more frequently than we do in prayer  deliverance from sin needs no such if but deliverance from death does  at this point the conversation was interrupted by tim rokens who came up to the captain and said respectfully  if ye please sir it ud be as well if ye wos to speak to the men theres somethin like mutiny agoin on i fear  mutiny why what about  its about the spirits  some on em says as how they wants to enjoy theirselves here as much as they can for they wont have much chance o doin so ashore any more  its my belief that fellow tarquins at the bottom ot  theres not much spirits aboard the wreck to fight about said the captain somewhat bitterly as they all rose and hurried towards the hut  i only brought a supply for medicine but it must not be touched however little there is  when the captain came up he found the space in front of their rude dwelling a scene of contention and angry dispute that bade fair to end in a fight  tarquin was standing before the first mate with his knife drawn and using violent language and gesticulations towards him while the latter stood by the raft grasping a handspike with which he threatened to knock the steward down if he set foot on it  the men were grouped round them some with looks that implied a desire to side with tarquin while others muttered shame  shame cried tarquin looking fiercely round on his shipmates who cried shame  were pretty sure all on us to be starved to death on this reef and its my opinion that since we havent got to live long we should try to enjoy ourselves as much as we can  theres not much spirits aboard mores the pity but what there is i shall have  so again i say who cried shame  i did said glynn proctor stepping quickly forward and i invite all who think with me to back me up  here ye are me boy said phil briant starting forward and baring his brawny arms as was his invariable custom in such circumstances its meself asll stick by ye lad av the whole crew should go with that halfcaste crokidile  gurney and dick barnes immediately sided with glynn also but jim scroggles and nikel sling and to the surprise of every one markham the second mate sided with the steward  as the opposing parties glanced at each other glynn observed that although his side was superior in numbers some of the largest and most powerful men of the crew were among his opponents and he felt that a conflict between such men must inevitably be serious  matters had almost come to a crisis when dr hopley and the captain approached the scene of action  the latter saw at a glance the state of affairs and stepping up to the steward ordered him at once into the hut  tarquin seemed to waver for a moment under the stern gaze of his commander but he suddenly swore a terrible oath and said that he would not obey  youre no longer in command of us he said gruffly now that you have lost your ship  every man may do what he pleases  may he replied the captain then it pleases me to do that and launching out his clenched right hand with all his might he hit the steward therewith right between the eyes  tarquin went down as if he had been shot and lay stunned and at full length upon the sand  now my lads cried the captain turning towards the men what he said just now is so far right  having lost my ship i am no longer entitled to command you but my command does not cease unless a majority of you choose that it should  tarquin has taken upon himself to decide the question without asking your opinion which amounts to mutiny and mutiny under the circumstances in which we are placed requires to be promptly dealt with  i feel it right to say this because i am a man of peace as you well know and do not approve of a too ready appeal to the fists for the settlement of a dispute  ah then mores the pity interrupted briant for ye use them oncommon well  a suppressed laugh followed this remark  silence men this is no time for jesting  one of our shipmates has not long since been taken suddenly from us it may be that we shall all of us be called into the presence of our maker before many days pass over us  we have much to do that will require to be done promptly and well if we would hope to be delivered at all and the question must be decided now whether i am to command you or every one is to do what he pleases  i votes for capen dunning exclaimed gurney  so does i cried jim scroggles who being somewhat weathercockish in his nature turned always with wonderful facility to the winning side  three cheers for the capen cried dick barnes suiting the action to the word  almost every voice joined in the vociferous cheer with which this proposal was received  an wan more for miss ailie shouted phil briant  even jacko lent his voice to the tremendous cheer that followed for briant in his energy chanced to tread on that creatures unfortunate tail which always seemed to be in his own way as well as in that of every one else and the shriek that he uttered rang high above the laughter into which the cheer degenerated as some one cried ah pat trust you my boy for rememberin the ladies  order having been thus happily restored and captain dunning having announced that the late attempt at mutiny should thenceforth be buried in total oblivion a council was called in order to consider seriously their present circumstances and to devise if possible some means of escape  my lads said the captain when they were all assembled ive been ponderin over matters ever since we were cast away on this bank an ive at last come to the conclusion that our only chance of gettin away is to build a small boat and fit her out for a long voyage  i need not tell you that this chance is a poor onewellnigh a forlorn hope  had it been better i would have spoken before now and began the work sooner but i have lived from day to day in the hope of a ship heaving in sight  this is a vain hope  we are far out of the usual track of all ships here  none come this way except such as may chance to be blown out of their course as we were and even if one did come within sight its ten chances to one that we should fail to attract attention on such a low bank as this  ive had several reliable observations of late and i find that we are upwards of two thousand miles from the nearest known land which is the cape of good hope  i propose therefore that we should strip off as much of the planking of the wreck as will suit our purpose get the carpenters chest landed and commence work at once  now what say you if anyone has a better plan to suggest ill be only to glad to adopt it for such a voyage in so slim a craft as we can build here will be one necessarily replete with danger  ill tell ye wot it is capen said tim rokens rising up taking off his cap and clearing his throat as if he were about to make a studied oration  weve not none on us got no suggestions to make wotsomdiver youve only got to give the word and well go to work an the sooner you does so the better for its my blief well have a gale afore long thatll pretty well stop work altogether as long as it lasts  the indications in the sky gave such ample testimony to the justness of rokens observations that no more time was wasted in discussion  dick barnes who acted the part of ships carpenter when not otherwise engaged went out to the wreck on the raft with a party of men under command of mr millons to fetch planking and the necessary material for the construction of a boat while the remainder of the crew under the captains superintendence prepared a place near fairyland for laying the keel  this spot was selected partly on account of the convenient formation of the shore for the launching of the boat when finished and partly because that would be the lee side of the rocky point when the coming storm should burst  for the latter reason the hut was removed to fairyland and poor ailie had the mortification in a few hours of seeing her little paradise converted into an unsightly wreck of confusion alas how often this is the case in human affairs of greater moment showing the folly of setting our hearts on the things of earth  it seems at first sight a hard passage that in the word of god  what the enthusiastic but thoughtless are ready to exclaim not love the world the bright beautiful world that was made by god to be enjoyed not love our fathers mothers brothers sisters wives not give our warmest affections to all these  truly ye hasty ones if you would but earnestly consider it you would find that god not only permits but requires us to love all that is good and beautiful here as much as we will as much as we can but we ought to love himself more  if this be our happy condition then our hearts are not set on the world on the contrary they are set free to love the world and all that is lovable in itof which there is very very muchmore probably than the best of men suppose  else wherefore does the father love it and care for it so tenderly  but ailie had not set her heart on her possessions on the sandbank  she felt deep regret for a time it is true and in feeling thus she indulged a right and natural impulse but that impulse did not lead to the sin of murmuring  her sorrow soon passed away and she found herself as cheerful and happy afterwards in preparing for her long long voyage as ever she had been in watching the gambols of her fish or in admiring the lovely hues of the weeds and coral rocks in the limpid pools of fairyland  it was a fortunate circumstance that captain dunning set about the preparations for building the boat that afternoon for the storm burst upon them sooner than had been expected and long before all the requisite stores and materials had been rafted from the wreck  the most important things however had been procuredsuch as the carpenters chest a large quantity of planking oakum and cordage and several pieces of sail cloth with the requisite thread and needles for making boat sails  still much was wanting when the increasing violence of the wind compelled them to leave off work  some of the men were now ordered to set about securing such materials as had been collected while others busied themselves in fixing ropes to the hut and rolling huge masses of coral rock against its fragile walls to steady it  av ye plaze sir said briant to the captain wiping his forehead as he approached with a lump of tarry canvas which he used in default of a better pockethandkerchief av ye plaze sir wotll i do now  do something useful lad whatever you do said the captain looking up from the hole which he was busily engaged in digging for the reception of a post to steady the hut  theres lots of work you can please yourself as to choice  then i comed fur to suggist that the purvisions and things atop o the sandbank isnt quite so safe as they might be  true briant i was just thinking of that as you came up  go and see you make a tight job of it  get rokens to help you  briant hurried off and calling his friend walked with him to the top of the sandbank leaning heavily against the gale and staggering as they went  the blast now whistled so that they could scarcely hear each other talk  well be blowed right into the sea shouted tim as the two reached a pile of casks and cases  sure thats me own belaif entirely roared his companion  what dye say to dig a hole and stick the things in it yelled rokens  were not fit screamed phil  lets try shrieked the other  to this briant replied by falling on his knees on the lee side of the goods and digging with his hands in the sand most furiously  tim rokens followed his example and the two worked like a couple of seamoles if such creatures exist until a hole capable of holding several casks was formed  into this they stowed all the biscuit casks and a few other articles and covered them up with sand  the remainder they covered with tarpaulin and threw sand and stones above it until the heap was almost buried out of sight  this accomplished they staggered back to the hut as fast as they could  here they found everything snugly secured and as the rocks effectually sheltered the spot from the gale with the exception of an occasional eddying blast that drove the sand in their faces they felt comparatively comfortable  lighting their pipes they sat down among their comrades to await the termination of the storm    chapter nineteen  the storm  a storm in almost all circumstances is a grand and solemnising sight one that forces man to feel his own weakness and his makers might and majesty  but a storm at sea in southern latitudes where the winds are let loose with a degree of violence that is seldom or never experienced in the temperate zones is so terrific that no words can be found to convey an adequate idea of its appalling ferocity  the storm that at this time burst upon the little sandbank on which the shipwrecked crew had found shelter was one of the most furious perhaps that ever swept the seas  the wind shrieked as if it were endued with life tore up the surface of the groaning deep into masses and shreds of foam which it whirled aloft in mad fury and then dissipated into a thin blinding mist that filled the whole atmosphere so that one could scarcely see a couple of yards beyond the spot on which he stood  the hurricane seemed to have reached its highest point soon after sunset that night and a ray of light from the moon struggled ever and anon through the black hurtling clouds as if to reveal to the cowering seamen the extreme peril of their situation  the great ocean was lashed into a wide sheet of foam and the presence of the little isle in the midst of that swirling waste of water was indicated merely by a slight circle of foam that seemed whiter than the rest of the sea  the men sat silently in their frail hut listening to the howling blast without  a feeling of awe crept over the whole party and the most careless and the lightest of heart among the crew of the red eric ceased to utter his passing jest and became deeply solemnised as the roar of the breakers filled his ear and reminded him that a thin ledge of rock alone preserved him from instant destruction  the wind has shifted a point said the captain who had just risen and opened a chink of the rude door of the hut in order to look out  i see that the keel of the boat is all fast and the planking beside it  the coral rock shelters it just now but if the wind goes on shifting i fear it will stand a poor chance  wed better go out and give it a hextra fastening suggested mr millons  not yet  theres no use of exposing any of the men to the risk of being blown away  the wind may keep steady in which case ive no fear for it  i dun know said rokens who sat beside ailie close to the embers of their fire with a glowing cinder from which he relighted his pipe for at least the twentieth time that night  you never can tell wots agoin to turn up  ill go out capen if ye like and see that alls fast  perhaps youre right tim you may make a bolt across to it and heave another rock or two on the planking if it seems to require it  the seaman rose and putting aside his pipe threw off his coat partly in order that he might present as small a surface to the wind as possible and partly that he might have a dry garment to put on when he returned  as he opened the little door of the hut a rude gust of wind burst in filling the apartment with spray and scattering the embers of the fire  i feared as much said the captain as he and the men started up to gather together the pieces of glowing charcoal that shows the winds shifted another point if it goes round two points more itll smash our boat to pieces  look sharp tim  lean well against the wind me boy cried briant in a warning voice  thus admonished rokens issued forth and dashed across the open space that separated the hut from the low ledge of coral rock behind which the keel of the intended boat and its planking were sheltered  a very few minutes sufficed to show tim that all was fast and to enable him to place a few additional pieces of rock above the heap in order to keep it down  then he prepared to dart back again to the hut from the doorway of which his proceedings were watched by the captain and as many of the men as could crowd round it  just as the harpooner sprang from the shelter of the rock the blast burst upon the bank with redoubled fury as if it actually were a sentient being and wished to catch the sailor in its rude grasp and whirl him away  rokens bent his stout frame against it with all his might and stood his ground for a few seconds like a noble tree on some exposed mountain side that has weathered the gales of centuries  then he staggered threw his arms wildly in the air and a moment after was swept from the spot and lost to view in the driving spray that flew over the island  the thing was so instantaneous that the horrified onlookers could scarcely credit the evidence of their eyes and they stood aghast for a moment or two ere their feelings found vent in a cry of alarm  next instant captain dunning felt himself rudely pushed aside and briant leaped through the doorway shouting as he dashed out  if tim rokens goes its phil briant asll go along with him  the enthusiastic irishman was immediately lost to view and glynn proctor was about to follow when the captain seized him by the collar dragged him back and shut the door violently  keep back lads he cried no one must leave the hut  if these two men cannot save themselves by means of their own strong muscles no human power can save them  glynn and indeed all of the men felt this remark to be true so they sat down round the fire and looked in each others faces with the expression of men who half believed they must be dreaming  little was said during the next ten or fifteen minutes indeed it was difficult to make their voices heard owing to the noise of the wind and dashing waves  the captain stood at the door looking out from time to time with feelings of the deepest anxiety each moment expecting to see the two sailors struggling back towards the hut but they did not return soon the gale increased to such a degree that every one felt although no one would acknowledge it even to himself that there was now no hope of their comrades ever returning  the wind shifted another point and now their lost shipmates were for a time forgotten in the anxieties of their own critical position for their rocky ledge formed only a partial shelter and every now and then the hut was shaken with a blast so terrible that it threatened to come down about their ears  dont you think our house will fall dear papa inquired ailie as a gust more furious than any that had hitherto passed swept round the rocks and shook the hut as if it had been made of pasteboard  god knows my darling we are in his hands  ailie tried to comfort herself with the thought that her heavenly father was indeed the ruler of the storm and could prevent it from doing them harm if he pleased but as gust after gust dashed against the frail building and almost shook it down while the loud rattling of the boards which composed it almost stunned her an irresistible feeling of alarm crept over her despite her utmost efforts to control herself  the captain now ordered the men to go out and see that the fastenings to windward and the supports to leeward of the hut remained firm and to add more of them if possible  he set the example by throwing off his coat and leading the way  this duty was by no means so difficult or dangerous as that which had been previously performed by rokens for it must be remembered the hut as yet was only exposed to partial gusts of eddying wind not to the full violence of the storm  it involved a thorough wetting however to all who went  in ten minutes the men reentered and put on their dry coats but as no one knew how soon he might again be called upon to expose himself none thought of changing his other garments  now ailie my pet said captain dunning sitting down beside his child on the sandy floor of the hut weve done all we can  if the wind remains as it is our house will stand  but have you not seen rokens or briant inquired ailie with an anxious face while the tears rolled over her cheeks  the captain shook his head but made no reply and the men looked earnestly at each other as if each sought to gather a ray of hope from the countenance of his friend  while they sat thus a terrible blast shook the hut to its foundation  again and again it came with everincreasing violence and then it burst on them with a continuous roar like prolonged thunder  look out cried the captain instinctively clasping ailie in his arms while the men sprang to their feet  the stout cornerposts bent over before the immense pressure and the second mate placed his shoulder against one of those on the windward side of the hut while dick barnes and nikel sling did the same to the other  its all up with us cried tarquin as part of the roof blew off and a deluge of water and spray burst in upon them extinguishing the fire and leaving them in total darkness  at that moment ailie felt herself seized round the waist by a pair of tiny arms and putting down her hand she felt that jacko was clinging to her with a tight but trembling grasp  even in that hour of danger the child experienced a sensation of pleasure at the mere thought that there was one living creature there which looked up to and clung to her for protection and although she knew full well that if the stout arm of her father which encircled her were removed her own strength in their present circumstances could not have availed to protect herself yet she felt a gush of renewed strength and courage at her heart when the poor little monkey put its trembling arms around her  lay your shoulders to the weatherwall lads cried the captain as another rush of wind bore down in the devoted hut  the men obeyed but their united strength availed nothing against the mighty power that raged without  the wind as the captain had feared went round another point and they were now exposed to the unbroken force of the hurricane  for a few minutes the stout cornerposts of the hut held up then they began to rend and crack  bear down with the blast to the lee of the rocks lads cried the captain its your only chance dont try to face it  almost before the words left his lips the posts snapped with a loud crash the hut was actually lifted off the ground by the wind and swept completely away while most of the men were thrown violently to the ground by the wreck as it passed over their heads  the captain fell like the rest but he retained his grasp of ailie and succeeded in rising and as the gale carried him away with irresistible fury he bore firmly down to his right and gained the eddy caused by the rocks which until now had sheltered the hut  he was safe but he did not feel secure until he had staggered towards the most sheltered part and placed his child in a cleft of the rock  here he found gurney and tarquin before him and soon after glynn came staggering in along with one or two others  in less than three minutes after the hut had been blown away all the men were collected in the cleft where they crouched down to avoid the pelting pitiless spray that dashed over their heads  it is difficult to conceive a more desperate position than that in which they were now placed yet there and at that moment a thrill of joy passed through the hearts of most if not all of them for they heard a shout which was recognised to be the voice of tim rokens  it came from the rocks a few yards to their right and almost ere it had died away rokens himself staggered into the sheltering cleft of rock accompanied by phil briant  some of the men who had faced the dangers to which they had been exposed with firm nerves and unblanched cheeks now grew pale and trembled violently for they actually believed that the spirits of their lost shipmates had come to haunt them  but these superstitious fears were soon put to flight by the hearty voice of the harpooner who shook himself like a great newfoundland dog as he came up and exclaimed  why wot on airth has brought ye all here  i think we may say what has brought you here replied the captain as he grasped them each by the hand and shook them with as much energy as if he had not met them for ten years past  its aisy to tell that said briant as he crouched down in the midst of the group tim and me wos blowd right across the bank an we should no doubt ha bin blowd right into the sea but tim went full split agin one o the casks o salt junk and i went slap agin him and we lay for a moment all but dead  then we crep in the lee o the cask an lay there till a lull came when we clapped on all sail an made for the shelter o the rocks an shure we got there niver a taste too soon for it came on to blow the next minit fit to blow the eyelids off yer face it did  its a fact added rokens  moreover we tried to git round to the hut but as we wos twice nearly blowed away wen we tried for to double the point we greed to stay where we wos till the back o the gale should be broke  but now lets hear wots happened  the huts gone said gurney in reply  blowed clean over our heads toi dun know where  blowed away cried rokens and briant in consternation  not a stick left replied the captain  an the boat inquired briant  its gone too i fancy but we cant be sure  then its all up boys observed briant for nearly every morsel o the prog that wos on the top o the bank is washed away  this piece of news fell like a thunderbolt on the men and no one spoke for some minutes  at last the captain said  well lads we must do the best we can  thank god we are still alive so let us see whether we cant make our present quarters more comfortable  setting his men the example captain dunning began to collect the few boards and bits of canvas that chanced to have been left on that side of the rocky ledge when the hut was removed to the other side and with these materials a very partial and insufficient shelter was put up  but the space thus inclosed was so small that they were all obliged to huddle together in a mass  those farthest from the rock were not altogether protected from the spray that flew over their heads while those nearest to it were crushed and incommoded by their companions  thus they passed that eventful night and all the following day during which the storm raged with such fury that no one dared venture out to ascertain how much if any of their provisions and stores were left to them  during the second night a perceptible decrease in the violence of the gale took place and before morning it ceased altogether  the sun rose in unclouded splendour sending its bright and warm beams up into the clear blue sky and down upon the ocean which glittered vividly as it still swelled and trembled with agitation  all was serene and calm in the sky while below the only sound that broke upon the ear was the deep and regular dash of the great breakers that fell upon the shores of the islet and encircled it with a fringe of purest white  on issuing from their confined uneasy nest in the cleft of the rock part of the shipwrecked crew hastened anxiously to the top of the bank to see how much of their valuable store of food was left while others ran to the spot in fairyland where the keel of the new boat had been laid  the latter party found to their joy that all was safe everything having been well secured but a terrible sight met the eyes of the other men  not a vestige of all their store remained  the summit of the sandbank was as smooth as on the day they landed there  casks boxes barrelsall were gone everything had been swept away into the sea  almost instinctively the men turned their eyes towards the reef on which the red eric had grounded each man feeling that in the wrecked vessel all his hope now remained  it too was gone  the spot on which it had lain was now washed by the waves and a few broken planks and spars on the beach were all that remained to remind them of their ocean home  the men looked at each other with deep despondency expressed in their countenances  they were haggard and worn from exposure anxiety and want of rest and as they stood there in their wet torn garments they looked the very picture of despair  theres one chance for us yet lads exclaimed tim rokens looking carefully round the spot on which they stood  whats that exclaimed several of the men eagerly catching at their comrades words as drowning men are said to catch at straws  briant an me buried some o the things by good luck when we were sent to make all snug here an im of opinion theyll be here yet if we could only find the place  let me see  rokens glanced round at the rocks beside which their hut had found shelter and at the reef where the ship had been wrecked in order to find the bearins o the spot as he expressed it  then walking a few yards to one side he struck his foot on the sand and said it should be hereabouts  the blow of his heel returned a peculiar hollow sound very unlike that produced by stamping on the mere sand  shure yeve hit the very spot ye have cried briant falling on his knees beside the place and scraping up the sand with both hands  it sounds uncommon like a breadcask  here it is  hurrah boys lind a hand will ye  there now heave away but trate it tinderly  shure its the only friend weve got in the wide world  youre all wrong phil cried gurney who almost at the same moment began to scrape another hole close by  its not our only one heres another friend o the same family  bear a hand lads  and heres another cried ailie with a little scream of delight as she observed the rim of a small keg just peeping out above the sand  well done ailie cried glynn as he ran to the spot and quickly dug up the keg in question which however proved to be full of nails to ailies great disappointment for she expected it to have turned out a keg of biscuits  how many casks did you bury inquired the captain  its meself cant tell replied briant dye know tim  three i think but we was in sich a hurry that i aint sartin exactly  well then boys look here continued the captain drawing a pretty large circle on the sand set to work like a band of moles an dig up every inch o that till you come to the water  thats your sort cried rokens plunging elbowdeep into the sand at once  arrah then heres at ye a fair field an no favour at any price shouted briant baring his arms straddling his legs and sending a shower of sand behind him that almost overwhelmed gurney before that stout little individual could get out of the way  the spirits of the men were farther rejoiced by the coming up of the other party bearing the good news that the keel of the boat was safe as well as all her planking and the carpenters tools which fortunately happened to have been secured in a sheltered spot  from the depths of despair they were all suddenly raised to renewed and sanguine hope so that they wrought with the energy of golddiggers and soon their toil was rewarded by the discovery of that which in their circumstances they would not have exchanged for all the golden nuggets that ever were or will be dug up from the prolific mines of australia california or british columbia namely three casks of biscuit a small keg of wine a cask of fresh water a roll of tobacco and a barrel of salt junk    chapter twenty  preparations for a long voyagebriant proves that ghosts can drink jacko astonishes his friends and saddens his adopted mother  wot i say is one thing wot you say is anotherso it is  i dun know wich is right or wich is wrongno more do you  praps you is praps i is anywise we cant both on us be right or both on us be wrongthats a comfort if its nothin else  wot you say isthat its morally impossble for a crew sich as us to travel over two thousand miles of ocean on three casks o biscuit and a barrel o salt junk  wot i say isthat we can an moreover that morals has nothin to do with it wotsomediver  now wot then  tim rokens paused and looked at gurney to whom his remarks were addressed as if he expected an answer  that rotund little seaman did not however appear to be thoroughly prepared to reply to wot then for he remained silent but looked at his comrade as though to say ill be happy to learn wisdom from your sagacious lips  wot then repeated tim rokens assaulting his knee with his clenched fist in a peculiarly emphatic manner ill tell ye wot then as you may be right and i may be right an nother on us can be both right or wrong i say as how that we dont know nothin about it  gurney looked as if he did not quite approve of so summary a method of solving such a knotty question but observing from the expression of rokens countenance that though he had paused that philosopher had not yet concluded he remained silent  an furthermore continued tim its my opinionseein that were both on us in such a state o cumblebofubulation an dont know nothinwed better go an ax the capen who does  you may save yourselves the trouble observed glynn proctor who at that moment came up and sat down on the rocks beside them with a piece of the salt junk that formed an element in the question at issue in his hand  ive just heard the captain give his opinion on that subject and he says that the boat can be got ready in a week or less and that with strict economy the provisions we have will last us long enough to enable us to make the cape supposing we have good weather and fair winds  thats his opinion  i told ye so said tim rokens  you did nothin o the sort retorted gurney  well if ye come fur to be oncommon strick in the use o your lingo i did not xactly tell ye so but i thought so wich is all the same  it aint all the same replied gurney whose temper seemed to have been a little soured by the prospects before him and you dont need to go for to be talkin there like a great solon as you are  wots a solon inquired tim  solon was a man as thought hisself a great feelosopher but he wornt he wor an ass  if im like solon retorted rokens youre like a solongoose wich is an animal as dont think itself an ass cause its too great a one to know it  having thus floored his adversary the philosophic mariner turned to glynn and said  in course we cant expect to be on full allowance  of course not old boy the captain remarked just as i left him that wed have to be content with short allowancevery short allowance indeed  gurney sighed deeply  how much inquired tim  about three ounces of biscuit one ounce of salt junk and a quarter of a pint of water per day  gurney groaned aloud  you of all men said glynn have least reason to complain gurney for youve got fat enough on your own proper person to last you a week at least  ay a fortnight or more added rokens an even then yed scarcely be redooced to a decent size  ah but pleaded gurney you scarecrow creatures dont know how horrid sore the process o comin down is  an one gets so cold too its just like taking off yer clos  sarves ye right for puttin on so many said rokens as he rose to resume work which he and gurney had left off threequarters of an hour before in order to enjoy a quiet philosophical teteatete during dinner  its a bad business that of the planking not being sufficient to deck or even halfdeck the boat observed glynn as they went together towards the place where the new boat was being built  it is replied rokens but its a good thing that weve got plenty of canvas to spare  it wont make an overly strong deck to be sure but its better than nothin  a heavy sea would burst it in no time remarked gurney  we must hope to escape heavy seas then said glynn as they parted and went to their several occupations  the boat that was now building with the most urgent despatch had a keel of exactly twentythree feet long and her breadth at the widest part was seven feet  she was being as well and firmly put together as the materials at their command would admit of and as far as the work had yet proceeded she bid fair to become an excellent boat capable of containing the whole crew and their small quantity of provisions  this last was diminishing so rapidly that captain dunning resolved to put all hands at once on short allowance  notwithstanding this the men worked hard and hopefully for as each plank and nail was added to their little bark they felt as if they were a step nearer home  the captain and the doctor however and one or two of the older men could not banish from their minds the fact that the voyage they were about to undertake was of the most perilous nature and one which in any other than the hopeless circumstances in which they were placed at that time would have been regarded as the most desperate of forlorn hopes  for fourteen souls to be tossed about on the wide and stormy sea during many weeks it might be months in a small open boat crowded together and cramped without sufficient covering and on short allowance of food was indeed a dreary prospect even for the menhow much more so for the delicate child who shared their trials and sufferings  captain dunnings heart sank within him when he thought of it but he knew how great an influence the conduct and bearing of a commander has in such circumstances on his men so he strove to show a smiling cheerful countenance though oftentimes he carried a sad and anxious heart in his bosom  to the doctor and tim rokens alone did he reveal his inmost thoughts because he knew that he could trust them and felt that he needed their advice and sympathy  the work progressed so rapidly that in a few days more the boat approached completion and preparations were being made in earnest for finally quitting the little isle on which they had found a home for so many days  it was observed by the captain that as the work of boatbuilding drew to a close glynn proctor continued to labour long after the others had retired to rest wearied with the toils of the daytoils which they were not now so well able to bear as heretofore on account of the slight want of vigour caused by being compelled to live on half allowance  one evening the captain went down to the building yard in fairyland and said to glynn  hallo my boy at it yet  why what are you making  a dogkennel eh  no not exactly that replied glynn laughing  youll hardly guess  i would say it was a house for jacko only it seems much too big  its just possible that jacko may have a share in it said glynn but its not for him  who then  not for yourself surely  its for ailie cried glynn gleefully  dont you think it will be required he added looking up as if he half feared the captain would not permit his contrivance to be used  well i believe it will my boy  i had intended to get some sort of covering for my dear ailie put up in the sternsheets but i did not think of absolutely making a box for her  ah youll find it will be a capital thing at nights  i know she could never stand the exposure and canvas dont keep out the rain well so i thought of rigging up a large box into which she can creep  ill make airholes in the roof that will let in air but not water and ill caulk the seams with oakum so as to keep it quite dry inside  thank you my boy its very kind of you to take so much thought for my poor child  yet she deserves it glynn and we cant be too careful of her  the captain patted the youth on the shoulder and leaving him to continue his work went to see gurney who had been ailing a little during the last few days  brandy in small quantities had been prescribed by the doctor and fortunately two bottles of that spirit had been swept from the wreck  being their whole stock captain dunning had stowed it carefully away in what he deemed a secret and secure place but it turned out that some member of the crew was not so strict in his principles of temperance as could be desired for on going to the spot to procure the required medicine it was found that one of the bottles was gone  this discovery caused the captain much anxiety and sorrow for besides inflicting on them the loss of a most valuable medicine it proved that there was a thief in their little society  what was to be done  to pass it over in silence would have shown weakness which especially in the circumstances in which they were at that time placed might have led at last to open mutiny  to discover the thief was impossible  the captains mind was soon made up  he summoned every one of the party before him and after stating the discovery he had made he said  now lads im not going to charge any of you with having done this thing but i cannot let it pass without warning you that if i discover any of you being guilty of such practices in future ill have the man tied up and give him three dozen with a ropesend  you know i have never resorted as many captains are in the habit of doing to corporal punishment  i dont like it  ive sailed in command of ships for many years and have never found it needful but now more than ever strict discipline must be maintained and i tell you once for all that i mean to maintain it at any cost  this speech was received in silence  all perceived the justice of it yet some felt that until the thief should be discovered they themselves would lie under suspicion  a few there were indeed whose wellknown and longestablished characters raised them above suspicion but there were others who knew that their character had not yet been established on so firm a basis and they felt that until the matter should be cleared up their honesty would be mentally at least called in question by their companions  with the exception of the disposition to mutiny related in a previous chapter this was the first cloud that had risen to interrupt the harmony of the shipwrecked sailors and as they returned to their work sundry suggestions and remarks were made in reference to the possibility of discovering the delinquent  i didnt think it wos possble said rokens  i thought as how there wasnt a man in the ship as could ha done sich a low mean thing as that  no more did i said dick barnes  wall boys observed nikel sling emphatically i guess as how that i dont believe it yet  arrah  dye think the bottle o brandy stole hisself inquired briant  i aint agoin fur to say that but a ghost might ha done it praps apurpose to get us into a scrape  there was a slight laugh at this and from that moment the other men suspected that sling was the culprit  the mere fact of his being the first to charge the crime upon any one elseeven a ghostcaused them in spite of themselves to come to this conclusion  they did not however by word or look show what was passing in their minds for the yankee was a favourite with his comrades and each felt unwilling that his suspicion should prove to be correct  i dont agree with you said tarquin who feared that suspicion might attach to himself seeing that he had been the ringleader in the recent mutiny i dont believe that ghosts drink  och thats all ye know cried phil briant  av yed only lived a month or two in owld ireland yed have seen raison to change yer mind ye would  sure ive seed a ghost the worse o liquor meself  oh  phil wot a stunner cried gurney  its as true as me names phil briantmores the pity  did i niver tell ye o the widdy morgan as had a ghost come to see her frequently  no neverlets hear it  stop that noise with yer hammer then tim rokens jist for five minutes and ill tell it ye  the men ceased work for a few minutes while their comrade spoke as follows  its not a long story boys but its long enough to prove that ghosts drink  ye must know that wance upon a time there wos a widdy as lived in a small town in the county o clare in owld ireland an oh but that was the place for drinkin and fightin  it wos there that i learned to use me sippers and it wos there too that i learned to give up drinkin for i comed for to see what a mighty dale o harm it did to my poor countrymen  the sexton o the place was the only man as niver wint near the grogshop and no wan iver seed him overtook with drink but it was a quare thing that no wan could rightly understand why he used to smell o drink very bad sometimes  there wos a young widdy in that town o the name o morgan as kep a cow an owned a small cabin an a patch o taterground about the size o the starn sheets of our owld longboat  she wos a great deal run after wos this widdynot that the young lads had an eye to the cow or the cabin or the taterestate by no manesbut she wos greatly admired she wos  i admired her meself and wint to see her pretty fraquent  well wan evenin i wint to see her an says i mrs morgan did ye iver hear the bit song called the widdy machree  sure i niver did says she  would ye like to hear it darlint says i  so she says she would an i gave it to her right off an when id done says i now widdy morgan ochone will ye take me  but she shook her head and looked melancholy  ye aint agoin to take spasms said i for i got frightened at her looks no says she but theres a sacret about me an i like ye too well phil to decaive ye if ye only knowd the sacret ye wouldnt have me at any price  wouldnt i says i try me cushla and see av i wont  phil briant says she awful solemn like im haunted  haunted says i av coorse ye are bliss yer purty face dont i know that ivery boy in the parish is after ye  its not that i mane  its a ghost as haunts me  it haunts me cabin and me cow and me taterestate an it drinks  now darlint says i everybody knows yer aisy frightened about ghosts  i dont belave in one meself an i dont mind em a farden dip but av all the ghosts in ireland haunted ye id niver give ye up  will ye come an see it this night says she  av coorse i will says i  an that same night i wint to her cabin and she let me in and put a candle on the table an hid me behind a great clock in a corner jist close by the cupboard where the brandybottle lived  then she lay down on her bed with her clos on and pulled the coverlid over her and pretinded to go to slape  in less nor halfanhour i hears a fut on the doorstep then a tap at the door which opened it seemed to me of its own accord and in walks the ghost sure enough  it was covered all over from head to fut in a white sheet and i seed by the way it walked that it wos the worse of drink i wos in a mortal fright ye may be sure an me knees shuk to that extint ye might have heard them rattle  the ghost walks straight up to the cupboard takes out the brandybottle and fills out a whole tumbler quite full and drinks it off it did the baste ivery dhrop  i seed it with me two eyes as sure as im astandin here  it came into the house drunk an it wint out drunker nor it came in  is that all exclaimed several of briants auditors  all av coorse it is  wot more would ye have  didnt i say that id tell ye a story as would prove to ye that ghosts drink more especially irish ghosts  to be sure it turned out afterwards that the ghost was the sexton o the parish as took advantage o the poor widdys fears but i can tell ye boys that ghost niver came back after the widdy became mrs briant  oh then ye married the widder did ye said jim scroggles  i did an shes alive and hearty this day av shes not  briant was interrupted by a sudden roar of laughter from the men who at that moment caught sight of jacko the small monkey in a condition of mind and body that to say the least of it did him no credit  we are sorry to be compelled to state that jacko was evidently and undoubtedly tipsy  gurney said he was as drunk as a fiddler  we cannot take upon ourself to say whether he was or was not as drunk as that  we are rather inclined to think that fiddlers as a class are maligned and that they are no worse than their neighbours in this respect perhaps not so bad  certainly if any fiddler really deserves the imputation it must be a violoncello player because he is properly speaking a basefiddler  be this however as it may jacko was unmistakably drunkin a maudlin state of intoxicationdrunker probably than ever a monkey was before or since  he appeared as he came slowly staggering forward to the place where the men were at work on the boat to have just wakened out of his first drunken sleep for his eyes were blinking like the orbs of an owl in the sunshine and in his walk he placed his right foot where his left should have gone and his left foot where his right should have gone occasionally making a little run forward to save himself from tumbling on his nose and then pulling suddenly up and throwing up his arms in order to avoid falling on his back  sometimes he halted altogetherand swayed to and fro gazing meanwhile pensively at the ground as if he were wondering why it had taken to rolling and earthquaking in that preposterous manner or were thinking on the baldheaded mother he had left behind him in the african wilderness when the loud laugh of the men saluted his ears jacko looked up as quickly and steadily as he could and grinned a ghastly smileor something like itas if to say what are you laughing at villains  it is commonly observed that among men the ruling passion comes out strongly when they are under the influence of strong drink  so it is with monkeys  jackos ruling passion was thieving but having at that time no particular inducement to steal he indulged his next ruling passionthat of affectionby holding out both arms and staggering towards phil briant to be taken up  a renewed burst of laughter greeted this movement  it knows ye phil cried jim scroggles  ah then so it should for its meself as is good to it  come to its uncle then  o good luck to yer purty little yaller face  so it wos you stole the brandy wos it  musha but ye might have knowd ye belonged to a timprance ship so ye might  jacko spread his arms on briants broad chestthey were too short to go round his necklaid his head thereon and sighed  perhaps he felt penitent on account of his wickedness but it is more probable that he felt uneasy in body rather than in mind  i say briant cried gurney  thats me answered the other  if you are jackos selfappointed uncle and miss ailie is his adopted mother wot relation is miss ailie to you  you never does nothin right gurney interposed nikel sling you cant even preepound a pruposition  heres how you oughter to ha put it  if phil briant be jackos uncle and miss ailie his adopted motherall three bein related in a sorter way by bein shipmates an all on us together bein closely connected in vartue of our bein messmateswot relation is gurney to a donkey  thats a puzzler said gurney affecting to consider the question deeply  heres a puzzler wotll beat it though observed tim rokens suppose we all go on talkin stuff till doomsday wenll the boat be finished  thats true cried dick barnes resuming work with redoubled energy take that young thief to his mother phil and tell her to ropesend him  im right glad to find though that he is the thief arter all and not one o us  on examination being made it was found that the broken and empty brandybottle lay on the floor of the monkeys nest and it was conjectured from the position in which it was discovered that that dissipated little creature having broken off the neck in order to get at the brandy had used the body of the bottle as a pillow whereon to lay its drunken little head  luckily for its own sake it had spilt the greater part of the liquid with which everything in its private residence was saturated and perfumed  on having ocular demonstration of the depravity of her pet ailie at first wept then on beholding its eccentric movements she laughed in spite of herself  after that she wept again and spoke to it reproachfully but failed to make the slightest impression on its hardened little heart  then she put it to bed and wrapped it up carefully in its sailcloth blanket  with this piece of unmerited kindness jacko seemed touched for he said ooooooooooeeee once or twice in a peculiarly soft and penitential tone after which he dropped into a calm untroubled slumber    chapter twenty one  the boat finishedfarewell to fairylandonce more at sea  at last the boat was finished  it had two masts and two lugsails and pulled eight oars  there was just sufficient room in it to enable the men to move about freely but it required a little management to enable them to stow themselves away when they went to sleep and had they possessed the proper quantity of provisions for their contemplated voyage there is no doubt that they would have found themselves considerably cramped  the boat was named the maid of the isle in memory of the sandbank on which she had been built and although in her general outline and details she was rather a clumsy craft she was serviceable and strongly put together  had she been decked or even halfdecked the voyage which now began would not have been so desperate an undertaking but having been only covered in part with a frail tarpaulin she was not at all fitted to face the terrible storms that sometimes sweep the southern seas  each man as he gazed at her felt that his chance of ultimate escape was very small indeed  still the men had now been so long contemplating the voyage and preparing for it and they had become so accustomed to risk their lives upon the sea that they set out upon this voyage at last in cheerful spirits and even jested about the anticipated dangers and trials which they knew full well awaited them  it was a lovely morning that on which the wrecked crew of the whaler bade adieu to fairyland as the islet had been named by ailiea name that was highly though laughingly approved of by the men  the ocean and sky presented that mysterious comingling of their gorgeous elements that irresistibly call forth the wonder and admiration of even the most unromantic and matteroffact men  it was one of ailies peculiarly beloved skies  you could not without much consideration have decided as to where was the exact line at which the glassy ocean met the clear sky and it was almost impossible to tell when gazing at the horizon which were the real clouds and which the reflections  the bright blue vault above was laden with clouds of the most gorgeous description in which all the shades of pearlygrey and yellow were mingled and contrasted  they rose up pile upon pile in stupendous majesty like the very battlements of heaven while their images clear and distinct almost as themselves rolled down and down into the watery depths until the isletthe only welldefined and solid object in the sceneappeared to float in their midst  the rising sun shot throughout the vast immensity of space and its warm rays were interrupted and broken and caught and absorbed and reflected in so many magical ways that it was impossible to trace any of the outlines for more than a few seconds ere the eye was lost in the confusion of bright lights and deep shadows that were mingled and mellowed together by the softer lights and shades of every degree of depth and tint into splendid harmony  in the midst of this scene captain dunning stood with ailie by his side and surrounded by his men on the shores of the little island everything was now in readiness to set sail  the boat was laden and in the water and the men stood ready to leap in and push off  my lads said the captain earnestly were about to quit this morsel of sandbank on which it pleased the almighty to cast our ship and on which thanks be to him we have found a pretty safe shelter for so long  i feel a sort o regret almost at leavin it now  but the time has come for us to begin our voyage towards the cape and i need scarcely repeat what you all know well enoughthat our undertakin is no childs play  we shall need all our bodily and our mental powers to carry us through  our labour must be constant and our food is not sufficient so that we must go on shorter allowance from this day  i gave you half rations while ye were buildin the boat because we had to get her finished and launched as fast as we could but now we cant afford to eat so much  i made a careful inspection of our provisions last night and i find that by allowing every man four ounces a day we can spin it out  we may fall in with islands perhaps but i know of none in these seasthere are none put down on the chartsand we may get hold of a fish now and then but we must not count on these chances now it must be plain to all of you that our only chance of getting on well together in circumstances that will try our tempers no doubt and rouse our selfishness is to resolve firmly before startingeach man for himselfthat we will lay restraint on ourselves and try to help each other as much as we can  there was a ready murmur of assent to this proposal then the captain continued  now lads one word more  our best efforts let us exert ourselves ever so much cannot be crowned with success unless before setting out we ask the special favour and blessing of him who we are told in the bible holds the waters of the ocean in the hollow of his hand  if he helps us we shall be saved if he does not help us we shall perish we will therefore offer up a prayer now in the name of our blessed redeemer that we may be delivered from every danger and be brought at last in peace and comfort to our homes  captain dunning then clasped his hands together and while the men around him reverently bowed their heads he offered up a short and simple but earnest prayer to god  from that day forward they continued the habit of offering up prayer together once a day and soon afterwards the captain began the practice of reading a chapter aloud daily out of ailies bible  the result of this was that not only were the more violent spirits among them restrained under frequent and sore privations and temptations but all the party were often much comforted and filled with hope at times when they were by their sufferings wellnigh driven to despair  im sorry to leave fairyland papa said ailie sadly as the men shoved the maid of the isle into deep water and pulled out to sea  so am i dear replied the captain sitting down beside his daughter in the sternsheets of the boat and taking the tiller i had no idea i could have come to like such a barren bit of sand so well  there was a long pause after this remark  every eye in the boat was turned with a sad expression on the brightyellow sandbank as they rowed away and the men dipped their oars lightly into the calm waters as if they were loth to leave their late home  any spot of earth that has been for some time the theatre of heartstirring events such as rouse mens strong emotions and on which happy and hopeful as well as wretched days have been spent will so entwine itself with the affections of men that they will cling to it and love it more or less powerfully no matter how barren may be the spot or how dreary its general aspect  the sandbank had been the cause no doubt of the wreck of the red eric but it had also been the means under god of saving the crew and affording them shelter during many succeeding weeksweeks of deep anxiety but also of healthful hopeful energetic toil in which if there were many things to create annoyance or fear there had also been not a few things to cause thankfulness delight and amusement  unknown to themselves these rough sailors and the tender child had become attached to the spot and it was only now that they were about to leave it for ever that they became aware of the fact  the circumscribed and limited range on which their thoughts and vision had been bent for the last few weeks had rendered each individual as familiar with every inch of the bank as if he had dwelt there for years  ailie gazed at the low rocks that overhung the crystal pool in fairyland until the blinding tears filled her eyes and she felt all the deep regret that is experienced by the little child when it is forcibly torn from an old and favourite toyregret that is not in the least degree mitigated by the fact that the said toy is but a sorry affair a doll perchance with a smashed head eyes thrust out and nose flattened on its face or rubbed away altogetherit matters not the long and happy hours and days spent in the companionship of that battered little mass of wood or wax rush on the infant memory like a dear delightful dream and it weeps on separation as if its heart would break  each man in the boats crew experienced more or less of the same feeling and commented according to his nature either silently or audibly on each familiar object as he gazed upon it for the last time  theres the spot where we built the hut when we first landed ailie said glynn who pulled the aft oar dye see itjust coming into view look  there it will be shut out again in a moment by the rock beside the coralpool  i see it exclaimed ailie eagerly as she brushed away the tears from her eyes  theres the rock too where we used to make our fire said the captain pointing it out  it doesnt look like itself from this point of view  ah sighed phil briant an it wos at the fut o that too where we used to bile the kittle night an mornin  sure its many a swait bit and pipe i had beside ye  is that a bit o the wreck inquired tim rokens pointing to the low rocky point with the eagerness of a man who had made an unexpected discovery  no replied mr millons shading his eyes with his hands and gazing at the object in question its himpossible  i searched every bit o the bank for a plank before we came hoff an couldnt find a morsel as big as my and  wat say you doctor  i think with you answered dr hopley but heres the telescope which will soon settle the question  while the doctor adjusted the glass rokens muttered that he wos sure it wos a bit o the wreck and that there wos a bit o rock as nobody couldnt easy git a tother side of to look and that that wos it and the bit of wreck was there and much to the same effect  so it is exclaimed the doctor  lay on your oars lads a moment said the captain taking the glass and applying it to his eye  the men obeyed gladly for they experienced an unaccountable disinclination to row away from the island  perhaps the feeling was caused in part by the idea that when they took their last look at it it might possibly be their last sight of land  its a small piece of the foretopmast crosstrees observed the captain shutting up the telescope and resuming his seat  shall we go back an pick it up sir asked dick barnes gravely giving vent to the desires of his heart without perceiving at the moment the absurdity of the question  why what would you do with it dick replied the captain smiling  sure ye couldnt ait it interposed briant but afther all theres no sayin  maybe nikel sling could make a tasty dish out of it stewed in oakum and tar  it wouldnt be purlite to take such a titbit from the mermaids observed gurney as the oars were once more dipped reluctantly in the water  the men smiled at the jest for in the monotony of sea life every species of pleasantry however poor is swallowed with greater or less avidity but the smile did not last long  they were in no jesting humour at that time and no one replied to the passing joke  soon after this a soft gentle breeze sprang up  it came direct from fairyland as if the mermaids referred to by gurney had been touched by the kindly feelings harboured in the sailors bosoms towards their islet and had wafted towards them a last farewell  the oars were shipped immediately and the sails hoisted and to the satisfaction of all on board the maid of the isle gave indications of being a swift sailer for although the puff of wind was scarcely sufficient to ruffle the glassy surface of the sea she glided through the water under its influence a good deal faster than she had done with the oars  thats good remarked the captain watching the ripples as they passed astern with fair winds and not too much of em we shall get on bravely so cheer up my lassie he added patting ailie on the head and let us begin our voyage in good spirits and with hopeful trusting hearts  look at fairyland said ailie clasping her fathers hand and pointing towards the horizon  at the moment she spoke an opening in the great white clouds let a ray of light fall on the sandbank which had now passed almost beyond the range of vision  the effect was to illumine its yellow shore and cause it to shine out for a few seconds like a golden speck on the horizon no one had ceased to gaze at it from the time the boat put forth but this sudden change caused every one to start up and fix their eyes on it with renewed interest and intensity  shall we ever see land again passed in one form or another through the minds of all  the clouds swept slowly on the golden point melted away and the shipwrecked mariners felt that their little boat was now all the world to them in the midst of that mighty world of waters    chapter twenty two  reduced allowance of foodjacko teaches briant a useful lesson  the first few days of the voyage of the maid of the isle were bright and favourable  the wind though light was fair and so steady that the men were only twice obliged to have recourse to their oars  the boat behaved admirably  once during these first days the wind freshened into a pretty stiff breeze and a somewhat boisterous sea arose so that she was tested in another of her sailing qualities and was found to be an excellent seaboat  very little water was shipped and that little was taken in rather through the awkwardness of king bumble who steered than through the fault of the boat  captain dunning had taken care that there should be a large supply of tin and wooden scoops for baling out the water that might be shipped in rough weather as he foresaw that on the promptness with which this duty was performed might sometimes depend the safety of the boat and crew  there was one thing that proved a matter of much regret to the crew and that was the want of a fowlingpiece or firearm of any kind  had they possessed a gun however old and bad with ammunition for it they would have been certain at some period of their voyage to shoot a few seabirds with which they expected to fall in on approaching the land even although many days distant from it  but having nothing of the kind their hope of adding to their slender stock of provisions was very small indeed  fortunately they had one or two fishinglines but in the deep water over which for many days they had to sail fishing was out of the question  this matter of the provisions was a source of constant anxiety to captain dunning  he had calculated the amount of their stores to an ounce and ascertained that at a certain rate of distribution they would barely serve for the voyage and this without making any allowance for interruptions or detentions  he knew the exact distance to be passed over namely 2322 miles in a straight line and he had ascertained the sailing and rowing powers of the boat and crew thus he was enabled to arrive at a pretty correct idea of the probable duration of the voyage supposing that all should go well  but in the event of strong contrary winds arising no fresh supplies of fish or fowl being obtained or sickness breaking out among the men he knew either that they must starve altogether or that he must at once before it was too late still farther reduce the scanty allowance of food and drink to each man  the captain sat at the helm one fine evening about a week after their departure from fairyland brooding deeply over this subject  the boat was running before a light breeze at the rate of about four or five knots and the men who had been obliged to row a good part of that day were sitting or reclining on the thwarts or leaning over the gunwale watching the ripples as they glided by and enjoying the rest from labour for now that they had been for some time on reduced allowance of food they felt less able for work than they used to be and often began to look forward with intense longing to seasons of repose  ailie was sitting near the entrance of her little sleeping apartmentwhich the men denominated a kenneland master jacko was seated on the top of it scratching his sides and enjoying the sunshine  my lads said the captain breaking a silence which had lasted a considerable time im afraid i shall have to reduce our allowance still farther  this remark was received by gurney and phil briant with a suppressed groanby the other men in silence  you see continued the captain it wont do to count upon chances which may or may not turn out to be poor  we can by fixing our allowance per man at a lower rate make quite certain of our food lasting us until we reach the cape even if we should experience a little detention but if we go on at the present rate we are equally certain that it will fail us just at the last  were sartain to fall in with birds before we near the land murmured gurney with a rueful expression of countenance  we are certain of nothing replied the captain but even suppose we were how are we to get hold of them  thats true observed briant who solaced himself with his pipe in the absence of a sufficiency of food  seabirds no more nor landbirds aint given to pluckin and roastin themselves and flyin down peoples throats ready cooked  besides resumed the captain the plan i propose although it will entail a little more present selfdenial will humanly speaking ensure our getting through the voyage with life in us even at the worst and if we are so lucky as to catch fish or procure birds in any way why we shall fare sumptuously  here tim rokens to whom the men instinctively looked upon all matters of perplexity removed his pipe from his lips and said  wot capen dunnin says is true  if we take his plan why well starve in a reglar way little by little and praps spin out till we git to the cape wereas if we take the other plan well keep a little fatter on the first part of the voyage mayhap but well arrive at the end of it as dead as mutton every man on us  this view of the question seemed so just to the men and so full of incontrovertible wisdom that it was received with something like a murmur of applause  youre a true philosopher rokens  now doctor hopley i must beg you to give us your opinion as a medical man on this knotty subject said the captain smiling  do you think that we can continue to exist if our daily allowance is reduced onefourth  the doctor replied let me see and putting his finger on his forehead frowned portentously affecting to give the subject the most intense consideration  he happened to look at jacko when he frowned and that pugnacious individual happening at the same instant to look at the doctor and supposing that the frown was a distinct challenge to fight first raised his eyebrows to the top of his head in amazement then pulled them down over his flashing orbs in deep indignation and displayed all his teeth as well as an extent of gums that was really frightful to behold  oh  jacko bad thing said ailie in a reproachful tone pulling the monkey towards her  taking no notice of these warlike indications the doctor after a few minutes thought looked up and said  i have no doubt whatever that we can stand it  most of us are in pretty good condition still and have some fat to spare  fat persons can endure reduced allowance of food much better and longer than those who are lean  theres gurney now for instance he could afford to have his share even still further curtailed  this remark was received with a grin of delighted approval by the men and with a groan by gurney who rubbed his stomach gently as if that region were assailed with pains at the bare thought of such injustice  troth if thats true what ye say doctor i hope yell see it to be yer duty to give wot ye cut off gurneys share to me remarked briant for its nothing but a bag o bones that i am this minute  oh oh wot a wopper cried jim scroggles whose lean and lanky person seemed ill adapted to exist upon light fare  well observed the captain the doctor and i shall make a careful calculation and let you know the result by suppertime when the new system shall be commenced  what think you ailie my pet will you be able to stand it  oh yes papa i dont care how much you reduce my allowance  what dont you feel hungry  no not a bit  not ready for supper  not anxious for it at any rate  och  i wish i wos you murmured briant with a deep sigh  i think i could ait the foresail av it wos only well biled with the laste possible taste o pigs fat  by suppertime the captain announced the future daily allowance and served it out  each man received a piece of salt junkthat is salt beefweighing exactly one ounce also two ounces of broken biscuit a small piece of tobacco and a quarter of a pint of water  although the supply of the latter was small there was every probability of a fresh supply being obtained when it chanced to rain so that little anxiety was felt at first in regard to it but the other portions of each mans allowance were weighed with scrupulous exactness in a pair of scales which were constructed by tim rokens out of a piece of wooda leaden musketball doing service as a weight  ailie received an equal portion with the others but jacko was doomed to drag out his existence on a very minute quantity of biscuit and water he utterly refused to eat salt junk and would not have been permitted to use tobacco even had he been so inclined which he was not  although they were thus reduced to a small allowance of fooda smaller quantity than was sufficient to sustain life for any lengthened period no one in the slightest degree grudged jacko his small portion  all the men entertained a friendly feeling to the little monkey partly because it was ailies pet and partly because it afforded them great amusement at times by its odd antics  as for jacko himself he seemed to thrive on short allowance and never exhibited any unseemly haste or anxiety at mealtimes  it was observed however that he kept an uncommonly sharp eye on all that passed around him as if he felt that his circumstances were at that time peculiar and worthy of being noted  in particular he knew to a nicety what happened to each atom of food from the time of its distribution among the men to the moment of its disappearance within their hungry jaws and if any poor fellow chanced to lay his morsel down and neglect it for the tenth part of an instant it vanished like a shot and immediately thereafter jacko was observed to present an unusually serene and innocent aspect and to become suddenly afflicted with a swelling in the pouch under his cheek  one day the men received a lesson in carefulness which they did not soon forget  breakfast had been served out and phil briant was about to finish his last mouthful of biscuithe had not had many mouthfuls to try his masticating powers poor fellowwhen he paused suddenly and gazing at the cherished morsel addressed it thus  shure its a purty bit ye are  av there wos only wan or two more o yer family here its meself as ud like to be made beknown to them ill not ait ye yit  ill look at ye for a little  in pursuance of this luxurious plan briant laid the morsel of biscuit on the thwart of the boat before him and taking out his pipe began to fill it leisurely keeping his eye all the time on the last bite  just then mr markham who pulled the bow oar called out  i say briant hand me my tobaccopouch its beside you on the thort close under the gunle  is it said briant stretching out his hand to the place indicated but keeping his eye fixed all the time on the piece of biscuit  ah here it is ketch it  for one instant briant looked at the second mate in order to throw the pouch with precision  that instant was sufficient for the exercise of jackos dishonest propensities  the pouch was yet in its passage through the air when a tremendous roar from tim rokens apprised the unhappy irishman of his misfortune  he did not require to be told to look out although more than one voice gave him that piece of advice an intuitive perception of irreparable loss flashed across his soul and with the speed of light his eye was again on the thwart before himbut not on the morsel of biscuit  at that same instant jacko sat down beside ailie with his usual serene aspect and swelled cheek  och ye bottle imp yelled the bereaved one dont i know ye and seizing a tin pannikin in his wrath he threw it at the small monkeys head with a force that would had it been well directed have smashed that small head effectually  jacko made a quick and graceful nod and the pannikin just missing ailie went over the side into the sea where it sank and was lost for ever to the regret of all for they could ill afford to lose it  yeve got it ye have but ye shant ait it growled briant through his teeth as he sprang over the seat towards the monkey  jacko bounded like a piece of indiarubber on to gurneys head next moment he was clinging to the edge of the mainsail and the next he was comfortably seated on the top of the mast where he proceeded calmly and leisurely to ait the biscuit in the face of its exasperated and rightful owner  ohbriant exclaimed ailie who was half frightened half amused at the sudden convulsion caused by her favourites bad conduct dont be vexed see here is a little bit of my biscuit i dont want itreally i dont  briant who stood aghast and overwhelmed by his loss and by the consummate impudence of the small monkey felt rebuked by this offer bursting into a loud laugh he said as he resumed his seat and the filling of his pipe  sure id rather ait me own hat miss ailie an its be no means a good wanwithout sarce too not even a blot o mustardthan take the morsel out o yer purty mouth  i wos more nor half jokin dear an i ax yer parding for puttin ye in sich a fright  expensive jokin growled tarquin if ye throw a pannikin overboard every time you take to it  kape your tongue quiet said briant reddening for he felt somewhat humbled at having given way to his anger so easily and was nettled at the remark coming as it did in a sneering spirit from a man for whom he had no particular liking  never mind briant interposed the captain quickly with a goodhumoured laugh i feel for you lad  had it been myself i fear i should have been even more exasperated  i would not sell a crumb of my portion just now for a guinea  neither would i added the doctor for a thousand guineas  ill tell ye wot it is lads remarked tim rokens i wish i only had a crumb to sell  now rokens dont be greedy cried gurney  greedy echoed tim  ay greedy has any o you lads got a dickshunairy to lend him  come jim scroggles you can tell him what it meansyouve been to school i believe haint you  rokens shook his head gravely  no lad im not greedy but im ready for wittles  i wont go fur to deny that  now let me ax ye a question  wotsupposin ye had the chancewould ye give at this good minit for a biled leg o mutton  with or without caperssauce inquired gurney  wichever you please  och we wouldnt need caperssarse interposed briant av we only had the mutton id cut enough o capers meself to do for the sarce i would  it matters little what youd give cried glynn for we cant get it at any price just now  dont you think captain that we might have our breakfast tonight  it would save time in the morning you know  there was a general laugh at this proposal yet there was a strong feeling in the minds of some that if it were consistent with their rules to have breakfast served out then and there they would gladly have consented to go without it next morning  thus with laugh and jest and goodnatured repartee did these men bear the pangs of hunger for many days  they were often silent during long intervals and sometimes they became talkative and sprightly but it was observed that whether they conversed earnestly or jestingly their converse ran for the most part on eating and drinking and in their uneasy slumbers during the intervals between the hours of work and watching they almost invariably dreamed of food    chapter twenty three  progress of the long voyagestorytelling and journalising  many weeks passed away but the maid of the isle still held on her course over the boundless ocean  day after day came and went the sun rose in the east morning after morning ran its appointed course and sank night after night on the western horizon but little else occurred to vary the monotony of that long long voyage  when the sun rose its bright rays leapt from the bosom of the ocean when it set the same bosom of the great deep received its descending beams  no land no sail appeared to the anxious gazers in that little boat which seemed to move across yet never to reach the boundaries of that mighty circle of water and sky in the midst of which they lay enchained as if by some wicked enchanters spell  breezes blew steadily at times and urged them swiftly on towards the circumference but it fled as fast as they approached  then it fell calm and the weary men resumed their oars and with heavy hearts and weakened arms tugged at the boat which seemed to have turned into a mass of lead  at such times a dead silence was maintained for the work which once would have been to them but childs play had now become severe and heavy labour  still they did not murmur  even the crossgrained tarquin became subdued in spirit by the influence of the calm endurance and goodhumour of his comrades  but the calms seldom lasted long  the winds which happily continued favourable again ruffled the surface of the sea and sometimes blew so briskly as to oblige them to take in a reef or two in their sails  the oars were gladly drawn in and the spirits of the men rose as the little boat bent over to the blast lost her leaden qualities and danced upon the broadbacked billows like a cork  there was no rain during all this time little or no stormy weather and but for their constant exposure to the hot sun by day and the cold chills by night the time might have been said to pass even pleasantly despite the want of a sufficiency of food  thus day after day and night after night flew by and week after week came and went and still the maid of the isle held on her course over the boundless ocean  during all that time the one and a quarter ounces of salt junk and biscuit and the eighth of a pint of water were weighed and measured out to each man three times a day with scrupulous care and exactness lest a drop or a crumb of the food that was more precious than diamonds should be lost  the men had all become accustomed to short allowance now and experienced no greater inconvenience than a feeling of lassitude which feeling increased daily but by such imperceptible degrees that they were scarcely conscious of it and were only occasionally made aware of the great reduction of their strength when they attempted to lift any article which in the days of their full vigour they could have tossed into the air but which they could scarcely move now  when however the fair breeze enabled them to glide along under sail and they lay enjoying complete rest they experienced no unwonted sensations of weakness their spirits rose as the spirits of sailors always will rise when the waves are rippling at the bow and a white track forming in the wake and they spent the timewhen not asleepin cheerful conversation and in the spinning of long yarns they did not sing however as might have been expectedthey were too weak for thatthey called the feeling lazy some said they couldnt be bothered to sing  no one seemed willing to admit that his strength was in reality abated  in storytelling the captain the doctor and glynn shone conspicuous and when all was going smoothly and well the anecdotes histories and romances related by these three were listened to with such intense interest and delight by the whole crew that one would have thought they were enjoying a pleasure trip and had no cause whatever for anxiety gurney too and briant and nikel sling came out frequently in the storytelling line and were the means of causing many and many an hour to pass quickly and pleasantly by which would otherwise have hung heavily on the hands of all  ailie dunning was an engrossed and delighted listener at all times  she drank in every species of story with an avidity that was quite amusing it seemed also to have been infectious for even jacko used to sit hour after hour looking steadily at each successive speaker with a countenance so full of bright intelligence and grave surpassing wisdom as to lead one to the belief that he not only understood all that was said but turned it over in his mind and drew from it ideas and conclusions far more bright and philosophical than could have been drawn therefrom by any human being however wise or ingenious  he grinned too did jacko with an intensity and frequency that induced the sailors at first to call him a clever dog in the belief that his perception of the ludicrous was very strong indeed but as his grins were observed to occur quite as frequently at the pathetic and the grave as at the comical parts of the stories they changed their minds and said he was a codgerin which remark they were undoubtedly safe seeing that it committed them to nothing very specific  captain dunnings stories were more properly speaking histories and were very much relished for he possessed a natural power of relating what he knew in an interesting manner and with a peculiarly pleasant tone of voice  every one who has considered the subject at all must have observed what a powerful influence there lies in the mere manner and tone of a speaker  the captains voice was so rich so mellow and capable of such varied modulation that the men listened with pleasure to the words which rolled from his lips as one would listen to a sweet song  he became so deeply interested too in the subject about which he happened to be speaking that his auditors could not help becoming interested also  he had no powers of eloquence neither was he gifted with an unusually bright fancy  but he was fluent in speech and his words though not chosen were usually appropriate  the captain had no powers of invention whatever  he used to say when asked to tell a story that he might as well try to play the fiddle with a handspike but this was no misfortune for he had read much and his memory was good and supplied him with an endless flow of smalltalk on almost every subject that usually falls under the observation of seacaptains and on many subjects besides about which most seacaptains or landcaptains or any other captains whatsoever are almost totally ignorant  captain dunning could tell of adventures in the whalefishery gone through either by himself or by friends that would have made your two eyes stare out of their two sockets until they looked like saucers to use a common but not very correct simile  he could tell the exact latitude and longitude of almost every important and prominent part of the globe and give the distance pretty nearly of any one place on a large scale from any other place  he could give the heights of all the chief mountains in the world to within a few feet and could calculate by merely looking at its current and depth how many cubic feet of water any river delivered to the sea per minute  length breadth and thickness height depth and density were subjects in which he revelled and with which he played as a juggler does with golden balls and so great were his powers of numerical calculation that the sailors often declared they believed he could work out any calculation backwards without the use of logarithms  he was constantly instituting comparisons that were by no means what the proverb terms odious but which were often very astonishing and in all his stories so many curious and peculiar facts were introduced that as we have already said they were very much relished indeed  not less relished however were glynn proctors astounding and purely imaginative tales  after the mens minds had been chained intently on one of the captains semiphilosophical anecdotes they turned with infinite zest to one of glynns outrageous flights  glynn had not read much in his short life and his memory was nothing to boast of but his imagination was quite gigantic  he could invent almost anything and the curious part of it was that he could do it out of nothing if need be  he never took time to consider what he should say  when called on for a story he began at once and it flowed from him like a flood of sparkling water from a fountain in fairy realms  up in the clouds high in the blue ether down in the coral caves deep in the ocean waves out on the mountain heaths far in the rocky glens or away in the wild woods greenit was all one to glynn he leaped away in an instant with a long train of adventurers at his heelsmale and female little and big old and young pretty and plain grave and gay  and didnt they go through adventures that would have made the hair of mortals not only stand on end but fly out by the roots altogether  didnt he make them talk as mortals never talked before and sing as mortals never dreamed of  and oh didnt he just make them stew and roast and boil joints of savoury meat and bake pies and tarts and puddings such as soyer in his wildest culinary dreams never imagined and such as caused the mouths of the crew of the maid of the isle to water until they were constrained poor fellows to tell him to clap a stopper upon that and hold his tongue for they couldnt stand it  phil briant and gurney dealt in the purely comic line  they remarked generally in an undertonethat they left poetry and prose to glynn and the captain and it was as well they did for their talents certainly did not lie in either of these directions  they came out strong after meals when the weather was fine and formed a species of light and agreeable interlude to the more weighty efforts of the captain and the brilliant sallies of glynn  gurney dealt in experiences chiefly and usually endeavoured by asseveration and iteration to impress his hearers with the truth of facts said to have been experienced by himself which if true would certainly have consigned him to a premature grave long ago  briant on the other hand dealt largely in ghost stories which he did not vouch for the truth of but permitted his hearers to judge of for themselves a permission which they would doubtless have taken for themselves at any rate  but tales and stories occupied after all only a small portion of the mens time during that long voyage  often very often they were too much exhausted to talk or even to listen and when not obliged to labour at the oars they tried to sleep but natures sweet restorer did not always come at the first invitation as was his wont in other days and too frequently they were obliged to resume work unrefreshed  their hands became hard and horny in the palms at last like a mans heel and their backs and arms ached from constant work  ailie kept in good health but she too began to grow weak from want of proper nourishment  she slept better than the men for the comfortable sleepingbox that glynn had constructed for her sheltered her from the heat wet and cold to which the former were constantly exposed  she amused herself when not listening to stories or asleep by playing with her favourite and she spent a good deal of time in reading her bible sometimes to herself at other times in a low tone to her father as he sat at the helm  and many a time did she see a meaning in passages which in happier times had passed meaningless before her eyes and often did she find sweet comfort in words that she had read with comparative indifference in former days  it is in the time of trial trouble and sorrow that the bible proves to be a friend indeed  happy the christian who when dark clouds overwhelm his soul has a memory well stored with the comforting passages of the word of god  but ailie had another occupation which filled up much of her leisure and proved to be a source of deep and engrossing interest at the time this was the keeping of a journal of the voyage  on the last trip made to the wreck of the red eric just before the great storm that completed the destruction of that ship the captain had brought away in his pocket a couple of notebooks  one of these he kept to himself to jot down the chief incidents of the intended voyage the other he gave to ailie along with a blacklead pencil  being fond of trying to write she amused herself for hours together in jotting down her thoughts about the various incidents of the voyage great and small and being a very good drawer for her age she executed many fanciful and elaborate sketches among which were innumerable portraits of jacko and several caricatures of the men  this journal as it advanced became a source of much interest and amusement to every one in the boat and when in an hour of the utmost peril it along with many other things was lost the men after the danger was past felt the loss severely  thus they spent their timenow pleasantly now sadlysometimes becoming cheerful and hopeful at other times sinking almost into a state of despair as their little stock of food and water dwindled down while the maid of the isle still held on her apparently endless course over the great wide sea    chapter twenty four  the calm and the storma serious loss and great gainbirdcatching extraordinarysaved at last  one day a deep deathlike calm settled down upon the ocean  for some days before the winds had been light and uncertain and the air had been excessively warm  the captain cast uneasy glances around him from time to time and looked with a sadder countenance than usual on the haggard faces of the men as they laboured slowly and silently at the oars  i dont know what this will turn to doctor he said in a low tone i dont like the look of it  the doctor who was perusing ailies journal at the moment looked up and shook his head  it seems to me captain that whatever happens matters cannot be made much worse  you are wrong doctor replied the captain quietly we have still much to be thankful for  did you not tell me a few minutes ago that the water was almost done  the doctor said this in a whisper for the men had not yet been made aware of the fact  yes i did but it is not quite done that is matter for thankfulness  oh according to that principle observed the doctor somewhat testily you may say we have cause to be thankful for everything bad as well as good  so we have so we have  if everything good were taken from us and nothing left us but our lives we would have reason to be thankful for thatthankful that we were still above ground still in the land of hope with salvation to our immortal souls through jesus christ freely offered for our acceptance  the doctor made no reply  he thought the captain a little weak in the matter of religion  if religion is false his opinion of the captain no doubt was right but if true surely the weakness lay all the other way  that morning the captains voice in prayer was more earnest if possible than usual and he put up a special petition for water which was observed by the men with feelings of great anxiety and responded to with a deep amen  after morning worship the scales were brought and the captain proceeded to weigh out the scanty meal while the men watched his every motion with an almost wolfish glare that told eloquently of the prolonged sufferings they had endured  even poor ailies gentle face now wore a sharp anxious expression when food was being served out and she accepted her small portion with a nervous haste that was deeply painful and touching to witness  she little knew poor child that that portion of bread and meat and water small though it was was larger than that issued to the men being increased by a small quantity deducted from the captains own allowance and an equal amount from that of glynn  the latter had noticed the captains habit of regularly calling off the childs attention during the distribution of each meal for the purpose of thus increasing her portion at the expense of his own and in a whispering conversation held soon after he insisted that a little of his allowance should also be transferred to her  at first the captain firmly refused but glynn said that if he did not accede to his wish he would hand over the whole of his portion in future to the monkey let the result be what it might  as glynn never threatened without a full and firm resolve to carry out his threats the captain was compelled to give in  when the water came to be served out that morning the captain paused and looking round at the anxious eyes that were riveted upon him said  my lads it has pleased the almighty to lay his hand still heavier on us  may he who has said that he will not suffer men to be tempted above what they are able to bear give us strength to stand it  our water is almost done  we must be content with a quarter of our usual allowance  this information was received in deep silenceperhaps it was the silence of despair for the quantity hitherto served out had been barely sufficient to moisten their parched throats and they knew that they could not exist long on the reduced allowance  jacko came with the rest as usual for his share and held out his little hand for the tin cup in which his few drops of water were wont to be handed to him  the captain hesitated and looked at the men then he poured out a few drops of the precious liquid  for the first time a murmur of disapproval was heard  its only a brute beast the monkey must die before us said a voice which was so hollow and changed that it could scarcely be recognised as that of tarquin the steward  no one else said a word  the captain did not even look up to see who had spoken  he felt the justice as well as the harshness of the remark and poured the water back into the jar  jacko seems puzzled at first and held out his hand again then he looked round on the men with that expression of unutterable woe which is peculiar to some species of the monkey tribe  he seemed to feel that something serious was about to happen to him  looking up in the sad face of his young mistress he uttered a very gentle and plaintive ooooee  ailie burst into a passionate flood of tears and in the impulse of the moment handed her own cup which she had not tasted to jacko who drained it in a twinklingbefore the captain could snatch it from his hands  having emptied it jacko went forward as he had been taught to do and handed back the cup with quite a pleased expression of countenancefor he was easily satisfied poor thing  you should not have done that my darling said the captain as he gave ailie another portion  dear papa i couldnt help it sobbed the child indeed i couldnt and you need not give me any  i can do without it today  can you  but you shant exclaimed glynn with a degree of energy that would have made every one laugh in happier times  no no my own pet replied the captain  you shant want it  here you must drink it come  from that day jacko received his allowance regularly as long as a drop of water was left and no one again murmured against it  when it was finished he had to suffer with the rest  the calm which had set in proved to be of longer duration than usual and the sufferings of the crew of the little boat became extreme  on the third day after its commencement the last drop of water was served out  it amounted to a couple of teaspoonfuls per man each meal of which there were three a day  during the continuance of the calm the sun shone in an almost cloudless sky and beat down upon the heads of the men until it drove them nearly mad  they all looked like living skeletons and their eyes glared from their sunken sockets with a dry fiery lustre that was absolutely terrible to behold  had each one in that boat possessed millions of gold he would have given all gladly for one drop of fresh water but alas nothing could purchase water there  ailie thought upon the man who in the bible is described as looking up to heaven from the depths of hell and crying for one drop of water to cool his tongue and she fancied that she could now realise his agony  the captain looked up into the hot sky but no blessed cloud appeared there to raise the shadow of a hope  he looked down at the sea and it seemed to mock him with its clear blue depths which looked so sweet and pleasant  he realised the full significance of that couplet in coleridges ancient mariner    water water everywhere   but not a drop to drink  and drawing ailie to his breast he laid his cheek upon hers and groaned aloud  we shall soon be taken away dear papa she saidand she tried to weep but the tears that came unbidden and so easily at other times to her bright blue eyes refused to flow now  the men had one by one ceased to ply their useless oars and the captain did not take notice of it for he felt that unless god sent relief in some almost miraculous way their continuing to row would be of no avail  it would only increase their agony without advancing them more than a few miles on the long long voyage that he knew still lay before them  o god grant us a breeze cried mr millons in a deep tremulous tone breaking a silence that had continued for some hours  messmates said tim rokens who for some time had leaned with both elbows on his oar and his face buried in his hands wot dye say to a bath  i do believe it ud do us good  phaps it would replied king bumble but he did not move and the other men made no reply while rokens again sank forward  gurney and tarquin had tried to relieve their thirst the day before by drinking seawater but their inflamed and swollen throats and lips now showed that the relief sought had not been obtained  its time for supper said the captain raising his head suddenly and laying ailie down for she had fallen into a lethargic slumber fetch me the bread and meat can  dick barnes obeyed reluctantly and the usual small allowance of salt junk was weighed out but there were no eager glances now  most of the crew refused to touch foodone or two tried to eat a morsel of biscuit without success  ill try a swim cried glynn suddenly starting up with the intention of leaping overboard  but his strength was more exhausted than he had fancied for he only fell against the side of the boat  it was as well that he failed  had he succeeded in getting into the water he could not have clambered in again and it is doubtful whether his comrades had sufficient strength left to have dragged him in  try it this way lad said tim rokens taking up a bucket and dipping it over the side  praps itll do as well  he raised the bucket with some difficulty and poured its contents over glynns head  thank god said glynn with a deep longdrawn sigh  do it again tim do it again  thats itagain again  no stop forgive my selfishness here give me the bucket ill do it to you now  tim rokens was quickly drenched from head to foot and felt great and instantaneous relief  in a few minutes every one in the boat jacko included was subjected to this species of cold bath and their spirits rose at once  some of them even began to eat their food and briant actually attempted to perpetrate a joke which gurney seconded promptly but they failed to make one even a bad one between them  although the cold bathing seemed good for them at first it soon proved to be hurtful  sitting and lying constantly night and day in saturated clothes had the effect of rendering their skins painfully sensitive and a feverish feeling was often alternated with cold shivering fits so they were fain to give it up  still they had found some slight relief and they bore their sufferings with calm resignationa state of mind which was fostered if not induced by the blessed words of comfort and hope which the captain read to them from the bible as frequently as his strength would permit and to which they listened with intense allabsorbing interest  it is ever thus with men  when death approaches in almost all instances we are readyay anxiousto listen with the deepest interest to gods message of salvation through his son and to welcome and long for the influences of the holy spirit  oh how happy should we be in life and in death did we only give heartfelt interest to our souls affairs before the days of sorrow and death arrive  on the fifth morning after the water had been exhausted the sun arose in the midst of dark clouds  the men could scarcely believe their eyes they shouted and in their weakness laughed for joy  the blessing was not long delayed  thick vapours veiled the red sun soon after it emerged from the sea then a few drops of rain fell blessed drops  how the men caught at them  how they spread out oiled cloths and tarpaulins and garments to gather them  how they grudged to see them falling around the boat into the sea and being lost to them for ever  but the blessing was soon sent liberally  the heavens above grew black and the rain came down in thick heavy showers  the tarpaulins were quickly filled and the men lay with their lips to the sweet pools drinkingin new life and dipping their heads and hands in the cool liquid when they could drink no more  their thirst was slaked at last and they were happy  all their past sufferings were forgotten in that great hour of relief and they looked and laughed and spoke to each other like men who were saved from death  as they stripped off their garments and washed the encrusted salt from their shrunken limbs all of them doubtless felt and some of them audibly expressed gratitude to the giver of every good and perfect gift  so glad were they and so absorbed in their occupation that they thought not of and cared not for the fact that a great storm was about to break upon them  it came upon them almost before they were aware and before the sails could be taken in the boat was almost upset  standby to lower the sails shouted the captain who was the first to see their danger  the old familiar command issued with something of the old familiar voice and energy caused every one to leap to his post if not with the agility of former times at least with all the good will  let go  the halyards were loosed and the sails came tumbling down at the same moment the squall burst on them  the maid of the isle bent over so quickly that every one expected she would upset the blue water curled in over the edge of the gunwale and the foam burst from her bows at the rude shock  then she hissed through the water as she answered the helm righted quickly and went tearing away before the wind at a speed that she had not known for many days  it was a narrow escape  the boat was nearly filled with water and worst of all the provision can along with ailies sleepingbox were washed overboard and lost  it was of no use attempting to recover them  all the energies of the crew were required to bale out the water and keep the boat afloat and during the whole storm some of them were constantly employed in baling for three days it blew a perfect hurricane and during all that time the men had nothing whatever to eat but they did not suffer so much as might be supposed  the gnawing pangs of hunger do not usually last beyond a few days when men are starving  after that they merely feel everincreasing weakness  during the fall of the rain they had taken care to fill their jars so that they had now a good supply of water  after the first burst of the squall had passed the tarpaulins were spread over the boat and under one of these near the stern ailie was placed and was comparatively sheltered and comfortable  besides forming a shelter for the men while they slept these tarpaulins threw off the waves that frequently broke over the boat and more than once bid fair to sink her altogether  these arose in enormous billows and the gale was so violent that only the smallest corner of the foresail could be raisedeven that was almost sufficient to tear away the mast  at length the gale blew itself out and gradually decreased to a moderate breeze before which the sails were shaken out and on the fourth morning after it broke they found themselves sweeping quickly over the waves on their homeward way but without a morsel of food and thoroughly exhausted in body and in mind  on that morning however they passed a piece of floating seaweed a sure indication of their approach to land  captain dunning pointed it out to ailie and the crew with a cheering remark that they would probably soon get to the end of their voyage but he did not feel much hope for without food they could not exist above a few days more at the furthestperhaps not so long  that same evening several small seabirds came towards the boat and flew inquiringly round it as if they wondered what it could be doing there so far away from the haunts of men  these birds were evidently unaccustomed to man for they exhibited little fear  they came so near to the boat that one of them was at length caught  it was the negro who succeeded in knocking it on the head with a boathook as it flew past  great was the praise bestowed on king bumble for this meritorious deed and loud were the praises bestowed on the bird itself which was carefully divided into equal portions and a small portion for jacko and eaten raw  not a morsel of it was lostclaws beak blood bones and feathersall were eaten up  in order to prevent dispute or jealousy the captain made ailie turn her back on the bird when thus divided and pointing to the different portions he said  who shall have this  whoever was named by ailie had to be content with what thus fell to his share  ah but ye wos always an onlucky dog exclaimed briant to whom fell the head and claws  yeve no reason to grumble replied gurney yeve got all the brains to yerself and no one needs them more  the catching of this bird was the saving of the crew and it afforded them a good deal of mirth in the dividing of it  the heart and a small part of the breast fell to ailiewhich every one remarked was singularly appropriate part of a leg and the tail fell to king bumble and the lungs and stomach became the property of jim scroggles whereupon briant remarked that he would think as much almost o that stomach as he had iver done of his own  but there was much of sadness mingled with their mirth for they felt that the repast was a peculiarly light one and they had scarcely strength left to laugh or jest  next morning they knocked down another bird and in the evening they got two more  the day after that they captured an albatross which furnished them at last with an ample supply of fresh food  it was mr markham the second mate who first saw the great bird looming in the distance as it sailed over the sea towards them  lets try to fish for him said the doctor  ive heard of seabirds being caught in that way before now  fish for it exclaimed ailie in surprise  ay with hook and line ailie  ive seen it done often said the captain  hand me the line bumble and a bit o that bird we got yesterday  now for it  by the time the hook was baited the albatross had approached near to the boat and hovered around it with that curiosity which seems to be a characteristic feature of all seabirds  it was an enormous creature but ailie when she saw it in the air could not have believed it possible that it was so large as it was afterwards found to be on being measured  here glynn catch hold of the line said the captain as he threw the hook overboard and allowed it to trail astern you are the strongest man amongst us now i think starvation dont seem to tell so much on your young flesh and bones as on ours  no it seems to agree with his constitution remarked gurney  its me that wouldnt give much for his flesh observed briant but his skin and bones would fetch a good price in the leather and rag market  while his messmates were thus freely remarking on his personal appearancewhich to say truth was dreadfully haggardglynn was holding the end of the line and watching the motions of the albatross with intense interest  he wont take it observed the captain  me tink him will said bumble  no go remarked nikel sling sadly  that was near said the first mate eagerly as the bird made a bold swoop down towards the bait which was skipping over the surface of the water  no hes off cried mr markham in despair  cotched or im a dutchman shouted  gurney  no cried jim scroggles  yes screamed ailie  hurrah shouted tim rokens and tarquin in a breath  dick barnes and the doctor and the captain and in short everybody echoed the last sentiment and repeated it again and again with delight as they saw the gigantic bird once again swoop down upon the bait and seize it  glynn gave a jerk the hook caught in its tongue and the albatross began to tug and swoop and whirl madly in its effort to escape  now to talk of any ordinary bird swooping and fluttering and tugging does not sound very tremendous but reader had you witnessed the manner in which that enormous albatross conducted itself you wouldnt have stared with amazementoh no  you wouldnt have gone home with your mouth as wide open as your eyes and have given a gasping account of what you had seenby no means  you wouldnt have talked of feathered steamengines or of fabled rocs or of winged elephants in the aircertainly not  glynns arms jerked as if he were holding on to the sheet of a shifting mainsail of a seventyfour  bear a hand he cried else ill be torn to bits  several hands grasped the line in a moment  my wot a wopper exclaimed tim rokens  och dont he pull  wot a fortin hed make av hed only set hisself up as a tugboat in the thames  if only we had him at the oar for a week added gurney  hoich doctor have ye strength to set disjointed limbs  have a care lads cried the captain in some anxiety give him more play the line wont stand it  time enough to jest after weve got him  the bird was now swooping and waving and beating its great wings so close to the boat that they began to entertain some apprehension lest any of the crew should be disabled by a stroke from them before the bird could be secured  glynn therefore left the management of the line to others and taking up an oar tried to strike it  but he failed in several attempts  wait till we haul him nearer boy said the captain  now then  glynn struck again and succeeded in hitting it a slight blow  at the same instant the albatross swept over the boat and almost knocked the doctor overboard  as it brushed past king bumble who was gifted with the agility of a monkey leaped up caught it round the neck and the next moment the two were rolling together in the bottom of the boat  the creature was soon strangled and a mighty cheer greeted this momentous victory  we are not aware that albatross flesh is generally considered very desirable food but we are certain that starving men are particularly glad to get it and that the supply now obtained by the wrecked mariners was the means of preserving their lives until they reached the land which they did ten days afterwards having thus accomplished a voyage of above two thousand miles over the ocean in an open boat in the course of eight weeks and on an amount of food that was barely sufficient for one or two weeks ordinary consumption  great commiseration was expressed for them by the people at the cape who vied with each other in providing for their wants and in showing them kindness  ailie and her father were carried off bodily by a stout old merchant with a broad kind face and a hearty boisterous manner and lodged in his elegant villa during their stay in that quarter of the world which was protracted some time in order that they might recruit the wasted strength of the party ere they commenced their voyage home in a vessel belonging to the same stout broadfaced and vociferous merchant  meanwhile several other ships departed for america and by one of these captain dunning wrote to his sisters martha and jane  the captain never wrote to martha or to jane separatelyhe always wrote to them conjointly as martha jane dunning  the captain was a peculiar letterwriter  those who may feel curious to know more about this matter are referred for further information to the next chapter    chapter twenty five  home sweet homethe captain takes his sisters by surprisea mysterious stranger  it is a fact which we cannot deny however much we may feel disposed to marvel at it that laughter and weeping at one and the same time are compatible  the most resolute sceptic on this point would have been convinced of the truth of it had he been introduced into the misses martha and jane dunnings parlour on the beautiful summer morning in which the remarkable events we are about to relate occurred  on the morning in question a lettercarrier walked up to the cottage with the yellowpainted face and with the green door so like a nose in the middle and the window on each side thereof so like its eyes and the green venetian blinds that served so admirably for eyelids attached theretoall of which stood and beamed and luxuriated and vegetated and grew old in the centre of the town on the eastern seaboard of america whose name for strictly private reasons we have firmly declined and do still positively refuse to communicate  having walked up to the cottage the lettercarrier hit it a severe smash on its green nose as good captain dunning had done many many months before  the result now as then was the opening thereof by a servantgirlthe servantgirl of old  the lettercarrier was a taciturn man he said nothing but handed in the letter and went his way  the servantgirl was a morose damsel she said nothing but took the letter shut the door and laid it the letter not the door on the breakfasttable and went her waywhich way was the way of all flesh fish and fowlnamely the kitchen where breakfast was being prepared  soon after the arrival of the letter miss jane dunninghaving put on an immaculately clean white collar and a spotlessly beautiful white cap with pink ribbons which looked if possible taller than usual descended to the breakfastparlour  her eye instantly fell on the letter and she exclaimedoh at the full pitch of her voice indeed did not respect for the good lady forbid we would say that she yelled oh  instantly as if by magic a faint oh came downstairs like an echo from the region of miss martha dunnings bedroom and was followed up by a what is it so loud that the most unimaginative person could not have failed to perceive that the elder sister had opened her door and put her head over the banisters  what is it repeated miss martha  a letter answered miss jane  who from  in eager surprise from above  brother george  in eager delight from below  miss jane had not come to this knowledge because of having read the letter for it still lay on the table unopened but because she could not read it at all  one of captain dunnings peculiarities was that he wrote an execrably bad and illegible hand  his english was good his spelling pretty fair considering the absurd nature of the orthography of his native tongue and his sense was excellent but the whole was usually shrouded in hieroglyphical mystery  miss jane could only read the opening my dearest sisters and the concluding george dunning nothing more  but miss martha could by the exercise of some rare power spell out her brothers hand though not without much difficulty  im coming shouted miss martha  be quick screamed miss jane  in a few seconds miss martha entered the room with her cap and collar though faultlessly clean and stiff put on very much awry  give it me  where is it  miss jane pointed to the letter still remaining transfixed to the spot where her eye had first met it as if it were some dangerous animal which would bite if she touched it  miss martha snatched it up tore it open and flopped down on the sofa miss jane snatched up an imaginary letter tore it open in imagination and flopping down beside her sister looked over her shoulder apparently to make believe to herself that she read it along with her  thus they read and commented on the captains letter in concert  table baydear me what a funny bay that must bemy dearest sistersthe darling fellow he always begins that way dont he jane dear  bless him he does martha dear  weve been alli cant make this word out can you dear  no love  weve been allworked  no it cant be that  stay weve been all wrecked  here martha laid down the letter with a look of horror and jane with a face of ashy paleness exclaimed then theyre lost  but no cried martha george could not have written to us from tablecloth bay had he been lost  neither he could exclaimed jane eagerly  under the influence of the revulsion of feeling this caused martha burst into tears and jane into laughter  immediately after jane wept and martha laughed then they both laughed and cried together after which they felt for their pockethandkerchiefs and discovered that in their haste they had forgotten them so they had to call the servantgirl and send her upstairs for them and when the handkerchiefs were brought they had to be unfolded before the sisters could dry their eyes  when they had done so and were somewhat composed they went on with the reading of the letter  weve been all wreckeddreadfuland the poor red angeloh it cant be that martha dear  indeed it looks very like it jane darling  oh  i see its ericand the poor red eric has been patched orpitched on a rock and smashed to sticks and stiversdear me what can that be  i know what sticks are but i cant imagine what stivers mean  can you jane  havent the remotest idea perhaps johnson or walker or webster may yes webster is sure to  oh never mind just now dear jane we can look it up afterwardsstiverssticks and stiverssomething very dreadful i fear  but were all safe and well nowim so thankfuland weve been stumpedno starved nearly to death too  my poor ailie was thinner than ever i saw her beforethis is horrible dear jane  dreadful darling martha  but shes milk and butterit cant be thatmilk andohmuch better now  at this point martha laid down the letter and the two sisters wept for a few seconds in silence  darling ailie said martha drying her eyes how thin she must have been  ah yes and no one to take in her frocks  well be home in less than no time continued martha reading so you may get ready for us  glynn will have tremendous long yarns to spin to you when we come back and so will ailie  she has seen a lotofun since we left youbless me what can that be jane  very likely some terrible sea monster martha how thankful we ought to be that it did not eat herseen a lotofunstrangea loto ohlot o funthats it how stupid of meand my dear pet has been such an asseh for shame brother  dont you think dear martha that theres some more of that word on the next line  so there is im so stupidistanceits not rightly divided thoughassistance and a comfort to me  i knew it couldnt be ass  so did i  ailie an ass precious child  now goodbye tye my dear lassies  ever your affectionate brother  dear fellow  george dunning  now it chanced that the ship which conveyed the above letter across the atlantic was a slow sailer and was much delayed by contrary winds  and it also chancedfor odd coincidences do happen occasionally in human affairsthat the vessel in which captain dunning with ailie and his crew embarked some weeks later was a fastsailing ship and was blown across the sea with strong favouring gales  hence it fell out that the first vessel entered port on sunday night and the second cast anchor in the same port on monday morning  the greenpainted door therefore of the yellowfaced cottage had scarcely recovered from the assault of the lettercarrier when it was again struck violently by the impatient captain dunning  miss martha who had just concluded and refolded the letter screamed oh and leaped up  miss jane did the same with this difference that she leaped up before screaming oh instead of after doing so  then both ladies hearing voices outside rushed towards the door of the parlour with the intention of flying to their rooms and there carefully arranging their tall white caps and clean white collars and keeping the early visitor whoever he or she might be waiting fully a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before they should descend stiffly starchly and ceremoniously to receive himor her  these intentions were frustrated by the servantgirl who opened the greenpainted door and let in the captain who rushed into the parlour and rudely kissed his speechless sisters  can it be gasped martha  jane had meant to gasp impossible but seeing ailie at that moment bound into marthas arms she changed her intention uttered a loud scream instead and fell down flat upon the floor under the impression that she had fainted  finding however that this was not the case she got up again quicklyignorant of the fact that the tall cap had come off altogether in the falland stood before her sister weeping and laughing and wringing her hands and waiting for her turn  but it did not seem likely to come soon for martha continued to hug ailie whom she had raised entirely from the ground with passionate fervour  seeing this and feeling that to wait was impossible jane darted forward threw her arms round ailieincluding martha as an unavoidable consequenceand pressed the childs back to her throbbing bosom  between the two poor ailie was nearly suffocated  indeed she was compelled to scream not because she wished to but because martha and jane squeezed a scream out of her  the scream acted on the former as a reproof  she resigned ailie to jane flung herself recklessly on the sofa and kicked  meanwhile captain dunning stood looking on rubbing his hands slapping his thighs and blowing his nose  the servantgirl also stood looking on doing nothingher face was a perfect blaze of amazement  girl said the captain turning suddenly towards her is breakfast ready  yes gasped the girl  then fetch it  the girl did not move  dye hear cried the captain  yees  then look alive  the captain followed this up with a roar and such an indescribably ferocious demonstration that the girl fled in terror to the culinary regions where she found the cat breakfasting on a pat of butter  the girl yelled and flung first a saucepan and after that the lid of a teapot at the thief  she failed of course in this effort to commit murder and the cat vanished  breakfast was brought but excepting in the captains case breakfast was not eaten  what between questioning and crying and hysterical laughing and replying and gasping explaining misunderstanding exclaiming and choking the other members of the party that breakfasted that morning in the yellow cottage with the muchabused green door did little else than upset teacups and creampots and sputter eggs about and otherwise make a mess of the once immaculate tablecloth  oh aunt martha exclaimed ailie in the midst of a short pause in the storm im so very very very glad to be home  the child said this with intense fervour  no one but he who has been long long away from the home of his childhood and had come back after having despaired of ever seeing it again can imagine with what deep fervour she said it and then burst into tears  aunt jane at that moment was venturing to swallow her first mouthful of tea so she gulped and choked and aunt martha spent the next five minutes in violently beating the poor creatures back as if she deemed choking a serious offence which merited severe punishment  as for the captain that unfeeling monster went on grinning from ear to ear and eating a heavy breakfast as if nothing had happened  but a close observer might have noticed a curious process going on at the starboard side of his weatherbeaten nose  in one of his many desperate encounters with whales captain dunning had had the end of a harpoon thrust accidentally into the prominent member of his face just above the bridge  a permanent little hole was the result and on the morning of which we write a drop of water got into that hole continually and when it rolled outwhich it did about once every two minutesand fell into the captains teacup it was speedily replaced by another drop which trickled into the depths of that small cavern on the starboard side of the captains nose  we dont pretend to account for that curious phenomenon  we merely record the fact  while the breakfast party were yet in this april mood a knock was heard at the outer door  visitors said martha with a look that would have led a stranger to suppose that she held visitors in much the same estimation as taxgatherers  how awkward exclaimed aunt jane  send em away girl cried the captain  were all engaged  cant see any one today  in a moment the servantgirl returned  he says he must see you  see who cried the captain  see you sir  must he then he shant  tell him that  please sir he says he wont go away  wont he  as he said this the captain set his teeth clenched his fists and darted out of the room  oh  george  stop him do stop him  hes so violent  hell do something dreadful said aunt martha  will no one call out murder groaned aunt jane with a shudder  as no one however ventured to check captain dunning he reached the door and confronted a rough big burly sailor who stood outside with a freeandeasy expression of countenance and his hands in his trousers pockets  why dont you go away when youre told eh shouted the captain  cause i wont answered the man coolly  the captain stepped close up but the sailor stood his ground and grinned  now my lad if you dont up anchor and make sail right away ill knock in your daylights  no you wont do nothin o the kind old genlemn but youll doublereef your temper and listen to wot ive got to say for its very partikler an wont keep long without spilin  what have you got to say then said the captain becoming interested but still feeling nettled at the interruption  cant tell you here  why not  never mind but put on your skyscraper and come down with me to the grogshop wot i frequents and ill tell ye  ill do nothing of the sort be off cried the captain preparing to slam the door  oh its all the same to me in coorse but i rather think if ye knowd that its bout the termagant and that ere whale wotbut it dont matter  goodmornin  stay cried the captain as the last words fell on his ears  have you really anything to say to me about that ship  in coorse i has  wont you come in and say it here  not by no means  you must come down to the grogshop with me  well ill go  so saying the captain ran back to the parlour said in hurried tones that he had to go out on matters of importance but would be back to dine at five and putting on his hat left the cottage in company with the strange sailor    chapter twenty six  captain dunning astonishes the strangersurprising news and desperate resolves  still keeping his hands in his pockets and the freeandeasy expression on his countenance the sailor swaggered through the streets of the town with captain dunning at his side until he arrived at a very dirty little street near the harbour the chief characteristics of which were noise compound smells and little shops with seastores hung out in front  at the farther end of this street the sailor paused before a small publichouse  here we are said he this is the place were i puts up wen im ashorewich aint oftenthats a fact  after you sir  the captain hesitated  you aint afraid air you asked the sailor in an incredulous tone  no im not my man but i have an objection to enter a publichouse unless i cannot help it  have you had a glass this morning  the sailor looked puzzled as if he did not see very clearly what the question had to do with the captains difficulty  well for the matter o that ive had three glasses this mornin  then i suppose you have no objection to try a glass of my favourite tipple have you  the man smiled and wiping his mouth with the cuff of his jacket as if he expected the captain was then and there about to hand him a glass of the tipple referred to said  no objection wotsomediver  then follow me ill take you to the place where i put up sometimes when im ashore  its not far off  five minutes sufficed to transport them from the dirty little street near the harbour to the backparlour of the identical coffeehouse in which the captain was first introduced to the reader  here having whispered something to the waiter he proceeded to question his companion on the mysterious business for which he had brought him there  couldnt we have the tipple first suggested the sailor  it will be here directly  have you breakfasted  xceptin the three glasses i told ye ofno  well now what have you to tell me about the termagant  you have already said that you are one of her crew and that you were in the boat that day when we had a row about the whale  what more can you tell me  the sailor sat down on a chair stretched out his legs quite straight and very wide apart and thrust his hands if possible deeper into his pockets than they even were thrust beforeso deep in fact as to suggest the idea that there were no pockets there at allmerely holes then he looked at captain dunning with a peculiarly sly expression of countenance and winked  well thats not much  anything more inquired the captain  ho yes lots more  the termagants in this yere portatthis yeremoment  the latter part of this was said in a hoarse emphatic whisper and the man raising up both legs to a horizontal position let them fall so that his heels came with a crash upon the wooden floor  is she cried the captain with lively interest and her captain  hesyeretoo  captain dunning took one or two hasty strides across the floor as if he were pacing his own quarterdeckthen stopped suddenly and said  can you get hold of any more of that boats crew  i can do nothin more wotiver nor say nothin more wotsomediver till ive tasted that ere tipple of yourn  the captain rang the bell and the waiter entered with ham and eggs buttered toast and hot coffee for two  the sailor opened his eyes to their utmost possible width and made an effort to thrust his hands still deeper into his unfathomable trousers pockets then he sat bolt upright and gathering his legs as close under his chair as possible clasped his knees with his hands hugged himself and grinned from ear to ear  after sitting a second or two in that position he jumped up and going forward to the table took up the plate of ham and eggs as if to make sure that it was a reality and smelt it  is this your favourite tipple he said on being quite satisfied of the reality of what he saw  coffee is my favourite drink replied the captain laughing  i never take anything stronger  ho youre a toteetler  i am  now my man as you have not yet had breakfast and as you interrupted me in the middle of mine suppose we sit down and discuss the matter of the whale over this  well this is the rummiest way of offerin to give a fellow a glass as i ever did come across since i was a tadpole as sure as my names dick jones remarked the sailor sitting down opposite the captain and turning up the cuffs of his coat  having filled his mouth to its utmost possible extent the astonished seaman proceeded at one and the same time to masticate and to relate all that he knew in regard to the termagant  he said that not only was that vessel in port at that time but that the same men were still aboard that the captaindixon by namewas still in command and that the whale which had been seized from the crew of the red eric had been sold along with the rest of the cargo  he related moreover how that he and his comrades had been very illtreated by captain dixon during the voyage and that he captain d was in the opinion of himself and his shipmates the greatest blackguard afloat and had made them so miserable by his brutality and tyranny that they all hoped they might never meet with his like again not to mention the hopes and wishes of a very unfeeling nature which they one and all expressed in regard to that captains future career besides all this he stated that he dick jones had recognised captain dunning when he landed that morning and had followed him to the cottage with the yellow face and the green door after which he had taken a turn of halfanhour or so up and down the street to think what he ought to do and had at last resolved to tell all that he knew and offer to stand witness against his captain which he was then and there prepared to do at that time or at any future period wherever he captain dunning liked and whenever he pleased and that there was an end of the whole matter and that was a fact  having unburdened his mind and eaten all the ham and eggs and toast and drunk all the coffee and asked for more and got it dick jones proceeded to make himself supremely happy by filling his pipe and lighting it  ill take him to law said captain dunning firmly smiting the table with his fist  i knowd a feller said jones wot always said wen he heard a feller say that youll come for to wish that ye hadnt but i think yere right capen for its a clear case clear as daylight an well all swear to amost anything asll go fur to prove it  but are you sure your messmates are as willing as you are to witness against the captain  sure  in coorse i issartin sure  didnt he lamp two on em with a ropesend once till they wos fit to bust and all for nothin but skylarkin  theyll all go in the same boat with me cept perhaps the cook who is named baldwin  hes a crossgrained critter anll stan by the capen through thick an thin an so will the carpenterbox they call himhes dead agin us but thats all  then ill do it at once cried captain dunning rising and putting on his hat firmly as a man does when he has made a great resolve which he more than half suspects will get him into a world of difficulties and trouble  i spose i may set here till ye come back inquired dick jones who now wore a dim mysterious aspect in consequence of the cloud of smoke in which he had enveloped himself  you may sit there till they turn you out but come and take breakfast with me at the same hour tomorrow will ye  wont i  then goodday  so saying the captain left the coffeehouse and hurried to his sisters cottage where he rightly conjectured he should find glynn proctor  without telling his sisters the result of the interview with the rude seaman he took glynns arm and sallied forth in search of tim rokens and mr millons both of whom they discovered enjoying their pipes after a hearty breakfast in a small unpretending but excellent and comfortable sailors home in the dirty little street before referred to  the greater part of the crew of the late red eric now sticks and stivers were found in the same place engaged in much the same occupation and to these in solemn conclave assembled captain dunning announced his intention of opening a lawsuit against the captain of the termagant for the unlawful appropriation of the whale harpooned by glynn  the men highly approved of what they called a shoregoing scrimmage and advised the captain to go and have the captain and crew of the termagant put in limbo right off  thus advised and encouraged captain dunning went to a lawyer who after hearing the case stated it as his opinion that it was a good one and forthwith set about taking the needful preliminary steps to commencing the action  thereafter captain dunning walked rapidly home wiping his hot brow as he went and entering the parlour of the cottagethe yellowfaced cottageflung himself on the sofa with a reckless air and said ive done it  horror cried aunt martha  misery gasped aunt jane who happened to be fondling ailie at the time of her brothers entrance  is he dead  quite dead added martha  is who dead inquired the captain in surprise  the manthe rude sailor  dead  no  you said just now that you had done it  so i have  ive done the deed  ive gone to law  had the captain said that he had gone to sticks and stivers his sisters could not have been more startled and horrified  they dreaded the law and hated it with a great and intense hatred and not without reason for their father had been ruined in a lawsuit and his father had broken the law in some political manner they could never clearly understand and had been condemned by the law to perpetual banishment  will it do you much harm dear papa inquired ailie in great concern  harm  of course not  i hope itll do me and you too a great deal of good  im so glad to hear that for ive heard people say that when you once go into it you never get out of it again  so have i said aunt martha with a deep sigh  and so have i added aunt jane with a deeper sigh and i believe its true  its false cried the captain laughing and you are all silly geese the law is  a bright and glorious institution  a desirable investment for the talents of able men  a machine for justice usuallyinjustice occasionallyand like all other good things often misused abused and spoken against said glynn proctor at that moment entering the room and throwing his hat on one chair and himself on another  ive had enough of the sea captain and have come to resign my situation and beg for dinner  you shall have it immediately dear glynn said martha whose heart warmed at the sight of one who had been so kind to her little niece  nay im in no hurry said glynn quickly i did but jest dear madam as shakespeare has it  perhaps it was milton who said it one cant be sure but whenever a truly grand remark escapes you youre safe to clap it down to shakespeare  at this point the servantgirl announced dinner  at the same instant a heavy foot was heard in the passage and tim rokens announced himself saying that he had just seen the captains lawyer and had been sent to say that he wished to see captain dunning in the course of the evening  then let him go on wishing till im ready to go to him  meanwhile do you come and dine with us rokens my lad  rokens looked awkward and shuffled a little with his feet and shook his head  why whats the matter man  rokens looked as if he wished to speak but hesitated  if ye please capen id raither not axin the ladies parding  id like a word with you in the passage  by all means replied the captain going out of the room with the sailor  now whats wrong  my flippers capen said rokens thrusting out his hard thick enormous hands which were stained all over with sundry streaks of tar and were very red as well as extremely clumsy to look ative bin an washed em with hot water and rubbed em with grease till i amost took the skin off but they wont come clean and im not fit to sit down with ladies  to this speech the captain replied by seizing tim rokens by the collar and dragging him fairly into the parlour  heres a man cried the captain enthusiastically presenting him to martha whos sailed with me for nigh thirty years and is the best harpooner i ever had and has stuck to me through thick and thin in fair weather and foul in heat and cold and was kinder to ailie during the last voyage than all the other men put together exceptin glynn and who tells me his hands are covered with tar and that he cant wash em clean nohow and isnt fit to dine with ladies so you will oblige me martha by ordering him to leave the house  i will brother with pleasure  i order you mr rokens to leave this house at your peril  and i invite you to partake of our dinner which is now on the table in the next room  saying this aunt martha grasped one of the great tarstained flippers in both of her own delicate hands and shook it with a degree of vigour that tim rokens afterwards said he could not have believed possible had he not felt it  seeing this aunt jane turned aside and blew her nose violently  tim rokens attempted to make a bow failed and grinned  the captain criednow then heave ahead  glynn in the exuberance of his spirits uttered a miniature cheer  ailie gave vent to a laugh that sounded as sweet as a good song and the whole party adjourned to the diningroom where the servantgirl was found in the sulks because dinner was getting rapidly cold and the cat was found    prowling round the festal board   on thievish deeds intent  see miltons paradise regained latest edition    chapter twenty seven  the lawsuitthe battle and the victory  the great case of dunning versus dixon came on at last  on that day captain dunning was in a fever glynn proctor was in a fever tim rokens was in a fever the misses dunning were in two separate feverseverybody in fact on the dunning side of the case was in a fever of nervous anxiety and mental confusion  as witnesses in the case they had been precognosced to such an extent by the lawyers that their intellects were almost overturned  on being told that he was to be precognosced  tim rokens said stoutly hed like to see the man as ud do it under the impression that that was the legal term for being kicked or otherwise maltreated and on being informed that the word signified merely an examination as to the extent of his knowledge of the facts of the case he said quietly fire away  before they had done firing away the gallant harpooner was so confused that he began to regard the whole case as already hopeless  the other men were much in the same condition but in a private meeting held among themselves the day before the trial rokens made the following speech which comforted them not a little  messmates and shipmates said tim ill tell ye wot it is  im no lawyerthats a factbut im a man an wots a manit aint a bundle o flesh an bones on two legs with a turnip atop ot is it  be no manes murmured briant with an approving nod  cernly not remarked dick barnes  i second that motion  good continued rokens  then bein a man ive got brains enough to see that if we dont want to contredick one another we must stick to the truth  you dont suppose id go fur to tell lies do you said tarquin quickly  in coorse not  but what i mean to say is that we must stick to what we knows to be the truth and not be goin for to guess at it or think that we knows it and then swear to it as if we wos certain sure  hear hear from the assembled company  in fact observed glynn let what we say be absolutely true and say just as little as we can  thats how to manage a good case  an be all manes added briant dont let any of ye try for to improve matters be volunteerin yer opinion  volunteerin opinions is stuff  volunteerin is altogether a bad lookout  i knowd a feller i dida strappin young feller he was too more betokenas volunteered himself to death he did  to be sure his wos a case o volunteerin into the louth militia and he wos shot he wos in a poplar riot as the noosepapers saida scrimmage i calls itso dont let any o us be goin for to volunteer opinions wen nobody axes emno nor wants em  briant looked so pointedly at gurney while delivering this advice that that obese individual felt constrained to look indignant and inquire whether them ere imperent remarks wos meant for him  to which briant replied that they wos meant for him as well as for ivery man then present  whereupon gurney started up and shook his fist across the table at briant and briant made a face at gurney at which the assembled company of mariners laughed and immediately thereafter the meeting was broken up  next day the trial came on and as the case was expected to be more than usually interesting the house was filled to overflowing long before the hour  the trial lasted all that day and all the next and a great part of the third but we do not purpose going into it in detail  the way in which mr rasp captain dunnings counsel and mr tooth captain dixons counsel badgered browbeat and utterly bamboozled the witnesses on both sides and totally puzzled the jury can only be understood by those who have frequented courts of law but could not be fully or adequately described in less than six hundred pages  in the course of the trial the resolutions come to by the crew of the red eric that they would tell nothing but the truth and carefully refrain from touching on what they were not quite sure of proved to be of the greatest advantage to the pursuers case  we feel constrained here to turn aside for one moment to advise the general adoption of that course of conduct in all the serious affairs of life  the evidence of tim rokens was clear and to the point  the whale had been first struck by glynn with a harpoon to which a drogue was attached it had been followed up by the crew of the red eric and also by the crew of the termagant  the boats of the latter overtook the fish first fixed a harpoon in it and lanced it mortally  the drogue and harpoon of the red eric were still attached to the whale when this was done so that according to the laws of the fishery the crew of the termagant had no right to touch the whaleit was a fast fish  if the drogue had become detached the fish would have been free and both crews would have been entitled to chase and capture it if they were able  angry words and threats had passed between the crews of the opposing boats but the whale put a stop to that by smashing the boat of the red eric with its tail whereupon the boat of the termagant made off with the fish which died almost immediately after and left the crew of the boat belonging to the red eric struggling in the water  such was the substance of the evidence of the harpooner and neither crossexamination nor recrossexamination by mr tooth the counsel for the defendant could induce tim rokens to modify alter omit or contradict one iota of what he had said  it must not be supposed however that all of the men gave their evidence so clearly or so well  the captain did though he was somewhat nervous and the doctor did and glynn did  but that of nikel sling was unsatisfactory in consequence of his being unable to repress his natural tendency to exaggeration  tarquin also did harm for in his spite against the crew of the termagant he made statements which were not true and his credit as a witness was therefore totally destroyed  last of all came jim scroggles who after being solemnly sworn deposed that he was between thirtyfive and thirtysix years of age on hearing which gurney said oh with peculiar emphasis and the people laughed and the judge cried silence and the examination went on  after some time mr tooth rose to crossquestion jim scroggles who happened to be a nervous man in public and was gradually getting confused and angry  now my man please to be particular in your replies said mr tooth pushing up his spectacles on his forehead thrusting his hands into his trousers pockets and staring very hard at jim  you said that you pulled the second oar from the bow on the day in which the whale was killed  yes  are you quite sure of that  was it not the third oar now  yes or no interrupted mr tooth  its so long since  yes or no repeated mr tooth  yes roared scroggles forgetting at the moment in his confusion and indignation at not being allowed to speak in what manner the question had been put  yes echoed mr tooth addressing the judge but looking at the jury you will observe gentlemen  would your lordship be so good as to note that  this witness on that very particular occasion when every point in the circumstances must naturally have been impressed deeply on the memories of all present appears to have been so confused as not to know which oar of the boat he pulled  so my man turning to the witness it appears evident that either you are now misstating the facts of the case or were then incapable of judging of them  jim scroggles felt inclined to leap out of the witnessbox and knocked the teeth of mr tooth down his throat  but he repressed the inclination and that gentleman went on to say  when the boat of the red eric came up to the whale was the drogue still attached to it  in coorse it was  didnt ye hear me say that three or  be so good as to answer my questions simply and do not make unnecessary remarks sir  was the drogue attached when the boat came up  yes or no  yes  how do you know  cause i seed it  you are quite sure that you saw it  in coorseleastwise tim rokens seed it and all the men in the boat seed it and said so to me afterwardswich is the same thing though i cant xactly say i seed it myself cause i was looking hard at the men in the enemys boat and considerin which on em i should give a dab in the nose to first wen we come along side of em  oh then you did not see the drogue attached to the whale said mr tooth with a glance at the jury and you were so taken up with the anticipated fight i suppose that you scarcely gave your attention to the whale at all  were the other men in your boat in a similarly unobservant condition  eh exclaimed scroggles  were the other men as eager for the fight as you were  i spose they wos youd better ax em  i dun know  no i dont suppose you do considering the state of mind you appear to have been in at the time  do you know which part of the whale struck your boat  was it the head  no it was the tail  are you quite sure of that  ho yes quite sartin for ive got a knot on my head this day where the tip of its flukes came down on me  youre quite sure of that  might it not have been the part of the fish near the tail now that struck you or the fin just under the tail  no im quite sartin sure it warnt that  how are you so sure it wasnt that  because whales haint got no fins just under their tails replied scroggles with a broad grin  there was another loud laugh at this and mr tooth looked a little put out and the judge cried silence again and threatened to clear the court  after a few more questions jim scroggles was permitted to retire which he did oppressed with a feeling that his evidence had done the case little good if not some harm yet rather elated than otherwise at the success of his last hit  that evening captain dunning supped with ailie and his sisters in low spirits  glynn and the doctor and tim rokens and the two mates millons and markham supped with him also in low spirits and king bumble acted the part of waiter for that sable monarch had expressed an earnest desire to become captain dunnings servant and the captain had agreed to take him on at least for a time  king bumble was also in low spirits and as a natural consequence so were aunts martha and jane and little ailie  it seemed utterly incomprehensible to the males of the party how so good a case as this should come to wear such an unpromising aspect  the fact is said the captain at the conclusion of a prolonged discussion i dont believe well gain it  neither do i said the doctor helping himself to a large quantity of salad as if that were the only comfort now left to him and he meant to make the most of it before giving way to total despair  i knew it observed aunt martha firmly  i always said the law was a wicked institution  its a great shame said aunt jane indignantly but what could we expect  it treats every one ill  wont it treat captain dixon well if he wins aunt inquired ailie  dear child what can you possibly know about law said aunt martha  would you like a little more tart asked aunt jane  bravo  ailie cried glynn thats a fair question  i back it up  how much do you claim for damages george inquired aunt martha changing the subject  question whispered glynn  two thousand pounds answered the captain  what exclaimed the aunts in a simultaneous burst of amazement  all for one fish  ay it was a big one you see and dick jones one of the men of the termagant told me it was sold for that  its a profitable fishing when one doesnt lose ones ship  what do you say to go with me and ailie on our next trip sisters  you might use up all your silk and worsted thread and crooked pins  what nonsense you talk george but i suppose you really do use pretty large hooks and lines when you fish for whales  aunt martha addressed the latter part of her remark to tim rokens who seemed immensely tickled by the captains pleasantry  hooks and lines maam cried rokens regarding his hostess with a look of puzzled surprise  to be sure we do interrupted glynn we use anchors baited with live crocodilessometimes elephants when we cant get crocodiles  but hippopotamuses do best  oh  glynn cried ailie laughing how can you  it all depends on the drogue remarked the doctor  im surprised to find how few of the men can state with absolute certainty that they saw the drogue attached to the whale when the boat came up to it  it all hinges upon that  yes observed mr millons the ole case inges on that because that proves it was a fast fish  dear me mr millons said aunt martha smiling i have heard of fast young men but i never heard of a fast fish before  didnt you maam exclaimed the first mate looking up in surprise for that matteroffact seamen seldom recognised a joke at first sight  aunt martha who very rarely ventured on the perpetration of a joke blushed and turning somewhat hastily to mr markham asked if he would take another cup of tea  seeing that there was no tea on the table she substituted another slice of ham and laughed  thereupon the whole company laughed and from that moment their spirits began to rise they began to discuss the more favourable points of the evidence led that day and when they retired at a late hour to rest their hopes had again become sanguine  next morning the examination of the witnesses for the defendant came on there were more of them than dick jones had expected for the crew of the termagant happened to be partly made up of very bad men who were easily bribed by their captain to give evidence in his favour  but it soon became evident that they had not previously determined as captain dunnings men had done to stick to the simple truth  they not only contradicted each other but each contradicted himself more than once and it amazed them all more than they could tell to find how easily mr rasp turned their thoughts outside in and caused them to prove conclusively that they were telling falsehoods  after the case had been summed up by the judge the jury retired to consult but they only remained five minutes away and then came back with a verdict in favour of the pursuers  whos the pursooers inquired gurney when this was announced to him by nikel sling  aint we all pursooers  wasnt we all pursooing the whale together  oh you grampus cried nikel laughing  dont ye know that we is the purshooers cause why  were purshooin the capen and crew of the termagant at law and means to purshoo em too i guess till they stumps up for that air whale  and they is the defendants cause theyre sposed to defend themselves to the last gasp but it aint o no manner o use  nikel sling was right  captain dixon was pursued until he paid back the value of his illgotten whale and was forcibly reminded by this episode in his career that honesty is the best policy after all thus captain dunning found himself suddenly put in possession of a sum of two thousand pounds    chapter twenty eight  the conclusion  the trouble and worry and annoyance that the sum of 2000 pounds gave to captain dunning is past all belief  that worthy man knowing that glynn proctor had scarcely a penny in the world not even his kit as sailors name their seachests which had been lost in the wreck of the red eric and that the boy was about to be cast upon the world again an almost friendless wandererknowing all this we say captain dunning insisted that as glynn had been the first to strike the whale and as no one else had had anything to do with its capture he glynn was justly entitled to the money  glynn firmly declined to admit the justice of this view of the case he had been paid his wages that was all he had any right to claim so he positively refused to take the money  but the captain was more than his match  he insisted so powerfully and argued so logically that glynn at last consented on condition that 500 pounds of it should be distributed among his shipmates  this compromise was agreed to and thus glynn came into possession of what appeared in his eyes a fortune of 1500 pounds  now what am i to do with it that is the question  glynn propounded this knotty question one evening about three weeks after the trial to his friends of the yellow cottage with the greenpainted door  put it in the bank suggested aunt martha  yes and live on the interest added aunt jane  or invest in the whalefishery said captain dunning emitting a voluminous cloud of tobaccosmoke as if to suggest the idea that the investment would probably end in something similar to that  the captain was a peculiarly favoured individual he was privileged to smoke in the misses dunnings parlour  oh  ill tell you what to do glynn cried ailie clapping her hands it would be so nice  buy a cottage with ita nice pretty whitepainted cottage beside a wood with a little river in front of it and a small lake with a boat on it not far off and a far far view from the windows of fields and villages and churches and cattle and sheep and  hurrah  ailie go it my lass interrupted glynn and horses and ponies and carts and cats and blackbirds and cocks and hens and ploughmen and milkmaids and beggars all in the foreground and coaches and railroads and steamboats and palaces and canals in the middle distance with a glorious background of the mighty sea glittering for ever under the blazing beams of a perpetually setting sun mingled with the pale rays of an eternally rising moon and laden with small craft and whaleships and seaweed and fish and bumboats and menofwar  oh how nice cried ailie screaming with delight  go ahead lad never give in said the captain whose pipe during this glowing description had been keeping up what seemed like a miniature seafight  youve forgot the main point  whats that inquired glynn  why a palace for jacko close beside it with a portrait of jacko over the drawingroom fireplace and a marble bust of jacko in the four corners of every room  so i did i forgot that replied glynn  dear jacko said ailie laughing heartily and holding out her hand  the monkey which had become domesticated in the house leaped nimbly upon her knee and looked up in her face  oh  ailie dear do put it down cried aunt jane shuddering  how can you said aunt martha dirty beast  of course aunt martha applied the latter part of her remark to the monkey not to the child  ill never be able to bear it remarked aunt jane  and it will never come to agree with the cat observed aunt martha  ailie patted her favourite on the cheek and told it to go away adding that it was a dear petwhereupon that small monkey retired modestly to a corner near the sideboard  it chanced to be the corner nearest to the sugarbasin which had been left out by accident but jacko didnt know that of courseat least if he did he did not say so  it is probable however that he found it out in course of time for an hour or two afterwards the distinct marks of ten very minute fingers were visible therein a discovery which aunt martha made with a scream and aunt jane announced with a shriekwhich caused jacko to retire precipitately  but really said glynn jesting apart i must take to something on shore for although i like the sea very well i find that i like the land better  well since you wish to be in earnest about it said captain dunning ill tell you what has been passing in my mind of late  im getting to be an oldish young man now you see and am rather tired of the sea myself so i also think of giving it up  i have now laid by about five thousand pounds and with this i think of purchasing a farm  i learnt something of farming before i took to the sea so that i am not quite so green on such matters as you might suppose though i confess im rather rusty and behind the age but that wont much matter in a fine country like this and i can get a good steward to take command and steer the ship until i have brushed up a bit in shoregoin navigation  there is a farm which is just the very thing for me not more than twenty miles from this town with a cottage on it and a view somewhat like the one you and ailie described a few minutes ago though not quite so grand but theres one great and insuperable objection to my taking it  what is that inquired aunt martha who with her sister expressed in their looks unbounded surprise at the words of their brother whom they regarded as so thoroughly and indissolubly connected with the sea that they would probably have been less surprised had he announced it to be his intention to become a fish and thenceforward dwell in a coral cave  i have not enough of money wherewith to buy and stock it  what a pity said ailie whose hopes had been rising with extraordinary rapidity and were thus quenched at once  glynn leaped up and smote his thigh with his right hand and exclaimed in a triumphant mannerthats the very ticket  whats the very ticket inquired the captain  ill lend you my money said glynn  ay boy thats just the point i was comin to  a thousand pounds will do  now if you lend me that sum im willin to take you into partnership and well buy the place and farm it together  i think well pull well in the same boat for i think you like me well enough and im sure i like you and i know ailie dont object to either of us and after im gone glynn you can work the farm for ailie and give her her share  what say you  done exclaimed glynn springing up and seizing the captains hand ill be your son and youll be my father and ailie will be my sister and wont we be jolly just  ailie laughed and so did the two aunts but the captain made no reply he merely smoked with a violence that was quite appalling and nodding his head winked at glynn as if to saythats it exactly  the compact thus halfjestingly entered into was afterwards thoroughly ratified and carried into effect  the cottage was named the red eric and the property was named the whale brae after an ancestral estate which it was supposed had at some remote period belonged to the dunning family in scotland  the title was not inappropriate for it occupied the side of a rising ground which as a feature in the landscape looked very like a whale only as glynn said not quite so big which was an outrageous falsehood for it was a great deal bigger  a small wooden palace was built for jacko and many a portrait was taken of him by glynn in charcoal on many an outhouse wall to the immense delight of ailie  as to having busts of him placed in the corners of every room glynn remarked that that was quite unnecessary for jacko almost bust himself in every possible way at every conceivable time in every imaginable place whenever he could conveniently collect enough of food to do sowhich was not often for jacko though small was of an elastic as well as an amiable disposition  tim rokens stuck to his old commander to the last  he said he had sailed with him the better part of his life in the same ships had weathered the same storms and chased the same fish and now that the captain had made up his mind to lay up in port he meant to cast anchor beside him  so the bold harpooner became a species of overseer and jackofalltrades on the property  phil briant set up as a carpenter in the village close by took to himself a wife his first wife having died and became tim rokens boon companion and bosom friend  as for the rest of the crew of the red eric they went their several ways got into separate ships and were never again reassembled together but nearly all of them came at separate times in the course of years to visit their old captain and shipmates in the red eric at whale brae  in course of time ailie grew up into such a sweet pretty modest loveable woman that the very sight of her did ones heart good  love was the ruling power in ailies heartlove to her god and saviour and to all his creatures  she was not perfect  who is  she had faults plenty of them  who has not  but her loving nature covered up everything with a golden veil so beautiful that no one saw her faults or if they did would not believe them to be faults at all  glynn also grew up and became a man  observe reader we dont mean to say that he became a thing with long legs and broad shoulders and whiskers  glynn became a real man an outandout man a being who realised the fact that he had been made and born into the world for the purpose of doing that world good and leaving it better than he found it  he did not think that to strut and smoke cigars and talk loud or big and commence most of his sentences with aw pon my soul was the summit of true greatness  neither did he flying in disgust to the opposite extreme speak like a misanthrope and look like a bear or dress like a savage  he came to know the truth of the proverb that there is a time for all things and following up the idea suggested by those words he came to perceive that there is a place for all things that place being the human heart when in a true and healthy condition in all its parts out of which in their proper time some of those all things ought to be ever ready to flow  hence glynn could weep with the sorrowful and laugh with the gay  he could wear a red or a blue flannel shirt and pull an oar ay the best oar at a rowing match or he could read the bible and pray with a bedridden old woman  had glynn proctor been a naval commander he might have sunk destroyed or captured fleets  had he been a soldier he might have stormed and taken cities being neither he was a greater man than either for he could rule his own spirit  if you are tempted dear reader to think that an easy matter just try it  make the effort  the first time you chance to be in a towering rage which i trust however may never be try to keep your tongue silent and most difficult of all try at that moment to pray and see whether your opinion as to your power over your own spirit be not changed  such were glynn and ailie  so they married of course you remark well reader and why not  nothing could be more natural  glynn felt and said too that nothing was nearer his heart  and ailie admitted after being told by glynn that she must be his wife for he wanted to have her and was determined to have her whether she would or notthat her heart was in similar proximity to the idea of marriage  captain dunning did not objectit would have been odd if he had objected to the fulfilment of his chief earthly desire  tim rokens did not groan when he heard of the proposalby no means on the contrary he roared and laughed and shouted with delight and went straight off to tell phil briant who roared a duet with him and they both agreed that it wos the most gloriously natral thing they ever did know since they wos launched upon the sea of time  so glynn proctor and ailie dunning were married and lived long and happily and usefully at whale brae  captain dunning lived with them until he was so old that ailies eldest daughter also named ailie had to lead him from his bedroom each morning to breakfast and light his pipe for him when he had finished  and ailie the second performed her duties well and made the old man happyhappier than he could find words to expressfor ailie the second was like her mother in all things and greater praise than that could not possibly be awarded to her  the affairs of the cottage with the yellow face and the green door were kept in good order for many years by one of ailie the seconds little sistersmartha by name and there was much traffic and intercourse between that ancient building and the red eric as long as the two aunts lived which was a very long time indeed  its green door was during that time almost battered off its hinges by successive juvenile members of the proctor family  and truly deep and heartfelt was the mourning at whale brae when the amiable sisters were taken away at last  as for tim rokens that ancient mariner became the idol of the young proctors as they successively came to be old enough to know his worth the number of ships and boats he made for the boys among them was absolutely fabulous  equal perhaps to about a twentieth part of the number of pipes of tobacco he smoked during his residence there and about double the number of stories told them by phil briant during the same period  king bumble lived with the family until his woolly head became as white as his face was black and jackopoor little jackolived so long that he became big but he did not become less amiable or less
