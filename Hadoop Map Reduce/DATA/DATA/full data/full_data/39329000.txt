venice  third or renaissance period     chapter i  early renaissance   § i i trust that the reader has been enabled by the preceding chapters to form some conception of the magnificence of the streets of venice during the course of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries yet by all this magnificence she was not supremely distinguished above the other cities of the middle ages her early edifices have been preserved to our times by the circuit of her waves while continual recurrences of ruin have defaced the glory of her sister cities but such fragments as are still left in their lonely squares and in the corners of their streets so far from being inferior to the buildings of venice are even more rich more finished more admirable in invention more exuberant in beauty and although in the north of europe civilization was less advanced and the knowledge of the arts was more confined to the ecclesiastical orders so that for domestic architecture the period of perfection must be there placed much later than in italy and considered as extending to the middle of the fifteenth century yet as each city reached a certain point in civilization its streets became decorated with the same magnificence varied only in style according to the materials at hand and temper of the people and i am not aware of any town of wealth and importance in the middle ages in which some proof does not exist that at its period of greatest energy and prosperity its streets were inwrought with rich sculpture and even though in this as before noticed venice always stood supreme glowing with color and with gold now therefore let the readerforming for himself as vivid and real a conception as he is able either of a group of venetian palaces in the fourteenth century or if he likes better of one of the more fantastic but even richer street scenes of rouen antwerp cologne or nuremberg and keeping this gorgeous image before himgo out into any thoroughfare representative in a general and characteristic way of the feeling for domestic architecture in modern times let him for instance if in london walk once up and down harley street or baker street or gower street and then looking upon this picture and on this set himself to consider for this is to be the subject of our following and final inquiry what have been the causes which have induced so vast a change in the european mind  § ii renaissance architecture is the school which has conducted mens inventive and constructive faculties from the grand canal to gower street from the marble shaft and the lancet arch and the wreathed leafage and the glowing and melting harmony of gold and azure to the square cavity in the brick wall we have now to consider the causes and the steps of this change and as we endeavored above to investigate the nature of gothic here to investigate also the nature of renaissance  § iii although renaissance architecture assumes very different forms among different nations it may be conveniently referred to three headsearly renaissance consisting of the first corruptions introduced into the gothic schools central or roman renaissance which is the perfectly formed style and grotesque renaissance which is the corruption of the renaissance itself  § iv now in order to do full justice to the adverse cause we will consider the abstract nature of the school with reference only to its best or central examples the forms of building which must be classed generally under the term early renaissance are in many cases only the extravagances and corruptions of the languid gothic for whose errors the classical principle is in no wise answerable it was stated in the second chapter of the seven lamps that unless luxury had enervated and subtlety falsified the gothic forms roman traditions could not have prevailed against them and although these enervated and false conditions are almost instantly colored by the classical influence it would be utterly unfair to lay to the charge of that influence the first debasement of the earlier schools which had lost the strength of their system before they could be struck by the plague  § v the manner however of the debasement of all schools of art so far as it is natural is in all ages the same luxuriance of ornament refinement of execution and idle subtleties of fancy taking the place of true thought and firm handling and i do not intend to delay the reader long by the gothic sickbed for our task is not so much to watch the wasting of fever in the features of the expiring king as to trace the character of that hazael who dipped the cloth in water and laid it upon his face nevertheless it is necessary to the completeness of our view of the architecture of venice as well as to our understanding of the manner in which the central renaissance obtained its universal dominion that we glance briefly at the principal forms into which venetian gothic first declined they are two in number one the corruption of the gothic itself the other a partial return to byzantine forms for the venetian mind having carried the gothic to a point at which it was dissatisfied tried to retrace its steps fell back first upon byzantine types and through them passed to the first roman but in thus retracing its steps it does not recover its own lost energy it revisits the places through which it had passed in the morning light but it is now with wearied limbs and under the gloomy shadows of evening  § vi it has just been said that the two principal causes of natural decline in any school are overluxuriance and overrefinement the corrupt gothic of venice furnishes us with a curious instance of the one and the corrupt byzantine of the other we shall examine them in succession  now observe first i do not mean by luxuriance of ornament quantity of ornament in the best gothic in the world there is hardly an inch of stone left unsculptured but i mean that character of extravagance in the ornament itself which shows that it was addressed to jaded faculties a violence and coarseness in curvature a depth of shadow a lusciousness in arrangement of line evidently arising out of an incapability of feeling the true beauty of chaste form and restrained power i do not know any character of design which may be more easily recognized at a glance than this overlusciousness and yet it seems to me that at the present day there is nothing so little understood as the essential difference between chasteness and extravagance whether in color shade or lines we speak loosely and inaccurately of overcharged ornament with an obscure feeling that there is indeed something in visible form which is correspondent to intemperance in moral habits but without any distinct detection of the character which offends us far less with any understanding of the most important lesson which there can be no doubt was intended to be conveyed by the universality of this ornamental law  § vii in a word then the safeguard of highest beauty in all visible work is exactly that which is also the safeguard of conduct in the soultemperance in the broadest sense the temperance which we have seen sitting on an equal throne with justice amidst the four cardinal virtues and wanting which there is not any other virtue which may not lead us into desperate error now observe temperance in the nobler sense does not mean a subdued and imperfect energy it does not mean a stopping short in any good thing as in love or in faith but it means the power which governs the most intense energy and prevents its acting in any way but as it ought and with respect to things in which there may be excess it does not mean imperfect enjoyment of them but the regulation of their quantity so that the enjoyment of them shall be greatest for instance in the matter we have at present in hand temperance in color does not mean imperfect or dull enjoyment of color but it means that government of color which shall bring the utmost possible enjoyment out of all hues a bad colorist does not love beautiful color better than the best colorist does nor half so much but he indulges in it to excess he uses it in large masses and unsubdued and then it is a law of nature a law as universal as that of gravitation that he shall not be able to enjoy it so much as if he had used it in less quantity his eye is jaded and satiated and the blue and red have life in them no more he tries to paint them bluer and redder in vain all the blue has become grey and gets greyer the more he adds to it all his crimson has become brown and gets more sere and autumnal the more he deepens it but the great painter is sternly temperate in his work he loves the vivid color with all his heart but for a long time he does not allow himself anything like it nothing but sober browns and dull greys and colors that have no conceivable beauty in them but these by his government become lovely and after bringing out of them all the life and power they possess and enjoying them to the uttermostcautiously and as the crown of the work and the consummation of its music he permits the momentary crimson and azure and the whole canvas is in a flame  § viii again in curvature which is the cause of loveliness in all form the bad designer does not enjoy it more than the great designer but he indulges in it till his eye is satiated and he cannot obtain enough of it to touch his jaded feeling for grace but the great and temperate designer does not allow himself any violent curves he works much with lines in which the curvature though always existing is long before it is perceived he dwells on all these subdued curvatures to the uttermost and opposes them with still severer lines to bring them out in fuller sweetness and at last he allows himself a momentary curve of energy and all the work is in an instant full of life and grace  the curves drawn in plate vii of the first volume were chosen entirely to show this character of dignity and restraint as it appears in the lines of nature together with the perpetual changefulness of the degrees of curvature in one and the same line but although the purpose of that plate was carefully explained in the chapter which it illustrates as well as in the passages of modern painters therein referred to vol ii pp 43 79 so little are we now in the habit of considering the character of abstract lines that it was thought by many persons that this plate only illustrated hogarths reversed line of beauty even although the curve of the salvia leaf which was the one taken from that plate for future use in architecture was not a reversed or serpentine curve at all i shall now however i hope be able to show my meaning better  § ix fig 1 in plate i opposite is a piece of ornamentation from a normanfrench manuscript of the thirteenth century and fig 2 from an italian one of the fifteenth observe in the first its stern moderation in curvature the gradually united lines nearly straight though none quite straight used for its main limb and contrasted with the bold but simple offshoots of its leaves and the noble spiral from which it shoots these in their turn opposed by the sharp trefoils and thorny cusps and see what a reserve of resource there is in the whole how easy it would have been to make the curves more palpable and the foliage more rich and how the noble hand has stayed itself and refused to grant one wave of motion more  illustration plate i                temperance and intemperance                in curvature  § x then observe the other example in which while the same idea is continually repeated excitement and interest are sought for by means of violent and continual curvatures wholly unrestrained and rolling hither and thither in confused wantonness compare the character of the separate lines in these two examples carefully and be assured that wherever this redundant and luxurious curvature shows itself in ornamentation it is a sign of jaded energy and failing invention do not confuse it with fulness or richness wealth is not necessarily wantonness a gothic moulding may be buried half a foot deep in thorns and leaves and yet will be chaste in every line and a late renaissance moulding may be utterly barren and povertystricken and yet will show the disposition to luxury in every line  § xi plate xx in the second volume though prepared for the special illustration of the notices of capitals becomes peculiarly interesting when considered in relation to the points at present under consideration the four leaves in the upper row are byzantine the two middle rows are transitional all but fig 11 which is of the formed gothic fig 12 is perfect gothic of the finest time ducal palace oldest part fig 13 is gothic beginning to decline fig 14 is renaissance gothic in complete corruption  now observe first the gothic naturalism advancing gradually from the byzantine severity how from the sharp hard formalized conventionality of the upper series the leaves gradually expand into more free and flexible animation until in fig 12 we have the perfect living leaf as if fresh gathered out of the dew and then in the last two examples and partly in fig 11 observe how the forms which can advance no longer in animation advance or rather decline into luxury and effeminacy as the strength of the school expires  § xii in the second place note that the byzantine and gothic schools however differing in degree of life are both alike in temperance though the temperance of the gothic is the nobler because it consists with entire animation observe how severe and subtle the curvatures are in all the leaves from fig 1 to fig 12 except only in fig 11 and observe especially the firmness and strength obtained by the close approximation to the straight line in the lateral ribs of the leaf fig 12 the longer the eye rests on these temperate curvatures the more it will enjoy them but it will assuredly in the end be wearied by the morbid exaggeration of the last example  illustration plate ii                gothic capitals  § xiii finally observeand this is very importanthow one and the same character in the work may be a sign of totally different states of mind and therefore in one case bad and in the other good the examples fig 3 and fig 12 are both equally pure in line but one is subdivided in the extreme the other broad in the extreme and both are beautiful the byzantine mind delighted in the delicacy of subdivision which nature shows in the fernleaf or parsleyleaf and so also often the gothic mind much enjoying the oak thorn and thistle but the builder of the ducal palace used great breadth in his foliage in order to harmonize with the broad surface of his mighty wall and delighted in this breadth as nature delights in the sweeping freshness of the dockleaf or waterlily both breadth and subdivision are thus noble when they are contemplated or conceived by a mind in health and both become ignoble when conceived by a mind jaded and satiated the subdivision in fig 13 as compared with the type fig 12 which it was intended to improve is the sign not of a mind which loved intricacy but of one which could not relish simplicity which had not strength enough to enjoy the broad masses of the earlier leaves and cut them to pieces idly like a child tearing the book which in its weariness it cannot read and on the other hand we shall continually find in other examples of work of the same period an unwholesome breadth or heaviness which results from the mind having no longer any care for refinement or precision nor taking any delight in delicate forms but making all things blunted cumbrous and dead losing at the same time the sense of the elasticity and spring of natural curves it is as if the soul of man itself severed from the root of its health and about to fall into corruption lost the perception of life in all things around it and could no more distinguish the wave of the strong branches full of muscular strength and sanguine circulation from the lax bending of a broken cord nor the sinuousness of the edge of the leaf crushed into deep folds by the expansion of its living growth from the wrinkled contraction of its decay1 thus in morals there is a care for trifles which proceeds from love and conscience and is most holy and a care for trifles which comes of idleness and frivolity and is most base and so also there is a gravity proceeding from thought which is most noble and a gravity proceeding from dulness and mere incapability of enjoyment which is most base now in the various forms assumed by the later gothic of venice there are one or two features which under other circumstances would not have been signs of decline but in the particular manner of their occurrence here indicate the fatal weariness of decay of all these features the most distinctive are its crockets and finials  § xiv there is not to be found a single crocket or finial upon any part of the ducal palace built during the fourteenth century and although they occur on contemporary and on some much earlier buildings they either indicate detached examples of schools not properly venetian or are signs of incipient decline  the reason of this is that the finial is properly the ornament of gabled architecture it is the compliance in the minor features of the building with the spirit of its towers ridged roof and spires venetian building is not gabled but horizontal in its roots and general masses therefore the finial is a feature contradictory to its spirit and adopted only in that search for morbid excitement which is the infallible indication of decline when it occurs earlier it is on fragments of true gabled architecture as for instance on the porch of the carmini  in proportion to the unjustifiableness of its introduction was the extravagance of the form it assumed becoming sometimes a tuft at the top of the ogee windows half as high as the arch itself and consisting in the richest examples of a human figure half emergent out of a cup of leafage as for instance in the small archway of the campo san zaccaria while the crockets as being at the side of the arch and not so strictly connected with its balance and symmetry appear to consider themselves at greater liberty even than the finials and fling themselves hither and thither in the wildest contortions fig 4 in plate i is the outline of one carved in stone from the later gothic of st marks fig 3 a crocket from the fine veronese gothic in order to enable the reader to discern the renaissance character better by comparison with the examples of curvature above them taken from the manuscripts and not content with this exuberance in the external ornaments of the arch the finial interferes with its traceries the increased intricacy of these as such being a natural process in the developement of gothic would have been no evil but they are corrupted by the enrichment of the finial at the point of the cuspcorrupted that is to say in venice for at verona the finial in the form of a fleurdelis appears long previously at the cusp point with exquisite effect and in our own best northern gothic it is often used beautifully in this place as in the window from salisbury plate xii vol ii fig 2 but in venice such a treatment of it was utterly contrary to the severe spirit of the ancient traceries and the adoption of a leafy finial at the extremity of the cusps in the door of san stefano as opposed to the simple ball which terminates those of the ducal palace is an unmistakable indication of a tendency to decline  in like manner the enrichment and complication of the jamb mouldings which in other schools might and did take place in the healthiest periods are at venice signs of decline owing to the entire inconsistency of such mouldings with the ancient love of the single square jamb and archivolt the process of enrichment in them is shown by the successive examples given in plate vii below they are numbered and explained in the appendix  § xv the date at which this corrupt form of gothic first prevailed over the early simplicity of the venetian types can be determined in an instant on the steps of the choir of the church of st john and paul on our left hand as we enter is the tomb of the doge marco cornaro who died in 1367 it is rich and fully developed gothic with crockets and finials but not yet attaining any extravagant developement opposite to it is that of the doge andrea morosini who died in 1382 its gothic is voluptuous and overwrought the crockets are bold and florid and the enormous finial represents a statue of st michael there is no excuse for the antiquaries who having this tomb before them could have attributed the severe architecture of the ducal palace to a later date for every one of the renaissance errors is here in complete developement though not so grossly as entirely to destroy the loveliness of the gothic forms in the porta della carta 1423 the vice reaches its climax  § xvi against this degraded gothic then came up the renaissance armies and their first assault was in the requirement of universal perfection for the first time since the destruction of rome the world had seen in the work of the greatest artists of the fifteenth centuryin the painting of ghirlandajo masaccio francia perugino pinturicchio and bellini in the sculpture of mino da fiesole of ghiberti and verrocchioa perfection of execution and fulness of knowledge which cast all previous art into the shade and which being in the work of those men united with all that was great in that of former days did indeed justify the utmost enthusiasm with which their efforts were or could be regarded but when this perfection had once been exhibited in anything it was required in everything the world could no longer be satisfied with less exquisite execution or less disciplined knowledge the first thing that it demanded in all work was that it should be done in a consummate and learned way and men altogether forgot that it was possible to consummate what was contemptible and to know what was useless imperatively requiring dexterity of touch they gradually forgot to look for tenderness of feeling imperatively requiring accuracy of knowledge they gradually forgot to ask for originality of thought the thought and the feeling which they despised departed from them and they were left to felicitate themselves on their small science and their neat fingering this is the history of the first attack of the renaissance upon the gothic schools and of its rapid results more fatal and immediate in architecture than in any other art because there the demand for perfection was less reasonable and less consistent with the capabilities of the workman being utterly opposed to that rudeness or savageness on which as we saw above the nobility of the elder schools in great part depends but inasmuch as the innovations were founded on some of the most beautiful examples of art and headed by some of the greatest men that the world ever saw and as the gothic with which they interfered was corrupt and valueless the first appearance of the renaissance feeling had the appearance of a healthy movement a new energy replaced whatever weariness or dulness had affected the gothic mind an exquisite taste and refinement aided by extended knowledge furnished the first models of the new school and over the whole of italy a style arose generally now known as cinquecento which in sculpture and painting as i just stated produced the noblest masters which the world ever saw headed by michael angelo raphael and leonardo but which failed of doing the same in architecture because as we have seen above perfection is therein not possible and failed more totally than it would otherwise have done because the classical enthusiasm had destroyed the best types of architectural form  § xvii for observe here very carefully the renaissance principle as it consisted in a demand for universal perfection is quite distinct from the renaissance principle as it consists in a demand for classical and roman forms of perfection and if i had space to follow out the subject as i should desire i would first endeavor to ascertain what might have been the course of the art of europe if no manuscripts of classical authors had been recovered and no remains of classical architecture left in the fifteenth century so that the executive perfection to which the efforts of all great men had tended for five hundred years and which now at last was reached might have been allowed to develope itself in its own natural and proper form in connexion with the architectural structure of earlier schools this refinement and perfection had indeed its own perils and the history of later italy as she sank into pleasure and thence into corruption would probably have been the same whether she had ever learned again to write pure latin or not still the inquiry into the probable cause of the enervation which might naturally have followed the highest exertion of her energies is a totally distinct one from that into the particular form given to this enervation by her classical learning and it is matter of considerable regret to me that i cannot treat these two subjects separately i must be content with marking them for separation in the mind of the reader  § xviii the effect then of the sudden enthusiasm for classical literature which gained strength during every hour of the fifteenth century was as far as respected architecture to do away with the entire system of gothic science the pointed arch the shadowy vault the clustered shaft the heavenpointing spire were all swept away and no structure was any longer permitted but that of the plain crossbeam from pillar to pillar over the round arch with square or circular shafts and a lowgabled roof and pediment two elements of noble form which had fortunately existed in rome were however for that reason still permitted the cupola and internally the waggon vault  § xix these changes in form were all of them unfortunate and it is almost impossible to do justice to the occasionally exquisite ornamentation of the fifteenth century on account of its being placed upon edifices of the cold and meagre roman outline there is as far as i know only one gothic building in europe the duomo of florence in which though the ornament be of a much earlier school it is yet so exquisitely finished as to enable us to imagine what might have been the effect of the perfect workmanship of the renaissance coming out of the hands of men like verrocchio and ghiberti had it been employed on the magnificent framework of gothic structure this is the question which as i shall note in the concluding chapter we ought to set ourselves practically to solve in modern times  § xx the changes effected in form however were the least part of the evil principles of the renaissance as i have just said its main mistake in its early stages was the unwholesome demand for perfection at any cost i hope enough has been advanced in the chapter on the nature of gothic to show the reader that perfection is not to be had from the general workman but at the cost of everythingof his whole life thought and energy and renaissance europe thought this a small price to pay for manipulative perfection men like verrocchio and ghiberti were not to be had every day nor in every place and to require from the common workman execution or knowledge like theirs was to require him to become their copyist their strength was great enough to enable them to join science with invention method with emotion finish with fire but in them the invention and the fire were first while europe saw in them only the method and the finish this was new to the minds of men and they pursued it to the neglect of everything else this they cried we must have in all our work henceforward and they were obeyed the lower workman secured method and finish and lost in exchange for them his soul  § xxi now therefore do not let me be misunderstood when i speak generally of the evil spirit of the renaissance the reader may look through all i have written from first to last and he will not find one word but of the most profound reverence for those mighty men who could wear the renaissance armor of proof and yet not feel it encumber their living limbs2leonardo and michael angelo ghirlandajo and masaccio titian and tintoret but i speak of the renaissance as an evil time because when it saw those men go burning forth into the battle it mistook their armor for their strength and forthwith encumbered with the painful panoply every stripling who ought to have gone forth only with his own choice of three smooth stones out of the brook  § xxii this then the reader must always keep in mind when he is examining for himself any examples of cinquecento work when it has been done by a truly great man whose life and strength could not be oppressed and who turned to good account the whole science of his day nothing is more exquisite i do not believe for instance that there is a more glorious work of sculpture existing in the world than that equestrian statue of bartolomeo colleone by verrocchio of which i hope before these pages are printed there will be a cast in england but when the cinquecento work has been done by those meaner men who in the gothic times though in a rough way would yet have found some means of speaking out what was in their hearts it is utterly inanimatea base and helpless copy of more accomplished models or if not this a mere accumulation of technical skill in gaining which the workman had surrendered all other powers that were in him  there is therefore of course an infinite gradation in the art of the period from the sistine chapel down to modern upholstery but for the most part since in architecture the workman must be of an inferior order it will be found that this cinquecento painting and higher religious sculpture is noble while the cinquecento architecture with its subordinate sculpture is universally bad sometimes however assuming forms in which the consummate refinement almost atones for the loss of force  § xxiii this is especially the case with that second branch of the renaissance which as above noticed was engrafted at venice on the byzantine types so soon as the classical enthusiasm required the banishment of gothic forms it was natural that the venetian mind should turn back with affection to the byzantine models in which the round arches and simple shafts necessitated by recent law were presented under a form consecrated by the usage of their ancestors and accordingly the first distinct school of architecture3 which arose under the new dynasty was one in which the method of inlaying marble and the general forms of shaft and arch were adopted from the buildings of the twelfth century and applied with the utmost possible refinements of modern skill both at verona and venice the resulting architecture is exceedingly beautiful at verona it is indeed less byzantine but possesses a character of richness and tenderness almost peculiar to that city at venice it is more severe but yet adorned with sculpture which for sharpness of touch and delicacy of minute form cannot be rivalled and rendered especially brilliant and beautiful by the introduction of those inlaid circles of colored marble serpentine and porphyry by which phillippe de commynes was so much struck on his first entrance into the city the two most refined buildings in this style in venice are the small church of the miracoli and the scuola di san marco beside the church of st john and st paul the noblest is the rio façade of the ducal palace the casa dario and casa manzoni on the grand canal are exquisite examples of the school as applied to domestic architecture and in the reach of the canal between the casa foscari and the rialto there are several palaces of which the casa contarini called delle figure is the principal belonging to the same group though somewhat later and remarkable for the association of the byzantine principles of color with the severest lines of the roman pediment gradually superseding the round arch the precision of chiselling and delicacy of proportion in the ornament and general lines of these palaces cannot be too highly praised and i believe that the traveller in venice in general gives them rather too little attention than too much but while i would ask him to stay his gondola beside each of them long enough to examine their every line i must also warn him to observe most carefully the peculiar feebleness and want of soul in the conception of their ornament which mark them as belonging to a period of decline as well as the absurd mode of introduction of their pieces of colored marble these instead of being simply and naturally inserted in the masonry are placed in small circular or oblong frames of sculpture like mirrors or pictures and are represented as suspended by ribands against the wall a pair of wings being generally fastened on to the circular tablets as if to relieve the ribands and knots from their weight and the whole series tied under the chin of a little cherub at the top who is nailed against the façade like a hawk on a barn door  but chiefly let him notice in the casa contarini delle figure one most strange incident seeming to have been permitted like the choice of the subjects at the three angles of the ducal palace in order to teach us by a single lesson the true nature of the style in which it occurs in the intervals of the windows of the first story certain shields and torches are attached in the form of trophies to the stems of two trees whose boughs have been cut off and only one or two of their faded leaves left scarcely observable but delicately sculptured here and there beneath the insertions of the severed boughs  it is as if the workman had intended to leave us an image of the expiring naturalism of the gothic school i had not seen this sculpture when i wrote the passage referring to its period in the first volume of this work chap xx § xxxiautumn camethe leaves were shedand the eye was directed to the extremities of the delicate branches the renaissance frosts came and all perished  § xxiv and the hues of this autumn of the early renaissance are the last which appear in architecture the winter which succeeded was colorless as it was cold and although the venetian painters struggled long against its influence the numbness of the architecture prevailed over them at last and the exteriors of all the latter palaces were built only in barren stone as at this point of our inquiry therefore we must bid farewell to color i have reserved for this place the continuation of the history of chromatic decoration from the byzantine period when we left it in the fifth chapter of the second volume down to its final close  § xxv it was above stated that the principal difference in general form and treatment between the byzantine and gothic palaces was the contraction of the marble facing into the narrow spaces between the windows leaving large fields of brick wall perfectly bare the reason for this appears to have been that the gothic builders were no longer satisfied with the faint and delicate hues of the veined marble they wished for some more forcible and piquant mode of decoration corresponding more completely with the gradually advancing splendor of chivalric costume and heraldic device what i have said above of the simple habits of life of the thirteenth century in no wise refers either to costumes of state or of military service and any illumination of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries the great period being it seems to me from 1250 to 1350 while it shows a peculiar majesty and simplicity in the fall of the robes often worn over the chain armor indicates at the same time an exquisite brilliancy of color and power of design in the hems and borders as well as in the armorial bearings with which they are charged and while as we have seen a peculiar simplicity is found also in the forms of the architecture corresponding to that of the folds of the robes its colors were constantly increasing in brilliancy and decision corresponding to those of the quartering of the shield and of the embroidery of the mantle  § xxvi whether indeed derived from the quarterings of the knights shields or from what other source i know not but there is one magnificent attribute of the coloring of the late twelfth the whole thirteenth and the early fourteenth century which i do not find definitely in any previous work nor afterwards in general art though constantly and necessarily in that of great colorists namely the union of one color with another by reciprocal interference that is to say if a mass of red is to be set beside a mass of blue a piece of the red will be carried into the blue and a piece of the blue carried into the red sometimes in nearly equal portions as in a shield divided into four quarters of which the uppermost on one side will be of the same color as the lowermost on the other sometimes in smaller fragments but in the periods above named always definitely and grandly though in a thousand various ways and i call it a magnificent principle for it is an eternal and universal one not in art only4 but in human life it is the great principle of brotherhood not by equality nor by likeness but by giving and receiving the souls that are unlike and the nations that are unlike and the natures that are unlike being bound into one noble whole by each receiving something from and of the others gifts and the others glory i have not space to follow out this thoughtit is of infinite extent and applicationbut i note it for the readers pursuit because i have long believed and the whole second volume of modern painters was written to prove that in whatever has been made by the deity externally delightful to the human sense of beauty there is some type of gods nature or of gods laws nor are any of his laws in one sense greater than the appointment that the most lovely and perfect unity shall be obtained by the taking of one nature into another i trespass upon too high ground and yet i cannot fully show the reader the extent of this law but by leading him thus far and it is just because it is so vast and so awful a law that it has rule over the smallest things and there is not a vein of color on the lightest leaf which the spring winds are at this moment unfolding in the fields around us but it is an illustration of an ordainment to which the earth and its creatures owe their continuance and their redemption  § xxvii it is perfectly inconceivable until it has been made a subject of special inquiry how perpetually nature employs this principle in the distribution of her light and shade how by the most extraordinary adaptations apparently accidental but always in exactly the right place she contrives to bring darkness into light and light into darkness and that so sharply and decisively that at the very instant when one object changes from light to dark the thing relieved upon it will change from dark to light and yet so subtly that the eye will not detect the transition till it looks for it the secret of a great part of the grandeur in all the noblest compositions is the doing of this delicately in degree and broadly in mass in color it may be done much more decisively than in light and shade and according to the simplicity of the work with greater frankness of confession until in purely decorative art as in the illumination glasspainting and heraldry of the great periods we find it reduced to segmental accuracy its greatest masters in high art are tintoret veronese and turner  § xxviii together with this great principle of quartering is introduced another also of very high value as far as regards the delight of the eye though not of so profound meaning as soon as color began to be used in broad and opposed fields it was perceived that the mass of it destroyed its brilliancy and it was tempered by chequering it with some other color or colors in smaller quantities mingled with minute portions of pure white the two moral principles of which this is the type are those of temperance and purity the one requiring the fulness of the color to be subdued and the other that it shall be subdued without losing either its own purity or that of the colors with which it is associated  § xxix hence arose the universal and admirable system of the diapered or chequered background of early ornamental art they are completely developed in the thirteenth century and extend through the whole of the fourteenth gradually yielding to landscape and other pictorial backgrounds as the designers lost perception of the purpose of their art and of the value of color the chromatic decoration of the gothic palaces of venice was of course founded on these two great principles which prevailed constantly wherever the true chivalric and gothic spirit possessed any influence the windows with their intermediate spaces of marble were considered as the objects to be relieved and variously quartered with vigorous color the whole space of the brick wall was considered as a background it was covered with stucco and painted in fresco with diaper patterns  § xxx what the reader asks in some surprisestucco and in the great gothic period even so but not stucco to imitate stone herein lies all the difference it is stucco confessed and understood and laid on the bricks precisely as gesso is laid on canvas in order to form them into a ground for receiving color from the human handcolor which if well laid on might render the brick wall more precious than if it had been built of emeralds whenever we wish to paint we may prepare our paper as we choose the value of the ground in no wise adds to the value of the picture a tintoret on beaten gold would be of no more value than a tintoret on coarse canvas the gold would merely be wasted all that we have to do is to make the ground as good and fit for the color as possible by whatever means  § xxxi i am not sure if i am right in applying the term stucco to the ground of fresco but this is of no consequence the reader will understand that it was white and that the whole wall of the palace was considered as the page of a book to be illuminated but he will understand also that the sea winds are bad librarians that when once the painted stucco began to fade or to fall the unsightliness of the defaced color would necessitate its immediate restoration and that therefore of all the chromatic decoration of the gothic palaces there is hardly a fragment left  happily in the pictures of gentile bellini the fresco coloring of the gothic palaces is recorded as it still remained in his time not with rigid accuracy but quite distinctly enough to enable us by comparing it with the existing colored designs in the manuscripts and glass of the period to ascertain precisely what it must have been  § xxxii the walls were generally covered with chequers of very warm color a russet inclining to scarlet more or less relieved with white black and grey as still seen in the only example which having been executed in marble has been perfectly preserved the front of the ducal palace this however owing to the nature of its materials was a peculiarly simple example the ground is white crossed with double bars of pale red and in the centre of each chequer there is a cross alternately black with a red centre and red with a black centre where the arms cross in painted work the grounds would be of course as varied and complicated as those of manuscripts but i only know of one example left on the casa sagredo where on some fragments of stucco a very early chequer background is traceable composed of crimson quatrefoils interlaced with cherubim stretching their wings filling the intervals a small portion of this ground is seen beside the window taken from the palace vol ii plate xiii fig 1  § xxxiii it ought to be especially noticed that in all chequered patterns employed in the colored designs of these noble periods the greatest care is taken to mark that they are grounds of design rather than designs themselves modern architects in such minor imitations as they are beginning to attempt endeavor to dispose the parts in the patterns so as to occupy certain symmetrical positions with respect to the parts of the architecture a gothic builder never does this he cuts his ground into pieces of the shape he requires with utter remorselessness and places his windows or doors upon it with no regard whatever to the lines in which they cut the pattern and in illuminations of manuscripts the chequer itself is constantly changed in the most subtle and arbitrary way wherever there is the least chance of its regularity attracting the eye and making it of importance so intentional is this that a diaper pattern is often set obliquely to the vertical lines of the designs for fear it should appear in any way connected with them  § xxxiv on these russet or crimson backgrounds the entire space of the series of windows was relieved for the most part as a subdued white field of alabaster and on this delicate and veined white were set the circular disks of purple and green the arms of the family were of course blazoned in their own proper colors but i think generally on a pure azure ground the blue color is still left behind the shields in the casa priuli and one or two more of the palaces which are unrestored and the blue ground was used also to relieve the sculptures of religious subject finally all the mouldings capitals cornices cusps and traceries were either entirely gilded or profusely touched with gold  the whole front of a gothic palace in venice may therefore be simply described as a field of subdued russet quartered with broad sculptured masses of white and gold these latter being relieved by smaller inlaid fragments of blue purple and deep green  § xxxv now from the beginning of the fourteenth century when painting and architecture were thus united two processes of change went on simultaneously to the beginning of the seventeenth the merely decorative chequerings on the walls yielded gradually to more elaborate paintings of figuresubject first small and quaint and then enlarging into enormous pictures filled by figures generally colossal as these paintings became of greater merit and importance the architecture with which they were associated was less studied and at last a style was introduced in which the framework of the building was little more interesting than that of a manchester factory but the whole space of its walls was covered with the most precious fresco paintings such edifices are of course no longer to be considered as forming an architectural school they were merely large preparations of artists panels and titian giorgione and veronese no more conferred merit on the later architecture of venice as such by painting on its façades than landseer or watts could confer merit on that of london by first whitewashing and then painting its brick streets from one end to the other  § xxxvi contemporarily with this change in the relative values of the color decoration and the stonework one equally important was taking place in the opposite direction but of course in another group of buildings for in proportion as the architect felt himself thrust aside or forgotten in one edifice he endeavored to make himself principal in another and in retaliation for the painters entire usurpation of certain fields of design succeeded in excluding him totally from those in which his own influence was predominant or more accurately speaking the architects began to be too proud to receive assistance from the colorists and these latter sought for ground which the architect had abandoned for the unrestrained display of their own skill and thus while one series of edifices is continually becoming feebler in design and richer in superimposed paintings another that of which we have so often spoken as the earliest or byzantine renaissance fragment by fragment rejects the pictorial decoration supplies its place first with marbles and then as the latter are felt by the architect daily increasing in arrogance and deepening in coldness to be too bright for his dignity he casts even these aside one by one and when the last porphyry circle has vanished from the façade we find two palaces standing side by side one built so far as mere masonry goes with consummate care and skill but without the slightest vestige of color in any part of it the other utterly without any claim to interest in its architectural form but covered from top to bottom with paintings by veronese at this period then we bid farewell to color leaving the painters to their own peculiar field and only regretting that they waste their noblest work on walls from which in a couple of centuries if not before the greater part of their labor must be effaced on the other hand the architecture whose decline we are tracing has now assumed an entirely new condition that of the central or true renaissance whose nature we are to examine in the next chapter  § xxxvii but before leaving these last palaces over which the byzantine influence extended itself there is one more lesson to be learned from them of much importance to us though in many respects debased in style they are consummate in workmanship and unstained in honor there is no imperfection in them and no dishonesty that there is absolutely no imperfection is indeed as we have seen above a proof of their being wanting in the highest qualities of architecture but as lessons in masonry they have their value and may well be studied for the excellence they display in methods of levelling stones for the precision of their inlaying and other such qualities which in them are indeed too principal yet very instructive in their particular way  § xxxviii for instance in the inlaid design of the dove with the olive branch from the casa trevisan vol i plate xx p 369 it is impossible for anything to go beyond the precision with which the olive leaves are cut out of the white marble and in some wreaths of laurel below the rippled edge of each leaf is as finely and easily drawn as if by a delicate pencil no florentine table is more exquisitely finished than the façade of this entire palace and as ideals of an executive perfection which though we must not turn aside from our main path to reach it may yet with much advantage be kept in our sight and memory these palaces are most notable amidst the architecture of europe the rio façade of the ducal palace though very sparing in color is yet as an example of finished masonry in a vast building one of the finest things not only in venice but in the world it differs from other work of the byzantine renaissance in being on a very large scale and it still retains one pure gothic character which adds not a little to its nobleness that of perpetual variety there is hardly one window of it or one panel that is like another and this continual change so increases its apparent size by confusing the eye that though presenting no bold features or striking masses of any kind there are few things in italy more impressive than the vision of it overhead as the gondola glides from beneath the bridge of sighs and lastly unless we are to blame these buildings for some pieces of very childish perspective they are magnificently honest as well as perfect i do not remember even any gilding upon them all is pure marble and of the finest kind5  and therefore in finally leaving the ducal palace6 let us take with us one more lesson the last which we shall receive from the stones of venice except in the form of a warning  § xxxix the school of architecture which we have just been examining is as we have seen above redeemed from severe condemnation by its careful and noble use of inlaid marbles as a means of color from that time forward this art has been unknown or despised the frescoes of the swift and daring venetian painters long contended with the inlaid marbles outvying them with color indeed more glorious than theirs but fugitive as the hues of woods in autumn and at last as the art itself of painting in this mighty manner failed from among men7 the modern decorative system established itself which united the meaninglessness of the veined marble with the evanescence of the fresco and completed the harmony by falsehood  § xl since first in the second chapter of the seven lamps i endeavored to show the culpableness as well as the baseness of our common modes of decoration by painted imitation of various woods or marbles the subject has been discussed in various architectural works and is evidently becoming one of daily increasing interest when it is considered how many persons there are whose means of livelihood consist altogether in these spurious arts and how difficult it is even for the most candid to admit a conviction contrary both to their interests and to their inveterate habits of practice and thought it is rather a matter of wonder that the cause of truth should have found even a few maintainers than that it should have encountered a host of adversaries it has however been defended repeatedly by architects themselves and so successfully that i believe so far as the desirableness of this or that method of ornamentation is to be measured by the fact of its simple honesty or dishonesty there is little need to add anything to what has been already urged upon the subject but there are some points connected with the practice of imitating marble which i have been unable to touch upon until now and by the consideration of which we may be enabled to see something of the policy of honesty in this matter without in the least abandoning the higher ground of principle  § xli consider then first what marble seems to have been made for over the greater part of the surface of the world we find that a rock has been providentially distributed in a manner particularly pointing it out as intended for the service of man not altogether a common rock it is yet rare enough to command a certain degree of interest and attention wherever it is found but not so rare as to preclude its use for any purpose to which it is fitted it is exactly of the consistence which is best adapted for sculpture that is to say neither hard nor brittle nor flaky nor splintery but uniform and delicately yet not ignobly softexactly soft enough to allow the sculptor to work it without force and trace on it the finest lines of finished form and yet so hard as never to betray the touch or moulder away beneath the steel and so admirably crystallized and of such permanent elements that no rains dissolve it no time changes it no atmosphere decomposes it once shaped it is shaped for ever unless subjected to actual violence or attrition this rock then is prepared by nature for the sculptor and architect just as paper is prepared by the manufacturer for the artist with as greatnay with greatercare and more perfect adaptation of the material to the requirements and of this marble paper some is white and some colored but more is colored than white because the white is evidently meant for sculpture and the colored for the covering of large surfaces  § xlii now if we would take nature at her word and use this precious paper which she has taken so much care to provide for us it is a long process the making of that paper the pulp of it needing the subtlest possible solution and the pressing of itfor it is all hotpressedhaving to be done under the saw or under something at least as heavy if i say we use it as nature would have us consider what advantages would follow the colors of marble are mingled for us just as if on a prepared palette they are of all shades and hues except bad ones some being united and even some broken mixed and interrupted in order to supply as far as possible the want of the painters power of breaking and mingling the color with the brush but there is more in the colors than this delicacy of adaptation there is history in them by the manner in which they are arranged in every piece of marble they record the means by which that marble has been produced and the successive changes through which it has passed and in all their veins and zones and flamelike stainings or broken and disconnected lines they write various legends never untrue of the former political state of the mountain kingdom to which they belonged of its infirmities and fortitudes convulsions and consolidations from the beginning of time  now if we were never in the habit of seeing anything but real marbles this language of theirs would soon begin to be understood that is to say even the least observant of us would recognize such and such stones as forming a peculiar class and would begin to inquire where they came from and at last take some feeble interest in the main question why they were only to be found in that or the other place and how they came to make a part of this mountain and not of that and in a little while it would not be possible to stand for a moment at a shop door leaning against the pillars of it without remembering or questioning of something well worth the memory or the inquiry touching the hills of italy or greece or africa or spain and we should be led on from knowledge to knowledge until even the unsculptured walls of our streets became to us volumes as precious as those of our libraries  § xliii but the moment we admit imitation of marble this source of knowledge is destroyed none of us can be at the pains to go through the work of verification if we knew that every colored stone we saw was natural certain questions conclusions interests would force themselves upon us without any effort of our own but we have none of us time to stop in the midst of our daily business to touch and pore over and decide with painful minuteness of investigation whether such and such a pillar be stucco or stone and the whole field of this knowledge which nature intended us to possess when we were children is hopelessly shut out from us worse than shut out for the mass of coarse imitations confuses our knowledge acquired from other sources and our memory of the marbles we have perhaps once or twice carefully examined is disturbed and distorted by the inaccuracy of the imitations which are brought before us continually  § xliv but it will be said that it is too expensive to employ real marbles in ordinary cases it may be so yet not always more expensive than the fitting windows with enormous plate glass and decorating them with elaborate stucco mouldings and other useless sources of expenditure in modern building nay not always in the end more expensive than the frequent repainting of the dingy pillars which a little water dashed against them would refresh from day to day if they were of true stone but granting that it be so in that very costliness checking their common use in certain localities is part of the interest of marbles considered as history where they are not found nature has supplied other materialsclay for brick or forest for timberin the working of which she intends other characters of the human mind to be developed and by the proper use of which certain local advantages will assuredly be attained while the delightfulness and meaning of the precious marbles will be felt more forcibly in the districts where they occur or on the occasions when they may be procured  § xlv it can hardly be necessary to add that as the imitation of marbles interferes with and checks the knowledge of geography and geology so the imitation of wood interferes with that of botany and that our acquaintance with the nature uses and manner of growth of the timber trees of our own and of foreign countries would probably in the majority of cases become accurate and extensive without any labor or sacrifice of time were not all inquiry checked and all observation betrayed by the wretched labors of the grainer  § xlvi but this is not all as the practice of imitation retards knowledge so also it retards art  there is not a meaner occupation for the human mind than the imitation of the stains and striæ of marble and wood when engaged in any easy and simple mechanical occupation there is still some liberty for the mind to leave the literal work and the clash of the loom or the activity of the fingers will not always prevent the thoughts from some happy expatiation in their own domains but the grainer must think of what he is doing and veritable attention and care and occasionally considerable skill are consumed in the doing of a more absolute nothing than i can name in any other department of painful idleness i know not anything so humiliating as to see a human being with arms and limbs complete and apparently a head and assuredly a soul yet into the hands of which when you have put a brush and pallet it cannot do anything with them but imitate a piece of wood it cannot color it has no ideas of color it cannot draw it has no ideas of form it cannot caricature it has no ideas of humor it is incapable of anything beyond knots all its achievement the entire result of the daily application of its imagination and immortality is to be such a piece of texture as the sun and dew are sucking up out of the muddy ground and weaving together far more finely in millions of millions of growing branches over every rood of waste woodland and shady hill  § xlvii but what is to be done the reader asks with men who are capable of nothing else than this nay they may be capable of everything else for all we know and what we are to do with them i will try to say in the next chapter but meanwhile one word more touching the higher principles of action in this matter from which we have descended to those of expediency i trust that some day the language of types will be more read and understood by us than it has been for centuries and when this language a better one than either greek or latin is again recognized amongst us we shall find or remember that as the other visible elements of the universeits air its water and its flameset forth in their pure energies the lifegiving purifying and sanctifying influences of the deity upon his creatures so the earth in its purity sets forth his eternity and his truth i have dwelt above on the historical language of stones let us not forget this which is their theological language and as we would not wantonly pollute the fresh waters when they issue forth in their clear glory from the rock nor stay the mountain winds into pestilential stagnancy nor mock the sunbeams with artificial and ineffective light so let us not by our own base and barren falsehoods replace the crystalline strength and burning color of the earth from which we were born and to which we must return the earth which like our own bodies though dust in its degradation is full of splendor when gods hand gathers its atoms and which was for ever sanctified by him as the symbol no less of his love than of his truth when he bade the high priest bear the names of the children of israel on the clear stones of the breastplate of judgment   footnotes    1 there is a curious instance of this in the modern imitations of     the gothic capitals of the casa d oro employed in its     restorations the old capitals look like clusters of leaves the     modern ones like kneaded masses of dough with holes in them    2 not that even these men were able to wear it altogether without     harm as we shall see in the next chapter    3 appendix 4 date of palaces of byzantine renaissance    4 in the various works which mr prout has written on light and     shade no principle will be found insisted on more strongly than     this carrying of the dark into the light and vice versa it is     curious to find the untaught instinct of a merely picturesque artist     in the nineteenth century fixing itself so intensely on a principle     which regulated the entire sacred composition of the thirteenth i     say untaught instinct for mr prout was throughout his life the     discoverer of his own principles fortunately so considering what     principles were taught in his time but unfortunately in the     abstract for there were gifts in him which had there been any     wholesome influences to cherish them might have made him one of the     greatest men of his age he was great under all adverse     circumstances but the mere wreck of what he might have been if     after the rough training noticed in my pamphlet on preraphaelitism     as having fitted him for his great function in the world he had met     with a teacher who could have appreciated his powers and directed     them    5 there may however be a kind of dishonesty even in the use of     marble if it is attempted to make the marble look like something     else see the final or venetian index under head scalzi    6 appendix 5 renaissance side of ducal palace    7 we have as far as i know at present among us only one     painter g f watts who is capable of design in color on a large     scale he stands alone among our artists of the old school in his     perception of the value of breadth in distant masses and in the     vigor of invention by which such breadth must be sustained and his     power of expression and depth of thought are not less remarkable     than his bold conception of color effect very probably some of the     preraphaelites have the gift also i am nearly certain that rosetti     has it and i think also millais but the experiment has yet to be     tried i wish it could be made in mr hopes church in margaret     street     chapter ii  roman renaissance   § i of all the buildings in venice later in date than the final additions to the ducal palace the noblest is beyond all question that which having been condemned by its proprietor not many years ago to be pulled down and sold for the value of its materials was rescued by the austrian government and appropriatedthe government officers having no other use for itto the business of the postoffice though still known to the gondolier by its ancient name the casa grimani it is composed of three stories of the corinthian order at once simple delicate and sublime but on so colossal a scale that the threestoried palaces on its right and left only reach to the cornice which marks the level of its first floor yet it is not at first perceived to be so vast and it is only when some expedient is employed to hide it from the eye that by the sudden dwarfing of the whole reach of the grand canal which it commands we become aware that it is to the majesty of the casa grimani that the rialto itself and the whole group of neighboring buildings owe the greater part of their impressiveness nor is the finish of its details less notable than the grandeur of their scale there is not an erring line nor a mistaken proportion throughout its noble front and the exceeding fineness of the chiselling gives an appearance of lightness to the vast blocks of stone out of whose perfect union that front is composed the decoration is sparing but delicate the first story only simpler than the rest in that it has pilasters instead of shafts but all with corinthian capitals rich in leafage and fruited delicately the rest of the walls flat and smooth and the mouldings sharp and shallow so that the bold shafts look like crystals of beryl running through a rock of quartz  § ii this palace is the principal type at venice and one of the best in europe of the central architecture of the renaissance schools that carefully studied and perfectly executed architecture to which those schools owe their principal claims to our respect and which became the model of most of the important works subsequently produced by civilized nations i have called it the roman renaissance because it is founded both in its principles of superimposition and in the style of its ornament upon the architecture of classic rome at its best period the revival of latin literature both led to its adoption and directed its form and the most important example of it which exists is the modern roman basilica of st peters it had at its renaissance or new birth no resemblance either to greek gothic or byzantine forms except in retaining the use of the round arch vault and dome in the treatment of all details it was exclusively latin the last links of connexion with mediæval tradition having been broken by its builders in their enthusiasm for classical art and the forms of true greek or athenian architecture being still unknown to them the study of these noble greek forms has induced various modifications of the renaissance in our own times but the conditions which are found most applicable to the uses of modern life are still roman and the entire style may most fitly be expressed by the term roman renaissance  § iii it is this style in its purity and fullest formrepresented by such buildings as the casa grimani at venice built by san micheli the town hall at vicenza by palladio st peters at rome by michael angelo st pauls and whitehall in london by wren and inigo joneswhich is the true antagonist of the gothic school the intermediate or corrupt conditions of it though multiplied over europe are no longer admired by architects or made the subjects of their study but the finished work of this central school is still in most cases the model set before the student of the nineteenth century as opposed to those gothic romanesque or byzantine forms which have long been considered barbarous and are so still by most of the leading men of the day that they are on the contrary most noble and beautiful and that the antagonistic renaissance is in the main unworthy and unadmirable whatever perfection of a certain kind it may possess it was my principal purpose to show when i first undertook the labor of this work it has been attempted already to put before the reader the various elements which unite in the nature of gothic and to enable him thus to judge not merely of the beauty of the forms which that system has produced already but of its future applicability to the wants of mankind and endless power over their hearts i would now endeavor in like manner to set before the reader the nature of renaissance and thus to enable him to compare the two styles under the same light and with the same enlarged view of their relations to the intellect and capacities for the service of man  § iv it will not be necessary for me to enter at length into any examination of its external form it uses whether for its roofs of aperture or roofs proper the low gable or circular arch but it differs from romanesque work in attaching great importance to the horizontal lintel or architrave above the arch transferring the energy of the principal shafts to the supporting of this horizontal beam and thus rendering the arch a subordinate if not altogether a superfluous feature the type of this arrangement has been given already at c fig xxxvi p 145 vol i and i might insist at length upon the absurdity of a construction in which the shorter shaft which has the real weight of wall to carry is split into two by the taller one which has nothing to carry at allthat taller one being strengthened nevertheless as if the whole weight of the building bore upon it and on the ungracefulness never conquered in any palladian work of the two halfcapitals glued as it were against the slippery round sides of the central shaft but it is not the form of this architecture against which i would plead its defects are shared by many of the noblest forms of earlier building and might have been entirely atoned for by excellence of spirit but it is the moral nature of it which is corrupt and which it must therefore be our principal business to examine and expose  § v the moral or immoral elements which unite to form the spirit of central renaissance architecture are i believe in the main twopride and infidelity but the pride resolves itself into three main branchespride of science pride of state and pride of system and thus we have four separate mental conditions which must be examined successively  § vi 1 pride of science it would have been more charitable but more confusing to have added another element to our list namely the love of science but the love is included in the pride and is usually so very subordinate an element that it does not deserve equality of nomenclature but whether pursued in pride or in affection how far by either we shall see presently the first notable characteristic of the renaissance central school is its introduction of accurate knowledge into all its work so far as it possesses such knowledge and its evident conviction that such science is necessary to the excellence of the work and is the first thing to be expressed therein so that all the forms introduced even in its minor ornament are studied with the utmost care the anatomy of all animal structure is thoroughly understood and elaborately expressed and the whole of the execution skilful and practised in the highest degree perspective linear and aerial perfect drawing and accurate light and shade in painting and true anatomy in all representations of the human form drawn or sculptured are the first requirements in all the work of this school  § vii now first considering all this in the most charitable light as pursued from a real love of truth and not from vanity it would of course have been all excellent and admirable had it been regarded as the aid of art and not as its essence but the grand mistake of the renaissance schools lay in supposing that science and art are the same things and that to advance in the one was necessarily to perfect the other whereas they are in reality things not only different but so opposed that to advance in the one is in ninetynine cases out of the hundred to retrograde in the other this is the point to which i would at present especially bespeak the readers attention  § viii science and art are commonly distinguished by the nature of their actions the one as knowing the other as changing producing or creating but there is a still more important distinction in the nature of the things they deal with science deals exclusively with things as they are in themselves and art exclusively with things as they affect the human senses and human soul8 her work is to portray the appearance of things and to deepen the natural impressions which they produce upon living creatures the work of science is to substitute facts for appearances and demonstrations for impressions both observe are equally concerned with truth the one with truth of aspect the other with truth of essence art does not represent things falsely but truly as they appear to mankind science studies the relations of things to each other but art studies only their relations to man and it requires of everything which is submitted to it imperatively this and only thiswhat that thing is to the human eyes and human heart what it has to say to men and what it can become to them a field of question just as much vaster than that of science as the soul is larger than the material creation  § ix take a single instance science informs us that the sun is ninetyfive millions of miles distant from and 111 times broader than the earth that we and all the planets revolve round it and that it revolves on its own axis in 25 days 14 hours and 4 minutes with all this art has nothing whatsoever to do it has no care to know anything of this kind but the things which it does care to know are these that in the heavens god hath set a tabernacle for the sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof  § x this then being the kind of truth with which art is exclusively concerned how is such truth as this to be ascertained and accumulated evidently and only by perception and feeling never either by reasoning or report nothing must come between nature and the artists sight nothing between god and the artists soul neither calculation nor hearsaybe it the most subtle of calculations or the wisest of sayingsmay be allowed to come between the universe and the witness which art bears to its visible nature the whole value of that witness depends on its being eyewitness the whole genuineness acceptableness and dominion of it depend on the personal assurance of the man who utters it all its victory depends on the veracity of the one preceding word vidi  the whole function of the artist in the world is to be a seeing and feeling creature to be an instrument of such tenderness and sensitiveness that no shadow no hue no line no instantaneous and evanescent expression of the visible things around him nor any of the emotions which they are capable of conveying to the spirit which has been given him shall either be left unrecorded or fade from the book of record it is not his business either to think to judge to argue or to know his place is neither in the closet nor on the bench nor at the bar nor in the library they are for other men and other work he may think in a byway reason now and then when he has nothing better to do know such fragments of knowledge as he can gather without stooping or reach without pains but none of these things are to be his care the work of his life is to be twofold only to see to feel  § xi nay but the reader perhaps pleads with me one of the great uses of knowledge is to open the eyes to make things perceivable which never would have been seen unless first they had been known  not so this could only be said or believed by those who do not know what the perceptive faculty of a great artist is in comparison with that of other men there is no great painter no great workman in any art but he sees more with the glance of a moment than he could learn by the labor of a thousand hours god has made every man fit for his work he has given to the man whom he means for a student the reflective logical sequential faculties and to the man whom he means for an artist the perceptive sensitive retentive faculties and neither of these men so far from being able to do the others work can even comprehend the way in which it is done the student has no understanding of the vision nor the painter of the process but chiefly the student has no idea of the colossal grasp of the true painters vision and sensibility  the labor of the whole geological society for the last fifty years has but now arrived at the ascertainment of those truths respecting mountain form which turner saw and expressed with a few strokes of a camels hair pencil fifty years ago when he was a boy the knowledge of all the laws of the planetary system and of all the curves of the motion of projectiles would never enable the man of science to draw a waterfall or a wave and all the members of surgeons hall helping each other could not at this moment see or represent the natural movement of a human body in vigorous action as a poor dyers son did two hundred years ago9  § xii but surely it is still insisted granting this peculiar faculty to the painter he will still see more as he knows more and the more knowledge he obtains therefore the better no not even so it is indeed true that here and there a piece of knowledge will enable the eye to detect a truth which might otherwise have escaped it as for instance in watching a sunrise the knowledge of the true nature of the orb may lead the painter to feel more profoundly and express more fully the distance between the bars of cloud that cross it and the sphere of flame that lifts itself slowly beyond them into the infinite heaven but for one visible truth to which knowledge thus opens the eyes it seals them to a thousand that is to say if the knowledge occur to the mind so as to occupy its powers of contemplation at the moment when the sight work is to be done the mind retires inward fixes itself upon the known fact and forgets the passing visible ones and a moment of such forgetfulness loses more to the painter than a days thought can gain this is no new or strange assertion every person accustomed to careful reflection of any kind knows that its natural operation is to close his eyes to the external world while he is thinking deeply he neither sees nor feels even though naturally he may possess strong powers of sight and emotion he who having journeyed all day beside the leman lake asked of his companions at evening where it was10 probably was not wanting in sensibility but he was generally a thinker not a perceiver and this instance is only an extreme one of the effect which in all cases knowledge becoming a subject of reflection produces upon the sensitive faculties it must be but poor and lifeless knowledge if it has no tendency to force itself forward and become ground for reflection in despite of the succession of external objects it will not obey their succession the first that comes gives it food enough for its days work it is its habit its duty to cast the rest aside and fasten upon that the first thing that a thinking and knowing man sees in the course of the day he will not easily quit it is not his way to quit anything without getting to the bottom of it if possible but the artist is bound to receive all things on the broad white lucid field of his soul not to grasp at one for instance as the knowing and thinking man watches the sunrise he sees something in the color of a ray or the change of a cloud that is new to him and this he follows out forthwith into a labyrinth of optical and pneumatical laws perceiving no more clouds nor rays all the morning but the painter must catch all the rays all the colors that come and see them all truly all in their real relations and succession therefore everything that occupies room in his mind he must cast aside for the time as completely as may be the thoughtful man is gone far away to seek but the perceiving man must sit still and open his heart to receive the thoughtful man is knitting and sharpening himself into a twoedged sword wherewith to pierce the perceiving man is stretching himself into a fourcornered sheet wherewith to catch and all the breadth to which he can expand himself and all the white emptiness into which he can blanch himself will not be enough to receive what god has to give him  § xiii what then it will be indignantly asked is an utterly ignorant and unthinking man likely to make the best artist no not so neither knowledge is good for him so long as he can keep it utterly servilely subordinate to his own divine work and trample it under his feet and out of his way the moment it is likely to entangle him  and in this respect observe there is an enormous difference between knowledge and education an artist need not be a learned man in all probability it will be a disadvantage to him to become so but he ought if possible always to be an educated man that is one who has understanding of his own uses and duties in the world and therefore of the general nature of the things done and existing in the world and who has so trained himself or been trained as to turn to the best and most courteous account whatever faculties or knowledge he has the mind of an educated man is greater than the knowledge it possesses it is like the vault of heaven encompassing the earth which lives and flourishes beneath it but the mind of an educated and learned man is like a caoutchouc band with an everlasting spirit of contraction in it fastening together papers which it cannot open and keeps others from opening  half our artists are ruined for want of education and by the possession of knowledge the best that i have known have been educated and illiterate the ideal of an artist however is not that he should be illiterate but well read in the best books and thoroughly high bred both in heart and in bearing in a word he should be fit for the best society and should keep out of it11  § xiv there are indeed some kinds of knowledge with which an artist ought to be thoroughly furnished those for instance which enable him to express himself for this knowledge relieves instead of encumbering his mind and permits it to attend to its purposes instead of wearying itself about means the whole mystery of manipulation and manufacture should be familiar to the painter from a child he should know the chemistry of all colors and materials whatsoever and should prepare all his colors himself in a little laboratory of his own limiting his chemistry to this one object the amount of practical science necessary for it and such accidental discoveries as might fall in his way in the course of his work of better colors or better methods of preparing them would be an infinite refreshment to his mind a minor subject of interest to which it might turn when jaded with comfortless labor or exhausted with feverish invention and yet which would never interfere with its higher functions when it chose to address itself to them even a considerable amount of manual labor sturdy colorgrinding and canvasstretching would be advantageous though this kind of work ought to be in great part done by pupils for it is one of the conditions of perfect knowledge in these matters that every great master should have a certain number of pupils to whom he is to impart all the knowledge of materials and means which he himself possesses as soon as possible so that at any rate by the time they are fifteen years old they may know all that he knows himself in this kind that is to say all that the world of artists know and his own discoveries besides and so never be troubled about methods any more not that the knowledge even of his own particular methods is to be of purpose confined to himself and his pupils but that necessarily it must be so in some degree for only those who see him at work daily can understand his small and multitudinous ways of practice these cannot verbally be explained to everybody nor is it needful that they should only let them be concealed from nobody who cares to see them in which case of course his attendant scholars will know them best but all that can be made public in matters of this kind should be so with all speed every artist throwing his discovery into the common stock and the whole body of artists taking such pains in this department of science as that there shall be no unsettled questions about any known material or method that it shall be an entirely ascertained and indisputable matter which is the best white and which the best brown which the strongest canvas and safest varnish and which the shortest and most perfect way of doing everything known up to that time and if any one discovers a better he is to make it public forthwith all of them taking care to embarrass themselves with no theories or reasons for anything but to work empirically only it not being in any wise their business to know whether light moves in rays or in waves or whether the blue rays of the spectrum move slower or faster than the rest but simply to know how many minutes and seconds such and such a powder must be calcined to give the brightest blue  § xv now it is perhaps the most exquisite absurdity of the whole renaissance system that while it has encumbered the artist with every species of knowledge that is of no use to him this one precious and necessary knowledge it has utterly lost there is not i believe at this moment a single question which could be put respecting pigments and methods on which the body of living artists would agree in their answers the lives of artists are passed in fruitless experiments fruitless because undirected by experience and uncommunicated in their results every man has methods of his own which he knows to be insufficient and yet jealously conceals from his fellowworkmen every colorman has materials of his own to which it is rare that the artist can trust and in the very front of the majestic advance of chemical science the empirical science of the artist has been annihilated and the days which should have led us to higher perfection are passed in guessing at or in mourning over lost processes while the socalled dark ages possessing no more knowledge of chemistry than a village herbalist does now discovered established and put into daily practice such methods of operation as have made their work at this day the despair of all who look upon it  § xvi and yet even this to the painter the safest of sciences and in some degree necessary has its temptations and capabilities of abuse for the simplest means are always enough for a great man and when once he has obtained a few ordinary colors which he is sure will stand and a white surface that will not darken nor moulder nor rend he is master of the world and of his fellowmen and indeed as if in these times we were bent on furnishing examples of every species of opposite error while we have suffered the traditions to escape us of the simple methods of doing simple things which are enough for all the arts and to all the ages we have set ourselves to discover fantastic modes of doing fantastic thingsnew mixtures and manipulations of metal and porcelain and leather and paper and every conceivable condition of false substance and cheap work to our own infinitely multiplied confusionblinding ourselves daily more and more to the great changeless and inevitable truth that there is but one goodness in art and that is one which the chemist cannot prepare nor the merchant cheapen for it comes only of a rare human hand and rare human soul  § xvii within its due limits however here is one branch of science which the artist may pursue and within limits still more strict another also namely the science of the appearances of things as they have been ascertained and registered by his fellowmen for no day passes but some visible fact is pointed out to us by others which without their help we should not have noticed and the accumulation and generalization of visible facts have formed in the succession of ages the sciences of light and shade and perspective linear and aerial so that the artist is now at once put in possession of certain truths respecting the appearances of things which so pointed out to him any man may in a few days understand and acknowledge but which without aid he could not probably discover in his lifetime i say probably could not because the time which the history of art shows us to have been actually occupied in the discovery and systematization of such truth is no measure of the time necessary for such discovery the lengthened period which elapsed between the earliest and the perfect developement of the science of light if i may so call it was not occupied in the actual effort to ascertain its laws but in acquiring the disposition to make that effort it did not take five centuries to find out the appearance of natural objects but it took five centuries to make people care about representing them an artist of the twelfth century did not desire to represent nature his work was symbolical and ornamental so long as it was intelligible and lovely he had no care to make it like nature as for instance when an old painter represented the glory round a saints head by a burnished plate of pure gold he had no intention of imitating an effect of light he meant to tell the spectator that the figure so decorated was a saint and to produce splendor of effect by the golden circle it was no matter to him what light was like so soon as it entered into his intention to represent the appearance of light he was not long in discovering the natural facts necessary for his purpose  § xviii but this being fully allowed it is still true that the accumulation of facts now known respecting visible phenomena is greater than any man could hope to gather for himself and that it is well for him to be made acquainted with them provided always that he receive them only at their true value and do not suffer himself to be misled by them i say at their true value that is an exceedingly small one all the information which men can receive from the accumulated experience of others is of no use but to enable them more quickly and accurately to see for themselves it will in no wise take the place of this personal sight nothing can be done well in art except by vision scientific principles and experiences are helps to the eye as a microscope is and they are of exactly as much use without the eye no science of perspective or of anything else will enable us to draw the simplest natural line accurately unless we see it and feel it science is soon at her wits end all the professors of perspective in europe could not by perspective draw the line of curve of a sea beach nay could not outline one pool of the quiet water left among the sand the eye and hand can do it nothing else all the rules of aerial perspective that ever were written will not tell me how sharply the pines on the hilltop are drawn at this moment on the sky i shall know if i see them and love them not till then i may study the laws of atmospheric gradation for fourscore years and ten and i shall not be able to draw so much as a brickkiln through its own smoke unless i look at it and that in an entirely humble and unscientific manner ready to see all that the smoke my master is ready to show me and expecting to see nothing more  § xix so that all the knowledge a man has must be held cheap and neither trusted nor respected the moment he comes face to face with nature if it help him well if not but on the contrary thrust itself upon him in an impertinent and contradictory temper and venture to set itself in the slightest degree in opposition to or comparison with his sight let it be disgraced forthwith and the slave is less likely to take too much upon herself if she has not been bought for a high price all the knowledge an artist needs will in these days come to him almost without his seeking if he has far to look for it he may be sure he does not want it prout became prout without knowing a single rule of perspective to the end of his days and all the perspective in the encyclopædia will never produce us another prout  § xx and observe also knowledge is not only very often unnecessary but it is often untrustworthy it is inaccurate and betrays us where the eye would have been true to us let us take the single instance of the knowledge of aerial perspective of which the moderns are so proud and see how it betrays us in various ways first by the conceit of it which often prevents our enjoying work in which higher and better things were thought of than effects of mist the other day i showed a line impression of albert durers st hubert to a modern engraver who had never seen it nor any other of albert durers works he looked at it for a minute contemptuously then turned away ah i see that man did not know much about aerial perspective all the glorious work and thought of the mighty master all the redundant landscape the living vegetation the magnificent truth of line were dead letters to him because he happened to have been taught one particular piece of knowledge which durer despised  § xxi but not only in the conceit of it but in the inaccuracy of it this science betrays us aerial perspective as given by the modern artist is in nine cases out of ten a gross and ridiculous exaggeration as is demonstrable in a moment the effect of air in altering the hue and depth of color is of course great in the exact proportion of the volume of air between the observer and the object it is not violent within the first few yards and then diminished gradually but it is equal for each foot of interposing air now in a clear day and clear climate such as that generally presupposed in a work of fine color objects are completely visible at a distance of ten miles visible in light and shade with gradations between the two take then the faintest possible hue of shadow or of any color and the most violent and positive possible and set them side by side the interval between them is greater than the real difference for objects may often be seen clearly much farther than ten miles i have seen mont blanc at 120 caused by the ten miles of intervening air between any given hue of the nearest and most distant objects but let us assume it in courtesy to the masters of aerial perspective to be the real difference then roughly estimating a mile at less than it really is also in courtesy to them or at 5000 feet we have this difference between tints produced by 50000 feet of air then ten feet of air will produce the 5000th part of this difference let the reader take the two extreme tints and carefully gradate the one into the other let him divide this gradated shadow or color into 5000 successive parts and the difference in depth between one of these parts and the next is the exact amount of aerial perspective between one object and another ten feet behind it on a clear day  § xxii now in millais huguenot the figures were standing about three feet from the wall behind them and the wise world of critics which could find no other fault with the picture professed to have its eyes hurt by the want of an aerial perspective which had it been accurately given as indeed i believe it was would have amounted to the 1035000th or less than the 15000th part of the depth of any given color it would be interesting to see a picture painted by the critics upon this scientific principle the aerial perspective usually represented is entirely conventional and ridiculous a mere struggle on the part of the pretendedly wellinformed but really ignorant artist to express distances by mist which he cannot by drawing  it is curious that the critical world is just as much offended by the true presence of aerial perspective over distances of fifty miles and with definite purpose of representing mist in the works of turner as by the true absence of aerial perspective over distances of three feet and in clear weather in those of millais  § xxiii well but still answers the reader this kind of error may here and there be occasioned by too much respect for undigested knowledge but on the whole the gain is greater than the loss and the fact is that a picture of the renaissance period or by a modern master does indeed represent nature more faithfully than one wrought in the ignorance of old times no not one whit for the most part less faithfully indeed the outside of nature is more truly drawn the material commonplace which can be systematized catalogued and taught to all painstaking mankindforms of ribs and scapulæ12 of eyebrows and lips and curls of hair whatever can be measured and handled dissected and demonstratedin a word whatever is of the body onlythat the schools of knowledge do resolutely and courageously possess themselves of and portray but whatever is immeasurable intangible indivisible and of the spirit that the schools of knowledge do as certainly lose and blot out of their sight that is to say all that is worth arts possessing or recording at all for whatever can be arrested measured and systematized we can contemplate as much as we will in nature herself but what we want art to do for us is to stay what is fleeting and to enlighten what is incomprehensible to incorporate the things that have no measure and immortalize the things that have no duration the dimly seen momentary glance the flitting shadow of faint emotion the imperfect lines of fading thought and all that by and through such things as these is recorded on the features of man and all that in mans person and actions and in the great natural world is infinite and wonderful having in it that spirit and power which man may witness but not weigh conceive but not comprehend love but not limit and imagine but not definethis the beginning and the end of the aim of all noble art we have in the ancient art by perception and we have not in the newer art by knowledge giotto gives it us orcagna gives it us angelico memmi pisano it matters not whoall simple and unlearned men in their measure and mannergive it us and the learned men that followed them give it us not and we in our supreme learning own ourselves at this day farther from it than ever  § xxiv nay but it is still answered this is because we have not yet brought our knowledge into right use but have been seeking to accumulate it rather than to apply it wisely to the ends of art let us now do this and we may achieve all that was done by that elder ignorant art and infinitely more no not so for as soon as we try to put our knowledge to good use we shall find that we have much more than we can use and that what more we have is an encumbrance all our errors in this respect arise from a gross misconception as to the true nature of knowledge itself we talk of learned and ignorant men as if there were a certain quantity of knowledge which to possess was to be learned and which not to possess was to be ignorant instead of considering that knowledge is infinite and that the man most learned in human estimation is just as far from knowing anything as he ought to know it as the unlettered peasant men are merely on a lower or higher stage of an eminence whose summit is gods throne infinitely above all and there is just as much reason for the wisest as for the simplest man being discontented with his position as respects the real quantity of knowledge he possesses and for both of them the only true reasons for contentment with the sum of knowledge they possess are these that it is the kind of knowledge they need for their duty and happiness in life that all they have is tested and certain so far as it is in their power that all they have is well in order and within reach when they need it that it has not cost too much time in the getting that none of it once got has been lost and that there is not too much to be easily taken care of  § xxv consider these requirements a little and the evils that result in our education and polity from neglecting them knowledge is mental food and is exactly to the spirit what food is to the body except that the spirit needs several sorts of food of which knowledge is only one and it is liable to the same kind of misuses it may be mixed and disguised by art till it becomes unwholesome it may be refined sweetened and made palatable until it has lost all its power of nourishment and even of its best kind it may be eaten to surfeiting and minister to disease and death  § xxvi therefore with respect to knowledge we are to reason and act exactly as with respect to food we no more live to know than we live to eat we live to contemplate enjoy act adore and we may know all that is to be known in this world and what satan knows in the other without being able to do any of these we are to ask therefore first is the knowledge we would have fit food for us good and simple not artificial and decorated and secondly how much of it will enable us best for our work and will leave our hearts light and our eyes clear for no more than that is to be eaten without the old evesin  § xxvii observe also the difference between tasting knowledge and hoarding it in this respect it is also like food since in some measure the knowledge of all men is laid up in granaries for future use much of it is at any given moment dormant not fed upon or enjoyed but in store and by all it is to be remembered that knowledge in this form may be kept without air till it rots or in such unthreshed disorder that it is of no use and that however good or orderly it is still only in being tasted that it becomes of use and that men may easily starve in their own granaries men of science perhaps most of all for they are likely to seek accumulation of their store rather than nourishment from it yet let it not be thought that i would undervalue them the good and great among them are like joseph to whom all nations sought to buy corn or like the sower going forth to sow beside all waters sending forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass only let us remember that this is not all mens work we are not intended to be all keepers of granaries nor all to be measured by the filling of a storehouse but many nay most of us are to receive day by day our daily bread and shall be as well nourished and as fit for our labor and often also fit for nobler and more divine labor in feeding from the barrel of meal that does not waste and from the cruse of oil that does not fail than if our barns were filled with plenty and our presses bursting out with new wine  § xxviii it is for each man to find his own measure in this matter in great part also for others to find it for him while he is yet a youth and the desperate evil of the whole renaissance system is that all idea of measure is therein forgotten that knowledge is thought the one and the only good and it is never inquired whether men are vivified by it or paralyzed let us leave figures the reader may not believe the analogy i have been pressing so far but let him consider the subject in itself let him examine the effect of knowledge in his own heart and see whether the trees of knowledge and of life are one now any more than in paradise he must feel that the real animating power of knowledge is only in the moment of its being first received when it fills us with wonder and joy a joy for which observe the previous ignorance is just as necessary as the present knowledge that man is always happy who is in the presence of something which he cannot know to the full which he is always going on to know this is the necessary condition of a finite creature with divinely rooted and divinely directed intelligence this therefore its happy statebut observe a state not of triumph or joy in what it knows but of joy rather in the continual discovery of new ignorance continual selfabasement continual astonishment once thoroughly our own the knowledge ceases to give us pleasure it may be practically useful to us it may be good for others or good for usury to obtain more but in itself once let it be thoroughly familiar and it is dead the wonder is gone from it and all the fine color which it had when first we drew it up out of the infinite sea and what does it matter how much or how little of it we have laid aside when our only enjoyment is still in the casting of that deep sea line what does it matter nay in one respect it matters much and not to our advantage for one effect of knowledge is to deaden the force of the imagination and the original energy of the whole man under the weight of his knowledge he cannot move so lightly as in the days of his simplicity the packhorse is furnished for the journey the warhorse is armed for war but the freedom of the field and the lightness of the limb are lost for both knowledge is at best the pilgrims burden or the soldiers panoply often a weariness to them both and the renaissance knowledge is like the renaissance armor of plate binding and cramping the human form while all good knowledge is like the crusaders chain mail which throws itself into folds with the body yet it is rarely so forged as that the clasps and rivets do not gall us all men feel this though they do not think of it nor reason out its consequences they look back to the days of childhood as of greatest happiness because those were the days of greatest wonder greatest simplicity and most vigorous imagination and the whole difference between a man of genius and other men it has been said a thousand times and most truly is that the first remains in great part a child seeing with the large eyes of children in perpetual wonder not conscious of much knowledgeconscious rather of infinite ignorance and yet infinite power a fountain of eternal admiration delight and creative force within him meeting the ocean of visible and governable things around him  that is what we have to make men so far as we may all are to be men of genius in their degreerivulets or rivers it does not matter so that the souls be clear and pure not dead walls encompassing dead heaps of things known and numbered but running waters in the sweet wilderness of things unnumbered and unknown conscious only of the living banks on which they partly refresh and partly reflect the flowers and so pass on  § xxix let each man answer for himself how far his knowledge has made him this or how far it is loaded upon him as the pyramid is upon the tomb let him consider also how much of it has cost him labor and time that might have been spent in healthy happy action beneficial to all mankind how many living souls may have been left uncomforted and unhelped by him while his own eyes were failing by the midnight lamp how many warm sympathies have died within him as he measured lines or counted letters how many draughts of ocean air and steps on mountainturf and openings of the highest heaven he has lost for his knowledge how much of that knowledge so dearly bought is now forgotten or despised leaving only the capacity of wonder less within him and as it happens in a thousand instances perhaps even also the capacity of devotion and let himif after thus dealing with his own heart he can say that his knowledge has indeed been fruitful to himyet consider how many there are who have been forced by the inevitable laws of modern education into toil utterly repugnant to their natures and that in the extreme until the whole strength of the young soul was sapped away and then pronounce with fearfulness how far and in how many senses it may indeed be true that the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god  § xxx now all this possibility of evil observe attaches to knowledge pursued for the noblest ends if it be pursued imprudently i have assumed in speaking of its effect both on men generally and on the artist especially that it was sought in the true love of it and with all honesty and directness of purpose but this is granting far too much in its favor of knowledge in general and without qualification it is said by the apostle that it puffeth up and the father of all modern science writing directly in its praise yet asserts this danger even in more absolute terms calling it a venomousness in the very nature of knowledge itself  § xxxi there is indeed much difference in this respect between the tendencies of different branches of knowledge it being a sure rule that exactly in proportion as they are inferior nugatory or limited in scope their power of feeding pride is greater thus philology logic rhetoric and the other sciences of the schools being for the most part ridiculous and trifling have so pestilent an effect upon those who are devoted to them that their students cannot conceive of any higher sciences than these but fancy that all education ends in the knowledge of words but the true and great sciences more especially natural history make men gentle and modest in proportion to the largeness of their apprehension and just perception of the infiniteness of the things they can never know and this it seems to me is the principal lesson we are intended to be caught by the book of job for there god has thrown open to us the heart of a man most just and holy and apparently perfect in all things possible to human nature except humility for this he is tried and we are shown that no suffering no selfexamination however honest however stern no searching out of the heart by its own bitterness is enough to convince man of his nothingness before god but that the sight of gods creation will do it for when the deity himself has willed to end the temptation and to accomplish in job that for which it was sent he does not vouchsafe to reason with him still less does he overwhelm him with terror or confound him by laying open before his eyes the book of his iniquities he opens before him only the arch of the dayspring and the fountains of the deep and amidst the covert of the reeds and on the heaving waves he bids him watch the kings of the children of pridebehold now behemoth which i made with thee and the work is done  § xxxii thus if i repeat there is any one lesson in the whole book which stands forth more definitely than another it is this of the holy and humbling influence of natural science on the human heart and yet even here it is not the science but the perception to which the good is owing and the natural sciences may become as harmful as any others when they lose themselves in classification and cataloguemaking still the principal danger is with the sciences of words and methods and it was exactly into those sciences that the whole energy of men during the renaissance period was thrown they discovered suddenly that the world for ten centuries had been living in an ungrammatical manner and they made it forthwith the end of human existence to be grammatical and it mattered thenceforth nothing what was said or what was done so only that it was said with scholarship and done with system falsehood in a ciceronian dialect had no opposers truth in patois no listeners a roman phrase was thought worth any number of gothic facts the sciences ceased at once to be anything more than different kinds of grammarsgrammar of language grammar of logic grammar of ethics grammar of art and the tongue wit and invention of the human race were supposed to have found their utmost and most divine mission in syntax and syllogism perspective and five orders  of such knowledge as this nothing but pride could come and therefore i have called the first mental characteristic of the renaissance schools the pride of science if they had reached any science worth the name they might have loved it but of the paltry knowledge they possessed they could only be proud there was not anything in it capable of being loved anatomy indeed then first made a subject of accurate study is a true science but not so attractive as to enlist the affections strongly on its side and therefore like its meaner sisters it became merely a ground for pride and the one main purpose of the renaissance artists in all their work was to show how much they knew  § xxxiii there were of course noble exceptions but chiefly belonging to the earliest periods of the renaissance when its teaching had not yet produced its full effect raphael leonardo and michael angelo were all trained in the old school they all had masters who knew the true ends of art and had reached them masters nearly as great as they were themselves but imbued with the old religious and earnest spirit which their disciples receiving from them and drinking at the same time deeply from all the fountains of knowledge opened in their day became the worlds wonders then the dull wondering world believed that their greatness rose out of their new knowledge instead of out of that ancient religious root in which to abide was life from which to be severed was annihilation and from that day to this they have tried to produce michael angelos and leonardos by teaching the barren sciences and still have mourned and marvelled that no more michael angelos came not perceiving that those great fathers were only able to receive such nourishment because they were rooted on the rock of all ages and that our scientific teaching nowadays is nothing more nor less than the assiduous watering of trees whose stems are cut through nay i have even granted too much in saying that those great men were able to receive pure nourishment from the sciences for my own conviction is and i know it to be shared by most of those who love raphael trulythat he painted best when he knew least michael angelo was betrayed again and again into such vain and offensive exhibition of his anatomical knowledge as to this day renders his higher powers indiscernible by the greater part of men and leonardo fretted his life away in engineering so that there is hardly a picture left to bear his name but with respect to all who followed there can be no question that the science they possessed was utterly harmful serving merely to draw away their hearts at once from the purposes of art and the power of nature and to make out of the canvas and marble nothing more than materials for the exhibition of petty dexterity and useless knowledge  § xxxiv it is sometimes amusing to watch the naïve and childish way in which this vanity is shown for instance when perspective was first invented the world thought it a mighty discovery and the greatest men it had in it were as proud of knowing that retiring lines converge as if all the wisdom of solomon had been compressed into a vanishing point and accordingly it became nearly impossible for any one to paint a nativity but he must turn the stable and manger into a corinthian arcade in order to show his knowledge of perspective and half the best architecture of the time instead of being adorned with historical sculpture as of old was set forth with basrelief of minor corridors and galleries thrown into perspective  now that perspective can be taught to any schoolboy in a week we can smile at this vanity but the fact is that all pride in knowledge is precisely as ridiculous whatever its kind or whatever its degree there is indeed nothing of which man has any right to be proud but the very last thing of which with any show of reason he can make his boast is his knowledge except only that infinitely small portion of it which he has discovered for himself for what is there to be more proud of in receiving a piece of knowledge from another person than in receiving a piece of money beggars should not be proud whatever kind of alms they receive knowledge is like current coin a man may have some right to be proud of possessing it if he has worked for the gold of it and assayed it and stamped it so that it may be received of all men as true or earned it fairly being already assayed but if he has done none of these things but only had it thrown in his face by a passerby what cause has he to be proud and though in this mendicant fashion he had heaped together the wealth of croesus would pride any more for this become him as in some sort it becomes the man who has labored for his fortune however small so if a man tells me the sun is larger than the earth have i any cause for pride in knowing it or if any multitude of men tell me any number of things heaping all their wealth of knowledge upon me have i any reason to be proud under the heap and is not nearly all the knowledge of which we boast in these days cast upon us in this dishonorable way worked for by other men proved by them and then forced upon us even against our wills and beaten into us in our youth before we have the wit even to know if it be good or not mark the distinction between knowledge and thought truly a noble possession to be proud of be assured there is no part of the furniture of a mans mind which he has a right to exult in but that which he has hewn and fashioned for himself he who has built himself a hut on a desert heath and carved his bed and table and chair out of the nearest forest may have some right to take pride in the appliances of his narrow chamber as assuredly he will have joy in them but the man who has had a palace built and adorned and furnished for him may indeed have many advantages above the other but he has no reason to be proud of his upholsterers skill and it is ten to one if he has half the joy in his couches of ivory that the other will have in his pallet of pine  § xxxv and observe how we feel this in the kind of respect we pay to such knowledge as we are indeed capable of estimating the value of when it is our own and new to us we cannot judge of it but let it be anothers also and long familiar to us and see what value we set on it consider how we regard a schoolboy fresh from his terms labor if he begin to display his newly acquired small knowledge to us and plume himself thereupon how soon do we silence him with contempt but it is not so if the schoolboy begins to feel or see anything in the strivings of his soul within him he is our equal in his power of sight and thought he stands separate from us and may be a greater than we we are ready to hear him forthwith you saw that you felt that no matter for your being a child let us hear  § xxxvi consider that every generation of men stands in this relation to its successors it is as the schoolboy the knowledge of which it is proudest will be as the alphabet to those who follow it had better make no noise about its knowledge a time will come when its utmost in that kind will be food for scorn poor fools was that all they knew and behold how proud they were but what we see and feel will never be mocked at all men will be thankful to us for telling them that indeed they will say they felt that in their day saw that would god we may be like them before we go to the home where sight and thought are not  this unhappy and childish pride in knowledge then was the first constituent element of the renaissance mind and it was enough of itself to have cast it into swift decline but it was aided by another form of pride which was above called the pride of state and which we have next to examine  § xxxvii ii pride of state it was noticed in the second volume of modern painters p 122 that the principle which had most power in retarding the modern school of portraiture was its constant expression of individual vanity and pride and the reader cannot fail to have observed that one of the readiest and commonest ways in which the painter ministers to this vanity is by introducing the pedestal or shaft of a column or some fragment however simple of renaissance architecture in the background of the portrait and this is not merely because such architecture is bolder or grander than in general that of the apartments of a private house no other architecture would produce the same effect in the same degree the richest gothic the most massive norman would not produce the same sense of exaltation as the simple and meagre lines of the renaissance  § xxxviii and if we think over this matter a little we shall soon feel that in those meagre lines there is indeed an expression of aristocracy in its worst characters coldness perfectness of training incapability of emotion want of sympathy with the weakness of lower men blank hopeless haughty selfsufficiency all these characters are written in the renaissance architecture as plainly as if they were graven on it in words for observe all other architectures have something in them that common men can enjoy some concession to the simplicities of humanity some daily bread for the hunger of the multitude quaint fancy rich ornament bright color something that shows a sympathy with men of ordinary minds and hearts and this wrought out at least in the gothic with a rudeness showing that the workman did not mind exposing his own ignorance if he could please others but the renaissance is exactly the contrary of all this it is rigid cold inhuman incapable of glowing of stooping of conceding for an instant whatever excellence it has is refined hightrained and deeply erudite a kind which the architect well knows no common mind can taste he proclaims it to us aloud you cannot feel my work unless you study vitruvius i will give you no gay color no pleasant sculpture nothing to make you happy for i am a learned man all the pleasure you can have in anything i do is in its proud breeding its rigid formalism its perfect finish its cold tranquillity i do not work for the vulgar only for the men of the academy and the court  § xxxix and the instinct of the world felt this in a moment in the new precision and accurate law of the classical forms they perceived something peculiarly adapted to the setting forth of state in an appalling manner princes delighted in it and courtiers the gothic was good for gods worship but this was good for mans worship the gothic had fellowship with all hearts and was universal like nature it could frame a temple for the prayer of nations or shrink into the poor mans winding stair but here was an architecture that would not shrink that had in it no submission no mercy the proud princes and lords rejoiced in it it was full of insult to the poor in its every line it would not be built of the materials at the poor mans hand it would not roof itself with thatch or shingle and black oak beams it would not wall itself with rough stone or brick it would not pierce itself with small windows where they were needed it would not niche itself wherever there was room for it in the street corners it would be of hewn stone it would have its windows and its doors and its stairs and its pillars in lordly order and of stately size it would have its wings and its corridors and its halls and its gardens as if all the earth were its own and the rugged cottages of the mountaineers and the fantastic streets of the laboring burgher were to be thrust out of its way as of a lower species  § xl it is to be noted also that it ministered as much to luxury as to pride not to luxury of the eye that is a holy luxury nature ministers to that in her painted meadows and sculptured forests and gilded heavens the gothic builder ministered to that in his twisted traceries and deepwrought foliage and burning casements the dead renaissance drew back into its earthliness out of all that was warm and heavenly back into its pride out of all that was simple and kind back into its stateliness out of all that was impulsive reverent and gay but it understood the luxury of the body the terraced and scented and grottoed garden with its trickling fountains and slumbrous shades the spacious hall and lengthened corridor for the summer heat the wellclosed windows and perfect fittings and furniture for defence against the cold and the soft picture and frescoed wall and roof covered with the last lasciviousness of paganismthis is understood and possessed to the full and still possesses this is the kind of domestic architecture on which we pride ourselves even to this day as an infinite and honorable advance from the rough habits of our ancestors from the time when the kings floor was strewn with rushes and the tapestries swayed before the searching wind in the barons hall  § xli let us hear two stories of those rougher times  at the debate of king edwin with his courtiers and priests whether he ought to receive the gospel preached to him by paulinus one of his nobles spoke as follows  the present life o king weighed with the time that is unknown seems to me like this when you are sitting at a feast with your earls and thanes in winter time and the fire is lighted and the hall is warmed and it rains and snows and the storm is loud without there comes a sparrow and flies through the house it comes in at one door and goes out at the other while it is within it is not touched by the winters storm but it is but for the twinkling of an eye for from winter it comes and to winter it returns so also this life of man endureth for a little space what goes before or what follows after we know not wherefore if this new lore bring anything more certain it is fit that we should follow it13  that could not have happened in a renaissance building the bird could not have dashed in from the cold into the heat and from the heat back again into the storm it would have had to come up a flight of marble stairs and through seven or eight antechambers and so if it had ever made its way into the presence chamber out again through loggias and corridors innumerable and the truth which the bird brought with it fresh from heaven has in like manner to make its way to the renaissance mind through many antechambers hardly and as a despised thing if at all  § xlii hear another story of those early times  the king of jerusalem godfrey of bouillon at the siege of asshur or arsur gave audience to some emirs from samaria and naplous they found him seated on the ground on a sack of straw they expressing surprise godfrey answered them may not the earth out of which we came and which is to be our dwelling after death serve us for a seat during life  it is long since such a throne has been set in the reception chambers of christendom or such an answer heard from the lips of a king  thus the renaissance spirit became base both in its abstinence and its indulgence base in its abstinence curtailing the bright and playful wealth of form and thought which filled the architecture of the earlier ages with sources of delight for their hardy spirit pure simple and yet rich as the fretwork of flowers and moss watered by some strong and stainless mountain stream and base in its indulgence as it granted to the body what it withdrew from the heart and exhausted in smoothing the pavement for the painless feet and softening the pillow for the sluggish brain the powers of art which once had hewn rough ladders into the clouds of heaven and set up the stones by which they rested for houses of god  § xliii and just in proportion as this courtly sensuality lowered the real nobleness of the men whom birth or fortune raised above their fellows rose their estimate of their own dignity together with the insolence and unkindness of its expression and the grossness of the flattery with which it was fed pride is indeed the first and the last among the sins of men and there is no age of the world in which it has not been unveiled in the power and prosperity of the wicked but there was never in any form of slavery or of feudal supremacy a forgetfulness so total of the common majesty of the human soul and of the brotherly kindness due from man to man as in the aristocratic follies in the renaissance i have not space to follow out this most interesting and extensive subject but here is a single and very curious example of the kind of flattery with which architectural teaching was mingled when addressed to the men of rank of the day  § xliv in st marks library there is a very curious latin manuscript of the twentyfive books of averulinus a florentine architect upon the principles of his art the book was written in or about 1460 and translated into latin and richly illuminated for corvinus king of hungary about 1483 i extract from the third book the following passage on the nature of stones as there are three genera of menthat is to say nobles men of the middle classes and rusticsso it appears that there are of stones for the marbles and common stones of which we have spoken above set forth the rustics the porphyries and alabasters and the other harder stones of mingled quality represent the middle classes if we are to deal in comparisons and by means of these the ancients adorned their temples with incrustations and ornaments in a magnificent manner and after these come the chalcedonies and sardonyxes c which are so transparent that there can be seen no spot in them14 thus men endowed with nobility lead a life in which no spot can be found  canute or coeur de lion i name not godfrey or st louis would have dashed their sceptres against the lips of a man who should have dared to utter to them flattery such as this but in the fifteenth century it was rendered and accepted as a matter of course and the tempers which delighted in it necessarily took pleasure also in every vulgar or false means of taking worldly superiority and among such false means largeness of scale in the dwellinghouse was of course one of the easiest and most direct all persons however senseless or dull could appreciate size it required some exertion of intelligence to enter into the spirit of the quaint carving of the gothic times but none to perceive that one heap of stones was higher than another15 and therefore while in the execution and manner of work the renaissance builders zealously vindicated for themselves the attribute of cold and superior learning they appealed for such approbation as they needed from the multitude to the lowest possible standard of taste and while the older workman lavished his labor on the minute niche and narrow casement on the doorways no higher than the head and the contracted angles of the turreted chamber the renaissance builder spared such cost and toil in his detail that he might spend it in bringing larger stones from a distance and restricted himself to rustication and five orders that he might load the ground with colossal piers and raise an ambitious barrenness of architecture as inanimate as it was gigantic above the feasts and follies of the powerful or the rich the titanic insanity extended itself also into ecclesiastical design the principal church in italy was built with little idea of any other admirableness than that which was to result from its being huge and the religious impressions of those who enter it are to this day supposed to be dependent in a great degree on their discovering that they cannot span the thumbs of the statues which sustain the vessels for holy water  § xlv it is easy to understand how an architecture which thus appealed not less to the lowest instincts of dulness than to the subtlest pride of learning rapidly found acceptance with a large body of mankind and how the spacious pomp of the new manner of design came to be eagerly adopted by the luxurious aristocracies not only of venice but of the other countries of christendom now gradually gathering themselves into that insolent and festering isolation against which the cry of the poor sounded hourly in more ominous unison bursting at last into thunder mark wherefirst among the planted walks and plashing fountains of the palace wherein the renaissance luxury attained its utmost height in europe versailles that cry mingling so much piteousness with its wrath and indignation our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of the wealthy and with the despitefulness of the proud  § xlvi but of all the evidence bearing upon this subject presented by the various arts of the fifteenth century none is so interesting or so conclusive as that deduced from its tombs for exactly in proportion as the pride of life became more insolent the fear of death became more servile and the difference in the manner in which the men of early and later days adorned the sepulchre confesses a still greater difference in their manner of regarding death to those he came as the comforter and the friend rest in his right hand hope in his left to these as the humiliator the spoiler and the avenger and therefore we find the early tombs at once simple and lovely in adornment severe and solemn in their expression confessing the power and accepting the peace of death openly and joyfully and in all their symbols marking that the hope of resurrection lay only in christs righteousness signed always with this simple utterance of the dead i will lay me down in peace and take my rest for it is thou lord only that makest me dwell in safety but the tombs of the later ages are a ghastly struggle of mean pride and miserable terror the one mustering the statues of the virtues about the tomb disguising the sarcophagus with delicate sculpture polishing the false periods of the elaborate epitaph and filling with strained animation the features of the portrait statue and the other summoning underneath out of the niche or from behind the curtain the frowning skull or scythed skeleton or some other more terrible image of the enemy in whose defiance the whiteness of the sepulchre had been set to shine above the whiteness of the ashes  § xlvii this change in the feeling with which sepulchral monuments were designed from the eleventh to the eighteenth centuries has been common to the whole of europe but as venice is in other respects the centre of the renaissance system so also she exhibits this change in the manner of the sepulchral monument under circumstances peculiarly calculated to teach us its true character for the severe guard which in earlier times she put upon every tendency to personal pomp and ambition renders the tombs of her ancient monarchs as remarkable for modesty and simplicity as for their religious feeling so that in this respect they are separated by a considerable interval from the more costly monuments erected at the same periods to the kings or nobles of other european states in later times on the other hand as the piety of the venetians diminished their pride overleaped all limits and the tombs which in recent epochs were erected for men who had lived only to impoverish or disgrace the state were as much more magnificent than those contemporaneously erected for the nobles of europe as the monuments for the great doges had been humbler when in addition to this we reflect that the art of sculpture considered as expressive of emotion was at a low ebb in venice in the twelfth century and that in the seventeenth she took the lead in italy in luxurious work we shall at once see the chain of examples through which the change of feeling is expressed must present more remarkable extremes here than it can in any other city extremes so startling that their impressiveness cannot be diminished while their intelligibility is greatly increased by the large number of intermediate types which have fortunately been preserved  it would however too much weary the general reader if without illustrations i were to endeavor to lead him step by step through the aisles of st john and paul and i shall therefore confine myself to a slight notice of those features in sepulchral architecture generally which are especially illustrative of the matter at present in hand and point out the order in which if possible the traveller should visit the tombs in venice so as to be most deeply impressed with the true character of the lessons they convey  § xlviii i have not such an acquaintance with the modes of entombment or memorial in the earliest ages of christianity as would justify me in making any general statement respecting them but it seems to me that the perfect type of a christian tomb was not developed until toward the thirteenth century sooner or later according to the civilization of each country that perfect type consisting in the raised and perfectly visible sarcophagus of stone bearing upon it a recumbent figure and the whole covered by a canopy before that type was entirely developed and in the more ordinary tombs contemporary with it we find the simple sarcophagus often with only a rough block of stone for its lid sometimes with a lowgabled lid like a cottage roof derived from egyptian forms and bearing either on the sides or the lid at least a sculpture of the cross and sometimes the name of the deceased and date of erection of the tomb in more elaborate examples rich figuresculpture is gradually introduced and in the perfect period the sarcophagus even when it does not bear any recumbent figure has generally a rich sculpture on its sides representing an angel presenting the dead in person and dress as he lived to christ or to the madonna with lateral figures sometimes of saints sometimesas in the tombs of the dukes of burgundy at dijonof mourners but in venice almost always representing the annunciation the angel being placed at one angle of the sarcophagus and the madonna at the other the canopy in a very simple foursquare form or as an arch over a recess is added above the sarcophagus long before the lifesize recumbent figure appears resting upon it by the time that the sculptors had acquired skill enough to give much expression to this figure the canopy attains an exquisite symmetry and richness and in the most elaborate examples is surmounted by a statue generally small representing the dead person in the full strength and pride of life while the recumbent figure shows him as he lay in death and at this point the perfect type of the gothic tomb is reached  § xlix of the simple sarcophagus tomb there are many exquisite examples both at venice and verona the most interesting in venice are those which are set in the recesses of the rude brick front of the church of st john and paul ornamented only for the most part with two crosses set in circles and the legend with the name of the dead and an orate pro anima in another circle in the centre and in this we may note one great proof of superiority in italian over english tombs the latter being often enriched with quatrefoils small shafts and arches and other ordinary architectural decorations which destroy their seriousness and solemnity render them little more than ornamental and have no religious meaning whatever while the italian sarcophagi are kept massive smooth and gloomyheavylidded dungeons of stone like rocktombsbut bearing on their surface sculptured with tender and narrow lines the emblem of the cross not presumptuously nor proudly but dimly graven upon their granite like the hope which the human heart holds but hardly perceives in its heaviness  § l among the tombs in front of the church of st john and paul there is one which is peculiarly illustrative of the simplicity of these earlier ages it is on the left of the entrance a massy sarcophagus with low horns as of an altar placed in a rude recess of the outside wall shattered and worn and here and there entangled among wild grass and weeds yet it is the tomb of two doges jacopo and lorenzo tiepolo by one of whom nearly the whole ground was given for the erection of the noble church in front of which his unprotected tomb is wasting away the sarcophagus bears an inscription in the centre describing the acts of the doges of which the letters show that it was added a considerable period after the erection of the tomb the original legend is still left in other letters on its base to this effect    lord james died 1251 lord laurence died 1288  at the two corners of the sarcophagus are two angels bearing censers and on its lid two birds with crosses like crests upon their heads for the sake of the traveller in venice the reader will i think pardon me the momentary irrelevancy of telling the meaning of these symbols  § li the foundation of the church of st john and paul was laid by the dominicans about 1234 under the immediate protection of the senate and the doge giacomo tiepolo accorded to them in consequence of a miraculous vision appearing to the doge of which the following account is given in popular tradition  in the year 1226 the doge giacomo tiepolo dreamed a dream and in his dream he saw the little oratory of the dominicans and behold the ground all around it now occupied by the church was covered with roses of the color of vermilion and the air was filled with their fragrance and in the midst of the roses there were seen flying to and fro a crowd of white doves with golden crosses upon their heads and while the doge looked and wondered behold two angels descended from heaven with golden censers and passing through the oratory and forth among the flowers they filled the place with the smoke of their incense then the doge heard suddenly a clear and loud voice which proclaimed this is the place that i have chosen for my preachers and having heard it straightway he awoke and went to the senate and declared to them the vision then the senate decreed that forty paces of ground should be given to enlarge the monastery and the doge tiepolo himself made a still larger grant afterwards  there is nothing miraculous in the occurrence of such a dream as this to the devout doge and the fact of which there is no doubt that the greater part of the land on which the church stands was given by him is partly a confirmation of the story but whether the sculptures on the tomb were records of the vision or the vision a monkish invention from the sculptures on the tomb the reader will not i believe look upon its doves and crosses or rudely carved angels any more with disdain knowing how in one way or another they were connected with a point of deep religious belief  § lii towards the beginning of the fourteenth century in venice the recumbent figure begins to appear on the sarcophagus the first dated example being also one of the most beautiful the statue of the prophet simeon sculptured upon the tomb which was to receive his relics in the church dedicated to him under the name of san simeone grande so soon as the figure appears the sarcophagus becomes much more richly sculptured but always with definite religious purpose it is usually divided into two panels which are filled with small basreliefs of the acts or martyrdom of the patron saints of the deceased between them in the centre christ or the virgin and child are richly enthroned under a curtained canopy and the two figures representing the annunciation are almost always at the angles the promise of the birth of christ being taken as at once the ground and the type of the promise of eternal life to all men  § liii these figures are always in venice most rudely chiselled the progress of figure sculpture being there comparatively tardy at verona where the great pisan school had strong influence the monumental sculpture is immeasurably finer and so early as about the year 133516 the consummate form of the gothic tomb occurs in the monument of can grande della scala at verona it is set over the portal of the chapel anciently belonging to the family the sarcophagus is sculptured with shallow basreliefs representing which is rare in the tombs with which i am acquainted in italy unless they are those of saints the principal achievements of the warriors life especially the siege of vicenza and battle of placenza these sculptures however form little more than a chased and roughened groundwork for the fully relieved statues representing the annunciation projecting boldly from the front of the sarcophagus above the lord of verona is laid in his long robe of civil dignity wearing the simple bonnet consisting merely of a fillet bound round the brow knotted and falling on the shoulder he is laid as asleep his arms crossed upon his body and his sword by his side above him a bold arched canopy is sustained by two projecting shafts and on the pinnacle of its roof is the statue of the knight on his warhorse his helmet dragonwinged and crested with the dogs head tossed back behind his shoulders and the broad and blazoned drapery floating back from his horses breastso truly drawn by the old workman from the life that it seems to wave in the wind and the knights spear to shake and his marble horse to be evermore quickening its pace and starting into heavier and hastier charge as the silver clouds float past behind it in the sky  § liv now observe in this tomb as much concession is made to the pride of man as may ever consist with honor discretion or dignity i do not enter into any question respecting the character of can grande though there can be little doubt that he was one of the best among the nobles of his time but that is not to our purpose it is not the question whether his wars were just or his greatness honorably achieved but whether supposing them to have been so these facts are well and gracefully told upon his tomb and i believe there can be no hesitation in the admission of its perfect feeling and truth though beautiful the tomb is so little conspicuous or intrusive that it serves only to decorate the portal of the little chapel and is hardly regarded by the traveller as he enters when it is examined the history of the acts of the dead is found subdued into dim and minute ornament upon his coffin and the principal aim of the monument is to direct the thoughts to his image as he lies in death and to the expression of his hope of resurrection while seen as by the memory far away diminished in the brightness of the sky there is set the likeness of his armed youth stately as it stood of old in the front of battle and meet to be thus recorded for us that we may now be able to remember the dignity of the frame of which those who once looked upon it hardly remembered that it was dust  § lv this i repeat is as much as may ever be granted but this ought always to be granted to the honor and the affection of men the tomb which stands beside that of can grande nearest it in the little field of sleep already shows the traces of erring ambition it is the tomb of mastino the second in whose reign began the decline of his family it is altogether exquisite as a work of art and the evidence of a less wise or noble feeling in its design is found only in this that the image of a virtue fortitude as belonging to the dead is placed on the extremity of the sarcophagus opposite to the crucifixion but for this slight circumstance of which the significance will only be appreciated as we examine the series of later monuments the composition of this monument of can mastino would have been as perfect as its decoration is refined it consists like that of can grande of the raised sarcophagus bearing the recumbent statue protected by a noble foursquare canopy sculptured with ancient scripture history on one side of the sarcophagus is christ enthroned with can mastino kneeling before him on the other christ is represented in the mystical form halfrising from the tomb meant i believe to be at once typical of his passion and resurrection the lateral panels are occupied by statues of saints at one extremity of the sarcophagus is the crucifixion at the other a noble statue of fortitude with a lions skin thrown over her shoulders its head forming a shield upon her breast her flowing hair bound with a narrow fillet and a threeedged sword in her gauntleted right hand drawn back sternly behind her thigh while in her left she bears high the shield of the scalas  § lvi close to this monument is another the stateliest and most sumptuous of the three it first arrests the eye of the stranger and long detains ita manypinnacled pile surrounded by niches with statues of the warrior saints  it is beautiful for it still belongs to the noble time the latter part of the fourteenth century but its work is coarser than that of the other and its pride may well prepare us to learn that it was built for himself in his own lifetime by the man whose statue crowns it can signorio della scala now observe for this is infinitely significant can mastino ii was feeble and wicked and began the ruin of his house his sarcophagus is the first which bears upon it the image of a virtue but he lays claim only to fortitude can signorio was twice a fratricide the last time when he lay upon his deathbed his tomb bears upon its gables the images of six virtuesfaith hope charity prudence and i believe justice and fortitude  § lvii let us now return to venice where in the second chapel counting from right to left at the west end of the church of the frari there is a very early fourteenth or perhaps late thirteenth century tomb another exquisite example of the perfect gothic form it is a knights but there is no inscription upon it and his name is unknown it consists of a sarcophagus supported on bold brackets against the chapel wall bearing the recumbent figure protected by a simple canopy in the form of a pointed arch pinnacled by the knights crest beneath which the shadowy space is painted dark blue and strewn with stars the statue itself is rudely carved but its lines as seen from the intended distance are both tender and masterly the knight is laid in his mail only the hands and face being bare the hauberk and helmet are of chainmail the armor for the limbs of jointed steel a tunic fitting close to the breast and marking the noble swell of it by two narrow embroidered lines is worn over the mail his dagger is at his right side his long crossbelted sword not seen by the spectator from below at his left his feet rest on a hound the hound being his crest which looks up towards its master in general in tombs of this kind the face of the statue is slightly turned towards the spectator in this monument on the contrary it is turned away from him towards the depth of the arch for there just above the warriors breast is carved a small image of st joseph bearing the infant christ who looks down upon the resting figure and to this image its countenance is turned the appearance of the entire tomb is as if the warrior had seen the vision of christ in his dying moments and had fallen back peacefully upon his pillow with his eyes still turned to it and his hands clasped in prayer  § lviii on the opposite side of this chapel is another very lovely tomb to duccio degli alberti a florentine ambassador at venice noticeable chiefly as being the first in venice on which any images of the virtues appear we shall return to it presently but some account must first be given of the more important among the other tombs in venice belonging to the perfect period of these by far the most interesting though not the most elaborate is that of the great doge francesco dandolo whose ashes it might have been thought were honorable enough to have been permitted to rest undisturbed in the chapterhouse of the frari where they were first laid but as if there were not room enough nor waste houses enough in the desolate city to receive a few convent papers the monks wanting an archivio have separated the tomb into three pieces the canopy a simple arch sustained on brackets still remains on the blank walls of the desecrated chamber the sarcophagus has been transported to a kind of museum of antiquities established in what was once the cloister of santa maria della salute and the painting which filled the lunette behind it is hung far out of sight at one end of the sacristy of the same church the sarcophagus is completely charged with basreliefs at its two extremities are the types of st mark and st john in front a noble sculpture of the death of the virgin at the angles angels holding vases the whole space is occupied by the sculpture there are no spiral shafts or panelled divisions only a basic plinth below and crowning plinth above the sculpture being raised from a deep concave field between the two but in order to give piquancy and picturesqueness to the mass of figures two small trees are introduced at the head and foot of the madonnas couch an oak and a stone pine  § lix it was said above17 in speaking of the frequent disputes of the venetians with the pontifical power which in their early days they had so strenuously supported that the humiliation of francesco dandolo blotted out the shame of barbarossa it is indeed well that the two events should be remembered together by the help of the venetians alexander iii was enabled in the twelfth century to put his foot upon the neck of the emperor barbarossa quoting the words of the psalm thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder a hundred and fifty years later the venetian ambassador francesco dandolo unable to obtain even an audience from the pope clement v to whom he had been sent to pray for a removal of the sentence of excommunication pronounced against the republic concealed himself according to the common tradition beneath the pontiffs diningtable and thence coming out as he sat down to meat embraced his feet and obtained by tearful entreaties the removal of the terrible sentence  i say according to the common tradition for there are some doubts cast upon the story by its supplement most of the venetian historians assert that francesco dandolos surname of dog was given him first on this occasion in insult by the cardinals and that the venetians in remembrance of the grace which his humiliation had won for them made it a title of honor to him and to his race it has however been proved18 that the surname was borne by the ancestors of francesco dandolo long before and the falsity of this seal of the legend renders also its circumstances doubtful but the main fact of grievous humiliation having been undergone admits of no dispute the existence of such a tradition at all is in itself a proof of its truth it was not one likely to be either invented or received without foundation and it will be well therefore that the reader should remember in connection with the treatment of barbarossa at the door of the church of st marks that in the vatican one hundred and fifty years later a venetian noble a future doge submitted to a degradation of which the current report among his people was that he had crept on his hands and knees from beneath the pontiffs table to his feet and had been spurned as a dog by the cardinals present  § lx there are two principal conclusions to be drawn from this the obvious one respecting the insolence of the papal dominion in the thirteenth century the second that there were probably most deep piety and humility in the character of the man who could submit to this insolence for the sake of a benefit to his country probably no motive would have been strong enough to obtain such a sacrifice from most men however unselfish but it was without doubt made easier to dandolo by his profound reverence for the pontifical office a reverence which however we may now esteem those who claimed it could not but have been felt by nearly all good and faithful men at the time of which we are speaking this is the main point which i wish the reader to remember as we look at his tomb this and the result of itthat some years afterwards when he was seated on the throne which his piety had saved there were sixty princes ambassadors in venice at the same time requesting the judgment of the senate on matters of various concernment so great was the fame of the uncorrupted justice of the fathers19  observe there are no virtues on this tomb nothing but religious history or symbols the death of the virgin in front and the types of st mark and st john at the extremities  § lxi of the tomb of the doge andrea dandolo in st marks i have spoken before it is one of the first in venice which presents in a canopy the pisan idea of angels withdrawing curtains as of a couch to look down upon the dead the sarcophagus is richly decorated with flowerwork the usual figures of the annunciation are at the sides an enthroned madonna in the centre and two basreliefs one of the martyrdom of the doges patron saint st andrew occupy the intermediate spaces all these tombs have been richly colored the hair of the angels has here been gilded their wings bedropped with silver and their garments covered with the most exquisite arabesques this tomb and that of st isidore in another chapel of st marks which was begun by this very doge andrea dandolo and completed after his death in 1354 are both nearly alike in their treatment and are on the whole the best existing examples of venetian monumental sculpture  § lxii of much ruder workmanship though still most precious and singularly interesting from its quaintness is a sarcophagus in the northernmost chapel beside the choir of st john and paul charged with two basreliefs and many figures but which bears no inscription it has however a shield with three dolphins on its brackets and as at the feet of the madonna in its centre there is a small kneeling figure of a doge we know it to be the tomb of the doge giovanni dolfino who came to the throne in 1356  he was chosen doge while as provveditore he was in treviso defending the city against the king of hungary the venetians sent to the besiegers praying that their newly elected doge might be permitted to pass the hungarian lines their request was refused the hungarians exulting that they held the doge of venice prisoner in treviso but dolfino with a body of two hundred horse cut his way through their lines by night and reached mestre malghera in safety where he was met by the senate his bravery could not avert the misfortunes which were accumulating on the republic the hungarian war was ignominiously terminated by the surrender of dalmatia the doges heart was broken his eyesight failed him and he died of the plague four years after he had ascended the throne  § lxiii it is perhaps on this account perhaps in consequence of later injuries that the tomb has neither effigy nor inscription that it has been subjected to some violence is evident from the dentil which once crowned its leafcornice being now broken away showing the whole front but fortunately the sculpture of the sarcophagus itself is little injured  there are two saints male and female at its angles each in a little niche a christ enthroned in the centre the doge and dogaressa kneeling at his feet in the two intermediate panels on one side the epiphany on the other the death of the virgin the whole supported as well as crowned by an elaborate leafplinth the figures under the niches are rudely cut and of little interest not so the central group instead of a niche the christ is seated under a square tent or tabernacle formed by curtains running on rods the idea of course as usual borrowed from the pisan one but here ingeniously applied the curtains are opened in front showing those at the back of the tent behind the seated figure the perspective of the two retiring sides being very tolerably suggested two angels of half the size of the seated figure thrust back the near curtains and look up reverently to the christ while again at their feet about one third of their size and halfsheltered as it seems by their garments are the two kneeling figures of the doge and dogaressa though so small and carefully cut full of life the christ raising one hand as to bless and holding a book upright and open on the knees does not look either towards them or to the angels but forward and there is a very noticeable effort to represent divine abstraction in the countenance the idea of the three magnitudes of spiritual beingthe god the angel and the manis also to be observed aided as it is by the complete subjection of the angelic power to the divine for the angels are in attitudes of the most lowly watchfulness of the face of christ and appear unconscious of the presence of the human beings who are nestled in the folds of their garments  § lxiv with this interesting but modest tomb of one of the kings of venice it is desirable to compare that of one of her senators of exactly the same date which is raised against the western wall of the frari at the end of the north aisle it bears the following remarkable inscription   anno mccclx prima die julii sepultura  domini  simonii dandolo     amador  de  justisia  e  desiroso  de  acrese  el  ben     chomum  the amador de justitia has perhaps some reference to simon dandolos having been one of the giunta who condemned the doge faliero the sarcophagus is decorated merely by the annunciation group and an enthroned madonna with a curtain behind her throne sustained by four tiny angels who look over it as they hold it up but the workmanship of the figures is more than usually beautiful  § lxv seven years later a very noble monument was placed on the north side of the choir of st john and paul to the doge marco cornaro chiefly with respect to our present subject noticeable for the absence of religious imagery from the sarcophagus which is decorated with roses only three very beautiful statues of the madonna and two saints are however set in the canopy above opposite this tomb though about fifteen years later in date is the richest monument of the gothic period in venice that of the doge michele morosini who died in 1382 it consists of a highly florid canopyan arch crowned by a gable with pinnacles at the flanks boldly crocketed and with a huge finial at the top representing st michaela medallion of christ set in the gable under the arch a mosaic representing the madonna presenting the doge to christ upon the cross beneath as usual the sarcophagus with a most noble recumbent figure of the doge his face meagre and severe and sharp in its lines but exquisite in the form of its small and princely features the sarcophagus is adorned with elaborate wrinkled leafage projecting in front of it into seven brackets from which the statues are broken away but by which for there can be no doubt that these last statues represented the theological and cardinal virtues we must for a moment pause  § lxvi it was noticed above that the tomb of the florentine ambassador duccio was the first in venice which presented images of the virtues its small lateral statues of justice and temperance are exquisitely beautiful and were i have no doubt executed by a florentine sculptor the whole range of artistical power and religious feeling being in florence full half a century in advance of that of venice but this is the first truly venetian tomb which has the virtues and it becomes of importance therefore to know what was the character of morosini  the reader must recollect that i dated the commencement of the fall of venice from the death of carlo zeno considering that no state could be held as in decline which numbered such a man amongst its citizens carlo zeno was a candidate for the ducal bonnet together with michael morosini and morosini was chosen it might be anticipated therefore that there was something more than usually admirable or illustrious in his character yet it is difficult to arrive at a just estimate of it as the reader will at once understand by comparing the following statements     § lxvi 1 to him andrea contarini succeeded morosini at the age    of seventyfour years a most learned and prudent man who also    reformed several lawssansovino vite de principi     2 it was generally believed that if his reign had been longer he    would have dignified the state by many noble laws and institutes but    by so much as his reign was full of hope by as much was it short in    duration for he died when he had been at the head of the republic    but four monthssabellico lib viii     3 he was allowed but a short time to enjoy this high dignity which    he had so well deserved by his rare virtues for god called him to    himself on the 15th of octobermuratori annali de italia     4 two candidates presented themselves one was zeno the other that    michael morosini who during the war had tripled his fortune by his    speculations the suffrages of the electors fell upon him and he was    proclaimed doge on the 10th of junedaru histoire de venise    lib x     5 the choice of the electors was directed to michele morosini a    noble of illustrious birth derived from a stock which coeval with    the republic itself had produced the conqueror of tyre given a    queen to hungary and more than one doge to venice the brilliancy of    this descent was tarnished in the present chief representative of the    family by the most base and grovelling avarice for at that moment    in the recent war at which all other venetians were devoting their    whole fortunes to the service of the state morosini sought in the    distresses of his country an opening for his own private enrichment    and employed his ducats not in the assistance of the national wants    but in speculating upon houses which were brought to market at a    price far beneath their real value and which upon the return of    peace insured the purchaser a fourfold profit what matters the    fall of venice to me so as i fall not together with her was his    selfish and sordid reply to some one who expressed surprise at the    transactionsketches of venetian history murray 1831  § lxviii the writer of the unpretending little history from which the last quotation is taken has not given his authority for this statement and i could not find it but believed from the general accuracy of the book that some authority might exist better than darus under these circumstances wishing if possible to ascertain the truth and to clear the character of this great doge from the accusation if it proved groundless i wrote to the count carlo morosini his descendant and one of the few remaining representatives of the ancient noblesse of venice one also by whom his great ancestral name is revered and in whom it is exalted his answer appears to me altogether conclusive as to the utter fallacy of the reports of daru and the english history i have placed his letter in the close of this volume appendix 6 in order that the reader may himself be the judge upon this point and i should not have alluded to darus report except for the purpose of contradicting it but that it still appears to me impossible that any modern historian should have gratuitously invented the whole story and that therefore there must have been a trace in the documents which daru himself possessed of some scandal of this kind raised by morosinis enemies perhaps at the very time of the disputed election with carlo zeno the occurrence of the virtues upon his tomb for the first time in venetian monumental work and so richly and conspicuously placed may partly have been in public contradiction of such a floating rumor but the face of the statue is a more explicit contradiction still it is resolute thoughtful serene and full of beauty and we must therefore for once allow the somewhat boastful introduction of the virtues to have been perfectly just though the whole tomb is most notable as furnishing not only the exact intermediate condition in style between the pure gothic and its final renaissance corruption but at the same time the exactly intermediate condition of feeling between the pure calmness of early christianity and the boastful pomp of the renaissance faithlessness for here we have still the religious humility remaining in the mosaic of the canopy which shows the doge kneeling before the cross while yet this tendency to selftrust is shown in the surrounding of the coffin by the virtues  § lxix the next tomb by the side of which they appear is that of jacopo cavalli in the same chapel of st john and paul which contains the tomb of the doge delfin it is peculiarly rich in religious imagery adorned by boldly cut types of the four evangelists and of two saints while on projecting brackets in front of it stood three statues of faith hope and charity now lost but drawn in zanottos work it is all rich in detail and its sculptor has been proud of it thus recording his name below the epitaph    qst opera dintalgio e fatto in piera    unvenician lafe chanome polo    nato di jachomel chataiapiera     this work of sculpture is done in stone    a venetian did it named paul    son of jachomel the stonecutter  jacopo cavalli died in 1384 he was a bold and active veronese soldier did the state much service was therefore ennobled by it and became the founder of the house of the cavalli but i find no especial reason for the images of the virtues especially that of charity appearing at his tomb unless it be this that at the siege of feltre in the war against leopold of austria he refused to assault the city because the senate would not grant his soldiers the pillage of the town the feet of the recumbent figure which is in full armor rest on a dog and its head on two lions and these animals neither of which form any part of the knights bearings are said by zanotto to be intended to symbolize his bravery and fidelity if however the lions are meant to set forth courage it is a pity they should have been represented as howling  § lxx we must next pause for an instant beside the tomb of michael steno now in the northern aisle of st john and paul having been removed there from the destroyed church of the servi first to note its remarkable return to the early simplicity the sarcophagus being decorated only with two crosses in quatrefoils though it is of the fifteenth century steno dying in 1413 and in the second place to observe the peculiarity of the epitaph which eulogises steno as having been amator justitie pacis et ubertatis a lover of justice peace and plenty in the epitaphs of this period the virtues which are made most account of in public men are those which were most useful to their country we have already seen one example in the epitaph on simon dandolo and similar expressions occur constantly in laudatory mentions of their later doges by the venetian writers thus sansovino of marco cornaro era savio huomo eloquente e amava molto la pace e l abbondanza della citta and of tomaso mocenigo huomo oltre modo desideroso della pace  of the tomb of this lastnamed doge mention has before been made here as in morosinis the images of the virtues have no ironical power although their great conspicuousness marks the increase of the boastful feeling in the treatment of monuments for the rest this tomb is the last in venice which can be considered as belonging to the gothic period its mouldings are already rudely classical and it has meaningless figures in roman armor at the angles but its tabernacle above is still gothic and the recumbent figure is very beautiful it was carved by two florentine sculptors in 1423  § lxxi tomaso mocenigo was succeeded by the renowned doge francesco foscari under whom it will be remembered the last additions were made to the gothic ducal palace additions which in form only not in spirit corresponded to the older portions since during his reign the transition took place which permits us no longer to consider the venetian architecture as gothic at all he died in 1457 and his tomb is the first important example of renaissance art  not however a good characteristic example it is remarkable chiefly as introducing all the faults of the renaissance at an early period when its merits such as they are were yet undeveloped its claim to be rated as a classical composition is altogether destroyed by the remnants of gothic feeling which cling to it here and there in their last forms of degradation and of which now that we find them thus corrupted the sooner we are rid the better thus the sarcophagus is supported by a species of trefoil arches the bases of the shafts have still their spurs and the whole tomb is covered by a pediment with crockets and a pinnacle we shall find that the perfect renaissance is at least pure in its insipidity and subtle in its vice but this monument is remarkable as showing the refuse of one style encumbering the embryo of another and all principles of life entangled either in the swaddling clothes or the shroud  § lxxii with respect to our present purpose however it is a monument of enormous importance we have to trace be it remembered the pride of state in its gradual intrusion upon the sepulchre and the consequent and correlative vanishing of the expressions of religious feeling and heavenly hope together with the more and more arrogant setting forth of the virtues of the dead now this tomb is the largest and most costly we have yet seen but its means of religious expression are limited to a single statue of christ small and used merely as a pinnacle at the top the rest of the composition is as curious as it is vulgar the conceit so often noticed as having been borrowed from the pisan school of angels withdrawing the curtains of the couch to look down upon the dead was brought forward with increasing prominence by every succeeding sculptor but as we draw nearer to the renaissance period we find that the angels become of less importance and the curtains of more with the pisans the curtains are introduced as a motive for the angels with the renaissance sculptors the angels are introduced merely as a motive for the curtains which become every day more huge and elaborate in the monument of mocenigo they have already expanded into a tent with a pole in the centre of it and in that of foscari for the first time the angels are absent altogether while the curtains are arranged in the form of an enormous french tentbed and are sustained at the flanks by two diminutive figures in roman armor substituted for the angels merely that the sculptor might show his knowledge of classical costume and now observe how often a fault in feeling induces also a fault in style in the old tombs the angels used to stand on or by the side of the sarcophagus but their places are here to be occupied by the virtues and therefore to sustain the diminutive roman figures at the necessary height each has a whole corinthian pillar to himself a pillar whose shaft is eleven feet high and some three or four feet round and because this was not high enough it is put on a pedestal four feet and a half high and has a spurred base besides of its own a tall capital then a huge bracket above the capital and then another pedestal above the bracket and on the top of all the diminutive figure who has charge of the curtains  § lxxiii under the canopy thus arranged is placed the sarcophagus with its recumbent figure the statues of the virgin and the saints have disappeared from it in their stead its panels are filled with halflength figures of faith hope and charity while temperance and fortitude are at the doges feet justice and prudence at his head figures now the size of life yet nevertheless recognizable only by their attributes for except that hope raises her eyes there is no difference in the character or expression of any of their facesthey are nothing more than handsome venetian women in rather full and courtly dresses and tolerably well thrown into postures for effect from below fortitude could not of course be placed in a graceful one without some sacrifice of her character but that was of no consequence in the eyes of the sculptors of this period so she leans back languidly and nearly overthrows her own column while temperance and justice opposite to her as neither the left hand of the one nor the right hand of the other could be seen from below have been left with one hand each  § lxxiv still these figures coarse and feelingless as they are have been worked with care because the principal effect of the tomb depends on them but the effigy of the doge of which nothing but the side is visible has been utterly neglected and the ingenuity of the sculptor is not so great at the best as that he can afford to be slovenly there is indeed nothing in the history of foscari which would lead us to expect anything particularly noble in his face but i trust nevertheless it has been misrepresented by this despicable carver for no words are strong enough to express the baseness of the portraiture a huge gross bony clowns face with the peculiar sodden and sensual cunning in it which is seen so often in the countenances of the worst romanist priest a face part of iron and part of clay with the immobility of the one and the foulness of the other double chinned bluntmouthed bonycheeked with its brows drawn down into meagre lines and wrinkles over the eyelids the face of a man incapable either of joy or sorrow unless such as may be caused by the indulgence of passion or the mortification of pride even had he been such a one a noble workman would not have written it so legibly on his tomb and i believe it to be the image of the carvers own mind that is there hewn in the marble not that of the doge foscari for the same mind is visible enough throughout the traces of it mingled with those of the evil taste of the whole time and people there is not anything so small but it is shown in some portion of its treatment for instance in the placing of the shields at the back of the great curtain in earlier times the shield as we have seen was represented as merely suspended against the tomb by a thong or if sustained in any other manner still its form was simple and undisguised men in those days used their shields in war and therefore there was no need to add dignity to their form by external ornament that which through day after day of mortal danger had borne back from them the waves of battle could neither be degraded by simplicity nor exalted by decoration by its rude leathern thong it seemed to be fastened to their tombs and the shield of the mighty was not cast away though capable of defending its master no more  § lxxv it was otherwise in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the changed system of warfare was rapidly doing away with the practical service of the shield and the chiefs who directed the battle from a distance or who passed the greater part of their lives in the councilchamber soon came to regard the shield as nothing more than a field for their armorial bearings it then became a principal object of their pride of state to increase the conspicuousness of these marks of family distinction by surrounding them with various and fantastic ornament generally scroll or flower work which of course deprived the shield of all appearance of being intended for a soldiers use thus the shield of the foscari is introduced in two ways on the sarcophagus the bearings are three times repeated enclosed in circular disks which are sustained each by a couple of naked infants above the canopy two shields of the usual form are set in the centre of circles filled by a radiating ornament of shell flutings which give them the effect of ventilators and their circumference is farther adorned by gilt rays undulating to represent a glory  § lxxvi we now approach that period of the early renaissance which was noticed in the preceding chapter as being at first a very visible improvement on the corrupted gothic the tombs executed during the period of the byzantine renaissance exhibit in the first place a consummate skill in handling the chisel perfect science of drawing and anatomy high appreciation of good classical models and a grace of composition and delicacy of ornament derived i believe principally from the great florentine sculptors but together with this science they exhibit also for a short time some return to the early religious feeling forming a school of sculpture which corresponds to that of the school of the bellini in painting and the only wonder is that there should not have been more workmen in the fifteenth century doing in marble what perugino francia and bellini did on canvas there are indeed some few as i have just said in whom the good and pure temper shows itself but the sculptor was necessarily led sooner than the painter to an exclusive study of classical models utterly adverse to the christian imagination and he was also deprived of the great purifying and sacred element of color besides having much more of merely mechanical and therefore degrading labor to go through in the realization of his thought hence i do not know any example in sculpture at this period at least in venice which has not conspicuous faults not faults of imperfection as in early sculpture but of purpose and sentiment staining such beauties as it may possess and the whole school soon falls away and merges into vain pomp and meagre metaphor  § lxxvii the most celebrated monument of this period is that to the doge andrea vendramin in the church of st john and paul sculptured about 1480 and before alluded to in the first chapter of the first volume it has attracted public admiration partly by its costliness partly by the delicacy and precision of its chiselling being otherwise a very base and unworthy example of the school and showing neither invention nor feeling it has the virtues as usual dressed like heathen goddesses and totally devoid of expression though graceful and well studied merely as female figures the rest of its sculpture is all of the same kind perfect in workmanship and devoid of thought its dragons are covered with marvellous scales but have no terror nor sting in them its birds are perfect in plumage but have no song in them its children lovely of limb but have no childishness in them  § lxxviii of far other workmanship are the tombs of pietro and giovanni mocenigo in st john and paul and of pietro bernardo in the frari in all which the details are as full of exquisite fancy as they are perfect in execution and in the two former and several others of similar feeling the old religious symbols return the madonna is again seen enthroned under the canopy and the sarcophagus is decorated with legends of the saints but the fatal errors of sentiment are nevertheless always traceable in the first place the sculptor is always seen to be intent upon the exhibition of his skill more than on producing any effect on the spectators mind elaborate backgrounds of landscape with tricks of perspective imitations of trees clouds and water and various other unnecessary adjuncts merely to show how marble could be subdued together with useless undercutting and overfinish in subordinate parts continually exhibiting the same cold vanity and unexcited precision of mechanism in the second place the figures have all the peculiar tendency to posturemaking which exhibiting itself first painfully in perugino rapidly destroyed the veracity of composition in all art by posturemaking i mean in general that action of figures which results from the painters considering in the first place not how under the circumstances they would actually have walked or stood or looked but how they may most gracefully and harmoniously walk or stand in the hands of a great man posture like everything else becomes noble even when overstudied as with michael angelo who was perhaps more than any other the cause of the mischief but with inferior men this habit of composing attitudes ends necessarily in utter lifelessness and abortion giotto was perhaps of all painters the most free from the infection of the poison always conceiving an incident naturally and drawing it unaffectedly and the absence of posturemaking in the works of the preraphaelites as opposed to the attitudinarianism of the modern school has been both one of their principal virtues and of the principal causes of outcry against them  § lxxix but the most significant change in the treatment of these tombs with respect to our immediate object is in the form of the sarcophagus it was above noted that exactly in proportion to the degree of the pride of life expressed in any monument would be also the fear of death and therefore as these tombs increase in splendor in size and beauty of workmanship we perceive a gradual desire to take away from the definite character of the sarcophagus in the earliest times as we have seen it was a gloomy mass of stone gradually it became charged with religious sculpture but never with the slightest desire to disguise its form until towards the middle of the fifteenth century it then becomes enriched with flowerwork and hidden by the virtues and finally losing its foursquare form it is modelled on graceful types of ancient vases made as little like a coffin as possible and refined away in various elegancies till it becomes at last a mere pedestal or stage for the portrait statue this statue in the meantime has been gradually coming back to life through a curious series of transitions the vendramin monument is one of the last which shows or pretends to show the recumbent figure laid in death a few years later this idea became disagreeable to polite minds and lo the figures which before had been laid at rest upon the tomb pillow raised themselves on their elbows and began to look round them the soul of the sixteenth century dared not contemplate its body in death  § lxxx the reader cannot but remember many instances of this form of monument england being peculiarly rich in examples of them although with her tomb sculpture after the fourteenth century is altogether imitative and in no degree indicative of the temper of the people it was from italy that the authority for the change was derived and in italy only therefore that it is truly correspondent to the change in the national mind there are many monuments in venice of this semianimate type most of them carefully sculptured and some very admirable as portraits and for the casting of the drapery especially those in the church of san salvador but i shall only direct the reader to one that of jacopo pesaro bishop of paphos in the church of the frari notable not only as a very skilful piece of sculpture but for the epitaph singularly characteristic of the period and confirmatory of all that i have alleged against it   james pesaro bishop of paphos who conquered the turks in war    himself in peace transported from a noble family among the venetians    to a nobler among the angels laid here expects the noblest crown    which the just judge shall give to him in that day he lived the    years of plato he died 24th march 154720  the mingled classicism and carnal pride of this epitaph surely need no comment the crown is expected as a right from the justice of the judge and the nobility of the venetian family is only a little lower than that of the angels the quaint childishness of the vixit annos platonicos is also very notable  § lxxxi the statue however did not long remain in this partially recumbent attitude even the expression of peace became painful to the frivolous and thoughtless italians and they required the portraiture to be rendered in a manner that should induce no memory of death the statue rose up and presented itself in front of the tomb like an actor upon a stage surrounded now not merely or not at all by the virtues but by allegorical figures of fame and victory by genii and muses by personifications of humbled kingdoms and adoring nations and by every circumstance of pomp and symbol of adulation that flattery could suggest or insolence could claim  § lxxxii as of the intermediate monumental type so also of this the last and most gross there are unfortunately many examples in our own country but the most wonderful by far are still at venice i shall however particularize only two the first that of the doge john pesaro in the frari it is to be observed that we have passed over a considerable interval of time we are now in the latter half of the seventeenth century the progress of corruption has in the meantime been incessant and sculpture has here lost its taste and learning as well as its feeling the monument is a huge accumulation of theatrical scenery in marble four colossal negro caryatides grinning and horrible with faces of black marble and white eyes sustain the first story of it above this two monsters longnecked half dog and half dragon sustain an ornamental sarcophagus on the top of which the fulllength statue of the doge in robes of state stands forward with its arms expanded like an actor courting applause under a huge canopy of metal like the roof of a bed painted crimson and gold on each side of him are sitting figures of genii and unintelligible personifications gesticulating in roman armor below between the negro caryatides are two ghastly figures in bronze half corpse half skeleton carrying tablets on which is written the eulogium but in large letters graven in gold the following words are the first and last that strike the eye the first two phrases one on each side on tablets in the lower story the last under the portrait statue above    vixit annos lxx            devixit anno mdclix              hic revixit anno mdclxix  we have here at last the horrible images of death in violent contrast with the defiant monument which pretends to bring the resurrection down to earth hic revixit and it seems impossible for false taste and base feeling to sink lower yet even this monument is surpassed by one in st john and paul  § lxxxiii but before we pass to this the last with which i shall burden the readers attention let us for a moment and that we may feel the contrast more forcibly return to a tomb of the early times  in a dark niche in the outer wall of the outer corridor of st marksnot even in the church observe but in the atrium or porch of it and on the north side of the churchis a solid sarcophagus of white marble raised only about two feet from the ground on four stunted square pillars its lid is a mere slab of stone on its extremities are sculptured two crosses in front of it are two rows of rude figures the uppermost representing christ with the apostles the lower row is of six figures only alternately male and female holding up their hands in the usual attitude of benediction the sixth is smaller than the rest and the midmost of the other five has a glory round its head i cannot tell the meaning of these figures but between them are suspended censers attached to crosses a most beautiful symbolic expression of christs mediatorial function the whole is surrounded by a rude wreath of vine leaves proceeding out of the foot of a cross  on the bar of marble which separates the two rows of figures are inscribed these words    here lies the lord marin morosini duke  it is the tomb of the doge marino morosini who reigned from 1249 to 1252  § lxxxiv from before this rude and solemn sepulchre let us pass to the southern aisle of the church of st john and paul and there towering from the pavement to the vaulting of the church behold a mass of marble sixty or seventy feet in height of mingled yellow and white the yellow carved into the form of an enormous curtain with ropes fringes and tassels sustained by cherubs in front of which in the now usual stage attitudes advance the statues of the doge bertuccio valier his son the doge silvester falier and his sons wife elizabeth the statues of the doges though mean and poloniuslike are partly redeemed by the ducal robes but that of the dogaressa is a consummation of grossness vanity and uglinessthe figure of a large and wrinkled woman with elaborate curls in stiff projection round her face covered from her shoulders to her feet with ruffs furs lace jewels and embroidery beneath and around are scattered virtues victories fames geniithe entire company of the monumental stage assembled as before a drop sceneexecuted by various sculptors and deserving attentive study as exhibiting every condition of false taste and feeble conception the victory in the centre is peculiarly interesting the lion by which she is accompanied springing on a dragon has been intended to look terrible but the incapable sculptor could not conceive any form of dreadfulness could not even make the lion look angry it looks only lachrymose and its lifted forepaws there being no spring nor motion in its body give it the appearance of a dog begging the inscriptions under the two principal statues are as follows        bertucius valier duke    great in wisdom and eloquence   greater in his hellespontic victory     greatest in the prince his son        died in the year 1658           elisabeth quirina        the wife of silvester     distinguished by roman virtue          by venetian piety        and by the ducal crown             died 1708  the writers of this age were generally anxious to make the world aware that they understood the degrees of comparison and a large number of epitaphs are principally constructed with this object compare in the latin that of the bishop of paphos given above but the latter of these epitaphs is also interesting from its mention in an age now altogether given up to the pursuit of worldly honor of that venetian piety which once truly distinguished the city from all others and of which some form and shadow remaining still served to point an epitaph and to feed more cunningly and speciously the pride which could not be satiated with the sumptuousness of the sepulchre  § lxxxv thus far then of the second element of the renaissance spirit the pride of state nor need we go farther to learn the reason of the fall of venice she was already likened in her thoughts and was therefore to be likened in her ruin to the virgin of babylon the pride of state and the pride of knowledge were no new passions the sentence against them had gone forth from everlasting thou saidst i shall be a lady for ever so that thou didst not lay these things to thine heart  thy wisdom and thy knowledge it hath perverted thee and thou hast said in thine heart i am and none else beside me therefore shall evil come upon thee  thy merchants from thy youth they shall wander every one to his quarter none shall save thee21  § lxxxvi iii pride of system i might have illustrated these evil principles from a thousand other sources but i have not time to pursue the subject farther and must pass to the third element above named the pride of system it need not detain us so long as either of the others for it is at once more palpable and less dangerous the manner in which the pride of the fifteenth century corrupted the sources of knowledge and diminished the majesty while it multiplied the trappings of state is in general little observed but the reader is probably already well and sufficiently aware of the curious tendency to formulization and system which under the name of philosophy encumbered the minds of the renaissance schoolmen as it was above stated grammar became the first of sciences and whatever subject had to be treated the first aim of the philosopher was to subject its principles to a code of laws in the observation of which the merit of the speaker thinker or worker in or on that subject was thereafter to consist so that the whole mind of the world was occupied by the exclusive study of restraints the sound of the forging of fetters was heard from sea to sea the doctors of all the arts and sciences set themselves daily to the invention of new varieties of cages and manacles they themselves wore instead of gowns a chain mail whose purpose was not so much to avert the weapon of the adversary as to restrain the motions of the wearer and all the acts thoughts and workings of mankindpoetry painting architecture and philosophywere reduced by them merely to so many different forms of fetterdance  § lxxxvii now i am very sure that no reader who has given any attention to the former portions of this work or the tendency of what else i have written more especially the last chapter of the seven lamps will suppose me to underrate the importance or dispute the authority of law it has been necessary for me to allege these again and again nor can they ever be too often or too energetically alleged against the vast masses of men who now disturb or retard the advance of civilization heady and highminded despisers of discipline and refusers of correction but law so far as it can be reduced to form and system and is not written upon the heartas it is in a divine loyalty upon the hearts of the great hierarchies who serve and wait about the throne of the eternal lawgiverthis lower and formally expressible law has i say two objects it is either for the definition and restraint of sin or the guidance of simplicity it either explains forbids and punishes wickedness or it guides the movements and actions both of lifeless things and of the more simple and untaught among responsible agents and so long therefore as sin and foolishness are in the world so long it will be necessary for men to submit themselves painfully to this lower law in proportion to their need of being corrected and to the degree of childishness or simplicity by which they approach more nearly to the condition of the unthinking and inanimate things which are governed by law altogether yet yielding in the manner of their submission to it a singular lesson to the pride of manbeing obedient more perfectly in proportion to their greatness22 but so far as men become good and wise and rise above the state of children so far they become emancipated from this written law and invested with the perfect freedom which consists in the fulness and joyfulness of compliance with a higher and unwritten law a law so universal so subtle so glorious that nothing but the heart can keep it  § lxxxviii now pride opposes itself to the observance of this divine law in two opposite ways either by brute resistance which is the way of the rabble and its leaders denying or defying law altogether or by formal compliance which is the way of the pharisee exalting himself while he pretends to obedience and making void the infinite and spiritual commandment by the finite and lettered commandment and it is easy to know which law we are obeying for any law which we magnify and keep through pride is always the law of the letter but that which we love and keep through humility is the law of the spirit and the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life  § lxxxix in the appliance of this universal principle to what we have at present in hand it is to be noted that all written or writable law respecting the arts is for the childish and ignorant that in the beginning of teaching it is possible to say that this or that must or must not be done and laws of color and shade may be taught as laws of harmony are to the young scholar in music but the moment a man begins to be anything deserving the name of an artist all this teachable law has become a matter of course with him and if thenceforth he boast himself anywise in the law or pretend that he lives and works by it it is a sure sign that he is merely tithing cummin and that there is no true art nor religion in him for the true artist has that inspiration in him which is above all law or rather which is continually working out such magnificent and perfect obedience to supreme law as can in no wise be rendered by line and rule there are more laws perceived and fulfilled in the single stroke of a great workman than could be written in a volume his science is inexpressibly subtle directly taught him by his maker not in any wise communicable or imitable23 neither can any written or definitely observable laws enable us to do any great thing it is possible by measuring and administering quantities of color to paint a room wall so that it shall not hurt the eye but there are no laws by observing which we can become titians it is possible so to measure and administer syllables as to construct harmonious verse but there are no laws by which we can write iliads out of the poem or the picture once produced men may elicit laws by the volume and study them with advantage to the better understanding of the existing poem or picture but no more write or paint another than by discovering laws of vegetation they can make a tree to grow and therefore wheresoever we find the system and formality of rules much dwelt upon and spoken of as anything else than a help for children there we may be sure that noble art is not even understood far less reached and thus it was with all the common and public mind in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the greater men indeed broke through the thorn hedges and though much time was lost by the learned among them in writing latin verses and anagrams and arranging the framework of quaint sonnets and dexterous syllogisms still they tore their way through the sapless thicket by force of intellect or of piety for it was not possible that either in literature or in painting rules could be received by any strong mind so as materially to interfere with its originality and the crabbed discipline and exact scholarship became an advantage to the men who could pass through and despise them so that in spite of the rules of the drama we had shakspeare and in spite of the rules of art we had tintoretboth of them to this day doing perpetual violence to the vulgar scholarship and dimeyed proprieties of the multitude  § xc but in architecture it was not so for that was the art of the multitude and was affected by all their errors and the great men who entered its field like michael angelo found expression for all the best part of their minds in sculpture and made the architecture merely its shell so the simpletons and sophists had their way with it and the reader can have no conception of the inanities and puerilities of the writers who with the help of vitruvius reestablished its five orders determined the proportions of each and gave the various recipes for sublimity and beauty which have been thenceforward followed to this day but which may i believe in this age of perfect machinery be followed out still farther if indeed there are only five perfect forms of columns and architraves and there be a fixed proportion to each it is certainly possible with a little ingenuity so to regulate a stonecutting machine as that it shall furnish pillars and friezes to the size ordered of any of the five orders on the most perfect greek models in any quantity an epitome also of vitruvius may be made so simple as to enable any bricklayer to set them up at their proper distances and we may dispense with our architects altogether  § xci but if this be not so and there be any truth in the faint persuasion which still lurks in mens minds that architecture is an art and that it requires some gleam of intellect to practise it then let the whole system of the orders and their proportions be cast out and trampled down as the most vain barbarous and paltry deception that was ever stamped on human prejudice and let us understand this plain truth common to all work of man that if it be good work it is not a copy nor anything done by rule but a freshly and divinely imagined thing five orders there is not a side chapel in any gothic cathedral but it has fifty orders the worst of them better than the best of the greek ones and all new and a single inventive human soul could create a thousand orders in an hour24 and this would have been discovered even in the worst times but that as i said the greatest men of the age found expression for their invention in the other arts and the best of those who devoted themselves to architecture were in great part occupied in adapting the construction of buildings to new necessities such as those developed by the invention of gunpowder introducing a totally new and most interesting science of fortification which directed the ingenuity of sanmicheli and many others from its proper channel and found interest of a meaner kind in the difficulties of reconciling the obsolete architectural laws they had consented to revive and the forms of roman architecture which they agreed to copy with the requirements of the daily life of the sixteenth century  § xcii these then were the three principal directions in which the renaissance pride manifested itself and its impulses were rendered still more fatal by the entrance of another element inevitably associated with pride for as it is written he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool so also it is written the fool hath said in his heart there is no god and the selfadulation which influenced not less the learning of the age than its luxury led gradually to the forgetfulness of all things but self and to an infidelity only the more fatal because it still retained the form and language of faith  § xciii iv infidelity in noticing the more prominent forms in which this faithlessness manifested itself it is necessary to distinguish justly between that which was the consequence of respect for paganism and that which followed from the corruption of catholicism for as the roman architecture is not to be made answerable for the primal corruption of the gothic so neither is the roman philosophy to be made answerable for the primal corruption of christianity year after year as the history of the life of christ sank back into the depths of time and became obscured by the misty atmosphere of the history of the worldas intermediate actions and incidents multiplied in number and countless changes in mens modes of life and tones of thought rendered it more difficult for them to imagine the facts of distant timeit became daily almost hourly a greater effort for the faithful heart to apprehend the entire veracity and vitality of the story of its redeemer and more easy for the thoughtless and remiss to deceive themselves as to the true character of the belief they had been taught to profess and this must have been the case had the pastors of the church never failed in their watchfulness and the church itself never erred in its practice or doctrine but when every year that removed the truths of the gospel into deeper distance added to them also some false or foolish tradition when wilful distortion was added to natural obscurity and the dimness of memory was disguised by the fruitfulness of fiction when moreover the enormous temporal power granted to the clergy attracted into their ranks multitudes of men who but for such temptation would not have pretended to the christian name so that grievous wolves entered in among them not sparing the flock and when by the machinations of such men and the remissness of others the form and administrations of church doctrine and discipline had become little more than a means of aggrandizing the power of the priesthood it was impossible any longer for men of thoughtfulness or piety to remain in an unquestioning serenity of faith the church had become so mingled with the world that its witness could no longer be received and the professing members of it who were placed in circumstances such as to enable them to become aware of its corruptions and whom their interest or their simplicity did not bribe or beguile into silence gradually separated themselves into two vast multitudes of adverse energy one tending to reformation and the other to infidelity  § xciv of these the last stood as it were apart to watch the course of the struggle between romanism and protestantism a struggle which however necessary was attended with infinite calamity to the church for in the first place the protestant movement was in reality not reformation but reanimation it poured new life into the church but it did not form or define her anew in some sort it rather broke down her hedges so that all they who passed by might pluck off her grapes the reformers speedily found that the enemy was never far behind the sower of good seed that an evil spirit might enter the ranks of reformation as well as those of resistance and that though the deadly blight might be checked amidst the wheat there was no hope of ever ridding the wheat itself from the tares new temptations were invented by satan wherewith to oppose the revived strength of christianity as the romanist confiding in his human teachers had ceased to try whether they were teachers sent from god so the protestant confiding in the teaching of the spirit believed every spirit and did not try the spirits whether they were of god and a thousand enthusiasms and heresies speedily obscured the faith and divided the force of the reformation  § xcv but the main evils rose out of the antagonism of the two great parties primarily in the mere fact of the existence of an antagonism to the eyes of the unbeliever the church of christ for the first time since its foundation bore the aspect of a house divided against itself not that many forms of schism had not before arisen in it but either they had been obscure and silent hidden among the shadows of the alps and the marshes of the rhine or they had been outbreaks of visible and unmistakable error cast off by the church rootless and speedily withering away while with much that was erring and criminal she still retained within her the pillar and ground of the truth but here was at last a schism in which truth and authority were at issue the body that was cast off withered away no longer it stretched out its boughs to the sea and its branches to the river and it was the ancient trunk that gave signs of decrepitude on one side stood the reanimated faith in its right hand the book open and its left hand lifted up to heaven appealing for its proof to the word of the testimony and the power of the holy ghost on the other stood or seemed to stand all beloved custom and believed tradition all that for fifteen hundred years had been closest to the hearts of men or most precious for their help longtrusted legend longreverenced power longpractised discipline faiths that had ruled the destiny and sealed the departure of souls that could not be told or numbered for multitude prayers that from the lips of the fathers to those of the children had distilled like sweet waterfalls sounding through the silence of ages breaking themselves into heavenly dew to return upon the pastures of the wilderness hopes that had set the face as a flint in the torture and the sword as a flame in the battle that had pointed the purposes and ministered the strength of life brightened the last glances and shaped the last syllables of death charities that had bound together the brotherhoods of the mountain and the desert and had woven chains of pitying or aspiring communion between this world and the unfathomable beneath and above and more than these the spirits of all the innumerable undoubting dead beckoning to the one way by which they had been content to follow the things that belonged unto their peacethese all stood on the other side and the choice must have been a bitter one even at the best but it was rendered tenfold more bitter by the natural but most sinful animosity of the two divisions of the church against each other  § xcvi on one side this animosity was of course inevitable the romanist party though still including many christian men necessarily included also all the worst of those who called themselves christians in the fact of its refusing correction it stood confessed as the church of the unholy and while it still counted among its adherents many of the simple and believingmen unacquainted with the corruption of the body to which they belonged or incapable of accepting any form of doctrine but that which they had been taught from their youthit gathered together with them whatever was carnal and sensual in priesthood or in people all the lovers of power in the one and of ease in the other and the rage of these men was of course unlimited against those who either disputed their authority reprehended their manner of life or cast suspicion upon the popular methods of lulling the conscience in the lifetime or purchasing salvation on the deathbed  § xcvii besides this the reassertion and defence of various tenets which before had been little more than floating errors in the popular mind but which definitely attacked by protestantism it became necessary to fasten down with a band of iron and brass gave a form at once more rigid and less rational to the whole body of romanist divinity multitudes of minds which in other ages might have brought honor and strength to the church preaching the more vital truths which it still retained were now occupied in pleading for arraigned falsehoods or magnifying disused frivolities and it can hardly be doubted by any candid observer that the nascent or latent errors which god pardoned in times of ignorance became unpardonable when they were formally defined and defended that fallacies which were forgiven to the enthusiasm of a multitude were avenged upon the stubbornness of a council that above all the great invention of the age which rendered gods word accessible to every man left all sins against its light incapable of excuse or expiation and that from the moment when rome set herself in direct opposition to the bible the judgment was pronounced upon her which made her the scorn and the prey of her own children and cast her down from the throne where she had magnified herself against heaven so low that at last the unimaginable scene of the bethlehem humiliation was mocked in the temples of christianity judea had seen her god laid in the manger of the beasts of burden it was for christendom to stable the beasts of burden by the altar of her god  § xcviii nor on the other hand was the opposition of protestantism to the papacy less injurious to itself that opposition was for the most part intemperate undistinguishing and incautious it could indeed hardly be otherwise fresh bleeding from the sword of rome and still trembling at her anathema the reformed churches were little likely to remember any of her benefits or to regard any of her teaching forced by the romanist contumely into habits of irreverence by the romanist fallacies into habits of disbelief the selftrusting rashlyreasoning spirit gained ground among them daily sect branched out of sect presumption rose over presumption the miracles of the early church were denied and its martyrs forgotten though their power and palm were claimed by the members of every persecuted sect pride malice wrath love of change masked themselves under the thirst for truth and mingled with the just resentment of deception so that it became impossible even for the best and truest men to know the plague of their own hearts while avarice and impiety openly transformed reformation into robbery and reproof into sacrilege ignorance could as easily lead the foes of the church as lull her slumber men who would once have been the unquestioning recipients were now the shameless inventors of absurd or perilous superstitions they who were of the temper that walketh in darkness gained little by having discovered their guides to be blind and the simplicity of the faith ill understood and contumaciously alleged became an excuse for the rejection of the highest arts and most tried wisdom of mankind while the learned infidel standing aloof drew his own conclusions both from the rancor of the antagonists and from their errors believed each in all that he alleged against the other and smiled with superior humanity as he watched the winds of the alps drift the ashes of jerome and the dust of england drink the blood of king charles  § xcix now all this evil was of course entirely independent of the renewal of the study of pagan writers but that renewal found the faith of christendom already weakened and divided and therefore it was itself productive of an effect tenfold greater than could have been apprehended from it at another time it acted first as before noticed in leading the attention of all men to words instead of things for it was discovered that the language of the middle ages had been corrupt and the primal object of every scholar became now to purify his style to this study of words that of forms being added both as of matters of the first importance half the intellect of the age was at once absorbed in the base sciences of grammar logic and rhetoric studies utterly unworthy of the serious labor of men and necessarily rendering those employed upon them incapable of high thoughts or noble emotion of the debasing tendency of philology no proof is needed beyond once reading a grammarians notes on a great poet logic is unnecessary for men who can reason and about as useful to those who cannot as a machine for forcing one foot in due succession before the other would be to a man who could not walk while the study of rhetoric is exclusively one for men who desire to deceive or be deceived he who has the truth at his heart need never fear the want of persuasion on his tongue or if he fear it it is because the base rhetoric of dishonesty keeps the truth from being heard  § c the study of these sciences therefore naturally made men shallow and dishonest in general but it had a peculiarly fatal effect with respect to religion in the view which men took of the bible christs teaching was discovered not to be rhetorical st pauls preaching not to be logical and the greek of the new testament not to be grammatical the stern truth the profound pathos the impatient period leaping from point to point and leaving the intervals for the hearer to fill the comparatively hebraized and unelaborate idiom had little in them of attraction for the students of phrase and syllogism and the chief knowledge of the age became one of the chief stumblingblocks to its religion  § ci but it was not the grammarian and logician alone who was thus retarded or perverted in them there had been small loss the men who could truly appreciate the higher excellences of the classics were carried away by a current of enthusiasm which withdrew them from every other study christianity was still professed as a matter of form but neither the bible nor the writings of the fathers had time left for their perusal still less heart left for their acceptance the human mind is not capable of more than a certain amount of admiration or reverence and that which was given to horace was withdrawn from david religion is of all subjects that which will least endure a second place in the heart or thoughts and a languid and occasional study of it was sure to lead to error or infidelity on the other hand what was heartily admired and unceasingly contemplated was soon brought nigh to being believed and the systems of pagan mythology began gradually to assume the places in the human mind from which the unwatched christianity was wasting men did not indeed openly sacrifice to jupiter or build silver shrines for diana but the ideas of paganism nevertheless became thoroughly vital and present with them at all times and it did not matter in the least as far as respected the power of true religion whether the pagan image was believed in or not so long as it entirely occupied the thoughts the scholar of the sixteenth century if he saw the lightning shining from the east unto the west thought forthwith of jupiter not of the coming of the son of man if he saw the moon walking in brightness he thought of diana not of the throne which was to be established for ever as a faithful witness in heaven and though his heart was but secretly enticed yet thus he denied the god that is above25  and indeed this double creed of christianity confessed and paganism beloved was worse than paganism itself inasmuch as it refused effective and practical belief altogether it would have been better to have worshipped diana and jupiter at once than to have gone on through the whole of life naming one god imagining another and dreading none better a thousandfold to have been a pagan suckled in some creed outworn than to have stood by the great sea of eternity and seen no god walking on its waves no heavenly world on its horizon  § cii this fatal result of an enthusiasm for classical literature was hastened and heightened by the misdirection of the powers of art the imagination of the age was actively set to realize these objects of pagan belief and all the most exalted faculties of man which up to that period had been employed in the service of faith were now transferred to the service of fiction the invention which had formerly been both sanctified and strengthened by laboring under the command of settled intention and on the ground of assured belief had now the reins laid upon its neck by passion and all ground of fact cut from beneath its feet and the imagination which formerly had helped men to apprehend the truth now tempted them to believe a falsehood the faculties themselves wasted away in their own treason one by one they fell in the potters field and the raphael who seemed sent and inspired from heaven that he might paint apostles and prophets sank at once into powerlessness at the feet of apollo and the muses  § ciii but this was not all the habit of using the greatest gifts of imagination upon fictitious subjects of course destroyed the honor and value of the same imagination used in the cause of truth exactly in the proportion in which jupiters and mercuries were embodied and believed in that proportion virgins and angels were disembodied and disbelieved the images summoned by art began gradually to assume one average value in the spectators mind and incidents from the iliad and from the exodus to come within the same degrees of credibility and farther while the powers of the imagination were becoming daily more and more languid because unsupported by faith the manual skill and science of the artist were continually on the increase when these had reached a certain point they began to be the principal things considered in the picture and its story or scene to be thought of only as a theme for their manifestation observe the difference in old times men used their powers of painting to show the objects of faith in later times they used the objects of faith that they might show their powers of painting the distinction is enormous the difference incalculable as irreconcilable and thus the more skilful the artist the less his subject was regarded and the hearts of men hardened as their handling softened until they reached a point when sacred profane or sensual subjects were employed with absolute indifference for the display of color and execution and gradually the mind of europe congealed into that state of utter apathyinconceivable unless it had been witnessed and unpardonable unless by us who have been infected by itwhich permits us to place the madonna and the aphrodite side by side in our galleries and to pass with the same unmoved inquiry into the manner of their handling from a bacchanal to a nativity  now all this evil observe would have been merely the necessary and natural operation of an enthusiasm for the classics and of a delight in the mere science of the artist on the most virtuous mind but this operation took place upon minds enervated by luxury and which were tempted at the very same period to forgetfulness or denial of all religious principle by their own basest instincts the faith which had been undermined by the genius of pagans was overthrown by the crimes of christians and the ruin which was begun by scholarship was completed by sensuality the characters of the heathen divinities were as suitable to the manners of the time as their forms were agreeable to its taste and paganism again became in effect the religion of europe that is to say the civilized world is at this moment collectively just as pagan as it was in the second century a small body of believers being now as they were then representative of the church of christ in the midst of the faithless but there is just this difference and this very fatal one between the second and nineteenth centuries that the pagans are nominally and fashionably christians and that there is every conceivable variety and shade of belief between the two so that not only is it most difficult theoretically to mark the point where hesitating trust and failing practice change into definite infidelity but it has become a point of politeness not to inquire too deeply into our neighbors religious opinions and so that no one be offended by violent breach of external forms to waive any close examination into the tenets of faith the fact is we distrust each other and ourselves so much that we dare not press this matter we know that if on any occasion of general intercourse we turn to our next neighbor and put to him some searching or testing question we shall in nine cases out of ten discover him to be only a christian in his own way and as far as he thinks proper and that he doubts of many things which we ourselves do not believe strongly enough to hear doubted without danger what is in reality cowardice and faithlessness we call charity and consider it the part of benevolence sometimes to forgive mens evil practice for the sake of their accurate faith and sometimes to forgive their confessed heresy for the sake of their admirable practice and under this shelter of charity humility and faintheartedness the world unquestioned by others or by itself mingles with and overwhelms the small body of christians legislates for them moralizes for them reasons for them and though itself of course greatly and beneficently influenced by the association and held much in check by its pretence to christianity yet undermines in nearly the same degree the sincerity and practical power of christianity itself until at last in the very institutions of which the administration may be considered as the principal test of the genuineness of national religion those devoted to education the pagan system is completely triumphant and the entire body of the socalled christian world has established a system of instruction for its youth wherein neither the history of christs church nor the language of gods law is considered a study of the smallest importance wherein of all subjects of human inquiry his own religion is the one in which a youths ignorance is most easily forgiven26 and in which it is held a light matter that he should be daily guilty of lying or debauchery or of blasphemy so only that he write latin verses accurately and with speed  i believe that in few years more we shall wake from all these errors in astonishment as from evil dreams having been preserved in the midst of their madness by those hidden roots of active and earnest christianity which gods grace has bound in the english nation with iron and brass but in the venetian those roots themselves had withered and from the palace of their ancient religion their pride cast them forth hopelessly to the pasture of the brute from pride to infidelity from infidelity to the unscrupulous and insatiable pursuit of pleasure and from this to irremediable degradation the transitions were swift like the falling of a star the great palaces of the haughtiest nobles of venice were stayed before they had risen far above their foundations by the blast of a penal poverty and the wild grass on the unfinished fragments of their mighty shafts waves at the tidemark where the power of the godless people first heard the hitherto shalt thou come

scientific men of forty centuries      before i approach this question permit me to make a few remarks on     the prehistoric period of greece that era which seems to have     produced nearly all the great men      on looking attentively at the statues within my observation i     cannot find the slightest foundation for the assertion that their     sculptors must have dissected the human frame and been well     acquainted with the human anatomy they like homer had discovered     natures secret and bestowed their whole attention on the exterior     the exterior they read profoundly and studied deeplythe living     exterior and the dead above all they avoided displaying the     dead and dissected interior through the exterior they had     discovered that the interior presents hideous shapes but not forms     men during the philosophic era of greece saw all this each reading     the antique to the best of his abilities the man of genius     rediscovered the canon of the ancient masters

remembering at the     same time what i have above said that the root of all great art in     europe is struck in the thirteenth century and that the great time     is from 1250 to 1350      in germany the tenth century leibnitz declares was a golden age     of learning compared with the thirteenth      the writers of the thirteenth century display an incredible     ignorance not only of pure idiom but of common grammatical rules      the fourteenth century was not superior to the thirteenth in     learning we may justly praise richard of bury for his zeal in     collecting books but his erudition appears crude his style     indifferent and his thoughts superficial      i doubt the superficialness of the thoughts at all events this     is not a character of the time though it may be of the writer for     this would affect art more even than literature    13 churtons early english church london 1840    14 quibus nulla macula inest quæ non cernatur ita viri nobilitate

authorities     that i had not had time enough to read the epistles properly i was     told that the epistles were separate sciences and i need not     trouble myself about them      the reader will find some farther notes on this subject in appendix     7 modern education     chapter iii  grotesque renaissance   § i in the close of the last chapter it was noted that the phases of transition in the moral temper of the falling venetians during their fall were from pride to infidelity and from infidelity to the unscrupulous pursuit of pleasure during the last years of the existence of the state the minds both of the nobility and the people seem to have been set simply upon the attainment of the means of selfindulgence there was not strength enough in them to be proud nor forethought enough to be ambitious one by one the possessions of the state were abandoned to its enemies one by one the channels of its trade were forsaken by its own languor or occupied and closed against it by its more energetic rivals and the time the resources and the thoughts of the nation were exclusively occupied in the invention of such fantastic and costly pleasures as might best amuse their apathy lull their remorse or disguise their ruin  § ii the architecture raised at venice during this period is amongst the worst and basest ever built by the hands of men being especially distinguished by a spirit of brutal mockery and insolent jest which exhausting itself in deformed and monstrous sculpture can sometimes be hardly otherwise defined than as the perpetuation in stone of the ribaldries of drunkenness on such a period and on such work it is painful to dwell and i had not originally intended to do so but i found that the entire spirit of the renaissance could not be comprehended unless it was followed to its consummation and that there were many most interesting questions arising out of the study of this particular spirit of jesting with reference to which i have called it the grotesque renaissance for it is not this period alone which is distinguished by such a spirit there is jestperpetual careless and not unfrequently obscenein the most noble work of the gothic periods and it becomes therefore of the greatest possible importance to examine into the nature and essence of the grotesque itself and to ascertain in what respect it is that the jesting of art in its highest flight differs from its jesting in its utmost degradation  § iii the place where we may best commence our inquiry is one renowned in the history of venice the space of ground before the church of santa maria formosa a spot which after the rialto and st marks place ought to possess a peculiar interest in the mind of the traveller in consequence of its connexion with the most touching and true legend of the brides of venice that legend is related at length in every venetian history and finally has been told by the poet rogers in a way which renders it impossible for any one to tell it after him i have only therefore to remind the reader that the capture of the brides took place in the cathedral church st pietro di castello and that this of santa maria formosa is connected with the tale only because it was yearly visited with prayers by the venetian maidens on the anniversary of their ancestors deliverance for that deliverance their thanks were to be rendered to the virgin and there was no church then dedicated to the virgin in venice except this27  neither of the cathedral church nor of this dedicated to st mary the beautiful is one stone left upon another but from that which has been raised on the site of the latter we may receive a most important lesson introductory to our immediate subject if first we glance back to the traditional history of the church which has been destroyed  § iv no more honorable epithet than traditional can be attached to what is recorded concerning it yet i should grieve to lose the legend of its first erection the bishop of uderzo driven by the lombards from his bishopric as he was praying beheld in a vision the virgin mother who ordered him to found a church in her honor in the place where he should see a white cloud rest and when he went out the white cloud went before him and on the place where it rested he built a church and it was called the church of st mary the beautiful from the loveliness of the form in which she had appeared in the vision28  the first church stood only for about two centuries it was rebuilt in 864 and enriched with various relics some fifty years later relics belonging principally to st nicodemus and much lamented when they and the church were together destroyed by fire in 1105  it was then rebuilt in magnifica forma much resembling according to corner the architecture of the chancel of st mark29 but the information which i find in various writers as to the period at which it was reduced to its present condition is both sparing and contradictory  § v thus by corner we are told that this church resembling st marks remained untouched for more than four centuries until in 1689 it was thrown down by an earthquake and restored by the piety of a rich merchant turrin toroni in ornatissima forma and that for the greater beauty of the renewed church it had added to it two façades of marble with this information that of the padre dell oratoria agrees only he gives the date of the earlier rebuilding of the church in 1175 and ascribes it to an architect of the name of barbetta but quadri in his usually accurate little guide tells us that this barbetta rebuilt the church in the fourteenth century and that of the two façades so much admired by corner one is of the sixteenth century and its architect unknown and the rest of the church is of the seventeenth in the style of sansovino  § vi there is no occasion to examine or endeavor to reconcile these conflicting accounts all that is necessary for the reader to know is that every vestige of the church in which the ceremony took place was destroyed at least as early as 1689 and that the ceremony itself having been abolished in the close of the fourteenth century is only to be conceived as taking place in that more ancient church resembling st marks which even according to quadri existed until that period i would therefore endeavor to fix the readers mind for a moment on the contrast between the former and latter aspect of this plot of ground the former when it had its byzantine church and its yearly procession of the doge and the brides and the latter when it has its renaissance church in the style of sansovino and its yearly honoring is done away  § vii and first let us consider for a little the significance and nobleness of that early custom of the venetians which brought about the attack and the rescue of the year 943 that there should be but one marriage day for the nobles of the whole nation30 so that all might rejoice together and that the sympathy might be full not only of the families who that year beheld the alliance of their children and prayed for them in one crowd weeping before the altar but of all the families of the state who saw in the day which brought happiness to others the anniversary of their own imagine the strong bond of brotherhood thus sanctified among them and consider also the effect on the minds of the youth of the state the greater deliberation and openness necessarily given to the contemplation of marriage to which all the people were solemnly to bear testimony the more lofty and unselfish tone which it would give to all their thoughts it was the exact contrary of stolen marriage it was marriage to which god and man were taken for witnesses and every eye was invoked for its glance and every tongue for its prayers31  § viii later historians have delighted themselves in dwelling on the pageantry of the marriage day itself but i do not find that they have authority for the splendor of their descriptions i cannot find a word in the older chronicles about the jewels or dress of the brides and i believe the ceremony to have been more quiet and homely than is usually supposed the only sentence which gives color to the usual accounts of it is one of sansovinos in which he says that the magnificent dress of the brides in his day was founded on ancient custom32 however this may have been the circumstances of the rite were otherwise very simple each maiden brought her dowry with her in a small cassetta or chest they went first to the cathedral and waited for the youths who having come they heard mass together and the bishop preached to them and blessed them and so each bridegroom took his bride and her dowry and bore her home  § ix it seems that the alarm given by the attack of the pirates put an end to the custom of fixing one day for all marriages but the main objects of the institution were still attained by the perfect publicity given to the marriages of all the noble families the bridegroom standing in the court of the ducal palace to receive congratulations on his betrothal and the whole body of the nobility attending the nuptials and rejoicing as at some personal good fortune since by the constitution of the state they are for ever incorporated together as if of one and the same family33 but the festival of the 2nd of february after the year 943 seems to have been observed only in memory of the deliverance of the brides and no longer set apart for public nuptials  § x there is much difficulty in reconciling the various accounts or distinguishing the inaccurate ones of the manner of keeping this memorable festival i shall first give sansovinos which is the popular one and then note the points of importance in the counterstatements sansovino says that the success of the pursuit of the pirates was owing to the ready help and hard fighting of the men of the district of sta maria formosa for the most part trunkmakers and that they having been presented after the victory to the doge and the senate were told to ask some favor for their reward the good men then said that they desired the prince with his wife and the signory to visit every year the church of their district on the day of its feast and the prince asking them suppose it should rain they answered we will give you hats to cover you and if you are thirsty we will give you to drink whence is it that the vicar in the name of the people presents to the doge on his visit two flasks of malvoisie34 and two oranges and presents to him two gilded hats bearing the arms of the pope of the prince and of the vicar and thus was instituted the feast of the maries which was called noble and famous because the people from all round came together to behold it and it was celebrated in this manner the account which follows is somewhat prolix but its substance is briefly that twelve maidens were elected two for each division of the city and that it was decided by lot which contrade or quarters of the town should provide them with dresses this was done at enormous expense one contrada contending with another and even the jewels of the treasury of st mark being lent for the occasion to the maries as the twelve damsels were called they being thus dressed with gold and silver and jewels went in their galley to st marks for the doge who joined them with the signory and went first to san pietro di castello to hear mass on st marks day the 31st of january and to santa maria formosa on the 2nd of february the intermediate day being spent in passing in procession through the streets of the city and sometimes there arose quarrels about the places they should pass through for every one wanted them to pass by his house  § xi nearly the same account is given by corner who however does not say anything about the hats or the malvoisie these however we find again in the matricola de casseleri which of course sets the services of the trunkmakers and the privileges obtained by them in the most brilliant light the quaintness of the old venetian is hardly to be rendered into english and you must know that the said trunkmakers were the men who were the cause of such victory and of taking the galley and of cutting all the triestines to pieces because at that time they were valiant men and well in order the which victory was on the 2nd february on the day of the madonna of candles and at the request and entreaties of the said trunkmakers it was decreed that the doge every year as long as venice shall endure should go on the eve of the said feast to vespers in the said church with the signory and be it noted that the vicar is obliged to give to the doge two flasks of malvoisie with two oranges besides and so it is observed and will be observed always the reader must observe the continual confusion between st marks day the 31st of january and candlemas the 2nd of february the fact appears to be that the marriage day in the old republic was st marks day and the recovery of the brides was the same day at evening so that as we are told by sansovino the commemorative festival began on that day but it was continued to the day of the purification that especial thanks might be rendered to the virgin and the visit to sta maria formosa being the most important ceremony of the whole festival the old chroniclers and even sansovino got confused and asserted the victory itself to have taken place on the day appointed for that pilgrimage  § xii i doubt not that the reader who is acquainted with the beautiful lines of rogers is as much grieved as i am at the interference of the casketmakers with the achievement which the poet ascribes to the bridegrooms alone an interference quite as inopportune as that of old le balafré with the victory of his nephew in the unsatisfactory conclusion of quentin durward i am afraid i cannot get the casketmakers quite out of the way but it may gratify some of my readers to know that a chronicle of the year 1378 quoted by galliciolli denies the agency of the people of sta maria formosa altogether in these terms some say that the people of sta m formosa were those who recovered the spoil predra i may notice in passing that most of the old chroniclers appear to consider the recovery of the caskets rather more a subject of congratulation than that of the brides and that for their reward they asked the doge and signory to visit sta m formosa but this is false the going to sta m formosa was because the thing had succeeded on that day and because this was then the only church in venice in honor of the virgin but here is again the mistake about the day itself and besides if we get rid altogether of the trunkmakers how are we to account for the ceremony of the oranges and hats of which the accounts seem authentic if however the reader likes to substitute carpenters or housebuilders for casketmakers he may do so with great reason vide galliciolli lib ii § 1758 but i fear that one or the other body of tradesmen must be allowed to have had no small share in the honor of the victory  § xiii but whatever doubt attaches to the particular circumstances of its origin there is none respecting the splendor of the festival itself as it was celebrated for four centuries afterwards we find that each contrada spent from 800 to 1000 zecchins in the dress of the maries entrusted to it but i cannot find among how many contrade the twelve maries were divided it is also to be supposed that most of the accounts given refer to the later periods of the celebration of the festival in the beginning of the eleventh century the good doge pietro orseolo ii left in his will the third of his entire fortune per la festa della marie and in the fourteenth century so many people came from the rest of italy to see it that special police regulations were made for it and the council of ten were twice summoned before it took place35 the expense lavished upon it seems to have increased till the year 1379 when all the resources of the republic were required for the terrible war of chiozza and all festivity was for that time put an end to the issue of the war left the venetians with neither the power nor the disposition to restore the festival on its ancient scale and they seem to have been ashamed to exhibit it in reduced splendor it was entirely abolished  § xiv as if to do away even with its memory every feature of the surrounding scene which was associated with that festival has been in succeeding ages destroyed with one solitary exception36 there is not a house left in the whole piazza of santa maria formosa from whose windows the festa of the maries has ever been seen of the church in which they worshipped not a stone is left even the form of the ground and direction of the neighboring canals are changed and there is now but one landmark to guide the steps of the traveller to the place where the white cloud rested and the shrine was built to st mary the beautiful yet the spot is still worth his pilgrimage for he may receive a lesson upon it though a painful one let him first fill his mind with the fair images of the ancient festival and then seek that landmark the tower of the modern church built upon the place where the daughters of venice knelt yearly with her noblest lords and let him look at the head that is carved on the base of the tower37 still dedicated to st mary the beautiful  § xv a headhuge inhuman and monstrousleering in bestial degradation too foul to be either pictured or described or to be beheld for more than an instant yet let it be endured for that instant for in that head is embodied the type of the evil spirit to which venice was abandoned in the fourth period of her decline and it is well that we should see and feel the full horror of it on this spot and know what pestilence it was that came and breathed upon her beauty until it melted away like the white cloud from the ancient fields of santa maria formosa  § xvi this head is one of many hundreds which disgrace the latest buildings of the city all more or less agreeing in their expression of sneering mockery in most cases enhanced by thrusting out the tongue most of them occur upon the bridges which were among the very last works undertaken by the republic several for instance upon the bridge of sighs and they are evidences of a delight in the contemplation of bestial vice and the expression of low sarcasm which is i believe the most hopeless state into which the human mind can fall this spirit of idiotic mockery is as i have said the most striking characteristic of the last period of the renaissance which in consequence of the character thus imparted to its sculpture i have called grotesque but it must be our immediate task and it will be a most interesting one to distinguish between this base grotesqueness and that magnificent condition of fantastic imagination which was above noticed as one of the chief elements of the northern gothic mind nor is this a question of interesting speculation merely for the distinction between the true and false grotesque is one which the present tendencies of the english mind have rendered it practically important to ascertain and that in a degree which until he has made some progress in the consideration of the subject the reader will hardly anticipate  § xvii but first i have to note one peculiarity in the late architecture of venice which will materially assist us in understanding the true nature of the spirit which is to be the subject of our inquiry and this peculiarity singularly enough is first exemplified in the very façade of santa maria formosa which is flanked by the grotesque head to which our attention has just been directed this façade whose architect is unknown consists of a pediment sustained on four corinthian pilasters and is i believe the earliest in venice which appears entirely destitute of every religious symbol sculpture or inscription unless the cardinals hat upon the shield in the centre of the impediment be considered a religious symbol the entire façade is nothing else than a monument to the admiral vincenzo cappello two tablets one between each pair of flanking pillars record his acts and honors and on the corresponding spaces upon the base of the church are two circular trophies composed of halberts arrows flags tridents helmets and lances sculptures which are just as valueless in a military as in an ecclesiastical point of view for being all copied from the forms of roman arms and armor they cannot even be referred to for information respecting the costume of the period over the door as the chief ornament of the façade exactly in the spot which in the barbarous st marks is occupied by the figure of christ is the statue of vincenzo cappello in roman armor he died in 1542 and we have therefore the latter part of the sixteenth century fixed as the period when in venice churches were first built to the glory of man instead of the glory of god  § xviii throughout the whole of scripture history nothing is more remarkable than the close connection of punishment with the sin of vainglory every other sin is occasionally permitted to remain for lengthened periods without definite chastisement but the forgetfulness of god and the claim of honor by man as belonging to himself are visited at once whether in hezekiah nebuchadnezzar or herod with the most tremendous punishment we have already seen that the first reason for the fall of venice was the manifestation of such a spirit and it is most singular to observe the definiteness with which it is here markedas if so appointed that it might be impossible for future ages to miss the lesson for in the long inscriptions38 which record the acts of vincenzo cappello it might at least have been anticipated that some expressions would occur indicative of remaining pretence to religious feeling or formal acknowledgement of divine power but there are none whatever the name of god does not once occur that of st mark is found only in the statement that cappello was a procurator of the church there is no word touching either on the faith or hope of the deceased and the only sentence which alludes to supernatural powers at all alludes to them under the heathen name of fates in its explanation of what the admiral cappello would have accomplished nisi fata christianis adversa vetuissent  § xix having taken sufficient note of all the baseness of mind which these facts indicate in the people we shall not be surprised to find immediate signs of dotage in the conception of their architecture the churches raised throughout this period are so grossly debased that even the italian critics of the present day who are partially awakened to the true state of art in italy though blind as yet to its true cause exhaust their terms of reproach upon these last efforts of the renaissance builders the two churches of san moisè and santa maria zobenigo which are among the most remarkable in venice for their manifestation of insolent atheism are characterized by lazari the one as culmine dogni follia architettonica the other as orrido ammasso di pietra distria with added expressions of contempt as just as it is unmitigated  § xx now both these churches which i should like the reader to visit in succession if possible after that of sta maria formosa agree with that church and with each other in being totally destitute of religious symbols and entirely dedicated to the honor of two venetian families in san moisè a bust of vincenzo fini is set on a tall narrow pyramid above the central door with this marvellous inscription    omne fastigivm    virtvte implet    vincentivs fini  it is very difficult to translate this for fastigium besides its general sense has a particular one in architecture and refers to the part of the building occupied by the bust but the main meaning of it is that vincenzo fini fills all height with his virtue the inscription goes on into farther praise but this example is enough over the two lateral doors are two other laudatory inscriptions of younger members of the fini family the dates of death of the three heroes being 1660 1685 and 1726 marking thus the period of consummate degradation  illustration plate iii                noble and ignoble grotesque  § xxi in like manner the church of santa maria zobenigo is entirely dedicated to the barbaro family the only religious symbols with which it is invested being statues of angels blowing brazen trumpets intended to express the spreading of the fame of the barbaro family in heaven at the top of the church is venice crowned between justice and temperance justice holding a pair of grocers scales of iron swinging in the wind there is a twonecked stone eagle the barbaro crest with a copper crown in the centre of the pediment a huge statue of a barbaro in armor with a fantastic headdress over the central door and four barbaros in niches two on each side of it strutting statues in the common stage postures of the periodjo maria barbaro sapiens ordinum marinus barbaro senator reading a speech in a ciceronian attitude franc barbaro legatus in classe in armor with highheeled boots and looking resolutely fierce and carolus barbaro sapiens ordinum the decorations of the façade being completed by two trophies consisting of drums trumpets flags and cannon and six plans sculptured in relief of the towns of zara candia padua rome corfu and spalatro  § xxii when the traveller has sufficiently considered the meaning of this façade he ought to visit the church of st eustachio remarkable for the dramatic effect of the group of sculpture on its façade and then the church of the ospedaletto see index under head ospedaletto noticing on his way the heads on the foundations of the palazzo corner della regina and the palazzo pesaro and any other heads carved on the modern bridges closing with those on the bridge of sighs  he will then have obtained a perfect idea of the style and feeling of the grotesque renaissance i cannot pollute this volume by any illustration of its worst forms but the head turned to the front on the righthand in the opposite plate will give the general reader an idea of its most graceful and refined developments the figure set beside it on the left is a piece of noble grotesque from fourteenth century gothic and it must be our present task to ascertain the nature of the difference which exists between the two by an accurate inquiry into the true essence of the grotesque spirit itself  § xxiii first then it seems to me that the grotesque is in almost all cases composed of two elements one ludicrous the other fearful that as one or other of these elements prevails the grotesque falls into two branches sportive grotesque and terrible grotesque but that we cannot legitimately consider it under these two aspects because there are hardly any examples which do not in some degree combine both elements there are few grotesques so utterly playful as to be overcast with no shade of fearfulness and few so fearful as absolutely to exclude all ideas of jest but although we cannot separate the grotesque itself into two branches we may easily examine separately the two conditions of mind which it seems to combine and consider successively what are the kinds of jest and what the kinds of fearfulness which may be legitimately expressed in the various walks of art and how their expressions actually occur in the gothic and renaissance schools  first then what are the conditions of playfulness which we may fitly express in noble art or which for this is the same thing are consistent with nobleness in humanity in other words what is the proper function of play with respect not to youth merely but to all mankind  § xxiv it is a much more serious question than may be at first supposed for a healthy manner of play is necessary in order to a healthy manner of work and because the choice of our recreation is in most cases left to ourselves while the nature of our work is generally fixed by necessity or authority it may be well doubted whether more distressful consequences may not have resulted from mistaken choice in play than from mistaken direction in labor  § xxv observe however that we are only concerned here with that kind of play which causes laughter or implies recreation not with that which consists in the excitement of the energies whether of body or mind muscular exertion is indeed in youth one of the conditions of recreation but neither the violent bodily labor which children of all ages agree to call play nor the grave excitement of the mental faculties in games of skill or chance are in anywise connected with the state of feeling we have here to investigate namely that sportiveness which man possesses in common with many inferior creatures but to which his higher faculties give nobler expression in the various manifestations of wit humor and fancy  with respect to the manner in which this instinct of playfulness is indulged or repressed mankind are broadly distinguishable into four classes the men who play wisely who play necessarily who play inordinately and who play not at all  § xxvi first those who play wisely it is evident that the idea of any kind of play can only be associated with the idea of an imperfect childish and fatigable nature as far as men can raise that nature so that it shall no longer be interested by trifles or exhausted by toils they raise it above play he whose heart is at once fixed upon heaven and open to the earth so as to apprehend the importance of heavenly doctrines and the compass of human sorrow will have little disposition for jest and exactly in proportion to the breadth and depth of his character and intellect will be in general the incapability of surprise or exuberant and sudden emotion which must render play impossible it is however evidently not intended that many men should even reach far less pass their lives in that solemn state of thoughtfulness which brings them into the nearest brotherhood with their divine master and the highest and healthiest state which is competent to ordinary humanity appears to be that which accepting the necessity of recreation and yielding to the impulses of natural delight springing out of health and innocence does indeed condescend often to playfulness but never without such deep love of god of truth and of humanity as shall make even its slightest words reverent its idlest fancies profitable and its keenest satire indulgent wordsworth and plato furnish us with perhaps the finest and highest examples of this playfulness in the one case unmixed with satire the perfectly simple effusion of that spiritin    which gives to all the selfsame bent    whose life is wise and innocent  plato and by the by in a very wise book of our own times not unworthy of being named in such companionship friends in council mingled with an exquisitely tender and loving satire  § xxvii secondly the men who play necessarily that highest species of playfulness which we have just been considering is evidently the condition of a mind not only highly cultivated but so habitually trained to intellectual labor that it can bring a considerable force of accurate thought into its moments even of recreation this is not possible unless so much repose of mind and heart are enjoyed even at the periods of greatest exertion that the rest required by the system is diffused over the whole life to the majority of mankind such a state is evidently unattainable they must perforce pass a large part of their lives in employments both irksome and toilsome demanding an expenditure of energy which exhausts the system and yet consuming that energy upon subjects incapable of interesting the nobler faculties when such employments are intermitted those noble instincts fancy imagination and curiosity are all hungry for the food which the labor of the day has denied to them while yet the weariness of the body in a great degree forbids their application to any serious subject they therefore exert themselves without any determined purpose and under no vigorous restraint but gather as best they may such various nourishment and put themselves to such fantastic exercise as may soonest indemnify them for their past imprisonment and prepare them to endure their recurrence this sketching of the mental limbs as their fetters fall awaythis leaping and dancing of the heart and intellect when they are restored to the fresh air of heaven yet half paralyzed by their captivity and unable to turn themselves to any earnest purposei call necessary play it is impossible to exaggerate its importance whether in polity or in art  § xxviii thirdly the men who play inordinately the most perfect state of society which consistently with due understanding of mans nature it may be permitted us to conceive would be one in which the whole human race were divided more or less distinctly into workers and thinkers that is to say into the two classes who only play wisely or play necessarily but the number and the toil of the working class are enormously increased probably more than doubled by the vices of the men who neither play wisely nor necessarily but are enabled by circumstances and permitted by their want of principle to make amusement the object of their existence there is not any moment of the lives of such men which is not injurious to others both because they leave the work undone which was appointed for them and because they necessarily think wrongly whenever it becomes compulsory upon them to think at all the greater portion of the misery of this world arises from the false opinions of men whose idleness has physically incapacitated them from forming true ones every duty which we omit obscures some truth which we should have known and the guilt of a life spent in the pursuit of pleasure is twofold partly consisting in the perversion of action and partly in the dissemination of falsehood  § xxix there is however a less criminal though hardly less dangerous condition of mind which though not failing in its more urgent duties fails in the finer conscientiousness which regulates the degree and directs the choice of amusement at those times when amusement is allowable the most frequent error in this respect is the want of reverence in approaching subjects of importance or sacredness and of caution in the expression of thoughts which may encourage like irreverence in others and these faults are apt to gain upon the mind until it becomes habitually more sensible to what is ludicrous and accidental than to what is grave and essential in any subject that is brought before it or even at last desires to perceive or to know nothing but what may end in jest very generally minds of this character are active and able and many of them are so far conscientious that they believe their jesting forwards their work but it is difficult to calculate the harm they do by destroying the reverence which is our best guide into all truth for weakness and evil are easily visible but greatness and goodness are often latent and we do infinite mischief by exposing weakness to eyes which cannot comprehend greatness this error however is more connected with abuses of the satirical than of the playful instinct and i shall have more to say of it presently  § xxx lastly the men who do not play at all those who are so dull or so morose as to be incapable of inventing or enjoying jest and in whom care guilt or pride represses all healthy exhilaration of the fancy or else men utterly oppressed with labor and driven too hard by the necessities of the world to be capable of any species of happy relaxation  § xxxi we have now to consider the way in which the presence or absence of joyfulness in these several classes is expressed in art  1 wise play the first and noblest class hardly ever speak through art except seriously they feel its nobleness too profoundly and value the time necessary for its production too highly to employ it in the rendering of trivial thoughts the playful fancy of a moment may innocently be expressed by the passing word but he can hardly have learned the preciousness of life who passes days in the elaboration of a jest and as to what regards the delineation of human character the nature of all noble art is to epitomize and embrace so much at once that its subject can never be altogether ludicrous it must possess all the solemnities of the whole not the brightness of the partial truth for all truth that makes us smile is partial the novelist amuses us by his relation of a particular incident but the painter cannot set any one of his characters before us without giving some glimpse of its whole career that of which the historian informs us in successive pages it is the task of the painter to inform us of at once writing upon the countenance not merely the expression of the moment but the history of the life and the history of a life can never be a jest  whatever part therefore of the sportive energy of these men of the highest class would be expressed in verbal wit or humor finds small utterance through their art and will assuredly be confined if it occur there at all to scattered and trivial incidents but so far as their minds can recreate themselves by the imagination of strange yet not laughable forms which either in costume in landscape or in any other accessaries may be combined with those necessary for their more earnest purposes we find them delighting in such inventions and a species of grotesqueness thence arising in all their work which is indeed one of its most valuable characteristics but which is so intimately connected with the sublime or terrible form of the grotesque that it will be better to notice it under that head  § xxxii 2 necessary play i have dwelt much in a former portion of this work on the justice and desirableness of employing the minds of inferior workmen and of the lower orders in general in the production of objects of art of one kind or another so far as men of this class are compelled to hard manual labor for their daily bread so far forth their artistical efforts must be rough and ignorant and their artistical perceptions comparatively dull now it is not possible with blunt perceptions and rude hands to produce works which shall be pleasing by their beauty but it is perfectly possible to produce such as shall be interesting by their character or amusing by their satire for one hardworking man who possesses the finer instincts which decide on perfection of lines and harmonies of color twenty possess dry humor or quaint fancy not because these faculties were originally given to the human race or to any section of it in greater degree than the sense of beauty but because these are exercised in our daily intercourse with each other and developed by the interest which we take in the affairs of life while the others are not and because therefore a certain degree of success will probably attend the effort to express this humor or fancy while comparative failure will assuredly result from an ignorant struggle to reach the forms of solemn beauty the workingman who turns his attention partially to art will probably and wisely choose to do that which he can do best and indulge the pride of an effective satire rather than subject himself to assured mortification in the pursuit of beauty and this the more because we have seen that his application to art is to be playful and recreative and it is not in recreation that the conditions of perfection can be fulfilled  § xxxiii now all the forms of art which result from the comparatively recreative exertion of minds more or less blunted or encumbered by other cares and toils the art which we may call generally art of the wayside as opposed to that which is the business of mens lives is in the best sense of the word grotesque and it is noble or inferior first according to the tone of the minds which have produced it and in proportion to their knowledge wit love of truth and kindness secondly according to the degree of strength they have been able to give forth but yet however much we may find in it needing to be forgiven always delightful so long as it is the work of good and ordinarily intelligent men and its delightfulness ought mainly to consist in those very imperfections which mark it for work done in times of rest it is not its own merit so much as the enjoyment of him who produced it which is to be the source of the spectators pleasure it is to the strength of his sympathy not to the accuracy of his criticism that it makes appeal and no man can indeed be a lover of what is best in the higher walks of art who has not feeling and charity enough to rejoice with the rude sportiveness of hearts that have escaped out of prison and to be thankful for the flowers which men have laid their burdens down to sow by the wayside  § xxxiv and consider what a vast amount of human work this right understanding of its meaning will make fruitful and admirable to us which otherwise we could only have passed by with contempt there is very little architecture in the world which is in the full sense of the words good and noble a few pieces of italian gothic and romanesque a few scattered fragments of gothic cathedrals and perhaps two or three of greek temples are all that we possess approaching to an ideal of perfection all the restegyptian norman arabian and most gothic and which is very noticeable for the most part all the strongest and mightiestdepend for their power on some developement of the grotesque spirit but much more the inferior domestic architecture of the middle ages and what similar conditions remain to this day in countries from which the life of art has not yet been banished by its laws the fantastic gables built up in scrollwork and steps of the flemish street the pinnacled roofs set with their small humorist double windows as if with so many ears and eyes of northern france the blackened timbers crossed and carved into every conceivable waywardness of imagination of normandy and old england the rude hewing of the pine timbers of the swiss cottage the projecting turrets and bracketed oriels of the german street these and a thousand other forms not in themselves reaching any high degree of excellence are yet admirable and most precious as the fruits of a rejoicing energy in uncultivated minds it is easier to take away the energy than to add the cultivation and the only effect of the better knowledge which civilized nations now possess has been as we have seen in a former chapter to forbid their being happy without enabling them to be great  § xxxv it is very necessary however with respect to this provincial or rustic architecture that we should carefully distinguish its truly grotesque from its picturesque elements in the seven lamps i defined the picturesque to be parasitical sublimity or sublimity belonging to the external or accidental characters of a thing not to the thing itself for instance when a highland cottage roof is covered with fragments of shale instead of slates it becomes picturesque because the irregularity and rude fractures of the rocks and their grey and gloomy color give to it something of the savageness and much of the general aspect of the slope of a mountain side but as a mere cottage roof it cannot be sublime and whatever sublimity it derives from the wildness or sternness which the mountains have given it in its covering is so far forth parasitical the mountain itself would have been grand which is much more than picturesque but the cottage cannot be grand as such and the parasitical grandeur which it may possess by accidental qualities is the character for which men have long agreed to use the inaccurate word picturesque  § xxxvi on the other hand beauty cannot be parasitical there is nothing so small or so contemptible but it may be beautiful in its own right the cottage may be beautiful and the smallest moss that grows on its roof and the minutest fibre of that moss which the microscope can raise into visible form and all of them in their own right not less than the mountains and the sky so that we use no peculiar term to express their beauty however diminutive but only when the sublime element enters without sufficient worthiness in the nature of the thing to which it is attached  § xxxvii now this picturesque element which is always given if by nothing else merely by ruggedness adds usually very largely to the pleasurableness of grotesque work especially to that of its inferior kinds but it is not for this reason to be confounded with the grotesqueness itself the knots and rents of the timbers the irregular lying of the shingles on the roofs the vigorous light and shadow the fractures and weatherstains of the old stones which were so deeply loved and so admirably rendered by our lost prout are the picturesque elements of the architecture the grotesque ones are those which are not produced by the working of nature and of time but exclusively by the fancy of man and as also for the most part by his indolent and uncultivated fancy they are always in some degree wanting in grandeur unless the picturesque element be united with them  § xxxviii 3 inordinate play the reader will have some difficulty i fear in keeping clearly in his mind the various divisions of our subject but when he has once read the chapter through he will see their places and coherence we have next to consider the expression throughout of the minds of men who indulge themselves in unnecessary play it is evident that a large number of these men will be more refined and more highly educated than those who only play necessarily the power of pleasureseeking implies in general fortunate circumstances of life it is evident also that their play will not be so hearty so simple or so joyful and this deficiency of brightness will affect it in proportion to its unnecessary and unlawful continuance until at last it becomes a restless and dissatisfied indulgence in excitement or a painful delving after exhausted springs of pleasure  the art through which this temper is expressed will in all probability be refined and sensualtherefore also assuredly feeble and because in the failure of the joyful energy of the mind there will fail also its perceptions and its sympathies it will be entirely deficient in expression of character and acuteness of thought but will be peculiarly restless manifesting its desire for excitement in idle changes of subject and purpose incapable of true imagination it will seek to supply its place by exaggerations incoherencies and monstrosities and the form of the grotesque to which it gives rise will be an incongruous chain of hackneyed graces idly thrown togetherprettinesses or sublimities not of its own invention associated in forms which will be absurd without being fantastic and monstrous without being terrible and because in the continual pursuit of pleasure men lose both cheerfulness and charity there will be small hilarity but much malice in this grotesque yet a weak malice incapable of expressing its own bitterness not having grasp enough of truth to become forcible and exhausting itself in impotent or disgusting caricature  § xxxix of course there are infinite ranks and kinds of this grotesque according to the natural power of the minds which originate it and to the degree in which they have lost themselves its highest condition is that which first developed itself among the enervated romans and which was brought to the highest perfection of which it was capable by raphael in the arabesques of the vatican it may be generally described as an elaborate and luscious form of nonsense its lower conditions are found in the common upholstery and decorations which over the whole of civilized europe have sprung from this poisonous root an artistical pottage composed of nymphs cupids and satyrs with shreddings of heads and paws of meek wild beasts and nondescript vegetables and the lowest of all are those which have not even graceful models to recommend them but arise out of the corruption of the higher schools mingled with clownish or bestial satire as is the case in the latter renaissance of venice which we were above examining it is almost impossible to believe the depth to which the human mind can be debased in following this species of grotesque in a recent italian garden the favorite ornaments frequently consist of stucco images representing in dwarfish caricature the most disgusting types of manhood and womanhood which can be found amidst the dissipation of the modern drawingroom yet without either veracity or humor and dependent for whatever interest they possess upon simple grossness of expression and absurdity of costume grossness of one kind or another is indeed an unfailing characteristic of the style either latent as in the refined sensuality of the more graceful arabesques or in the worst examples manifested in every species of obscene conception and abominable detail in the head described in the opening of this chapter at santa maria formosa the teeth are represented as decayed  § xl 4 the minds of the fourth class of men who do not play at all are little likely to find expression in any trivial form of art except in bitterness of mockery and this character at once stamps the work in which it appears as belonging to the class of terrible rather than of playful grotesque we have therefore now to examine the state of mind which gave rise to this second and more interesting branch of imaginative work  § xli two great and principal passions are evidently appointed by the deity to rule the life of man namely the love of god and the fear of sin and of its companiondeath how many motives we have for love how much there is in the universe to kindle our admiration and to claim our gratitude there are happily multitudes among us who both feel and teach but it has not i think been sufficiently considered how evident throughout the system of creation is the purpose of god that we should often be affected by fear not the sudden selfish and contemptible fear of immediate danger but the fear which arises out of the contemplation of great powers in destructive operation and generally from the perception of the presence of death nothing appears to me more remarkable than the array of scenic magnificence by which the imagination is appalled in myriads of instances when the actual danger is comparatively small so that the utmost possible impression of awe shall be produced upon the minds of all though direct suffering is inflicted upon few consider for instance the moral effect of a single thunderstorm perhaps two or three persons may be struck dead within the space of a hundred square miles and their deaths unaccompanied by the scenery of the storm would produce little more than a momentary sadness in the busy hearts of living men but the preparation for the judgment by all that mighty gathering of clouds by the questioning of the forest leaves in their terrified stillness which way the winds shall go forth by the murmuring to each other deep in the distance of the destroying angels before they draw forth their swords of fire by the march of the funeral darkness in the midst of the noonday and the rattling of the dome of heaven beneath the chariotwheels of deathon how many minds do not these produce an impression almost as great as the actual witnessing of the fatal issue and how strangely are the expressions of the threatening elements fitted to the apprehension of the human soul the lurid color the long irregular convulsive sound the ghastly shapes of flaming and heaving cloud are all as true and faithful in their appeal to our instinct of danger as the moaning or wailing of the human voice itself is to our instinct of pity it is not a reasonable calculating terror which they awake in us it is no matter that we count distance by seconds and measure probability by averages that shadow of the thundercloud will still do its work upon our hearts and we shall watch its passing away as if we stood upon the threshingfloor of araunah  § xlii and this is equally the case with respect to all the other destructive phenomena of the universe from the mightiest of them to the gentlest from the earthquake to the summer shower it will be found that they are attended by certain aspects of threatening which strike terror into the hearts of multitudes more numerous a thousandfold than those who actually suffer from the ministries of judgment and that besides the fearfulness of these immediately dangerous phenomena there is an occult and subtle horror belonging to many aspects of the creation around us calculated often to fill us with serious thought even in our times of quietness and peace i understand not the most dangerous because most attractive form of modern infidelity which pretending to exalt the beneficence of the deity degrades it into a reckless infinitude of mercy and blind obliteration of the work of sin and which does this chiefly by dwelling on the manifold appearances of gods kindness on the face of creation such kindness is indeed everywhere and always visible but not alone wrath and threatening are invariably mingled with the love and in the utmost solitudes of nature the existence of hell seems to me as legibly declared by a thousand spiritual utterances as that of heaven it is well for us to dwell with thankfulness on the unfolding of the flower and the falling of the dew and the sleep of the green fields in the sunshine but the blasted trunk the barren rock the moaning of the bleak winds the roar of the black perilous merciless whirlpools of the mountain streams the solemn solitudes of moors and seas the continual fading of all beauty into darkness and of all strength into dust have these no language for us we may seek to escape their teaching by reasonings touching the good which is wrought out of all evil but it is vain sophistry the good succeeds to the evil as day succeeds the night but so also the evil to the good gerizim and ebal birth and death light and darkness heaven and hell divide the existence of man and his futurity39  § xliii and because the thoughts of the choice we have to make between these two ought to rule us continually not so much in our own actions for these should for the most part be governed by settled habit and principle as in our manner of regarding the lives of other men and our own responsibilities with respect to them therefore it seems to me that the healthiest state into which the human mind can be brought is that which is capable of the greatest love and the greatest awe and this we are taught even in our times of rest for when our minds are rightly in tone the merely pleasurable excitement which they seek with most avidity is that which rises out of the contemplation of beauty or of terribleness we thirst for both and according to the height and tone of our feeling desire to see them in noble or inferior forms thus there is a divine beauty and a terribleness or sublimity coequal with it in rank which are the subjects of the highest art and there is an inferior or ornamental beauty and an inferior terribleness coequal with it in rank which are the subjects of grotesque art and the state of mind in which the terrible form of the grotesque is developed is that which in some irregular manner dwells upon certain conditions of terribleness into the complete depth of which it does not enter for the time  § xliv now the things which are the proper subjects of human fear are twofold those which have the power of death and those which have the nature of sin of which there are many ranks greater or less in power and vice from the evil angels themselves down to the serpent which is their type and which though of a low and contemptible class appears to unite the deathful and sinful natures in the most clearly visible and intelligible form for there is nothing else which we know of so small strength and occupying so unimportant a place in the economy of creation which yet is so mortal and so malignant it is then on these two classes of objects that the mind fixes for its excitement in that mood which gives rise to the terrible grotesque and its subject will be found always to unite some expression of vice and danger but regarded in a peculiar temper sometimes a of predetermined or involuntary apathy sometimes b of mockery sometimes c of diseased and ungoverned imaginativeness  § xlv for observe the difficulty which as i above stated exists in distinguishing the playful from the terrible grotesque arises out of this cause that the mind under certain phases of excitement plays with terror and summons images which if it were in another temper would be awful but of which either in weariness or in irony it refrains for the time to acknowledge the true terribleness and the mode in which this refusal takes place distinguishes the noble from the ignoble grotesque for the master of the noble grotesque knows the depth of all at which he seems to mock and would feel it at another time or feels it in a certain undercurrent of thought even while he jests with it but the workman of the ignoble grotesque can feel and understand nothing and mocks at all things with the laughter of the idiot and the cretin  to work out this distinction completely is the chief difficulty in our present inquiry and in order to do so let us consider the abovenamed three conditions of mind in succession with relation to objects of terror  § xlvi a involuntary or predetermined apathy we saw above that the grotesque was produced chiefly in subordinate or ornamental art by rude and in some degree uneducated men and in their times of rest at such times and in such subordinate work it is impossible that they should represent any solemn or terrible subject with a full and serious entrance into its feeling it is not in the languor of a leisure hour that a man will set his whole soul to conceive the means of representing some important truth nor to the projecting angle of a timber bracket that he would trust its representation if conceived and yet in this languor and in this trivial work he must find some expression of the serious part of his soul of what there is within him capable of awe as well as of love the more noble the man is the more impossible it will be for him to confine his thoughts to mere loveliness and that of a low order were his powers and his time unlimited so that like frà angelico he could paint the seraphim in that order of beauty he could find contentment bringing down heaven to earth but by the conditions of his being by his hardworked life by his feeble powers of execution by the meanness of his employment and the languor of his heart he is bound down to earth it is the worlds work that he is doing and worlds work is not to be done without fear and whatever there is of deep and eternal consciousness within him thrilling his mind with the sense of the presence of sin and death around him must be expressed in that slight work and feeble way come of it what will he cannot forget it among all that he sees of beautiful in nature he may not bury himself among the leaves of the violet on the rocks and of the lily in the glen and twine out of them garlands of perpetual gladness he sees more in the earth than thesemisery and wrath and discordance and danger and all the work of the dragon and his angels this he sees with too deep feeling ever to forget and though when he returns to his idle workit may be to gild the letters upon the page or to carve the timbers of the chamber or the stones of the pinnaclehe cannot give his strength of thought any more to the woe or to the danger there is a shadow of them still present with him and as the bright colors mingle beneath his touch and the fair leaves and flowers grow at his bidding strange horrors and phantasms rise by their side grisly beasts and venomous serpents and spectral fiends and nameless inconsistencies of ghastly life rising out of things most beautiful and fading back into them again as the harm and the horror of life do out of its happiness he has seen these things he wars with them daily he cannot but give them their part in his work though in a state of comparative apathy to them at the time he is but carving and gilding and must not turn aside to weep but he knows that hell is burning on for all that and the smoke of it withers his oakleaves  § xlvii now the feelings which give rise to the false or ignoble grotesque are exactly the reverse of these in the true grotesque a man of naturally strong feeling is accidentally or resolutely apathetic in the false grotesque a man naturally apathetic is forcing himself into temporary excitement the horror which is expressed by the one comes upon him whether he will or not that which is expressed by the other is sought out by him and elaborated by his art and therefore also because the fear of the one is true and of true things however fantastic its expression may be there will be reality in it and force it is not a manufactured terribleness whose author when he had finished it knew not if it would terrify any one else or not but it is a terribleness taken from the life a spectre which the workman indeed saw and which as it appalled him will appal us also but the other workman never felt any divine fear he never shuddered when he heard the cry from the burning towers of the earth    venga medusa sì lo farem di smalto  he is stone already and needs no gentle hand laid upon his eyes to save him  § xlviii i do not mean what i say in this place to apply to the creations of the imagination it is not as the creating but as the seeing man that we are here contemplating the master of the true grotesque it is because the dreadfulness of the universe around him weighs upon his heart that his work is wild and therefore through the whole of it we shall find the evidence of deep insight into nature his beasts and birds however monstrous will have profound relations with the true he may be an ignorant man and little acquainted with the laws of nature he is certainly a busy man and has not much time to watch nature but he never saw a serpent cross his path nor a bird flit across the sky nor a lizard bask upon a stone without learning so much of the sublimity and inner nature of each as will not suffer him thenceforth to conceive them coldly he may not be able to carve plumes or scales well but his creatures will bite and fly for all that the ignoble workman is the very reverse of this he never felt never looked at nature and if he endeavor to imitate the work of the other all his touches will be made at random and all his extravagances will be ineffective he may knit brows and twist lips and lengthen beaks and sharpen teeth but it will be all in vain he may make his creatures disgusting but never fearful  § xlix there is however often another cause of difference than this the true grotesque being the expression of the repose or play of a serious mind there is a false grotesque opposed to it which is the result of the full exertion of a frivolous one there is much grotesque which is wrought out with exquisite care and pains and as much labor given to it as if it were of the noblest subject so that the workman is evidently no longer apathetic and has no excuse for unconnectedness of thought or sudden unreasonable fear if he awakens horror now it ought to be in some truly sublime form his strength is in his work and he must not give way to sudden humor and fits of erratic fancy if he does so it must be because his mind is naturally frivolous or is for the time degraded into the deliberate pursuit of frivolity and herein lies the real distinction between the base grotesque of raphael and the renaissance above alluded to and the true gothic grotesque those grotesques or arabesques of the vatican and other such work which have become the patterns of ornamentation in modern times are the fruit of great minds degraded to base objects the care skill and science applied to the distribution of the leaves and the drawing of the figures are intense admirable and accurate therefore they ought to have produced a grand and serious work not a tissue of nonsense if we can draw the human head perfectly and are masters of its expression and its beauty we have no business to cut it off and hang it up by the hair at the end of a garland if we can draw the human body in the perfection of its grace and movement we have no business to take away its limbs and terminate it with a bunch of leaves or rather our doing so will imply that there is something wrong with us that if we can consent to use our best powers for such base and vain trifling there must be something wanting in the powers themselves and that however skilful we may be or however learned we are wanting both in the earnestness which can apprehend a noble truth and in the thoughtfulness which can feel a noble fear no divine terror will ever be found in the work of the man who wastes a colossal strength in elaborating toys for the first lesson which that terror is sent to teach us is the value of the human soul and the shortness of mortal time  § l and are we never then it will be asked to possess a refined or perfect ornamentation must all decoration be the work of the ignorant and the rude not so but exactly in proportion as the ignorance and rudeness diminish must the ornamentation become rational and the grotesqueness disappear the noblest lessons may be taught in ornamentation the most solemn truths compressed into it the book of genesis in all the fulness of its incidents in all the depth of its meaning is bound within the leafborders of the gates of ghiberti but raphaels arabesque is mere elaborate idleness it has neither meaning nor heart in it it is an unnatural and monstrous abortion  § li now this passing of the grotesque into higher art as the mind of the workman becomes informed with better knowledge and capable of more earnest exertion takes place in two ways either as his power increases he devotes himself more and more to the beauty which he now feels himself able to express and so the grotesqueness expands and softens into the beautiful as in the abovenamed instance of the gates of ghiberti or else if the mind of the workman be naturally inclined to gloomy contemplation the imperfection or apathy of his work rises into nobler terribleness until we reach the point of the grotesque of albert durer where every now and then the playfulness or apathy of the painter passes into perfect sublime take the adam and eve for instance when he gave adam a bough to hold with a parrot on it and a tablet hung to it with albertus durer noricus faciebat 1504 thereupon his mind was not in paradise he was half in play half apathetic with respect to his subject thinking how to do his work well as a wise mastergraver and how to receive his just reward of fame but he rose into the true sublime in the head of adam and in the profound truthfulness of every creature that fills the forest so again in that magnificent coat of arms with the lady and the satyr as he cast the fluttering drapery hither and thither around the helmet and wove the delicate crown upon the womans forehead he was in a kind of play but there is none in the dreadful skull upon the shield and in the knight and death and in the dragons of the illustrations to the apocalypse there is neither play nor apathy but their grotesque is of the ghastly kind which best illustrates the nature of death and sin and this leads us to the consideration of the second state of mind out of which the noble grotesque is developed that is to say the temper of mockery  § lii b mockery or satire in the former part of this chapter when i spoke of the kinds of art which were produced in the recreation of the lower orders i only spoke of forms of ornament not of the expression of satire or humor but it seems probable that nothing is so refreshing to the vulgar mind as some exercise of this faculty more especially on the failings of their superiors and that wherever the lower orders are allowed to express themselves freely we shall find humor more or less caustic becoming a principal feature in their work the classical and renaissance manufacturers of modern times having silenced the independent language of the operative his humor and satire pass away in the wordwit which has of late become the especial study of the group of authors headed by charles dickens all this power was formerly thrown into noble art and became permanently expressed in the sculptures of the cathedral it was never thought that there was anything discordant or improper in such a position for the builders evidently felt very deeply a truth of which in modern times we are less cognizant that folly and sin are to a certain extent synonymous and that it would be well for mankind in general if all could be made to feel that wickedness is as contemptible as it is hateful so that the vices were permitted to be represented under the most ridiculous forms and all the coarsest wit of the workman to be exhausted in completing the degradation of the creatures supposed to be subjected to them  § liii nor were even the supernatural powers of evil exempt from this species of satire for with whatever hatred or horror the evil angels were regarded it was one of the conditions of christianity that they should also be looked upon as vanquished and this not merely in their great combat with the king of saints but in daily and hourly combats with the weakest of his servants in proportion to the narrowness of the powers of abstract conception in the workman the nobleness of the idea of spiritual nature diminished and the traditions of the encounters of men with fiends in daily temptations were imagined with less terrific circumstances until the agencies which in such warfare were almost always represented as vanquished with disgrace became at last as much the objects of contempt as of terror  the superstitions which represented the devil as assuming various contemptible forms of disguises in order to accomplish his purposes aided this gradual degradation of conception and directed the study of the workman to the most strange and ugly conditions of animal form until at last even in the most serious subjects the fiends are oftener ludicrous than terrible nor indeed is this altogether avoidable for it is not possible to express intense wickedness without some condition of degradation malice subtlety and pride in their extreme cannot be written upon noble forms and i am aware of no effort to represent the satanic mind in the angelic form which has succeeded in painting milton succeeds only because he separately describes the movements of the mind and therefore leaves himself at liberty to make the form heroic but that form is never distinct enough to be painted dante who will not leave even external forms obscure degrades them before he can feel them to be demoniacal so also john bunyan both of them i think having firmer faith than miltons in their own creations and deeper insight into the nature of sin milton makes his fiends too noble and misses the foulness inconstancy and fury of wickedness his satan possesses some virtues not the less virtues for being applied to evil purpose courage resolution patience deliberation in council this latter being eminently a wise and holy character as opposed to the insania of excessive sin and all this if not a shallow and false is a smooth and artistical conception on the other hand i have always felt that there was a peculiar grandeur in the indescribable ungovernable fury of dantes fiends ever shortening its own powers and disappointing its own purposes the deaf blind speechless unspeakable rage fierce as the lightning but erring from its mark or turning senselessly against itself and still further debased by foulness of form and action something is indeed to be allowed for the rude feelings of the time but i believe all such men as dante are sent into the world at the time when they can do their work best and that it being appointed for him to give to mankind the most vigorous realization possible both of hell and heaven he was born both in the country and at the time which furnished the most stern opposition of horror and beauty and permitted it to be written in the clearest terms and therefore though there are passages in the inferno which it would be impossible for any poet now to write i look upon it as all the more perfect for them for there can be no question but that one characteristic of excessive vice is indecency a general baseness in its thoughts and acts concerning the body40 and that the full portraiture of it cannot be given without marking and that in the strongest lines this tendency to corporeal degradation which in the time of dante could be done frankly but cannot now and therefore i think the twentyfirst and twentysecond books of the inferno the most perfect portraitures of fiendish nature which we possess and at the same time in their mingling of the extreme of horror for it seems to me that the silent swiftness of the first demon con lali aperte e sovra i pie leggiero cannot be surpassed in dreadfulness with ludicrous actions and images they present the most perfect instances with which i am acquainted of the terrible grotesque but the whole of the inferno is full of this grotesque as well as the faërie queen and these two poems together with the works of albert durer will enable the reader to study it in its noblest forms without reference to gothic cathedrals  § liv now just as there are base and noble conditions of the apathetic grotesque so also are there of this satirical grotesque the condition which might be mistaken for it is that above described as resulting from the malice of men given to pleasure and in which the grossness and foulness are in the workman as much as in his subject so that he chooses to represent vice and disease rather than virtue and beauty having his chief delight in contemplating them though he still mocks at them with such dull wit as may be in him because as young has said most truly    tis not in folly not to scorn a fool  § lv now it is easy to distinguish this grotesque from its noble counterpart by merely observing whether any forms of beauty or dignity are mingled with it or not for of course the noble grotesque is only employed by its master for good purposes and to contrast with beauty but the base workman cannot conceive anything but what is base and there will be no loveliness in any part of his work or at the best a loveliness measured by line and rule and dependent on legal shapes of feature but without resorting to this test and merely by examining the ugly grotesque itself it will be found that if it belongs to the base school there will be first no horror in it secondly no nature in it and thirdly no mercy in it  § lvi i say first no horror for the base soul has no fear of sin and no hatred of it and however it may strive to make its work terrible there will be no genuineness in the fear the utmost it can do will be to make its work disgusting  secondly there will be no nature in it it appears to be one of the ends proposed by providence in the appointment of the forms of the brute creation that the various vices to which mankind are liable should be severally expressed in them so distinctly and clearly as that men could not but understand the lesson while yet these conditions of vice might in the inferior animal be observed without the disgust and hatred which the same vices would excite if seen in men and might be associated with features of interest which would otherwise attract and reward contemplation thus ferocity cunning sloth discontent gluttony uncleanness and cruelty are seen each in its extreme in various animals and are so vigorously expressed that when men desire to indicate the same vices in connexion with human forms they can do it no better than by borrowing here and there the features of animals and when the workman is thus led to the contemplation of the animal kingdom finding therein the expressions of vice which he needs associated with power and nobleness and freedom from disease if his mind be of right tone he becomes interested in this new study and all noble grotesque is therefore full of the most admirable rendering of animal character but the ignoble workman is capable of no interest of this kind and being too dull to appreciate and too idle to execute the subtle and wonderful lines on which the expression of the lower animal depends he contents himself with vulgar exaggeration and leaves his work as false as it is monstrous a mass of blunt malice and obscene ignorance  § lvii lastly there will be no mercy in it wherever the satire of the noble grotesque fixes upon human nature it does so with much sorrow mingled amidst its indignation in its highest forms there is an infinite tenderness like that of the fool in lear and even in its more heedless or bitter sarcasm it never loses sight altogether of the better nature of what it attacks nor refuses to acknowledge its redeeming or pardonable features but the ignoble grotesque has no pity it rejoices in iniquity and exists only to slander  § lviii i have not space to follow out the various forms of transition which exist between the two extremes of great and base in the satirical grotesque the reader must always remember that although there is an infinite distance between the best and worst in this kind the interval is filled by endless conditions more or less inclining to the evil or the good impurity and malice stealing gradually into the nobler forms and invention and wit elevating the lower according to the countless minglings of the elements of the human soul  § lix c ungovernableness of the imagination the reader is always to keep in mind that if the objects of horror in which the terrible grotesque finds its materials were contemplated in their true light and with the entire energy of the soul they would cease to be grotesque and become altogether sublime and that therefore it is some shortening of the power or the will of contemplation and some consequent distortion of the terrible image in which the grotesqueness consists now this distortion takes place it was above asserted in three ways either through apathy satire or ungovernableness of imagination it is this last cause of the grotesque which we have finally to consider namely the error and wildness of the mental impressions caused by fear operating upon strong powers of imagination or by the failure of the human faculties in the endeavor to grasp the highest truths  § lx the grotesque which comes to all men in a disturbed dream is the most intelligible example of this kind but also the most ignoble the imagination in this instance being entirely deprived of all aid from reason and incapable of selfgovernment i believe however that the noblest forms of imaginative power are also in some sort ungovernable and have in them something of the character of dreams so that the vision of whatever kind comes uncalled and will not submit itself to the seer but conquers him and forces him to speak as a prophet having no power over his words or thoughts41 only if the whole man be trained perfectly and his mind calm consistent and powerful the vision which comes to him is seen as in a perfect mirror serenely and in consistence with the rational powers but if the mind be imperfect and ill trained the vision is seen as in a broken mirror with strange distortions and discrepancies all the passions of the heart breathing upon it in cross ripples till hardly a trace of it remains unbroken so that strictly speaking the imagination is never governed it is always the ruling and divine power and the rest of the man is to it only as an instrument which it sounds or a tablet on which it writes clearly and sublimely if the wax be smooth and the strings true grotesquely and wildly if they are stained and broken and thus the iliad the inferno the pilgrims progress the faërie queen are all of them true dreams only the sleep of the men to whom they came was the deep living sleep which god sends with a sacredness in it as of death the revealer of secrets  § lxi now observe in this matter carefully the difference between a dim mirror and a distorted one and do not blame me for pressing the analogy too far for it will enable me to explain my meaning every way more clearly most mens minds are dim mirrors in which all truth is seen as st paul tells us darkly this is the fault most common and most fatal dulness of the heart and mistiness of sight increasing to utter hardness and blindness satan breathing upon the glass so that if we do not sweep the mist laboriously away it will take no image but even so far as we are able to do this we have still the distortion to fear yet not to the same extent for we can in some sort allow for the distortion of an image if only we can see it clearly and the fallen human soul at its best must be as a diminishing glass and that a broken one to the mighty truths of the universe round it and the wider the scope of its glance and the vaster the truths into which it obtains an insight the more fantastic their distortion is likely to be as the winds and vapors trouble the field of the telescope most when it reaches farthest  § lxii now so far as the truth is seen by the imagination42 in its wholeness and quietness the vision is sublime but so far as it is narrowed and broken by the inconsistencies of the human capacity it becomes grotesque and it would seem to be rare that any very exalted truth should be impressed on the imagination without some grotesqueness in its aspect proportioned to the degree of diminution of breadth in the grasp which is given of it nearly all the dreams recorded in the biblejacobs josephs pharaohs nebuchadnezzarsare grotesques and nearly the whole of the accessary scenery in the books of ezekiel and the apocalypse thus jacobs dream revealed to him the ministry of angels but because this ministry could not be seen or understood by him in its fulness it was narrowed to him into a ladder between heaven and earth which was a grotesque josephs two dreams were evidently intended to be signs of the steadfastness of the divine purpose towards him by possessing the clearness of special prophecy yet were couched in such imagery as not to inform him prematurely of his destiny and only to be understood after their fulfilment the sun and moon and stars were at the period and are indeed throughout the bible the symbols of high authority it was not revealed to joseph that he should be lord over all egypt but the representation of his family by symbols of the most magnificent dominion and yet as subject to him must have been afterwards felt by him as a distinctly prophetic indication of his own supreme power it was not revealed to him that the occasion of his brethrens special humiliation before him should be their coming to buy corn but when the event took place must he not have felt that there was prophetic purpose in the form of the sheaves of wheat which first imaged forth their subjection to him and these two images of the sun doing obeisance and the sheaves bowing downnarrowed and imperfect intimations of great truth which yet could not be otherwise conveyedare both grotesque the kine of pharaoh eating each other the gold and clay of nebuchadnezzars image the four beasts full of eyes and other imagery of ezekiel and the apocalypse are grotesques of the same kind on which i need not further insist  § lxiii such forms however ought perhaps to have been arranged under a separate head as symbolical grotesque but the element of awe enters into them so strongly as to justify for all our present purposes their being classed with the other varieties of terrible grotesque for even if the symbolic vision itself be not terrible the sense of what may be veiled behind it becomes all the more awful in proportion to the insignificance or strangeness of the sign itself and i believe this thrill of mingled doubt fear and curiosity lies at the very root of the delight which mankind take in symbolism it was not an accidental necessity for the conveyance of truth by pictures instead of words which led to its universal adoption wherever art was on the advance but the divine fear which necessarily follows on the understanding that a thing is other and greater than it seems and which it appears probable has been rendered peculiarly attractive to the human heart because god would have us understand that this is true not of invented symbols merely but of all things amidst which we live that there is a deeper meaning within them than eye hath seen or ear hath heard and that the whole visible creation is a mere perishable symbol of things eternal and true it cannot but have been sometimes a subject of wonder with thoughtful men how fondly age after age the church has cherished the belief that the four living creatures which surrounded the apocalyptic throne were symbols of the four evangelists and rejoiced to use those forms in its pictureteaching that a calf a lion an eagle and a beast with a mans face should in all ages have been preferred by the christian world as expressive of evangelistic power and inspiration to the majesty of human forms and that quaint grotesques awkward and often ludicrous caricatures even of the animals represented should have been regarded by all men not only with contentment but with awe and have superseded all endeavors to represent the characters and persons of the evangelistic writers themselves except in a few instances confined principally to works undertaken without a definite religious purposethis i say might appear more than strange to us were it not that we ourselves share the awe and are still satisfied with the symbol and that justly for whether we are conscious of it or not there is in our hearts as we gaze upon the brutal forms that have so holy a signification an acknowledgment that it was not matthew nor mark nor luke nor john in whom the gospel of christ was unsealed but that the invisible things of him from the beginning of the creation are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made that the whole world and all that is therein be it low or high great or small is a continual gospel and that as the heathen in their alienation from god changed his glory into an image made like unto corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted boasts the christian in his approach to god is to undo this work and to change the corruptible things into the image of his glory believing that there is nothing so base in creation but that our faith may give it wings which shall raise us into companionship with heaven and that on the other hand there is nothing so great or so goodly in creation but that it is a mean symbol of the gospel of christ and of the things he has prepared for them that love him  § lxiv and it is easy to understand if we follow out this thought how when once the symbolic language was familiarized to the mind and its solemnity felt in all its fulness there was no likelihood of offence being taken at any repulsive or feeble characters in execution or conception there was no form so mean no incident so commonplace but if regarded in this light it might become sublime the more vigorous the fancy and the more faithful the enthusiasm the greater would be the likelihood of their delighting in the contemplation of symbols whose mystery was enhanced by apparent insignificance or in which the sanctity and majesty of meaning were contrasted with the utmost uncouthness of external form nor with uncouthness merely but even with every appearance of malignity or baseness the beholder not being revolted even by this but comprehending that as the seeming evil in the framework of creation did not invalidate its divine authorship so neither did the evil or imperfection in the symbol invalidate its divine message and thus sometimes the designer at last became wanton in his appeal to the piety of his interpreter and recklessly poured out the impurity and the savageness of his own heart for the mere pleasure of seeing them overlaid with the fine gold of the sanctuary by the religion of their beholder  § lxv it is not however in every symbolical subject that the fearful grotesque becomes embodied to the full the element of distortion which affects the intellect when dealing with subjects above its proper capacity is as nothing compared with that which it sustains from the direct impressions of terror it is the trembling of the human soul in the presence of death which most of all disturbs the images on the intellectual mirror and invests them with the fitfulness and ghastliness of dreams and from the contemplation of death and of the pangs which follow his footsteps arise in mens hearts the troop of strange and irresistible superstitions which more or less melancholy or majestic according to the dignity of the mind they impress are yet never without a certain grotesqueness following on the paralysis of the reason and overexcitement of the fancy i do not mean to deny the actual existence of spiritual manifestations i have never weighed the evidence upon the subject but with these if such exist we are not here concerned the grotesque which we are examining arises out of that condition of mind which appears to follow naturally upon the contemplation of death and in which the fancy is brought into morbid action by terror accompanied by the belief in spiritual presence and in the possibility of spiritual apparition hence are developed its most sublime because its least voluntary creations aided by the fearfulness of the phenomena of nature which are in any wise the ministers of death and primarily directed by the peculiar ghastliness of expression in the skeleton itself a species of terrible grotesque in its relation to the perfect human frame  § lxvi thus first born from the dusty and dreadful whiteness of the charnel house but softened in their forms by the holiest of human affections went forth the troop of wild and wonderful images seen through tears that had the mastery over our northern hearts for so many ages the powers of sudden destruction lurking in the woods and waters in the rocks and cloudskelpie and gnome lurlei and hartz spirits the wraith and foreboding phantom the spectra of second sight the various conceptions of avenging or tormented ghost haunting the perpetrator of crime or expiating its commission and the half fictitious and contemplative half visionary and believed images of the presence of death itself doing its daily work in the chambers of sickness and sin and waiting for its hour in the fortalices of strength and the high places of pleasurethese partly degrading us by the instinctive and paralyzing terror with which they are attended and partly ennobling us by leading our thoughts to dwell in the eternal world fill the last and the most important circle in that great kingdom of dark and distorted power of which we all must be in some sort the subjects until mortality shall be swallowed up of life until the waters of the last fordless river cease to roll their untransparent volume between us and the light of heaven and neither death stand between us and our brethren nor symbols between us and our god  § lxvii we have now i believe obtained a view approaching to completeness of the various branches of human feeling which are concerned in the developement of this peculiar form of art it remains for us only to note as briefly as possible what facts in the actual history of the grotesque bear upon our immediate subject  from what we have seen to be its nature we must i think be led to one most important conclusion that wherever the human mind is healthy and vigorous in all its proportions great in imagination and emotion no less than in intellect and not overborne by an undue or hardened preëminence of the mere reasoning faculties there the grotesque will exist in full energy and accordingly i believe that there is no test of greatness in periods nations or men more sure than the developement among them or in them of a noble grotesque and no test of comparative smallness or limitation of one kind or another more sure than the absence of grotesque invention or incapability of understanding it i think that the central man of all the world as representing in perfect balance the imaginative moral and intellectual faculties all at their highest is dante and in him the grotesque reaches at once the most distinct and the most noble developement to which it was ever brought in the human mind the two other greatest men whom italy has produced michael angelo and tintoret show the same element in no less original strength but oppressed in the one by his science and in both by the spirit of the age in which they lived never however absent even in michael angelo but stealing forth continually in a strange and spectral way lurking in folds of raiment and knots of wild hair and mountainous confusions of craggy limb and cloudy drapery and in tintoret ruling the entire conceptions of his greatest works to such a degree that they are an enigma or an offence even to this day to all the petty disciples of a formal criticism of the grotesque in our own shakspeare i need hardly speak nor of its intolerableness to his french critics nor of that of Æschylus and homer as opposed to the lower greek writers and so i believe it will be found at all periods in all minds of the first order  § lxviii as an index of the greatness of nations it is a less certain test or rather we are not so well agreed on the meaning of the term greatness respecting them a nation may produce a great effect and take up a high place in the worlds history by the temporary enthusiasm or fury of its multitudes without being truly great or on the other hand the discipline of morality and common sense may extend its physical power or exalt its wellbeing while yet its creative and imaginative powers are continually diminishing and again a people may take so definite a lead over all the rest of the world in one direction as to obtain a respect which is not justly due to them if judged on universal grounds thus the greeks perfected the sculpture of the human body threw their literature into a disciplined form which has given it a peculiar power over certain conditions of modern mind and were the most carefully educated race that the world has seen but a few years hence i believe we shall no longer think them a greater people than either the egyptians or assyrians  § lxix if then ridding ourselves as far as possible of prejudices owing merely to the schoolteaching which remains from the system of the renaissance we set ourselves to discover in what races the human soul taken all in all reached its highest magnificence we shall find i believe two great families of men one of the east and south the other of the west and north the one including the egyptians jews arabians assyrians and persians the other i know not whence derived but seeming to flow forth from scandinavia and filling the whole of europe with its norman and gothic energy and in both these families wherever they are seen in their utmost nobleness there the grotesque is developed in its utmost energy and i hardly know whether most to admire the winged bulls of nineveh or the winged dragons of verona  § lxx the reader who has not before turned his attention to this subject may however at first have some difficulty in distinguishing between the noble grotesque of these great nations and the barbarous grotesque of mere savages as seen in the work of the hindoo and other indian nations or more grossly still in that of the complete savage of the pacific islands or if as is to be hoped he instinctively feels the difference he may yet find difficulty in determining wherein that difference consists but he will discover on consideration that the noble grotesque involves the true appreciation of beauty though the mind may wilfully turn to other images or the hand resolutely stop short of the perfection which it must fail if it endeavored to reach while the grotesque of the sandwich islander involves no perception or imagination of anything above itself he will find that in the exact proportion in which the grotesque results from an incapability of perceiving beauty it becomes savage or barbarous and that there are many stages of progress to be found in it even in its best times much truly savage grotesque occurring in the fine gothic periods mingled with the other forms of the ignoble grotesque resulting from vicious inclinations or base sportiveness nothing is more mysterious in the history of the human mind than the manner in which gross and ludicrous images are mingled with the most solemn subjects in the work of the middle ages whether of sculpture or illumination and although in great part such incongruities are to be accounted for on the various principles which i have above endeavored to define in many instances they are clearly the result of vice and sensuality the general greatness of seriousness of an age does not effect the restoration of human nature and it would be strange if in the midst of the art even of the best periods when that art was entrusted to myriads of workmen we found no manifestations of impiety folly or impurity  § lxxi it needs only to be added that in the noble grotesque as it is partly the result of a morbid state of the imaginative power that power itself will be always seen in a high degree and that therefore our power of judging of the rank of a grotesque work will depend on the degree in which we are in general sensible of the presence of invention the reader may partly test this power in himself by referring to the plate given in the opening of this chapter in which on the left is a piece of noble and inventive grotesque a head of the lionsymbol of st mark from the veronese gothic the other is a head introduced as a boss on the foundation of the palazzo corner della regina at venice utterly devoid of invention made merely monstrous by exaggerations of the eyeballs and cheeks and generally characteristic of that late renaissance grotesque of venice with which we are at present more immediately concerned43  § lxxii the developement of that grotesque took place under different laws from those which regulate it in any other european city for great as we have seen the byzantine mind show itself to be in other directions it was marked as that of a declining nation by the absence of the grotesque element and owing to its influence the early venetian gothic remained inferior to all other schools in this particular character nothing can well be more wonderful than its instant failure in any attempt at the representation of ludicrous or fearful images more especially when it is compared with the magnificent grotesque of the neighboring city of verona in which the lombard influence had full sway nor was it until the last links of connexion with constantinople had been dissolved that the strength of the venetian mind could manifest itself in this direction but it had then a new enemy to encounter the renaissance laws altogether checked its imagination in architecture and it could only obtain permission to express itself by starting forth in the work of the venetian painters filling them with monkeys and dwarfs even amidst the most serious subjects and leading veronese and tintoret to the most unexpected and wild fantasies of form and color  § lxxiii we may be deeply thankful for this peculiar reserve of the gothic grotesque character to the last days of venice all over the rest of europe it had been strongest in the days of imperfect art magnificently powerful throughout the whole of the thirteenth century tamed gradually in the fourteenth and fifteenth and expiring in the sixteenth amidst anatomy and laws of art but at venice it had not been received when it was elsewhere in triumph and it fled to the lagoons for shelter when elsewhere it was oppressed and it was arrayed by the venetian painters in robes of state and advanced by them to such honor as it had never received in its days of widest dominion while in return it bestowed upon their pictures that fulness piquancy decision of parts and mosaiclike intermingling of fancies alternately brilliant and sublime which were exactly what was most needed for the developement of their unapproachable colorpower  § lxxiv yet observe it by no means follows that because the grotesque does not appear in the art of a nation the sense of it does not exist in the national mind except in the form of caricature it is hardly traceable in the english work of the present day but the minds of our workmen are full of it if we would only allow them to give it shape they express it daily in gesture and gibe but are not allowed to do so where it would be useful in like manner though the byzantine influence repressed it in the early venetian architecture it was always present in the venetian mind and showed itself in various forms of national custom and festival acted grotesques full of wit feeling and goodhumor the ceremony of the hat and the orange described in the beginning of this chapter is one instance out of multitudes another more rude and exceedingly characteristic was that instituted in the twelfth century in memorial of the submission of woldaric the patriarch of aquileia who having taken up arms against the patriarch of grado and being defeated and taken prisoner by the venetians was sentenced not to death but to send every year on fat thursday sixtytwo large loaves twelve fat pigs and a bull to the doge the bull being understood to represent the patriarch and the twelve pigs his clergy and the ceremonies of the day consisting in the decapitation of these representatives and a distribution of their joints among the senators together with a symbolic record of the attack upon aquileia by the erection of a wooden castle in the rooms of the ducal palace which the doge and the senate attacked and demolished with clubs as long as the doge and the senate were truly kingly and noble they were content to let this ceremony be continued but when they became proud and selfish and were destroying both themselves and the state by their luxury they found it inconsistent with their dignity and it was abolished as far as the senate was concerned in 154944  § lxxv by these and other similar manifestations the grotesque spirit is traceable through all the strength of the venetian people but again it is necessary that we should carefully distinguish between it and the spirit of mere levity i said in the fifth chapter that the venetians were distinctively a serious people serious that is to say in the sense in which the english are a more serious people than the french though the habitual intercourse of our lower classes in london has a tone of humor in it which i believe is untraceable in that of the parisian populace it is one thing to indulge in playful rest and another to be devoted to the pursuit of pleasure and gaiety of heart during the reaction after hard labor and quickened by satisfaction in the accomplished duty or perfected result is altogether compatible with nay even in some sort arises naturally out of a deep internal seriousness of disposition this latter being exactly the condition of mind which as we have seen leads to the richest developements of the playful grotesque while on the contrary the continual pursuit of pleasure deprives the soul of all alacrity and elasticity and leaves it incapable of happy jesting capable only of that which is bitter base and foolish thus throughout the whole of the early career of the venetians though there is much jesting there is no levity on the contrary there is an intense earnestness both in their pursuit of commercial and political successes and in their devotion to religion45 which led gradually to the formation of that highly wrought mingling of immovable resolution with secret thoughtfulness which so strangely sometimes so darkly distinguishes the venetian character at the time of their highest power when the seriousness was left but the conscientiousness destroyed and if there be any one sign by which the venetian countenance as it is recorded for us to the very life by a school of portraiture which has never been equalled chiefly because no portraiture ever had subjects so noblei say if there be one thing more notable than another in the venetian features it is this deep pensiveness and solemnity in other districts of italy the dignity of the heads which occur in the most celebrated compositions is clearly owing to the feeling of the painter he has visibly raised or idealized his models and appears always to be veiling the faults or failings of the human nature around him so that the best of his work is that which has most perfectly taken the color of his own mind and the least impressive if not the least valuable that which appears to have been unaffected and unmodified portraiture but at venice all is exactly the reverse of this the tone of mind in the painter appears often in some degree frivolous or sensual delighting in costume in domestic and grotesque incident and in studies of the naked form but the moment he gives himself definitely to portraiture all is noble and grave the more literally true his work the more majestic and the same artist who will produce little beyond what is commonplace in painting a madonna or an apostle will rise into unapproachable sublimity when his subject is a member of the forty or a master of the mint  such then were the general tone and progress of the venetian mind up to the close of the seventeenth century first serious religious and sincere then though serious still comparatively deprived of conscientiousness and apt to decline into stern and subtle policy in the first case the spirit of the noble grotesque not showing itself in art at all but only in speech and action in the second case developing itself in painting through accessories and vivacities of composition while perfect dignity was always preserved in portraiture a third phase rapidly developed itself  § lxxvi once more and for the last time let me refer the reader to the important epoch of the death of the doge tomaso mocenigo in 1423 long ago indicated as the commencement of the decline of the venetian power that commencement is marked not merely by the words of the dying prince but by a great and clearly legible sign it is recorded that on the accession of his successor foscari to the throne si festeggio dalla citta uno anno intero the city kept festival for a whole year venice had in her childhood sown in tears the harvest she was to reap in rejoicing she now sowed in laughter the seeds of death  thenceforward year after year the nation drank with deeper thirst from the fountains of forbidden pleasure and dug for springs hitherto unknown in the dark places of the earth in the ingenuity of indulgence in the varieties of vanity venice surpassed the cities of christendom as of old she surpassed them in fortitude and devotion and as once the powers of europe stood before her judgmentseat to receive the decisions of her justice so now the youth of europe assembled in the halls of her luxury to learn from her the arts of delight  it is as needless as it is painful to trace the steps of her final ruin that ancient curse was upon her the curse of the cities of the plain pride fulness of bread and abundance of idleness by the inner burning of her own passions as fatal as the fiery reign of gomorrah she was consumed from her place among the nations and her ashes are choking the channels of the dead salt sea   footnotes    27 mutinelli annali urbani

sôphrosynês tên ek theou tês par anthrôpôn     gignomenês it is the testimony of the ancients that the madness     which is of god is a nobler thing than the wisdom which is of men     and again he who sets himself to any work with which the muses     have to do i e to any of the fine arts without madness     thinking that by art alone he can do his work sufficiently will be     found vain and incapable and the work of temperance and rationalism     will be thrust aside and obscured by that of inspiration the     passages to the same effect relating especially to poetry are     innumerable in nearly all ancient writers but in this of plato the     entire compass of the fine arts is intended to be embraced      no one acquainted with other parts of my writings will suppose me to     be an advocate of idle trust in the imagination but it is in these     days just as necessary to allege the supremacy of genius as the     necessity of labor for there never was perhaps a period in which     the peculiar gift of the painter was so little discerned in which     so many and so vain efforts have been made to replace it by study     and toil this has been peculiarly the case with the german school     and there are few exhibitions of human error more pitiable than the     manner in which the inferior members of it men originally and for     ever destitute of the painting faculty force themselves into an     unnatural encumbered learned fructification of tasteless fruit     and pass laborious lives in setting obscurely and weakly upon canvas     the philosophy if such it be which ten minutes work of a strong     man would have put into healthy practice or plain words i know not     anything more melancholy than the sight of the huge german cartoon     with its objective side and subjective side and mythological     division and symbolical division and human and divine division     its allegorical sense and literal sense and ideal point of view     and intellectual point of view its heroism of wellmade armor and     knitted brows its heroinism of graceful attitude and braided hair     its inwoven web of sentiment and piety and philosophy and     anatomy and history all profound and twenty innocent dashes of     the hand of one godmade painter poor old bassan or bonifazio were     worth it all and worth it ten thousand times over      not that the sentiment or the philosophy is base in itself they     will make a good man but they will not make a good painterno     nor the millionth part of a painter they would have been good in     the work and words of daily life but they are good for nothing in     the cartoon if they are there alone and the worst result of the     system is the intense conceit into which it cultivates a weak mind     nothing is so hopeless so intolerable as the pride of a foolish     man who has passed through a process of thinking so as actually to     have found something out he believes there is nothing else to be     found out in the universe whereas the truly great man on whom the     revelations rain till they bear him to the earth with their weight     lays his head in the dust and speaks thenceoften in broken     syllables vanity is indeed a very equally divided inheritance among     mankind but i think that among the first persons no emphasis is     altogether so strong as that on the german ich i was once     introduced to a german philosopherpainter before tintorets     massacre of the innocents he looked at it superciliously and     said it wanted to be restored he had been himself several years     employed in painting a faust in a red jerkin and blue fire which     made tintoret appear somewhat dull to him    42 i have before stated modern painters vol ii that the     first function of the imagination is the apprehension of ultimate     truth    43 note especially in connexion with what was advanced in vol ii     respecting our english neatness of execution how the base workman     has cut the lines of the architecture neatly and precisely round the     abominable head but the noble workman has used his chisel like a     painters pencil and sketched the glory with a few irregular lines     anything rather than circular and struck out the whole head in the     same frank and fearless way leaving the sharp edges of the stone as     they first broke and flinging back the crest of hair from the     forehead with half a dozen hammerstrokes while the poor wretch who     did the other was half a day in smoothing its vapid and vermicular     curls    44 the decree is quoted by mutinelli lib i p 46    45 see appendix 9     chapter iv  conclusion   § i i fear this chapter will be a rambling one for it must be a kind of supplement to the preceding pages and a general recapitulation of the things i have too imperfectly and feebly said  the grotesques of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the nature of which we examined in the last chapter close the career of the architecture of europe they were the last evidences of any feeling consistent with itself and capable of directing the efforts of the builder to the formation of anything worthy the name of a style or school from that time to this no resuscitation of energy has taken place nor does any for the present appear possible how long this impossibility may last and in what direction with regard to art in general as well as to our lifeless architecture our immediate efforts may most profitably be directed are the questions i would endeavor briefly to consider in the present chapter  § ii that modern science with all its additions to the comforts of life and to the fields of rational contemplation has placed the existing races of mankind on a higher platform than any that preceded them none can doubt for an instant and i believe the position in which we find ourselves is somewhat analogous to that of thoughtful and laborious youth succeeding a restless and heedless infancy not long ago it was said to me by one of the masters of modern science when men invented the locomotive the child was learning to go when they invented the telegraph it was learning to speak he looked forward to the manhood of mankind as assuredly the nobler in proportion to the slowness of its developement what might not be expected from the prime and middle strength of the order of existence whose infancy had lasted six thousand years and indeed i think this the truest as well as the most cheering view that we can take of the worlds history little progress has been made as yet base war lying policy thoughtless cruelty senseless improvidenceall things which in nations are analogous to the petulance cunning impatience and carelessness of infancyhave been up to this hour as characteristic of mankind as they were in the earliest periods so that we must either be driven to doubt of human progress at all or look upon it as in its very earliest stage whether the opportunity is to be permitted us to redeem the hours that we have lost whether he in whose sight a thousand years are as one day has appointed us to be tried by the continued possession of the strange powers with which he has lately endowed us or whether the periods of childhood and of probation are to cease together and the youth of mankind is to be one which shall prevail over death and bloom for ever in the midst of a new heaven and a new earth are questions with which we have no concern it is indeed right that we should look for and hasten so far as in us lies the coming of the day of god but not that we should check any human efforts by anticipations of its approach we shall hasten it best by endeavoring to work out the tasks that are appointed for us here and therefore reasoning as if the world were to continue under its existing dispensation and the powers which have just been granted to us were to be continued through myriads of future ages  § iii it seems to me then that the whole human race so far as their own reason can be trusted may at present be regarded as just emergent from childhood and beginning for the first time to feel their strength to stretch their limbs and explore the creation around them if we consider that till within the last fifty years the nature of the ground we tread on of the air we breathe and of the light by which we see were not so much as conjecturally conceived by us that the duration of the globe and the races of animal life by which it was inhabited are just beginning to be apprehended and that the scope of the magnificent science which has revealed them is as yet so little received by the public mind that presumption and ignorance are still permitted to raise their voices against it unrebuked that perfect veracity in the representation of general nature by art has never been attempted until the present day and has in the present day been resisted with all the energy of the popular voice46 that the simplest problems of social science are yet so little understood as that doctrines of liberty and equality can be openly preached and so successfully as to affect the whole body of the civilized world with apparently incurable disease that the first principles of commerce were acknowledged by the english parliament only a few months ago in its free trade measures and are still so little understood by the million that no nation dares to abolish its customhouses47 that the simplest principles of policy are still not so much as stated far less received and that civilized nations persist in the belief that the subtlety and dishonesty which they know to be ruinous in dealings between man and man are serviceable in dealings between multitude and multitude finally that the scope of the christian religion which we have been taught for two thousand years is still so little conceived by us that we suppose the laws of charity and of selfsacrifice bear upon individuals in all their social relations and yet do not bear upon nations in any of their political relationswhen i say we thus review the depth of simplicity in which the human race are still plunged with respect to all that it most profoundly concerns them to know and which might by them with most ease have been ascertained we can hardly determine how far back on the narrow path of human progress we ought to place the generation to which we belong how far the swaddling clothes are unwound from us and childish things beginning to be put away  on the other hand a power of obtaining veracity in the representation of material and tangible things which within certain limits and conditions is unimpeachable has now been placed in the hands of all men48 almost without labor the foundation of every natural science is now at last firmly laid not a day passing without some addition of buttress and pinnacle to their already magnificent fabric social theorems if fiercely agitated are therefore the more likely to be at last determined so that they never can be matters of question more human life has been in some sense prolonged by the increased powers of locomotion and an almost limitless power of converse finally there is hardly any serious mind in europe but is occupied more or less in the investigation of the questions which have so long paralyzed the strength of religious feeling and shortened the dominion of religious faith and we may therefore at least look upon ourselves as so far in a definite state of progress as to justify our caution in guarding against the dangers incident to every period of change and especially to that from childhood into youth  § iv those dangers appear in the main to be twofold consisting partly in the pride of vain knowledge partly in the pursuit of vain pleasure a few points are still to be noticed with respect to each of these heads  enough it might be thought had been said already touching the pride of knowledge but i have not yet applied the principles at which we arrived in the third chapter to the practical questions of modern art and i think those principles together with what were deduced from the consideration of the nature of gothic in the second volume so necessary and vital not only with respect to the progress of art but even to the happiness of society that i will rather run the risk of tediousness than of deficiency in their illustration and enforcement  in examining the nature of gothic we concluded that one of the chief elements of power in that and in all good architecture was the acceptance of uncultivated and rude energy in the workman in examining the nature of renaissance we concluded that its chief element of weakness was that pride of knowledge which not only prevented all rudeness in expression but gradually quenched all energy which could only be rudely expressed nor only so but for the motive and matter of the work itself preferred science to emotion and experience to perception  § v the modern mind differs from the renaissance mind in that its learning is more substantial and extended and its temper more humble but its errors with respect to the cultivation of art are precisely the samenay as far as regards execution even more aggravated we require at present from our general workmen more perfect finish than was demanded in the most skilful renaissance periods except in their very finest productions and our leading principles in teaching and in the patronage which necessarily gives tone to teaching are that the goodness of work consists primarily in firmness of handling and accuracy of science that is to say in handwork and headwork whereas heartwork which is the one work we want is not only independent of both but often in great degree inconsistent with either  § vi here therefore let me finally and firmly enunciate the great principle to which all that has hitherto been stated is subservientthat art is valuable or otherwise only as it expresses the personality activity and living perception of a good and great human soul that it may express and contain this with little help from execution and less from science and that if it have not this if it show not the vigor perception and invention of a mighty human spirit it is worthless worthless i mean as art it may be precious in some other way but as art it is nugatory once let this be well understood among us and magnificent consequences will soon follow let me repeat it in other terms so that i may not be misunderstood all art is great and good and true only so far as it is distinctively the work of manhood in its entire and highest sense that is to say not the work of limbs and fingers but of the soul aided according to her necessities by the inferior powers and therefore distinguished in essence from all products of those inferior powers unhelped by the soul for as a photograph is not a work of art though it requires certain delicate manipulations of paper and acid and subtle calculations of time in order to bring out a good result so neither would a drawing like a photograph made directly from nature be a work of art although it would imply many delicate manipulations of the pencil and subtle calculations of effects of color and shade it is no more art49 to manipulate a camels hair pencil than to manipulate a china tray and a glass vial it is no more art to lay on color delicately than to lay on acid delicately it is no more art to use the cornea and retina for the reception of an image than to use a lens and a piece of silvered paper but the moment that inner part of the man or rather that entire and only being of the man of which cornea and retina fingers and hands pencils and colors are all the mere servants and instruments50 that manhood which has light in itself though the eyeball be sightless and can gain in strength when the hand and the foot are hewn off and cast into the fire the moment this part of the man stands forth with its solemn behold it is i then the work becomes art indeed perfect in honor priceless in value boundless in power  § vii yet observe i do not mean to speak of the body and soul as separable the man is made up of both they are to be raised and glorified together and all art is an expression of the one by and through the other all that i would insist upon is the necessity of the whole man being in his work the body must be in it hands and habits must be in it whether we will or not but the nobler part of the man may often not be in it and that nobler part acts principally in love reverence and admiration together with those conditions of thought which arise out of them for we usually fall into much error by considering the intellectual powers as having dignity in themselves and separable from the heart whereas the truth is that the intellect becomes noble and ignoble according to the food we give it and the kind of subjects with which it is conversant it is not the reasoning power which of itself is noble but the reasoning power occupied with its proper objects half of the mistakes of metaphysicians have arisen from their not observing this namely that the intellect going through the same processes is yet mean or noble according to the matter it deals with and wastes itself away in mere rotatory motion if it be set to grind straws and dust if we reason only respecting words or lines or any trifling and finite things the reason becomes a contemptible faculty but reason employed on holy and infinite things becomes herself holy and infinite so that by work of the soul i mean the reader always to understand the work of the entire immortal creature proceeding from a quick perceptive and eager heart perfected by the intellect and finally dealt with by the hands under the direct guidance of these higher powers  § viii and now observe the first important consequence of our fully understanding this preëminence of the soul will be the due understanding of that subordination of knowledge respecting which so much has already been said for it must be felt at once that the increase of knowledge merely as such does not make the soul larger or smaller that in the sight of god all the knowledge man can gain is as nothing but that the soul for which the great scheme of redemption was laid be it ignorant or be it wise is all in all and in the activity strength health and wellbeing of this soul lies the main difference in his sight between one man and another and that which is all in all in gods estimate is also be assured all in all in mans labor and to have the heart open and the eyes clear and the emotions and thoughts warm and quick and not the knowing of this or the other fact is the state needed for all mighty doing in this world and therefore finally for this the weightiest of all reasons let us take no pride in our knowledge we may in a certain sense be proud of being immortal we may be proud of being gods children we may be proud of loving thinking seeing and of all that we are by no human teaching but not of what we have been taught by rote not of the ballast and freight of the ship of the spirit but only of its pilotage without which all the freight will only sink it faster and strew the sea more richly with its ruin there is not at this moment a youth of twenty having received what we moderns ridiculously call education but he knows more of everything except the soul than plato or st paul did but he is not for that reason a greater man or fitter for his work or more fit to be heard by others than plato or st paul there is not at this moment a junior student in our schools of painting who does not know fifty times as much about the art as giotto did but he is not for that reason greater than giotto no nor his work better nor fitter for our beholding let him go on to know all that the human intellect can discover and contain in the term of a long life and he will not be one inch one line nearer to giottos feet but let him leave his academy benches and innocently as one knowing nothing go out into the highways and hedges and there rejoice with them that rejoice and weep with them that weep and in the next world among the companies of the great and good giotto will give his hand to him and lead him into their white circle and say this is our brother  § ix and the second important consequence of our feeling the souls preëminence will be our understanding the souls language however broken or low or feeble or obscure in its words and chiefly that great symbolic language of past ages which has now so long been unspoken it is strange that the same cold and formal spirit which the renaissance teaching has raised amongst us should be equally dead to the languages of imitation and of symbolism and should at once disdain the faithful rendering of real nature by the modern school of the preraphaelites and the symbolic rendering of imagined nature in the work of the thirteenth century but so it is and we find the same body of modern artists rejecting preraphaelitism because it is not ideal and thirteenth century work because it is not realtheir own practice being at once false and unideal and therefore equally opposed to both  § x it is therefore at this juncture of much importance to mark for the reader the exact relation of healthy symbolism and of healthy imitation and in order to do so let us return to one of our venetian examples of symbolic art to the central cupola of st marks on that cupola as has been already stated there is a mosaic representing the apostles on the mount of olives with an olivetree separating each from the other and we shall easily arrive at our purpose by comparing the means which would have been adopted by a modern artist bred in the renaissance schoolsthat is to say under the influence of claude and poussin and of the common teaching of the present daywith those adopted by the byzantine mosaicist to express the nature of these trees  § xi the reader is doubtless aware that the olive is one of the most characteristic and beautiful features of all southern scenery on the slopes of the northern apennines olives are the usual forest timber the whole of the val darno is wooded with them every one of its gardens is filled with them and they grow in orchardlike ranks out of its fields of maize or corn or vine so that it is physically impossible in most parts of the neighborhood of florence pistoja lucca or pisa to choose any site of landscape which shall not owe its leading character to the foliage of these trees what the elm and oak are to england the olive is to italy nay more than this its presence is so constant that in the case of at least four fifths of the drawings made by any artist in north italy he must have been somewhat impeded by branches of olive coming between him and the landscape its classical associations double its importance in greece and in the holy land the remembrances connected with it are of course more touching than can ever belong to any other tree of the field now for many years back at least one third out of all the landscapes painted by english artists have been chosen from italian scenery sketches in greece and in the holy land have become as common as sketches on hampstead heath our galleries also are full of sacred subjects in which if any background be introduced at all the foliage of the olive ought to have been a prominent feature  and here i challenge the untravelled english reader to tell me what an olivetree is like  § xii i know he cannot answer my challenge he has no more idea of an olivetree than if olives grew only in the fixed stars let him meditate a little on this one fact and consider its strangeness and what a wilful and constant closing of the eyes to the most important truths it indicates on the part of the modern artist observe a want of perception not of science i do not want painters to tell me any scientific facts about olivetrees but it had been well for them to have felt and seen the olivetree to have loved it for christs sake partly also for the helmed wisdoms sake which was to the heathen in some sort as that nobler wisdom which stood at gods right hand when he founded the earth and established the heavens to have loved it even to the hoary dimness of its delicate foliage subdued and faint of hue as if the ashes of the gethsemane agony had been cast upon it for ever and to have traced line by line the gnarled writhing of its intricate branches and the pointed fretwork of its light and narrow leaves inlaid on the blue field of the sky and the small rosywhite stars of its spring blossoming and the beads of sable fruit scattered by autumn along its topmost boughsthe right in israel of the stranger the fatherless and the widowand more than all the softness of the mantle silver grey and tender like the down on a birds breast with which far away it veils the undulation of the mountainsthese it had been well for them to have seen and drawn whatever they had left unstudied in the gallery  § xiii and if the reader would know the reason why this has not been done it is one instance only out of the myriads which might be given of sightlessness in modern art and will ask the artists themselves he will be informed of another of the marvellous contradictions and inconsistencies in the base renaissance art for it will be answered him that it is not right nor according to law to draw trees so that one should be known from another but that trees ought to be generalized into a universal idea of a tree that is to say that the very school which carries its science in the representation of man down to the dissection of the most minute muscle refuses so much science to the drawing of a tree as shall distinguish one species from another and also while it attends to logic and rhetoric and perspective and atmosphere and every other circumstance which is trivial verbal external or accidental in what it either says or sees it will not attend to what is essential and substantialbeing intensely solicitous for instance if it draws two trees one behind the other that the farthest off shall be as much smaller as mathematics show that it should be but totally unsolicitous to show what to the spectator is a far more important matter whether it is an apple or an orange tree  § xiv this however is not to our immediate purpose let it be granted that an idea of an olivetree is indeed to be given us in a special manner how and by what language this idea is to be conveyed are questions on which we shall find the world of artists again divided and it was this division which i wished especially to illustrate by reference to the mosaics of st marks  now the main characteristics of an olivetree are these it has sharp and slender leaves of a greyish green nearly grey on the under surface and resembling but somewhat smaller than those of our common willow its fruit when ripe is black and lustrous but of course so small that unless in great quantity it is not conspicuous upon the tree its trunk and branches are peculiarly fantastic in their twisting showing their fibres at every turn and the trunk is often hollow and even rent into many divisions like separate stems but the extremities are exquisitely graceful especially in the setting on of the leaves and the notable and characteristic effect of the tree in the distance is of a rounded and soft mass or ball of downy foliage  § xv supposing a modern artist to address himself to the rendering of this tree with his best skill he will probably draw accurately the twisting of the branches but yet this will hardly distinguish the tree from an oak he will also render the color and intricacy of the foliage but this will only confuse the idea of an oak with that of a willow the fruit and the peculiar grace of the leaves at the extremities and the fibrous structure of the stems will all be too minute to be rendered consistently with his artistical feeling of breadth or with the amount of labor which he considers it dexterous and legitimate to bestow upon the work but above all the rounded and monotonous form of the head of the tree will be at variance with his ideas of composition he will assuredly disguise or break it and the main points of the olivetree will all at last remain untold  § xvi now observe the old byzantine mosaicist begins his work at enormous disadvantage it is to be some one hundred and fifty feet above the eye in a dark cupola executed not with free touches of the pencil but with square pieces of glass not by his own hand but by various workmen under his superintendence finally not with a principal purpose of drawing olivetrees but mainly as a decoration of the cupola there is to be an olivetree beside each apostle and their stems are to be the chief lines which divide the dome he therefore at once gives up the irregular twisting of the boughs hither and thither but he will not give up their fibres other trees have irregular and fantastic branches but the knitted cordage of fibres is the olives own again were he to draw the leaves of their natural size they would be so small that their forms would be invisible in the darkness and were he to draw them so large as that their shape might be seen they would look like laurel instead of olive so he arranges them in small clusters of five each nearly of the shape which the byzantines give to the petals of the lily but elongated so as to give the idea of leafage upon a spray and these clustershis object always be it remembered being decoration not less than representationhe arranges symmetrically on each side of his branches laying the whole on a dark ground most truly suggestive of the heavy rounded mass of the tree which in its turn is relieved against the gold of the cupola lastly comes the question respecting the fruit the whole power and honor of the olive is in its fruit and unless that be represented nothing is represented but if the berries were colored black or green they would be totally invisible if of any other color utterly unnatural and violence would be done to the whole conception there is but one conceivable means of showing them namely to represent them as golden for the idea of golden fruit of various kinds was already familiar to the mind as in the apples of the hesperides without any violence to the distinctive conception of the fruit itself51 so the mosaicist introduced small round golden berries into the dark ground between each leaf and his work was done  illustration plate iv                mosaics of olivetree and flowers  § xvii on the opposite plate the uppermost figure on the left is a tolerably faithful representation of the general effect of one of these decorative olivetrees the figure on the right is the head of the tree alone showing the leaf clusters berries and interlacing of the boughs as they leave the stem each bough is connected with a separate line of fibre in the trunk and the junctions of the arms and stem are indicated down to the very root of the tree with a truth in structure which may well put to shame the tree anatomy of modern times  § xviii the white branching figures upon the serpentine band below are two of the clusters of flowers which form the foreground of a mosaic in the atrium i have printed the whole plate in blue because that color approaches more nearly than black to the distant effect of the mosaics of which the darker portions are generally composed of blue in greater quantity than any other color but the waved background in this instance is of various shades of blue and green alternately with one narrow black band to give it force the whole being intended to represent the distant effect and color of deep grass and the wavy line to express its bending motion just as the same symbol is used to represent the waves of water then the two white clusters are representative of the distinctly visible herbage close to the spectator having buds and flowers of two kinds springing in one case out of the midst of twisted grass and in the other out of their own proper leaves the clusters being kept each so distinctly symmetrical as to form when set side by side an ornamental border of perfect architectural severity and yet each cluster different from the next and every flower and bud and knot of grass varied in form and thought the way the mosaic tesseræ are arranged so as to give the writhing of the grass blades round the stalks of the flowers is exceedingly fine  the tree circles below are examples of still more severely conventional forms adopted on principle when the decoration is to be in white and gold instead of color these ornaments being cut in white marble on the outside of the church and the ground laid in with gold though necessarily here represented like the rest of the plate in blue and it is exceedingly interesting to see how the noble workman the moment he is restricted to more conventional materials retires into more conventional forms and reduces his various leafage into symmetry now nearly perfect yet observe in the central figure where the symbolic meaning of the vegetation beside the cross required it to be more distinctly indicated he has given it life and growth by throwing it into unequal curves on the opposite sides  § xix i believe the reader will now see that in these mosaics which the careless traveller is in the habit of passing by with contempt there is a depth of feeling and of meaning greater than in most of the best sketches from nature of modern times and without entering into any question whether these conventional representations are as good as under the required limitations it was possible to render them they are at all events good enough completely to illustrate that mode of symbolical expression which appeals altogether to thought and in no wise trusts to realization and little as in the present state of our schools such an assertion is likely to be believed the fact is that this kind of expression is the only one allowable in noble art  § xx i pray the reader to have patience with me for a few moments i do not mean that no art is noble but byzantine mosaic but no art is noble which in any wise depends upon direct imitation for its effect upon the mind this was asserted in the opening chapters of modern painters but not upon the highest grounds the results at which we have now arrived in our investigation of early art will enable me to place it on a loftier and firmer foundation  § xxi we have just seen that all great art is the work of the whole living creature body and soul and chiefly of the soul but it is not only the work of the whole creature it likewise addresses the whole creature that in which the perfect being speaks must also have the perfect being to listen i am not to spend my utmost spirit and give all my strength and life to my work while you spectator or hearer will give me only the attention of half your soul you must be all mine as i am all yours it is the only condition on which we can meet each other all your faculties all that is in you of greatest and best must be awake in you or i have no reward the painter is not to cast the entire treasure of his human nature into his labor merely to please a part of the beholder not merely to delight his senses not merely to amuse his fancy not merely to beguile him into emotion not merely to lead him into thought but to do all this senses fancy feeling reason the whole of the beholding spirit must be stilled in attention or stirred with delight else the laboring spirit has not done its work well for observe it is not merely its right to be thus met face to face heart to heart but it is its duty to evoke its answering of the other soul its trumpet call must be so clear that though the challenge may by dulness or indolence be unanswered there shall be no error as to the meaning of the appeal there must be a summons in the work which it shall be our own fault if we do not obey we require this of it we beseech this of it most men do not know what is in them till they receive this summons from their fellows their hearts die within them sleep settles upon them the lethargy of the worlds miasmata there is nothing for which they are so thankful as for that cry awake thou that sleepest and this cry must be most loudly uttered to their noblest faculties first of all to the imagination for that is the most tender and the soonest struck into numbness by the poisoned air so that one of the main functions of art in its service to man is to arouse the imagination from its palsy like the angel troubling the bethesda pool and the art which does not do this is false to its duty and degraded in its nature it is not enough that it be well imagined it must task the beholder also to imagine well and this so imperatively that if he does not choose to rouse himself to meet the work he shall not taste it nor enjoy it in any wise once that he is well awake the guidance which the artist gives him should be full and authoritative the beholders imagination must not be suffered to take its own way or wander hither and thither but neither must it be left at rest and the right point of realization for any given work of art is that which will enable the spectator to complete it for himself in the exact way the artist would have him but not that which will save him the trouble of effecting the completion so soon as the idea is entirely conveyed the artists labor should cease and every touch which he adds beyond the point when with the help of the beholders imagination the story ought to have been told is a degradation to his work so that the art is wrong which either realizes its subject completely or fails in giving such definite aid as shall enable it to be realized by the beholding imagination  § xxii it follows therefore that the quantity of finish or detail which may rightly be bestowed upon any work depends on the number and kind of ideas which the artist wishes to convey much more than on the amount of realization necessary to enable the imagination to grasp them it is true that the differences of judgment formed by one or another observer are in great degree dependent on their unequal imaginative powers as well as their unequal efforts in following the artists intention and it constantly happens that the drawing which appears clear to the painter in whose mind the thought is formed is slightly inadequate to suggest it to the spectator these causes of false judgment or imperfect achievement must always exist but they are of no importance for in nearly every mind the imaginative power however unable to act independently is so easily helped and so brightly animated by the most obscure suggestion that there is no form of artistical language which will not readily be seized by it if once it set itself intelligently to the task and even without such effort there are few hieroglyphics of which once understanding that it is to take them as hieroglyphics it cannot make itself a pleasant picture  § xxiii thus in the case of all sketches etchings unfinished engravings c no one ever supposes them to be imitations black outlines on white paper cannot produce a deceptive resemblance of anything and the mind understanding at once that it is to depend on its own powers for great part of its pleasure sets itself so actively to the task that it can completely enjoy the rudest outline in which meaning exists now when it is once in this temper the artist is infinitely to be blamed who insults it by putting anything into his work which is not suggestive having summoned the imaginative power he must turn it to account and keep it employed or it will run against him in indignation whatever he does merely to realize and substantiate an idea is impertinent he is like a dull storyteller dwelling on points which the hearer anticipates or disregards the imagination will say to him i knew all that before i dont want to be told that go on or be silent and let me go on in my own way i can tell the story better than you  observe then whenever finish is given for the sake of realization it is wrong whenever it is given for the sake of adding ideas it is right all true finish consists in the addition of ideas that is to say in giving the imagination more food for once well awaked it is ravenous for food but the painter who finishes in order to substantiate takes the food out of its mouth and it will turn and rend him  § xxiv let us go back for instance to our olive groveor lest the reader should be tired of olives let it be an oak copseand consider the difference between the substantiating and the imaginative methods of finish in such a subject a few strokes of the pencil or dashes of color will be enough to enable the imagination to conceive a tree and in those dashes of color sir joshua reynolds would have rested and would have suffered the imagination to paint what more it liked for itself and grow oaks or olives or apples out of the few dashes of color at its leisure on the other hand hobbima one of the worst of the realists smites the imagination on the mouth and bids it be silent while he sets to work to paint his oak of the right green and fill up its foliage laboriously with jagged touches and furrow the bark all over its branches so as if possible to deceive us into supposing that we are looking at a real oak which indeed we had much better do at once without giving any one the trouble to deceive us in the matter  § xxv now the truly great artist neither leaves the imagination to itself like sir joshua nor insults it by realization like hobbima but finds it continual employment of the happiest kind having summoned it by his vigorous first touches he says to it here is a tree for you and it is to be an oak now i know that you can make it green and intricate for yourself but that is not enough an oak is not only green and intricate but its leaves have most beautiful and fantastic forms which i am very sure you are not quite able to complete without help so i will draw a cluster or two perfectly for you and then you can go on and do all the other clusters so far so good but the leaves are not enough the oak is to be full of acorns and you may not be quite able to imagine the way they grow nor the pretty contrast of their glossy almondshaped nuts with the chasing of their cups so i will draw a bunch or two of acorns for you and you can fill up the oak with others like them good but that is not enough it is to be a bright day in summer and all the outside leaves are to be glittering in the sunshine as if their edges were of gold i cannot paint this but you can so i will really gild some of the edges nearest you52 and you can turn the gold into sunshine and cover the tree with it well done but still this is not enough the tree is so full foliaged and so old that the wood birds come in crowds to build there they are singing two or three under the shadow of every bough i cannot show you them all but here is a large one on the outside spray and you can fancy the others inside  § xxvi in this way the calls upon the imagination are multiplied as a great painter finishes and from these larger incidents he may proceed into the most minute particulars and lead the companion imagination to the veins in the leaves and the mosses on the trunk and the shadows of the dead leaves upon the grass but always multiplying thoughts or subjects of thought never working for the sake of realization the amount of realization actually reached depending on his space his materials and the nature of the thoughts he wishes to suggest in the sculpture of an oaktree introduced above an adoration of the magi on the tomb of the doge marco dolfino fourteenth century the sculptor has been content with a few leaves a single acorn and a bird while on the other hand millais willowtree with the robin in the background of his ophelia or the foreground of hunts two gentlemen of verona carries the appeal to the imagination into particulars so multiplied and minute that the work nearly reaches realization but it does not matter how near realization the work may approach in its fulness or how far off it may remain in its slightness so long as realization is not the end proposed but the informing one spirit of the thoughts of another and in this greatness and simplicity of purpose all noble art is alike however slight its means or however perfect from the rudest mosaics of st marks to the most tender finishing of the huguenot or the ophelia  § xxvii only observe in this matter that a greater degree of realization is often allowed for the sake of color than would be right without it for there is not any distinction between the artists of the inferior and the nobler schools more definite than this that the first color for the sake of realization and the second realize for the sake of color i hope that in the fifth chapter enough has been said to show the nobility of color though it is a subject on which i would fain enlarge whenever i approach it for there is none that needs more to be insisted upon chiefly on account of the opposition of the persons who have no eye for color and who being therefore unable to understand that it is just as divine and distinct in its power as music only infinitely more varied in its harmonies talk of it as if it were inferior and servile with respect to the other powers of art53 whereas it is so far from being this that wherever it enters it must take the mastery and whatever else is sacrificed for its sake it at least must be right this is partly the case even with music it is at our choice whether we will accompany a poem with music or not but if we do the music must be right and neither discordant nor inexpressive the goodness and sweetness of the poem cannot save it if the music be harsh or false but if the music be right the poem may be insipid or inharmonious and still saved by the notes to which it is wedded but this is far more true of color if that be wrong all is wrong no amount of expression or invention can redeem an illcolored picture while on the other hand if the color be right there is nothing it will not raise or redeem and therefore wherever color enters at all anything may be sacrificed to it and rather than it should be false or feeble everything must be sacrificed to it so that when an artist touches color it is the same thing as when a poet takes up a musical instrument he implies in so doing that he is a master up to a certain point of that instrument and can produce sweet sound from it and is able to fit the course and measure of his words to its tones which if he be not able to do he had better not have touched it in like manner to add color to a drawing is to undertake for the perfection of a visible music which if it be false will utterly and assuredly mar the whole work if true proportionately elevate it according to its power and sweetness but in no case ought the color to be added in order to increase the realization the drawing or engraving is all that the imagination needs to paint the subject merely to make it more real is only to insult the imaginative power and to vulgarize the whole hence the common though little understood feeling among men of ordinary cultivation that an inferior sketch is always better than a bad painting although in the latter there may verily be more skill than in the former for the painter who has presumed to touch color without perfectly understanding it not for the colors sake nor because he loves it but for the sake of completion merely has committed two sins against us he has dulled the imagination by not trusting it far enough and then in this languid state he oppresses it with base and false color for all color that is not lovely is discordant there is no mediate condition so therefore when it is permitted to enter at all it must be with the predetermination that cost what it will the color shall be right and lovely and i only wish that in general it were better understood that a painters business is to paint primarily and that all expression and grouping and conceiving and what else goes to constitute design are of less importance than color in a colored work and so they were always considered in the noble periods and sometimes all resemblance to nature whatever as in painted windows illuminated manuscripts and such other work is sacrificed to the brilliancy of color sometimes distinctness of form to its richness as by titian turner and reynolds and which is the point on which we are at present insisting sometimes in the pursuit of its utmost refinements on the surfaces of objects an amount of realization becomes consistent with noble art which would otherwise be altogether inadmissible that is to say which no great mind could otherwise have either produced or enjoyed the extreme finish given by the preraphaelites is rendered noble chiefly by their love of color  § xxviii so then whatever may be the means or whatever the more immediate end of any kind of art all of it that is good agrees in this that it is the expression of one soul talking to another and is precious according to the greatness of the soul that utters it and consider what mighty consequences follow from our acceptance of this truth what a key we have herein given us for the interpretation of the art of all time for as long as we held art to consist in any high manual skill or successful imitation of natural objects or any scientific and legalized manner of performance whatever it was necessary for us to limit our admiration to narrow periods and to few men according to our own knowledge and sympathies the period chosen might be different and our rest might be in greek statues or dutch landscapes or italian madonnas but whatever our choice we were therein captive barred from all reverence but of our favorite masters and habitually using the language of contempt towards the whole of the human race to whom it had not pleased heaven to reveal the arcana of the particular craftsmanship we admired and who it might be had lived their term of seventy years upon the earth and fitted themselves therein for the eternal world without any clear understanding sometimes even with an insolent disregard of the laws of perspective and chiaroscuro  but let us once comprehend the holier nature of the art of man and begin to look for the meaning of the spirit however syllabled and the scene is changed and we are changed also those small and dexterous creatures whom once we worshipped those furcapped divinities with sceptres of camels hair peering and poring in their onewindowed chambers over the minute preciousness of the labored canvas how are they swept away and crushed into unnoticeable darkness and in their stead as the walls of the dismal rooms that enclosed them and us are struck by the four winds of heaven and rent away and as the world opens to our sight lo far back into all the depths of time and forth from all the fields that have been sown with human life how the harvest of the dragons teeth is springing how the companies of the gods are ascending out of the earth the dark stones that have so long been the sepulchres of the thoughts of nations and the forgotten ruins wherein their faith lay charnelled give up the dead that were in them and beneath the egyptian ranks of sultry and silent rock and amidst the dim golden lights of the byzantine dome and out of the confused and cold shadows of the northern cloister behold the multitudinous souls come forth with singing gazing on us with the soft eyes of newly comprehended sympathy and stretching their white arms to us across the grave in the solemn gladness of everlasting brotherhood  § xxix the other danger to which it was above said we were primarily exposed under our present circumstances of life is the pursuit of vain pleasure that is to say false pleasure delight which is not indeed delight as knowledge vainly accumulated is not indeed knowledge and this we are exposed to chiefly in the fact of our ceasing to be children for the child does not seek false pleasure its pleasures are true simple and instinctive but the youth is apt to abandon his early and true delight for vanitiesseeking to be like men and sacrificing his natural and pure enjoyments to his pride in like manner it seems to me that modern civilization sacrifices much pure and true pleasure to various forms of ostentation from which it can receive no fruit consider for a moment what kind of pleasures are open to human nature undiseased passing by the consideration of the pleasures of the higher affections which lie at the root of everything and considering the definite and practical pleasures of daily life there is first the pleasure of doing good the greatest of all only apt to be despised from not being often enough tasted and then i know not in what order to put them nor does it matterthe pleasure of gaining knowledge the pleasure of the excitement of imagination and emotion or poetry and passion and lastly the gratification of the senses first of the eye then of the ear and then of the others in their order  § xxx all these we are apt to make subservient to the desire of praise nor unwisely when the praise sought is gods and the consciences but if the sacrifice is made for mans admiration and knowledge is only sought for praise passion repressed or affected for praise and the arts practised for praise we are feeding on the bitterest apples of sodom suffering always ten mortifications for one delight and it seems to me that in the modern civilized world we make such sacrifice doubly first by laboring for merely ambitious purposes and secondly which is the main point in question by being ashamed of simple pleasures more especially of the pleasure in sweet color and form a pleasure evidently so necessary to mans perfectness and virtue that the beauty of color and form has been given lavishly throughout the whole of creation so that it may become the food of all and with such intricacy and subtlety that it may deeply employ the thoughts of all if we refuse to accept the natural delight which the deity has thus provided for us we must either become ascetics or we must seek for some base and guilty pleasures to replace those of paradise which we have denied ourselves  some years ago in passing through some of the cells of the grand chartreuse noticing that the window of each apartment looked across the little garden of its inhabitant to the wall of the cell opposite and commanded no other view i asked the monk beside me why the window was not rather made on the side of the cell whence it would open to the solemn fields of the alpine valley we do not come here he replied to look at the mountains  § xxxi the same answer is given practically by the men of this century to every such question only the walls with which they enclose themselves are those of pride not of prayer but in the middle ages it was otherwise not indeed in landscape itself but in the art which can take the place of it in the noble color and form with which they illumined and into which they wrought every object around them that was in any wise subjected to their power they obeyed the laws of their inner nature and found its proper food the splendor and fantasy even of dress which in these days we pretend to despise or in which if we even indulge it is only for the sake of vanity and therefore to our infinite harm were in those early days studied for love of their true beauty and honorableness and became one of the main helps to dignity of character and courtesy of bearing look back to what we have been told of the dress of the early venetians that it was so invented that in clothing themselves with it they might clothe themselves also with modesty and honor54 consider what nobleness of expression there is in the dress of any of the portrait figures of the great times nay what perfect beauty and more than beauty there is in the folding of the robe round the imagined form even of the saint or of the angel and then consider whether the grace of vesture be indeed a thing to be despised we cannot despise it if we would and in all our highest poetry and happiest thought we cling to the magnificence which in daily life we disregard the essence of modern romance is simply the return of the heart and fancy to the things in which they naturally take pleasure and half the influence of the best romances of ivanhoe or marmion or the crusaders or the lady of the lake is completely dependent upon the accessaries of armor and costume nay more than this deprive the iliad itself of its costume and consider how much of its power would be lost and that delight and reverence which we feel in and by means of the mere imagination of these accessaries the middle ages had in the vision of them the nobleness of dress exercising as i have said a perpetual influence upon character tending in a thousand ways to increase dignity and selfrespect and together with grace of gesture to induce serenity of thought  § xxxii i do not mean merely in its magnificence the most splendid time was not the best time it was still in the thirteenth centurywhen as we have seen simplicity and gorgeousness were justly mingled and the leathern girdle and clasp of bone were worn as well as the embroidered mantlethat the manner of dress seems to have been noblest the chain mail of the knight flowing and falling over his form in lapping waves of gloomy strength was worn under full robes of one color in the ground his crest quartered on them and their borders enriched with subtle illumination the women wore first a dress close to the form in like manner and then long and flowing robes veiling them up to the neck and delicately embroidered around the hem the sleeves and the girdle the use of plate armor gradually introduced more fantastic types the nobleness of the form was lost beneath the steel the gradually increasing luxury and vanity of the age strove for continual excitement in more quaint and extravagant devices and in the fifteenth century dress reached its point of utmost splendor and fancy being in many cases still exquisitely graceful but now in its morbid magnificence devoid of all wholesome influence on manners from this point like architecture it was rapidly degraded and sank through the buff coat and lace collar and jackboot to the bagwig tailed coat and highheeled shoes and so to what it is now  § xxxiii precisely analogous to this destruction of beauty in dress has been that of beauty in architecture its color and grace and fancy being gradually sacrificed to the base forms of the renaissance exactly as the splendor of chivalry has faded into the paltriness of fashion and observe the form in which the necessary reaction has taken place necessary for it was not possible that one of the strongest instincts of the human race could be deprived altogether of its natural food exactly in the degree that the architect withdrew from his buildings the sources of delight which in early days they had so richly possessed demanding in accordance with the new principles of taste the banishment of all happy color and healthy invention in that degree the minds of men began to turn to landscape as their only resource the picturesque school of art rose up to address those capacities of enjoyment for which in sculpture architecture or the higher walks of painting there was employment no more and the shadows of rembrandt and savageness of salvator arrested the admiration which was no longer permitted to be rendered to the gloom or the grotesqueness of the gothic aisle and thus the english school of landscape culminating in turner is in reality nothing else than a healthy effort to fill the void which the destruction of gothic architecture has left  § xxxiv but the void cannot thus be completely filled no nor filled in any considerable degree the art of landscapepainting will never become thoroughly interesting or sufficing to the minds of men engaged in active life or concerned principally with practical subjects the sentiment and imagination necessary to enter fully into the romantic forms of art are chiefly the characteristics of youth so that nearly all men as they advance in years and some even from their childhood upwards must be appealed to if at all by a direct and substantial art brought before their daily observation and connected with their daily interests no form of art answers these conditions so well as architecture which as it can receive help from every character of mind in the workman can address every character of mind in the spectator forcing itself into notice even in his most languid moments and possessing this chief and peculiar advantage that it is the property of all men pictures and statues may be jealously withdrawn by their possessors from the public gaze and to a certain degree their safety requires them to be so withdrawn but the outsides of our houses belong not so much to us as to the passerby and whatever cost and pains we bestow upon them though too often arising out of ostentation have at least the effect of benevolence  § xxxv if then considering these things any of my readers should determine according to their means to set themselves to the revival of a healthy school of architecture in england and wish to know in few words how this may be done the answer is clear and simple first let us cast out utterly whatever is connected with the greek roman or renaissance architecture in principle or in form we have seen above that the whole mass of the architecture founded on greek and roman models which we have been in the habit of building for the last three centuries is utterly devoid of all life virtue honorableness or power of doing good it is base unnatural unfruitful unenjoyable and impious pagan in its origin proud and unholy in its revival paralyzed in its old age yet making prey in its dotage of all the good and living things that were springing around it in their youth as the dying and desperate king who had long fenced himself so strongly with the towers of it is said to have filled his failing veins with the blood of children55 an architecture invented as it seems to make plagiarists of its architects slaves of its workmen and sybarites of its inhabitants an architecture in which intellect is idle invention impossible but in which all luxury is gratified and all insolence fortifiedthe first thing we have to do is to cast it out and shake the dust of it from our feet for ever whatever has any connexion with the five orders or with any one of the orderswhatever is doric or ionic or tuscan or corinthian or composite or in any way grecized or romanized whatever betrays the smallest respect for vitruvian laws or conformity with palladian workthat we are to endure no more to cleanse ourselves of these cast clouts and rotten rags is the first thing to be done in the court of our prison  § xxxvi then to turn our prison into a palace is an easy thing we have seen above that exactly in the degree in which greek and roman architecture is lifeless unprofitable and unchristian in that same degree our own ancient gothic is animated serviceable and faithful we have seen that it is flexible to all duty enduring to all time instructive to all hearts honorable and holy in all offices it is capable alike of all lowliness and all dignity fit alike for cottage porch or castle gateway in domestic service familiar in religious sublime simple and playful so that childhood may read it yet clothed with a power that can awe the mightiest and exalt the loftiest of human spirits an architecture that kindles every faculty in its workman and addresses every emotion in its beholder which with every stone that is laid on its solemn walls raises some human heart a step nearer heaven and which from its birth has been incorporated with the existence and in all its form is symbolical of the faith of christianity in this architecture let us henceforward build alike the church the palace and the cottage but chiefly let us use it for our civil and domestic buildings these once ennobled our ecclesiastical work will be exalted together with them but churches are not the proper scenes for experiments in untried architecture nor for exhibitions of unaccustomed beauty it is certain that we must often fail before we can again build a natural and noble gothic let not our temples be the scenes of our failures it is certain that we must offend many deeprooted prejudices before ancient christian architecture56 can be again received by all of us let not religion be the first source of such offence we shall meet with difficulties in applying gothic architecture to churches which would in no wise affect the designs of civil buildings for the most beautiful forms of gothic chapels are not those which are best fitted for protestant worship as it was noticed in the second volume when speaking of the cathedral of torcello it seems not unlikely that as we study either the science of sound or the practice of the early christians we may see reason to place the pulpit generally at the extremity of the apse or chancel an arrangement entirely destructive of the beauty of a gothic church as seen in existing examples and requiring modifications of its design in other parts with which we should be unwise at present to embarrass ourselves besides that the effort to introduce the style exclusively for ecclesiastical purposes excites against it the strong prejudices of many persons who might otherwise be easily enlisted among its most ardent advocates i am quite sure for instance that if such noble architecture as has been employed for the interior of the church just built in margaret street57 had been seen in a civil building it would have decided the question with many men at once whereas at present it will be looked upon with fear and suspicion as the expression of the ecclesiastical principles of a particular party but whether thus regarded or not this church assuredly decides one question conclusively that of our present capability of gothic design it is the first piece of architecture i have seen built in modern days which is free from all signs of timidity or incapacity in general proportion of parts in refinement and piquancy of mouldings above all in force vitality and grace of floral ornament worked in a broad and masculine manner it challenges fearless comparison with the noblest work of any time having done this we may do anything there need be no limits to our hope or our confidence and i believe it to be possible for us not only to equal but far to surpass in some respects any gothic yet seen in northern countries in the introduction of figuresculpture we must indeed for the present remain utterly inferior for we have no figures to study from no architectural sculpture was ever good for anything which did not represent the dress and persons of the people living at the time and our modern dress will not form decorations for spandrils and niches but in floral sculpture we may go far beyond what has yet been done as well as in refinement of inlaid work and general execution for although the glory of gothic architecture is to receive the rudest work it refuses not the best and when once we have been content to admit the handling of the simplest workman we shall soon be rewarded by finding many of our simple workmen become cunning ones and with the help of modern wealth and science we may do things like giottos campanile instead of like our own rude cathedrals but better than giottos campanile insomuch as we may adopt the pure and perfect forms of the northern gothic and work them out with the italian refinement it is hardly possible at present to imagine what may be the splendor of buildings designed in the forms of english and french thirteenth century surface gothic and wrought out with the refinement of italian art in the details and with a deliberate resolution since we cannot have figure sculpture to display in them the beauty of every flower and herb of the english fields each by each doing as much for every tree that roots itself in our rocks and every blossom that drinks our summer rains as our ancestors did for the oak the ivy and the rose let this be the object of our ambition and let us begin to approach it not ambitiously but in all humility accepting help from the feeblest hands and the london of the nineteenth century may yet become as venice without her despotism and as florence without her dispeace   footnotes    46 in the works of turner and the preraphaelites    47 observe i speak of these various principles as selfevident     only under the present circumstances of the world not as if they     had always been so and i call them now selfevident not merely     because they seem so to myself but because they are felt to be so     likewise by all the men in whom i place most trust but granting     that they are not so then their very disputability proves the state     of infancy above alleged as characteristic of the world for i do     not suppose that any christian reader will doubt the first great     truth that whatever facts or laws are important to mankind god has     made ascertainable by mankind and that as the decision of all these     questions is of vital importance to the race that decision must     have been long ago arrived at unless they were still in a state of     childhood    48 i intended to have given a sketch in this place above referred     to of the probable results of the daguerreotype and calotype within     the next few years in modifying the application of the engravers     art but i have not had time to complete the experiments necessary     to enable me to speak with certainty of one thing however i have     little doubt that an infinite service will soon be done to a large     body of our engravers namely the making them draughtsmen in black     and white on paper instead of steel    49 i mean art in its highest sense all that men do ingeniously is     art in one sense in fact we want a definition of the word art     much more accurate than any in our minds at present for strictly     speaking there is no such thing as fine or high art all art     is a low and common thing and what we indeed respect is not art at     all but instinct or inspiration expressed by the help of art    50 socrates this then was what i asked you whether that     which puts anything else to service and the thing which is put to     service by it are always two different things      alcibiades i think so      socrates what shall we then say of the leathercutter does he     cut his leather with his instruments only or with his hands also      alcibiades with his hands also      socrates does he not use his eyes as well as his hands      alcibiades yes      socrates and we agreed

exalt that of the ear in music do they really suppose the eye is a     less noble bodily organ than the earthat the organ by which     nearly all our knowledge of the external universe is communicated to     us and through which we learn the wonder and the love can be less     exalted in its own peculiar delight than the ear which is only for     the communication of the ideas which owe to the eye their very     existence i do not mean to depreciate music let it be loved and     reverenced as is just only let the delight of the eye be reverenced     more the great power of music over the multitude is owing not to     its being less but more sensual than color it is so distinctly     and so richly sensual that it can be idly enjoyed it is exactly at     the point where the lower and higher pleasures of the senses and     imagination are balanced so that pure and great minds love it for     its invention and emotion and lower minds for its sensual power    54 vol ii appendix 7

hardly attract the eye where so much has been already     done with precious and beautiful marble and is yet to be done in     fresco much will depend however upon the coloring of this latter     portion i wish that either holman hunt or millais could be     prevailed upon to do at least some of these smaller frescoes     appendix   1 architect of the ducal palace  popular tradition and a large number of the chroniclers ascribe the building of the ducal palace to that filippo calendario who suffered death for his share in the conspiracy of faliero he was certainly one of the leading architects of the time and had for several years the superintendence of the works of the palace but it appears from the documents collected by the abbé cadorin that the first designer of the palace the man to whom we owe the adaptation of the frari traceries to civil architecture was pietro baseggio who is spoken of expressly as formerly the chief master of our new palace58 in the decree of 1361 quoted by cadorin and who at his death left calendario his executor other documents collected by zanotto in his work on venezia e le sue lagune show that calendario was for a long time at sea under the commands of the signory returning to venice only three or four years before his death and that therefore the entire management of the works of the palace in the most important period must have been entrusted to baseggio  it is quite impossible however in the present state of the palace to distinguish one architects work from another in the older parts and i have not in the text embarrassed the reader by any attempt at close definition of epochs before the great junction of the piazzetta façade with the older palace in the fifteenth century here however it is necessary that i should briefly state the observations i was able to make on the relative dates of the earlier portions  in the description of the figtree angle given in the eighth chapter of vol ii i said that it seemed to me somewhat earlier than that of the vine and the reader might be surprised at the apparent opposition of this statement to my supposition that the palace was built gradually round from the rio façade to the piazzetta but in the two great open arcades there is no succession of work traceable from the vine angle to the junction with the fifteenth century work above and below all seems nearly of the same date the only question being of the accidental precedence of workmanship of one capital or another and i think from its style that the figtree angle must have been first completed but in the upper stories of the palace there are enormous differences of style on the rio façade in the upper story are several series of massive windows of the third order corresponding exactly in mouldings and manner of workmanship to those of the chapterhouse of the frari and consequently carrying us back to a very early date in the fourteenth century several of the capitals of these windows and two richly sculptured stringcourses in the wall below are of byzantine workmanship and in all probability fragments of the ziani palace the traceried windows on the rio façade and the two eastern windows on the sea façade are all of the finest early fourteenth century work masculine and noble in their capitals and bases to the highest degree and evidently contemporary with the very earliest portions of the lower arcades but the moment we come to the windows of the great council chamber the style is debased the mouldings are the same but they are coarsely worked and the heads set amidst the leafage of the capitals quite valueless and vile  i have not the least doubt that these windowjambs and traceries were restored after the great fire59 and various other restorations have taken place since beginning with the removal of the traceries from all the windows except the northern one of the sala del scrutinio behind the porta della carta where they are still left i made out four periods of restoration among these windows each baser than the preceding it is not worth troubling the reader about them but the traveller who is interested in the subject may compare two of them in the same window the one nearer the sea of the two belonging to the little room at the top of the palace on the piazzetta façade between the sala del gran consiglio and that of the scrutinio the seaward jamb of that window is of the first and the opposite jamb of the second period of these restorations these are all the points of separation in date which i could discover by internal evidence but much more might be made out by any venetian antiquary whose time permitted him thoroughly to examine any existing documents which allude to or describe the parts of the palace spoken of in the important decrees of 1340 1342 and 1344 for the first of these decrees speaks of certain columns looking towards the canal60 or sea as then existing and i presume these columns to have been part of the ziani palace corresponding to the part of that palace on the piazzetta where were the red columns between which calendario was executed and a great deal more might be determined by any one who would thoroughly unravel the obscure language of those decrees  meantime in order to complete the evidence respecting the main dates stated in the text i have collected here such notices of the building of the ducal palace as appeared to me of most importance in the various chronicles i examined i could not give them all in the text as they repeat each other and would have been tedious but they will be interesting to the antiquary and it is to be especially noted in all of them how the palazzo vecchio is invariably distinguished either directly or by implication from the palazzo nuovo i shall first translate the piece of the zancarol chronicle given by cadorin which has chiefly misled the venetian antiquaries i wish i could put the rich old italian into old english but must be content to lose its raciness as it is necessary that the reader should be fully acquainted with its facts  it was decreed that none should dare to propose to the signory of venice to ruin the old palace and rebuild it new and more richly and there was a penalty of one thousand ducats against any one who should break it then the doge wishing to set forward the public good said to the signory  that they ought to rebuild the façades of the old palace and that it ought to be restored to do honor to the nation and so soon as he had done speaking the avogadori demanded the penalty from the doge for having disobeyed the law and the doge with ready mind paid it remaining in his opinion that the said fabric ought to be built and so in the year 1422 on the 20th day of september it was passed in the council of the pregadi that the said new palace should be begun and the expense should be borne by the signori del sal and so on the 24th day of march 1424 it was begun to throw down the old palace and to build it anewcadorin p 129  the day of the month and the council in which the decree was passed are erroneously given by this chronicle cadorin has printed the words of the decree itself which passed in the great council on the 27th september and these words are fortunately much to our present purpose for as more than one façade is spoken of in the above extract the marchese selvatico was induced to believe that both the front to the sea and that to the piazzetta had been destroyed whereas the façades spoken of are evidently those of the ziani palace for the words of the decree which are much more trustworthy than those of the chronicle even if there were any inconsistency between them run thus palatium nostrum fabricetur et fiat in forma decora et convenienti quod respondeat solemnissimo principio palatii nostri novi thus the new council chamber and façade to the sea are called the most venerable beginning of our new palace and the rest was ordered to be designed in accordance with these as was actually the case as far as the porta della carta but the renaissance architects who thenceforward proceeded with the fabric broke through the design and built everything else according to their own humors  the question may be considered as set at rest by these words of the decree even without any internal or any farther documentary evidence but rather for the sake of impressing the facts thoroughly on the readers mind than of any additional proof i shall quote a few more of the best accredited chronicles  the passage given by bettio from the sivos chronicle is a very important parallel with that from the zancarol above  essendo molto vecchio e quasi rovinoso el palazzo sopra la piazza fo deliberato di far quella parte tutta da novo et continuarla com è quella della sala grande et cosi il lunedi 27 marzo 1424 fu dato principio a ruinare detto palazzo vecchio dalla parte ch è verso panateria cioè della giustizia ch è nelli occhi di sopra le colonne fino alla chiesa et fo fatto anco la porta grande com è al presente con la sala che si addimanda la libraria61  we have here all the facts told us in so many words the old palace is definitely stated to have been on the piazza and it is to be rebuilt like the part of the great saloon the very point from which the newer buildings commenced is told us but here the chronicler has carried his attempt at accuracy too far the point of junction is as stated above at the third pillar beyond the medallion of venice and i am much at a loss to understand what could have been the disposition of these three pillars where they joined the ziani palace and how they were connected with the arcade of the inner cortile but with these difficulties as they do not bear on the immediate question it is of no use to trouble the reader  the next passage i shall give is from a chronicle in the marcian library bearing title supposta di zancaruol but in which i could not find the passage given by cadorin from i believe a manuscript of this chronicle at vienna there occurs instead of it the following thus headed  come la parte nova del palazzo fuo hedificata novamente  el palazzo novo de venesia quella parte che xe verso la chiesia de s marcho fuo prexo chel se fesse del 1422 e fosse pagado la spexa per li officiali del sal e fuo fatto per sovrastante g nicolo barberigo cum provision de ducati x doro al mexe e fuo fabricado e fatto nobelissimo come fin ancho di el sta e fuo grande honor a la signoria de venesia e a la sua citta  this entry which itself bears no date but comes between others dated 22nd july and 27th december is interesting because it shows the first transition of the idea of newness from the grand council chamber to the part built under foscari for when mocenigos wishes had been fulfilled and the old palace of ziani had been destroyed and another built in its stead the great council chamber which was the new palace compared with zianis became the old palace compared with foscaris and thus we have in the body of the above extract the whole building called the new palace of venice but in the heading of it we have the new part of the palace applied to the part built by foscari in contradistinction to the council chamber  the next entry i give is important because the writing of the ms in which it occurs no 53 in the correr museum shows it to be probably not later than the end of the fifteenth century  el palazo nuovo de venixia zoe quella parte che se sora la piazza verso la giesia di miss san marcho del 1422 fo principiado el qual fo fato e finito molto belo chome al presente se vede nobilissimo et a la fabricha de quello fo deputado miss nicolo barberigo soprastante con ducati dieci doro al mexe  we have here the part built by foscari distinctly called the palazzo nuovo as opposed to the great council chamber which had now completely taken the position of the palazzo vecchio and is actually so called by sansovino in the copy of the chronicle of paolo morosini and in the mss numbered respectively 57 59 74 and 76 in the correr museum the passage above given from no 53 is variously repeated with slight modifications and curtailments the entry in the morosini chronicle being headed come fu principiato il palazo che guarda sopra la piaza grande di s marco and proceeding in the words el palazo nuovo di venetia cioè quella parte che e sopra la piaza c the writers being cautious in all these instances to limit their statement to the part facing the piazza that no reader might suppose the council chamber to have been built or begun at the same time though as long as to the end of the sixteenth century we find the council chamber still included in the expression palazzo nuovo thus in the ms no 75 in the correr museum which is about that date we have del 1422 a di 20 settembre fu preso nel consegio grando de dover compir el palazo novo e dovesen fare la spessa li officialli del sal 61 m 2 b and so long as this is the case the palazzo vecchio always means the ziani palace thus in the next page of this same ms we have a di 27 marzo 1424 by context fo principia a butar zosso el palazzo vecchio per refarlo da novo e poi se he and so it is done and in the ms no 81 del 1424 fo gittado zoso el palazzo vecchio per refarlo de nuovo a di 27 marzo but in the time of sansovino the ziani palace was quite forgotten the council chamber was then the old palace and foscaris part was the new his account of the palazzo publico will now be perfectly intelligible but as the work itself is easily accessible i shall not burden the reader with any farther extracts only noticing that the chequering of the façade with red and white marbles which he ascribes to foscari may or may not be of so late a date as there is nothing in the style of the work which can be produced as evidence   2 theology of spenser  the following analysis of the first books of the faërie queen may be interesting to readers who have been in the habit of reading the noble poem too hastily to connect its parts completely together and may perhaps induce them to more careful study of the rest of the poem  the redcrosse knight is holinessthe pietas of st marks the devotio of orcagnameaning i think in general reverence and godly fear  this virtue in the opening of the book has truth or una at its side but presently enters the wandering wood and encounters the serpent error that is to say error in her universal form the first enemy of reverence and holiness and more especially error as founded on learning for when holiness strangles her    her vomit full of bookes and papers was    with loathly frogs and toades which eyes did lacke  having vanquished this first open and palpable form of error as reverence and religion must always vanquish it the knight encounters hypocrisy or archimagus holiness cannot detect hypocrisy but believes him and goes home with him whereupon hypocrisy succeeds in separating holiness from truth and the knight holiness and lady truth go forth separately from the house of archimagus  now observe the moment godly fear or holiness is separated from truth he meets infidelity or the knight sans foy infidelity having falsehood or duesa riding behind him the instant the redcrosse knight is aware of the attack of infidelity he    gan fairly couch his speare and towards ride  he vanquishes and slays infidelity but is deceived by his companion falsehood and takes her for his lady thus showing the condition of religion when after being attacked by doubt and remaining victorious it is nevertheless seduced by any form of falsehood to pay reverence where it ought not this then is the first fortune of godly fear separated from truth the poet then returns to truth separated from godly fear she is immediately attended by a lion or violence which makes her dreaded wherever she comes and when she enters the mart of superstition this lion tears kirkrapine in pieces showing how truth separated from godliness does indeed put an end to the abuses of superstition but does so violently and desperately she then meets again with hypocrisy whom she mistakes for her own lord or godly fear and travels a little way under his guardianship hypocrisy thus not unfrequently appearing to defend the truth until they are both met by lawlessness or the knight sans loy whom hypocrisy cannot resist lawlessness overthrows hypocrisy and seizes upon truth first slaying her lion attendant showing that the first aim of licence is to destroy the force and authority of truth sans loy then takes truth captive and bears her away now this lawlessness is the unrighteousness or adikia of st paul and his bearing truth away captive is a type of those who hold the truth in unrighteousnessthat is to say generally of men who knowing what is true make the truth give way to their own purposes or use it only to forward them as is the case with so many of the popular leaders of the present day una is then delivered from sans loy by the satyrs to show that nature in the end must work out the deliverance of the truth although where it has been captive to lawlessness that deliverance can only be obtained through savageness and a return to barbarism una is then taken from among the satyrs by satyrane the son of a satyr and a lady myld fair thyamis typifying the early steps of renewed civilization and its rough and hardy character nousled up in life and manners wilde who meeting again with sans loy enters instantly into rough and prolonged combat with him showing how the early organization of a hardy nation must be wrought out through much discouragement from lawlessness this contest the poet leaving for the time undecided returns to trace the adventures of the redcrosse knight or godly fear who having vanquished infidelity presently is led by falsehood to the house of pride thus showing how religion separated from truth is first tempted by doubts of god and then by the pride of life the description of this house of pride is one of the most elaborate and noble pieces in the poem and here we begin to get at the proposed system of virtues and vices for pride as queen has six other vices yoked in her chariot namely first idleness then gluttony lust avarice envy and anger all driven on by sathan with a smarting whip in hand from these lower vices and their company godly fear though lodging in the house of pride holds aloof but he is challenged and has a hard battle to fight with sans joy the brother of sans foy showing that though he has conquered infidelity and does not give himself up to the allurements of pride he is yet exposed so long as he dwells in her house to distress of mind and loss of his accustomed rejoicing before god he however having partly conquered despondency or sans joy falsehood goes down to hades in order to obtain drugs to maintain the power or life of despondency but meantime the knight leaves the house of pride falsehood pursues and overtakes him and finds him by a fountain side of which the waters are                             dull and slow   and all that drinke thereof do faint and feeble grow  of which the meaning is that godly fear after passing through the house of pride is exposed to drowsiness and feebleness of watch as after peters boast came peters sleeping from weakness of the flesh and then last of all peters fall and so it follows for the redcrosse knight being overcome with faintness by drinking of the fountain is thereupon attacked by the giant orgoglio overcome and thrown by him into a dungeon this orgoglio is orgueil or carnal pride not the pride of life spiritual and subtle but the common and vulgar pride in the power of this world and his throwing the redcrosse knight into a dungeon is a type of the captivity of true religion under the temporal power of corrupt churches more especially of the church of rome and of its gradually wasting away in unknown places while carnal pride has the preëminence over all things that spenser means especially the pride of the papacy is shown by the 16th stanza of the book for there the giant orgoglio is said to have taken duessa or falsehood for his deare and to have set upon her head a triple crown and endowed her with royal majesty and made her to ride upon a sevenheaded beast  in the meantime the dwarf the attendant of the redcrosse knight takes his arms and finding una tells her of the captivity of her lord una in the midst of her mourning meets prince arthur in whom as spenser himself tells us is set forth generally magnificence but who as is shown by the choice of the heros name is more especially the magnificence or literally great doing of the kingdom of england this power of england going forth with truth attacks orgoglio or the pride of papacy slays him strips duessa or falsehood naked and liberates the redcrosse knight the magnificent and wellknown description of despair follows by whom the redcrosse knight is hard bested on account of his past errors and captivity and is only saved by truth who perceiving him to be still feeble brings him to the house of coelia called in the argument of the canto holiness but properly heavenly grace the mother of the virtues her three daughters well upbrought are faith hope and charity her porter is humility because humility opens the door of heavenly grace zeal and reverence are her chamberlains introducing the new comers to her presence her groom or servant is obedience and her physician patience under the commands of charity the matron mercy rules over her hospital under whose care the knight is healed of his sickness and it is to be especially noticed how much importance spenser though never ceasing to chastise all hypocrisies and mere observances of form attaches to true and faithful penance in effecting this cure having his strength restored to him the knight is trusted to the guidance of mercy who leading him forth by a narrow and thorny way first instructs him in the seven works of mercy and then leads him to the hill of heavenly contemplation whence having a sight of the new jerusalem as christian of the delectable mountains he goes forth to the final victory over satan the old serpent with which the book closes   3 austrian government in italy  i cannot close these volumes without expressing my astonishment and regret at the facility with which the english allow themselves to be misled by any representations however openly groundless or ridiculous proceeding from the italian liberal party respecting the present administration of the austrian government i do not choose here to enter into any political discussion or express any political opinion but it is due to justice to state the simple facts which came under my notice during my residence in italy i was living at venice through two entire winters and in the habit of familiar association both with italians and austrians my own antiquarian vocations rendering such association possible without exciting the distrust of either party during this whole period i never once was able to ascertain from any liberal italian that he had a single definite ground of complaint against the government there was much general grumbling and vague discontent but i never was able to bring one of them to the point or to discover what it was that they wanted or in what way they felt themselves injured nor did i ever myself witness an instance of oppression on the part of the government though several of much kindness and consideration the indignation of those of my own countrymen and countrywomen whom i happened to see during their sojourn in venice was always vivid but by no means large in its grounds english ladies on their first arrival invariably began the conversation with the same remark what a dreadful thing it was to be ground under the iron heel of despotism upon closer inquiries it always appeared that being ground under the heel of despotism was a poetical expression for being asked for ones passport at san juliano and required to fetch it from san lorenzo full a mile and a quarter distant in like manner travellers after two or three days residence in the city used to return with pitiful lamentations over the misery of the italian people upon inquiring what instances they had met with of this misery it invariably turned out that their gondoliers after being paid three times their proper fare had asked for something to drink and had attributed the fact of their being thirsty to the austrian government the misery of the italians consists in having three festa days a week and doing in their days of exertion about one fourth as much work as an english laborer  there is indeed much true distress occasioned by the measures which the government is sometimes compelled to take in order to repress sedition but the blame of this lies with those whose occupation is the excitement of sedition so also there is much grievous harm done to works of art by the occupation of the country by so large an army but for the mode in which that army is quartered the italian municipalities are answerable not the austrians whenever i was shocked by finding as abovementioned at milan a cloister or a palace occupied by soldiery i always discovered on investigation that the place had been given by the municipality and that beyond requiring that lodging for a certain number of men should be found in such and such a quarter of the town the austrians had nothing to do with the matter this does not however make the mischief less and it is strange if we think of it to see italy with all her precious works of art made a continual battlefield as if no other place for settling their disputes could be found by the european powers than where every random shot may destroy what a kings ransom cannot restore62 it is exactly as if the tumults in paris could he settled no otherwise than by fighting them out in the gallery of the louvre   4 date of the palaces of the byzantine renaissance  in the sixth article of the appendix to the first volume the question of the date of the casa dario and casa trevisan was deferred until i could obtain from my friend mr rawdon brown to whom the former palace once belonged some more distinct data respecting this subject than i possessed myself  speaking first of the casa dario he says fontana dates it from about the year 1450 and considers it the earliest specimen of the architecture founded by pietro lombardo and followed by his sons tullio and antonio in a sanuto autograph miscellany purchased by me long ago and which i gave to st marks library are two letters from giovanni dario dated 10th and 11th july 1485 in the neighborhood of adrianople where the turkish camp found itself and bajazet ii received presents from the soldan of egypt from the schah of the indies query grand mogul and from the king of hungary of these matters darios letters give many curious details then in the printed malipiero annals page 136 which err i think by a year the secretary darios negotiations at the porte are alluded to and in date of 1484 he is stated to have returned to venice having quarrelled with the venetian bailiff at constantinople the annalist adds that giovanni dario was a native of candia and that the republic was so well satisfied with him for having concluded peace with bajazet that he received as a gift from his country an estate at noventa in the paduan territory worth 1500 ducats and 600 ducats in cash for the dower of one of his daughters these largesses probably enabled him to build his house about the year 1486 and are doubtless hinted at in the inscription which i restored ad 1837 it had no date and ran thus urbis  genio  joannes  darivs in the venetian history of paolo morosini page 594 it is also mentioned that giovanni dario was moreover the secretary who concluded the peace between mahomet the conqueror of constantinople and venice ad 1478 but unless he build his house by proxy that date has nothing to do with it and in my mind the fact of the present and the inscription warrant ones dating it 1486 and not 1450  the trevisancappello house in canonica was once the property ad 1578 of a venetian dame fond of crayfish according to a letter of hers in the archives whereby she thanks one of her lovers for some which he had sent her from treviso to florence of which she was then grand duchess her name has perhaps found its way into the english annuals did you ever hear of bianca cappello she bought that house of the trevisana family by whom selva in cicognara and fontana following selva say it was ordered of the lombardi at the commencement of the sixteenth century but the inscription on its façade thus    soli     honor et   deo      gloria  reminding one both of the dario house and of the words non nobis domine inscribed on the façade of the loredano vendramin palace at s marcuola now the property of the duchess of berri of which selva found proof in the vendramin archives that it was commenced by sante lombardo ad 1481 is in favor of its being classed among the works of the fifteenth century   5 renaissance side of ducal palace  in passing along the rio del palazzo the traveller ought especially to observe the base of the renaissance building formed by alternately depressed and raised pyramids the depressed portions being casts of the projecting ones which are truncated on the summits the work cannot be called rustication for it is cut as sharply and delicately as a piece of ivory but it thoroughly answers the end which rustication proposes and misses it gives the base of the building a look of crystalline hardness actually resembling and that very closely the appearance presented by the fracture of a piece of cap quartz while yet the light and shade of its alternate recesses and projections are so varied as to produce the utmost possible degree of delight to the eye attainable by a geometrical pattern so simple yet with all this high merit it is not a base which could be brought into general use its brilliancy and piquancy are here set off with exquisite skill by its opposition to mouldings in the upper part of the building of an almost effeminate delicacy and its complexity is rendered delightful by its contrast with the ruder bases of the other buildings of the city but it would look meagre if it were employed to sustain bolder masses above and would become wearisome if the eye were once thoroughly familiarized with it by repetition   6 character of the doge michele morosini  the following extracts from the letter of count charles morosini above mentioned appear to set the question at rest  it is our unhappy destiny that during the glory of the venetian republic no one took the care to leave us a faithful and conscientious history but i hardly know whether this misfortune should be laid to the charge of the historians themselves or of those commentators who have destroyed their trustworthiness by new accounts of things invented by themselves as for the poor morosini we may perhaps save his honor by assembling a conclave of our historians in order to receive their united sentence for in this case he would have the absolute majority on his side nearly all the authors bearing testimony to his love for his country and to the magnanimity of his heart i must tell you that the history of daru is not looked upon with esteem by wellinformed men and it is said that he seems to have no other object in view than to obscure the glory of all actions i know not on what authority the english writer depends but he has perhaps merely copied the statement of daru i have consulted an ancient and authentic ms belonging to the venieri family a ms well known and certainly better worthy of confidence than darus history and it says nothing of m morosini but that he was elected doge to the delight and joy of all men neither do the savina or dolfin chronicles say a word of the shameful speculation and our best informed men say that the reproach cast by some historians against the doge perhaps arose from a mistaken interpretation of the words pronounced by him and reported by marin sanuto that the speculation would sooner or later have been advantageous to the country but this single consideration is enough to induce us to form a favorable conclusion respecting the honor of this man namely that he was not elected doge until after he had been entrusted with many honorable embassies to the genoese and carrarese as well as to the king of hungary and amadeus of savoy and if in these embassies he had not shown himself a true lover of his country the republic not only would not again have entrusted him with offices so honorable but would never have rewarded him with the dignity of doge therein to succeed such a man as andrea contarini and the war of chioggia during which it is said that he tripled his fortune by speculations took place during the reign of contarini 1379 1380 while morosini was absent on foreign embassies   7 modern education  the following fragmentary notes on this subject have been set down at different times i have been accidentally prevented from arranging them properly for publication but there are one or two truths in them which it is better to express insufficiently than not at all                                       by a large body of the people of england and of europe a man is called educated if he can write latin verses and construe a greek chorus by some few more enlightened persons it is confessed that the construction of hexameters is not in itself an important end of human existence but they say that the general discipline which a course of classical reading gives to the intellectual powers is the final object of our scholastical institutions  but it seems to me there is no small error even in this last and more philosophical theory i believe that what it is most honorable to know it is also most profitable to learn and that the science which it is the highest power to possess it is also the best exercise to acquire  and if this be so the question as to what should be the materiel of education becomes singularly simplified it might be matter of dispute what processes have the greatest effect in developing the intellect but it can hardly be disputed what facts it is most advisable that a man entering into life should accurately know  i believe in brief that he ought to know three things    first   where he is   secondly   where he is going   thirdly   what he had best do under those circumstances  first where he isthat is to say what sort of a world he has got into how large it is what kind of creatures live in it and how what it is made of and what may be made of it  secondly where he is goingthat is to say what chances or reports there are of any other world besides this what seems to be the nature of that other world and whether for information respecting it he had better consult the bible koran or council of trent  thirdly what he had best do under those circumstancesthat is to say what kind of faculties he possesses what are the present state and wants of mankind what is his place in society and what are the readiest means in his power of attaining happiness and diffusing it the man who knows these things and who has had his will so subdued in the learning them that he is ready to do what he knows he ought i should call educated and the man who knows them notuneducated though he could talk all the tongues of babel  our present european system of socalled education ignores or despises not one nor the other but all the three of these great branches of human knowledge  first it despises natural historyuntil within the last year or two the instruction in the physical sciences given at oxford consisted of a course of twelve or fourteen lectures on the elements of mechanics or pneumatics and permission to ride out to shotover with the professor of geology i do not know the specialties of the system pursued in the academies of the continent but their practical result is that unless a mans natural instincts urge him to the pursuit of the physical sciences too strongly to be resisted he enters into life utterly ignorant of them i cannot within my present limits even so much as count the various directions in which this ignorance does evil but the main mischief of it is that it leaves the greater number of men without the natural food which god intended for their intellects for one man who is fitted for the study of words fifty are fitted for the study of things and were intended to have a perpetual simple and religious delight in watching the processes or admiring the creatures of the natural universe deprived of this source of pleasure nothing is left to them but ambition or dissipation and the vices of the upper classes of europe are i believe chiefly to be attributed to this single cause  secondly it despises religioni do not say it despises theology that is to say talk about god but it despises religion that is to say the binding or training to gods service there is much talk and much teaching in all our academies of which the effect is not to bind but to loosen the elements of religious faith of the ten or twelve young men who at oxford were my especial friends who sat with me under the same lectures on divinity or were punished with me for missing lecture by being sent to evening prayers63 four are now zealous romanistsa large average out of twelve and while thus our own universities profess to teach protestantism and do not the universities on the continent profess to teach romanism and do notsending forth only rebels and infidels during long residence on the continent i do not remember meeting with above two or three young men who either believed in revelation or had the grace to hesitate in the assertion of their infidelity  whence it seems to me we may gather one of two things either that there is nothing in any european form of religion so reasonable or ascertained as that it can be taught securely to our youth or fastened in their minds by any rivets of proof which they shall not be able to loosen the moment they begin to think or else that no means are taken to train them in such demonstrable creeds  it seems to me the duty of a rational nation to ascertain and to be at some pains in the matter which of these suppositions is true and if indeed no proof can be given of any supernatural fact or divine doctrine stronger than a youth just out of his teens can overthrow in the first stirrings of serious thought to confess this boldly to get rid of the expense of an establishment and the hypocrisy of a liturgy to exhibit its cathedrals as curious memorials of a bygone superstition and abandoning all thoughts of the next world to set itself to make the best it can of this  but if on the other hand there does exist any evidence by which the probability of certain religious facts may be shown as clearly even as the probabilities of things not absolutely ascertained in astronomical or geological science let this evidence be set before all our youth so distinctly and the facts for which it appears inculcated upon them so steadily that although it may be possible for the evil conduct of after life to efface or for its earnest and protracted meditation to modify the impressions of early years it may not be possible for our young men the instant they emerge from their academies to scatter themselves like a flock of wild fowl risen out of a marsh and drift away on every irregular wind of heresy and apostasy  lastly our system of european education despises politicsthat is to say the science of the relations and duties of men to each other one would imagine indeed by a glance at the state of the world that there was no such science and indeed it is one still in its infancy  it implies in its full sense the knowledge of the operations of the virtues and vices of men upon themselves and society the understanding of the ranks and offices of their intellectual and bodily powers in their various adaptations to art science and industry the understanding of the proper offices of art science and labor themselves as well as of the foundations of jurisprudence and broad principles of commerce all this being coupled with practical knowledge of the present state and wants of mankind  what it will be said and is all this to be taught to schoolboys no but the first elements of it all that are necessary to be known by an individual in order to his acting wisely in any station of life might be taught not only to every schoolboy but to every peasant the impossibility of equality among men the good which arises from their inequality the compensating circumstances in different states and fortunes the honorableness of every man who is worthily filling his appointed place in society however humble the proper relations of poor and rich governor and governed the nature of wealth and mode of its circulation the difference between productive and unproductive labor the relation of the products of the mind and hand the true value of works of the higher arts and the possible amount of their production the meaning of civilization its advantages and dangers the meaning of the term refinement the possibilities of possessing refinement in a low station and of losing it in a high one and above all the significance of almost every act of a mans daily life in its ultimate operation upon himself and othersall this might be and ought to be taught to every boy in the kingdom so completely that it should be just as impossible to introduce an absurd or licentious doctrine among our adult population as a new version of the multiplication table nor am i altogether without hope that some day it may enter into the heads of the tutors of our schools to try whether it is not as easy to make an eton boys mind as sensitive to falseness in policy as his ear is at present to falseness in prosody  i know that this is much to hope that english ministers of religion should ever come to desire rather to make a youth acquainted with the powers of nature and of god than with the powers of greek particles that they should ever think it more useful to show him how the great universe rolls upon its course in heaven than how the syllables are fitted in a tragic metre that they should hold it more advisable for him to be fixed in the principles of religion than in those of syntax or finally that they should ever come to apprehend that a youth likely to go straight out of college into parliament might not unadvisably know as much of the peninsular as of the peloponnesian war and be as well acquainted with the state of modern italy as of old etruriaall this however unreasonably i do hope and mean to work for for though i have not yet abandoned all expectation of a better world than this i believe this in which we live is not so good as it might be i know there are many people who suppose french revolutions italian insurrections caffre wars and such other scenic effects of modern policy to be among the normal conditions of humanity i know there are many who think the atmosphere of rapine rebellion and misery which wraps the lower orders of europe more closely every day is as natural a phenomenon as a hot summer but god forbid there are ills which flesh is heir to and troubles to which man is born but the troubles which he is born to are as sparks which fly upward not as flames burning to the nethermost hell the poor we must have with us always and sorrow is inseparable from any hour of life but we may make their poverty such as shall inherit the earth and the sorrow such as shall be hallowed by the hand of the comforter with everlasting comfort we can if we will but shake off this lethargy and dreaming that is upon us and take the pains to think and act like men we can i say make kingdoms to be like wellgoverned households in which indeed while no care or kindness can prevent occasional heartburnings nor any foresight or piety anticipate all the vicissitudes of fortune or avert every stroke of calamity yet the unity of their affection and fellowship remains unbroken and their distress is neither embittered by division prolonged by imprudence nor darkened by dishonor                                       the great leading error of modern times is the mistaking erudition for education i call it the leading error for i believe that with little difficulty nearly every other might be shown to have root in it and most assuredly the worst that are fallen into on the subject of art  education then briefly is the leading human souls to what is best and making what is best out of them and these two objects are always attainable together and by the same means the training which makes men happiest in themselves also makes them most serviceable to others true education then has respect first to the ends which are proposable to the man or attainable by him and secondly to the material of which the man is made so far as it is able it chooses the end according to the material but it cannot always choose the end for the position of many persons in life is fixed by necessity still less can it choose the material and therefore all it can do is to fit the one to the other as wisely as may be  but the first point to be understood is that the material is as various as the ends that not only one man is unlike another but every man is essentially different from every other so that no training no forming nor informing will ever make two persons alike in thought or in power among all men whether of the upper or lower orders the differences are eternal and irreconcilable between one individual and another born under absolutely the same circumstances one man is made of agate another of oak one of slate another of clay the education of the first is polishing of the second seasoning of the third rending of the fourth moulding it is of no use to season the agate it is vain to try to polish the slate but both are fitted by the qualities they possess for services in which they may be honored  now the cry for the education of the lower classes which is heard every day more widely and loudly is a wise and a sacred cry provided it be extended into one for the education of all classes with definite respect to the work each man has to do and the substance of which he is made but it is a foolish and vain cry if it be understood as in the plurality of cases it is meant to be for the expression of mere craving after knowledge irrespective of the simple purposes of the life that now is and blessings of that which is to come  one great fallacy into which men are apt to fall when they are reasoning on this subject is that light as such is always good and darkness as such always evil far from it light untempered would be annihilation it is good to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death but to those that faint in the wilderness so also is the shadow of the great rock in a weary land if the sunshine is good so also the cloud of the latter rain light is only beautiful only available for life when it is tempered with shadow pure light is fearful and unendurable by humanity and it is not less ridiculous to say that the light as such is good in itself than to say that the darkness is good in itself both are rendered safe healthy and useful by the other the night by the day the day by the night and we could just as easily live without the dawn as without the sunset so long as we are human of the celestial city we are told there shall be no night there and then we shall know even as also we are known but the night and the mystery have both their service here and our business is not to strive to turn the night into day but to be sure that we are as they that watch for the morning  therefore in the education either of lower or upper classes it matters not the least how much or how little they know provided they know just what will fit them to do their work and to be happy in it what the sum or the nature of their knowledge ought to be at a given time or in a given case is a totally different question the main thing to be understood is that a man is not educated in any sense whatsoever because he can read latin or write english or can behave well in a drawingroom but that he is only educated if he is happy busy beneficent and effective in the world that millions of peasants are therefore at this moment better educated than most of those who call themselves gentlemen and that the means taken to educate the lower classes in any other sense may very often be productive of a precisely opposite result  observe i do not say nor do i believe that the lower classes ought not to be better educated in millions of ways than they are i believe every man in a christian kingdom ought to be equally well educated but i would have it education to purpose stern practical irresistible in moral habits in bodily strength and beauty in all faculties of mind capable of being developed under the circumstances of the individual and especially in the technical knowledge of his own business but yet infinitely various in its effort directed to make one youth humble and another confident to tranquillize this mind to put some spark of ambition into that now to urge and now to restrain and in the doing of all this considering knowledge as one only out of myriads of means in its hands or myriads of gifts at its disposal and giving it or withholding it as a good husbandman waters his garden giving the full shower only to the thirsty plants and at times when they are thirsty whereas at present we pour it upon the heads of our youth as the snow falls on the alps on one and another alike till they can bear no more and then take honor to ourselves because here and there a river descends from their crests into the valleys not observing that we have made the loaded hills themselves barren for ever  finally i hold it for indisputable that the first duty of a state is to see that every child born therein shall be well housed clothed fed and educated till it attain years of discretion but in order to the effecting this the government must have an authority over the people of which we now do not so much as dream and i cannot in this place pursue the subject farther   8 early venetian marriages  galliciolli lib ii § 1757 insinuates a doubt of the general custom saying it would be more reasonable to suppose that only twelve maidens were married in public on st marks day and sandi also speaks of twelve only all evidence however is clearly in favor of the popular tradition the most curious fact connected with the subject being the mention by herodotus of the mode of marriage practised among the illyrian veneti of his time who presented their maidens for marriage on one day in each year and with the price paid for those who were beautiful gave dowries to those who had no personal attractions  it is very curious to find the traces of this custom existing though in a softened form in christian times still i admit that there is little confidence to be placed in the mere concurrence of the venetian chroniclers who for the most part copied from each other but the best and most complete account i have read is that quoted by galliciolli from the matricola de casseleri written in 1449 and in that account the words are quite unmistakable it was anciently the custom of venice that all the brides novizze of venice when they married should be married by the bishop in the church of s pietro di castello on st marks day which is the 31st of january rogers quotes navagiero to the same effect and sansovino is more explicit still it was the custom to contract marriages openly and when the deliberations were completed the damsels assembled themselves in st pietro di castello for the feast of st mark in february   9 character of the venetian aristocracy  the following noble answer of a venetian ambassador giustiniani on the occasion of an insult offered him at the court of henry the eighth is as illustrative of the dignity which there yet remained in the character and thoughts of the venetian noble as descriptive in few words of the early faith and deeds of his nation he writes thus to the doge from london on the 15th of april 1516  by my last in date of the 30th ult i informed you that the countenances of some of these lords evinced neither friendship nor goodwill and that much language had been used to me of a nature bordering not merely on arrogance but even on outrage and not having specified this in the foregoing letters i think fit now to mention it in detail finding myself at the court and talking familiarly about other matters two lay lords great personages in this kingdom inquired of me whence it came that your excellency was of such slippery faith now favoring one party and then the other although these words ought to have irritated me i answered them with all discretion that you did keep and ever had kept your faith the maintenance of which has placed you in great trouble and subjected you to wars of longer duration than you would otherwise have experienced descending to particulars in justification of your sublimity whereupon one of them replied isti veneti sunt piscatores64 marvellous was the command i then had over myself in not giving vent to expressions which might have proved injurious to your signory and with extreme moderation i rejoined that had he been at venice and seen our senate and the venetian nobility he perhaps would not speak thus and moreover were he well read in our history both concerning the origin of our city and the grandeur of your excellencys feats neither the one nor the other would seem to him those of fishermen yet said i did fishermen found the christian faith and we have been those fishermen who defended it against the forces of the infidel our fishingboats being galleys and ships our hooks the treasure of st mark and our bait the lifeblood of our citizens who died for the christian faith  i take this most interesting passage from a volume of despatches addressed from london to the signory of venice by the ambassador giustiniani during the years 15161519 despatches not only full of matters of historical interest but of the most delightful everyday description of all that went on at the english court they were translated by mr brown from the original letters and will i believe soon be published and i hope also read and enjoyed for i cannot close these volumes without expressing a conviction which has long been forcing itself upon my mind that restored history is of little more value than restored painting or architecture that the only history worth reading is that written at the time of which it treats the history of what was done and seen heard out of the mouths of the men who did and saw one fresh draught of such history is worth more than a thousand volumes of abstracts and reasonings and suppositions and theories and i believe that as we get wiser we shall take little trouble about the history of nations who have left no distinct records of themselves but spend our time only in the examination of the faithful documents which in any period of the world have been left either in the form of art or literature portraying the scenes or recording the events which in those days were actually passing before the eyes of men   10 final appendix  the statements respecting the dates of venetian buildings made throughout the preceding pages are founded as above stated on careful and personal examination of all the mouldings or other features available as evidence of every palace of importance in the city three parts at least of the time occupied in the completion of the work have been necessarily devoted to the collection of these evidences of which it would be quite useless to lay the mass before the reader but of which the leading points must be succinctly stated in order to show the nature of my authority for any of the conclusions expressed in the text  i have therefore collected in the plates which illustrate this article of the appendix for the examination of any reader who may be interested by them as many examples of the evidencebearing details as are sufficient for the proof required especially including all the exceptional forms so that the reader may rest assured that if i had been able to lay before him all the evidence in my possession it would have been still more conclusive than the portion now submitted to him  illustration plate v                byzantine bases  we must examine in succession the bases doorways and jambs capitals archivolts cornices and tracery bars of venetian architecture     i bases  the principal points we have to notice are the similarity and simplicity of the byzantine bases in general and the distinction between those of torcello and murano and of st marks as tending to prove the early dates attributed in the text to the island churches i have sufficiently illustrated the forms of the gothic bases in plates x xi and xiii of the first volume so that i here note chiefly the byzantine or romanesque ones adding two gothic forms for the sake of comparison  the most characteristic examples then are collected in plate v opposite namely              1 2 3 4 in the upper gallery of apse of murano             5 lower shafts of apse murano             6 casa falier             7 small shafts of panels casa farsetti             8 great shafts and plinth casa farsetti             9 great lower shafts fondaco de turchi            10 ducal palace upper arcade  plate v  11 general late gothic form  vol iii 12 tomb of dogaressa vital michele in st marks atrium            13 upper arcade of madonnetta house            14 riofoscari house            15 upper arcade terraced house            16 17 18 nave torcello            19 20 transepts st marks            21 nave st marks            22 external pillars of northern portico st marks            23 24 clustered pillars of northern portico st marks            25 26 clustered pillars of southern portico st marks  now observe first the enormous difference in style between the bases 1 to 5 and the rest in the upper row that is to say between the bases of murano and the twelfth and thirteenth century bases of venice and secondly the difference between the bases 16 to 20 and the rest in the lower row that is to say between the bases of torcello with those of st marks which belong to the nave and which may therefore be supposed to be part of the earlier church and the later ones of the st marks façade  secondly note the fellowship between 5 and 6 one of the evidences of the early date of the casa falier  thirdly observe the slurring of the upper roll into the cavetto in 13 14 and 15 and the consequent relationship established between three most important buildings the riofoscari house terraced house and madonnetta house  fourthly byzantine bases if they have an incision between the upper roll and cavetto are very apt to approach the form of fig 23 in which the upper roll is cut out of the flat block and the ledge beneath it is sloping compare nos 7 8 9 21 22 23 24 25 26 on the other hand the later gothic base 11 has always its upper roll well developed and generally the fillet between it and the cavetto vertical the sloping fillet is indeed found down to late periods and the vertical fillet as in no 12 in byzantine ones but still when a base has such a sloping fillet and peculiarly graceful sweeping cavetto as those of no 10 looking as if they would run into one line with each other it is strong presumptive evidence of its belonging to an early rather than a late period  the base 12 is the boldest example i could find of the exceptional form in early times but observe in this that the upper roll is larger than the lower this is never the case in late gothic where the proportion is always as in fig 11 observe that in nos 8 and 9 the upper rolls are at least as large as the lower an important evidence of the dates of the casa farsetti and fondaco de turchi  lastly note the peculiarly steep profile of no 22 with reference to what is said of this base in vol ii appendix 9     ii doorways and jambs  the entrances to st marks consist as above mentioned of great circular or ogee porches underneath which the real open entrances in which the valves of the bronze doors play are square headed  illustration fig i  the mouldings of the jambs of these doors are highly curious and the most characteristic are therefore represented in one view the outsides of the jambs are lowest    a northern lateral door   b first northern door of the façade   c second door of the façade   d fourth door of the façade   e central door of the façade  i wish the reader especially to note the arbitrary character of the curves and incisions all evidently being drawn by hand none being segments of circles none like another none influenced by any visible law i do not give these mouldings as beautiful they are for the most part very poor in effect but they are singularly characteristic of the free work of the time  the kind of door to which these mouldings belong is shown with the other groups of doors in plate xiv vol ii fig 6 a then 6 b 6 c 6 d represent the groups of doors in which the byzantine influence remained energetic admitting slowly the forms of the pointed gothic 7 a with the gable above is the intermediate group between the byzantine and gothic schools 7 b 7 c 7 d 7 e are the advanced guards of the gothic and lombardic invasions representative of a large number of thirteenth century arcades and doors observe that 6 d is shown to be of a late school by its finial and 6 e of the latest school by its finial complete ogee arch instead of round or pointed and abandonment of the lintel  these examples with the exception of 6 a which is a general form are all actually existing doors namely    6 b in the fondamenta venier near st maria della salute   6 c in the calle delle botteri between the rialto and san cassan   6 d main door of san gregorio   6 e door of a palace in rio san paternian   7 a door of a small courtyard near house of marco polo   7 b arcade in narrow canal at the side of casa barbaro   7 c at the turn of the canal close to the ponte dell angelo   7 d in rio san paternian a ruinous house   7 e at the turn of the canal on which the sotto portico della stua            opens near san zaccaria  if the reader will take a magnifying glass to the figure 6 d he will see that its square ornaments of which in the real door each contains a rose diminish to the apex of the arch a very interesting and characteristic circumstance showing the subtle feeling of the gothic builders they must needs diminish the ornamentation in order to sympathize with the delicacy of the point of the arch the magnifying glass will also show the bondumieri shield in no 7 d and the leze shield in no 7 e both introduced on the keystones in the grand early manner the mouldings of these various doors will be noticed under the head archivolt  illustration plate vi                byzantine jambs  now throughout the city we find a number of doors resembling the square doors of st mark and occurring with rare exceptions either in buildings of the byzantine period or imbedded in restored houses never in a single instance forming a connected portion of any late building and they therefore furnish a most important piece of evidence wherever they are part of the original structure of a gothic building that such building is one of the advanced guards of the gothic school and belongs to its earliest period  on plate vi opposite are assembled all the important examples i could find in venice of these mouldings the reader will see at a glance their peculiar character and unmistakable likeness to each other the following are the references              1 door in calle mocenigo             2 angle of tomb of dogaressa vital michele             3 door in sotto portico st apollonia near ponte di                   canonica             4 door in calle della verona another like it is close by             5 angle of tomb of doge marino morosini             6 7 door in calle mocenigo             8 door in campo s margherita  plate vi  9 door at traghetto san

reggio            17 18 doors in sotto portico dei squellini  the principal points to be noted in these mouldings are their curious differences of level as marked by the dotted lines more especially in 14 15 16 and the systematic projection of the outer or lower mouldings in 16 17 18 then as points of evidence observe that 1 is the jamb and 6 the archivolt 7 the angle on a larger scale of the brick door given in my folio work from ramo di rimpetto mocenigo one of the evidences of the early date of that door 8 is the jamb of the door in campo santa margherita also given in my folio work fixing the early date of that also 10 is from a gothic door opening off the ponte st toma and 11 is also from a gothic building all the rest are from byzantine work or from ruins the angle of the tomb of marino morosini 5 is given for comparison only  the doors with the mouldings 17 18 are from the two ends of a small dark passage called the sotto portico dei squellini opening near ponte cappello on the riomarin 14 is the outside one arranged as usual and at a in the rough stone are places for the staples of the door valve 15 at the other end of the passage opening into the little corte dei squellini is set with the part a outwards it also having places for hinges but it is curious that the rich moulding should be set in towards the dark passage though natural that the doors should both open one way  illustration plate vii                gothic jambs  the next plate vii will show the principal characters of the gothic jambs and the total difference between them and the byzantine ones two more byzantine forms 1 and 2 are given here for the sake of comparison then 3 4 and 5 are the common profiles of simple jambs of doors in the gothic period 6 is one of the jambs of the frari windows continuous into the archivolt and meeting the traceries where the line is set upon it at the extremity of its main slope 7 and 8 are jambs of the ducal palace windows in which the great semicircle is the half shaft which sustains the traceries and the rest of the profile is continuous in the archivolt 17 18 and 19 are the principal piers of the ducal palace and 20 from st fermo of verona is put with them in order to show the step of transition from the byzantine form 2 to the gothic chamfer which is hardly represented at venice the other profiles on the plate are all late gothic given to show the gradual increase of complexity without any gain of power the open lines in 12 14 16 etc are the parts of the profile cut into flowers or cable mouldings and so much incised as to show the constant outline of the cavetto or curve beneath them the following are the references               1 door in house of marco polo              2 old door in a restored church of st cassan

the piazetta                   façade of the ducal palace     iii capitals  i shall here notice the various facts i have omitted in the text of the work  first with respect to the byzantine capitals represented in plate vii vol ii i omitted to notice that figs 6 and 7 represent two sides of the same capital at murano though one is necessarily drawn on a smaller scale than the other fig 7 is the side turned to the light and fig 6 to the shade the inner part which is quite concealed not being touched at all  we have here a conclusive proof that these capitals were cut for their place in the apse therefore i have always considered them as tests of venetian workmanship and on the strength of that proof have occasionally spoken of capitals as of true venetian work which m lazari supposes to be of the lower empire no 11 from st marks was not above noticed the way in which the cross is gradually left in deeper relief as the sides slope inwards and away from it is highly picturesque and curious  no 9 has been reduced from a larger drawing and some of the life and character of the curves lost in consequence it is chiefly given to show the irregular and fearless freedom of the byzantine designers no two parts of the foliage being correspondent in the original it is of white marble the ground being colored blue  plate x vol ii represents the four principal orders of venetian capitals in their greatest simplicity and the profiles of the most interesting examples of each the figures 1 and 4 are the two great concave and convex groups and 2 and 3 the transitional above each type of form i have put also an example of the group of flowers which represent it in nature fig 1 has a lily fig 2 a variety of the tulipa sylvestris figs 3 and 4 forms of the magnolia i prepared this plate in the early spring when i could not get any other examples65 or i would rather have had two different species for figs 3 and 4 but the halfopen magnolia will answer the purpose showing the beauty of the triple curvature in the sides  i do not say that the forms of the capitals are actually taken from flowers though assuredly so in some instances and partially so in the decoration of nearly all but they were designed by men of pure and natural feeling for beauty who therefore instinctively adopted the forms represented which are afterwards proved to be beautiful by their frequent occurrence in common flowers  the convex forms 3 and 4 are put lowest in the plate only because they are heaviest they are the earliest in date and have already been enough examined  i have added a plate to this volume plate xii which should have appeared in illustration of the fifth chapter of vol ii but was not finished in time it represents the central capital and two of the lateral ones of the fondaco de turchi the central one drawn very large in order to show the excessive simplicity of its chiselling together with the care and sharpness of it each leaf being expressed by a series of sharp furrows and ridges some slight errors in the large tracings from which the engraving was made have however occasioned a loss of spring in the curves and the little fig 4 of plate x vol ii gives a truer idea of the distant effect of the capital  the profiles given in plate x vol ii are the following         1 a main capitals upper arcade madonnetta house           b main capitals upper arcade

times have already been illustrated in plate viii vol ii we have yet to trace their succession in the gothic times this is done in plate ii of this volume which we will now examine carefully the following are the capitals represented in that plate             1 small shafts of st marks pulpit            2 from the transitional house in the calle di rimedio conf                 vol ii

central column is a group of exceptional character running parallel with both we will take the lateral ones first 1 capital of pulpit of st marks representative of the simplest concave forms of the byzantine period look back to plate viii vol ii and observe that while all the forms in that plate are contemporaneous we are now going to follow a series consecutive in time which begins from fig 1 either in that plate or in this that is to say with the simplest possible condition to be found at the time and which proceeds to develope itself into gradually increasing richness while the already rich capitals of the old school die at its side in the forms 14 and 15 plate viii the byzantine school expired but from the byzantine simple capital 1 plate ii above which was coexistent with them sprang another hardy race of capitals whose succession we have now to trace  the form 1 plate ii is evidently the simplest conceivable condition of the truncated capital long ago represented generally in vol i being only rounded a little on its side to fit it to the shaft the next step was to place a leaf beneath each of the truncations fig 4 plate ii san giacomo de lorio the end of the leaf curling over at the top in a somewhat formal spiral partly connected with the traditional volute of the corinthian capital the sides are then enriched by the addition of some ornament as a shield fig 7 or rose fig 10 and we have the formed capital of the early gothic fig 10 being from the palace of marco querini is certainly not later than the middle of the thirteenth century see vol ii and fig 7 is i believe of the same date it is one of the bearing capitals of the lower story of the palace at the apostoli and is remarkably fine in the treatment of its angle leaves which are not deeply undercut but show their magnificent sweeping under surface all the way down not as a leaf surface but treated like the gorget of a helmet with a curved line across it like that where the gorget meets the mail i never saw anything finer in simple design fig 10 is given chiefly as a certification of date and to show the treatment of the capitals of this school on a small scale observe the more expansive head in proportion to the diameter of the shaft the leaves being drawn from the angles as if gathered in the hand till their edges meet and compare the rule given in vol i chap ix § xiv the capitals of the remarkable house of which a portion is represented in fig xxxi vol ii are most curious and pure examples of this condition with experimental trefoils roses and leaves introduced between their volutes when compared with those of the querini palace they form one of the most important evidences of the date of the building  fig 13 one of the bearing capitals already drawn on a small scale in the windows represented in plate xvi vol ii  now observe the capital of the form of fig 10 appeared sufficient to the venetians for all ordinary purposes and they used it in common windows to the latest gothic periods but yet with certain differences which at once show the lateness of the work in the first place the rose which at first was flat and quatrefoiled becomes after some experiments a round ball dividing into three leaves closely resembling our english ball flower and probably derived from it and in other cases forming a bold projecting bud in various degrees of contraction or expansion in the second place the extremities of the angle leaves are wrought into rich flowing lobes and bent back so as to lap against their own breasts showing lateness of date in exact proportion to the looseness of curvature fig 3 represents the general aspect of these later capitals which may be conveniently called the rose capitals of venice two are seen on service in plate viii vol i showing comparatively early date by the experimental form of the sixfoiled rose but for elaborate edifices this form was not sufficiently rich and there was felt to be something awkward in the junction of the leaves at the bottom therefore four other shorter leaves were added at the sides as in fig 13 plate ii and as generally represented in plate x vol ii fig 1 this was a good and noble step taken very early in the thirteenth century and all the best venetian capitals were thenceforth of this form those which followed and rested in the common rose type were languid and unfortunate i do not know a single good example of them after the first half of the thirteenth century  but the form reached in fig 13 was quickly felt to be of great value and power one would have thought it might have been taken straight from the corinthian type but it is clearly the work of men who were making experiments for themselves for instance in the central capital of fig xxxi vol ii there is a trial condition of it with the intermediate leaf set behind those at the angles the reader had better take a magnifying glass to this woodcut it will show the character of the capitals better two other experimental forms occur in the casa cicogna vol ii and supply one of the evidences which fix the date of that palace but the form soon was determined as in fig 13 and then means were sought of recommending it by farther decoration  the leaves which are used in fig 13 it will be observed have lost the corinthian volute and are now pure and plain leaves such as were used in the lombardic gothic of the early thirteenth century all over italy now in a roundarched gateway at verona certainly not later than 1300 the pointed leaves of this pure form are used in one portion of the mouldings and in another are enriched by having their surfaces carved each into a beautiful ribbed and pointed leaf the capital fig 6 plate ii is nothing more than fig 13 so enriched and the two conditions are quite contemporary fig 13 being from a beautiful series of fourth order windows in campo sta ma mater domini already drawn in my folio work  fig 13 is representative of the richest conditions of gothic capital which existed at the close of the thirteenth century the builder of the ducal palace amplified them into the form of fig 9 but varying the leafage in disposition and division of lobes in every capital and the workmen trained under him executed many noble capitals for the gothic palaces of the early fourteenth century of which fig 12 from a palace in the campo st polo is one of the most beautiful examples in figs 9 and 12 the reader sees the venetian gothic capital in its noblest developement the next step was to such forms as fig 15 which is generally characteristic of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth century gothic and of which i hope the reader will at once perceive the exaggeration and corruption  this capital is from a palace near the miracoli and it is remarkable for the delicate though corrupt ornament on its abacus which is precisely the same as that on the pillars of the screen of st marks that screen is a monument of very great value for it shows the entire corruption of the gothic power and the style of the later palaces accurately and completely defined in all its parts and is dated 1380 thus at once furnishing us with a limiting date which throws all the noble work of the early ducal palace and all that is like it in venice thoroughly back into the middle of the fourteenth century at the latest  fig 2 is the simplest condition of the capital universally employed in the windows of the second order noticed above vol ii as belonging to a style of great importance in the transitional architecture of venice observe that in all the capitals given in the lateral columns in plate ii the points of the leaves turn over but in this central group they lie flat against the angle of the capital and form a peculiarly light and lovely succession of forms occurring only in their purity in the windows of the second order and in some important monuments connected with them  in fig 2 the leaf at the angle is cut exactly in the manner of an egyptian basrelief into the stone with a raised edge round it and a raised rib up the centre and this mode of execution seen also in figs 4 and 7 is one of the collateral evidences of early date but in figs 5 and 8 where more elaborate effect was required the leaf is thrown out boldly with an even edge from the surface of the capital and enriched on its own surface and as the treatment of fig 2 corresponds with that of fig 4 so that of fig 5 corresponds with that of fig 6 2 and 5 having the upright leaf 4 and 6 the bending leaves but all contemporary  fig 5 is the central capital of the windows of casa falier drawn in plate xv vol ii and one of the leaves set on its angles is drawn larger at fig 7 plate xx vol ii it has no rib but a sharp raised ridge down its centre and its lobes of which the reader will observe the curious formround in the middle one truncated in the sidesare wrought with a precision and care which i have hardly ever seen equalled but of this more presently  the next figure 8 plate ii is the most important capital of the whole transitional period that employed on the two columns of the piazzetta these pillars are said to have been raised in the close of the twelfth century but i cannot find even the most meagre account of their bases capitals or which seems to me most wonderful of that noble winged lion one of the grandest things produced by mediæval art which all men admire and none can draw i have never yet seen a faithful representation of his firm fierce and fiery strength i believe that both he and the capital which bears him are late thirteenth century work i have not been up to the lion and cannot answer for it but if it be not thirteenth century work it is as good and respecting the capitals there can be small question they are of exactly the date of the oldest tombs bearing crosses outside of st john and paul and are associated with all the other work of the transitional period from 1250 to 1300 the bases of these pillars representing the trades of venice ought by the by to have been mentioned as among the best early efforts of venetian grotesque and besides their abaci are formed by four reduplications of the dentilled mouldings of st marks which never occur after the year 1300  nothing can be more beautiful or original than the adaptation of these broad bearing abaci but as they have nothing to do with the capital itself and could not easily be brought into the space they are omitted in plate ii where fig 8 shows the bell of the capital only its profile is curiously subtleapparently concave everywhere but in reality concave all the way down only on the angles and slightly convex at the sides the profile through the side being 2 k plate x vol ii in this subtlety of curvature as well as in the simple cross showing the influence of early times  the leaf on the angle of which more presently is fig 5 plate xx vol ii  connected with this school of transitional capitals we find a form in the later gothic such as fig 14 from the church of san stefano but which appears in part derived from an old and rich byzantine type of which fig 11 from the fondaco de turchi is a characteristic example  i must now take the reader one step farther and ask him to examine finally the treatment of the leaves down to the cutting of their most minute lobes in the series of capitals of which we have hitherto only sketched the general forms  in all capitals with nodding leaves such as 6 and 9 in plate ii the real form of the leaf is not to be seen except in perspective but in order to render the comparison more easy i have in plate xx vol ii opened all the leaves out as if they were to be dried in a herbarium only leaving the furrows and sinuosities of surface but laying the outside contour nearly flat upon the page except for a particular reason in figs 2 10 11 and 15  i shall first as usual give the references and then note the points of interest

the right hand at the top of plate xii in this volume the lobes worked in the same manner with deep black drill holes between their points  fig 3 one of the leaves of fig 14 plate viii vol ii fully unfolded the lobes worked in the same manner but left shallow so as not to destroy the breadth of light the central line being drawn by drill holes and the interstices between lobes cut black and deep  fig 4 leaf with flower pure byzantine work showing whence the treatment of all the other leaves has been derived  fig 6 for the sake of symmetry this is put in the centre it is the earliest of the three in this row taken from the madonnetta house where the capitals have leaves both at their sides and angles the tall angle leaf with its two lateral ones is given in the plate and there is a remarkable distinction in the mode of workmanship of these leaves which though found in a palace of the byzantine period is indicative of a tendency to transition namely that the sharp furrow is now drawn only to the central lobe of each division of the leaf and the rest of the surface of the leaf is left nearly flat a slight concavity only marking the division of the extremities at the base of these leaves they are perfectly flat only cut by the sharp and narrow furrow as an elevated tableland is by ravines  fig 5 a more advanced condition the fold at the recess between each division of the leaf carefully expressed and the concave or depressed portions of the extremities marked more deeply as well as the central furrow and a rib added in the centre  fig 7 a contemporary but more finished form the sharp furrows becoming softer and the whole leaf more flexible  fig 8 an exquisite form of the same period but showing still more advanced naturalism from a very early group of third order windows near the church of st eustachio on the grand canal  fig 9 of the same time from a small capital of an angle shaft of the sarcophagi at the side of st john and paul in the little square which is adorned by the colleone statue this leaf is very quaint and pretty in giving its midmost lateral divisions only two lobes each instead of the usual three or four  fig 10 leaf employed in the cornice of the tomb of the doge giovanni soranzo who died in 1312 it nods over and has three ribs on its upper surface thus giving us the completed ideal form of the leaf but its execution is still very archaic and severe  now the next example fig 11 is from the tomb of the doge andrea dandolo and therefore executed between 1354 and 1360 and this leaf shows the gothic naturalism and refinement of curvature fully developed in this forty years interval then the principal advance of gothic sculpture is to be placed  i had prepared a complete series of examples showing this advance and the various ways in which the separations of the ribs a most characteristic feature are more and more delicately and scientifically treated from the beginning to the middle of the fourteenth century but i feared that no general reader would care to follow me into these minutiæ and have cancelled this portion of the work at least for the present the main point being that the reader should feel the full extent of the change which he can hardly fail to do in looking from fig 10 to figs 11 and 12 i believe that fig 12 is the earlier of the two and it is assuredly the finer having all the elasticity and simplicity of the earliest forms with perfect flexibility added in fig 11 there is a perilous element beginning to develope itself into one feature namely the extremities of the leaves which instead of merely nodding over now curl completely round into a kind of ball this occurs early and in the finest gothic work especially in cornices and other running mouldings but it is a fatal symptom a beginning of the intemperance of the later gothic and it was followed out with singular avidity the ball of coiled leafage increasing in size and complexity and at last becoming the principal feature of the work the light striking on its vigorous projection as in fig 14 nearly all the renaissance gothic of venice depends upon these balls for effect a late capital being generally composed merely of an upper and lower range of leaves terminating in this manner  it is very singular and notable how in this loss of temperance there is loss of life for truly healthy and living leaves do not bind themselves into knots at the extremities they bend and wave and nod but never curl it is in disease or in death by blight or frost or poison only that leaves in general assume this ingathered form it is the flame of autumn that has shrivelled them or the web of the caterpillar that has bound them and thus the last forms of the venetian leafage set forth the fate of venetian pride and in their utmost luxuriance and abandonment perish as if eaten of worms  and now by glancing back to plate x vol ii the reader will see in a moment the kind of evidence which is found of the date of capitals in their profiles merely observe we have seen that the treatment of the leaves in the madonnetta house seemed indicative of a tendency to transition note their profile 1a and its close correspondence with 1 h which is actually of a transitional capital from the upper arcade of second order windows in the apostoli palace yet both shown to be very close to the byzantine period if not belonging to it by their fellowship with the profile i from the fondaco de turchi then note the close correspondence of all the other profiles in that line which belong to the concave capitals or plinths of the byzantine palaces and note their composition the abacus being in idea merely an echo or reduplication of the capital itself as seen in perfect simplicity in the profile f which is a roll under a tall concave curve forming the bell of the capital with a roll and short concave curve for its abacus this peculiar abacus is an unfailing test of early date and our finding this simple profile used for the ducal palace f is strongly confirmatory of all our former conclusions  then the next row 2 are the byzantine and early gothic semiconvex curves in their pure forms having no roll below but often with a roll added as at f and in certain early gothic conditions curiously fused into it with a cavetto between as b c d but the more archaic form is as at f and k and as these two profiles are from the ducal palace and piazzetta shafts they join again with the rest of the evidence of their early date the profiles i and k are both most beautiful i is that of the great capitals of the ducal palace and the small profiles between it and k are the varieties used on the fillet at its base the profile i should have had leaves springing from it as 1 h has only more boldly but there was no room for them  the reader cannot fail to discern at a glance the fellowship of the whole series of profiles 2 a to k nor can he but with equal ease observe a marked difference in 4 d and 4 e from any others in the plate the bulging outlines of leafage being indicative of the luxuriant and flowing masses no longer expressible with a simple line but to be considered only as confined within it of the later gothic now d is a dated profile from the tomb of st isidore 1355 which by its dogtooth abacus and heavy leafage distinguishes itself from all the other profiles and therefore throws them back into the first half of the century but observe it still retains the noble swelling root this character soon after vanishes and in 1380 the profile e at once heavy feeble and ungraceful with a meagre and valueless abacus hardly discernible is characteristic of all the capitals of venice  note finally this contraction of the abacus compare 4 c which is the earliest form in the plate from murano with 4 e which is the latest the other profiles show the gradual process of change only observe in 3a the abacus is not drawn it is so bold that it would not come into the plate without reducing the bell curve to too small a scale  so much for the evidence derivable from the capitals we have next to examine that of the archivolts or arch mouldings  illustration plate viii                byzantine archivolts     iv archivolts  in plate viii opposite are arranged in one view all the conditions of byzantine archivolt employed in venice on a large scale it will be seen in an instant that there can be no mistaking the manner of their masonry the soffit of the arch is the horizontal line at the bottom of all these profiles and each of them except 13 14 is composed of two slabs of marble one for the soffit another for the face of the arch the one on the soffit is worked on the edge into a roll fig 10 or dentil fig 9 and the one on the face is bordered on the other side by another piece let edgeways into the wall and also worked into a roll or dentil in the richer archivolts a cornice is added to this roll as in figs 1 and 4 or takes its place as in figs 1 3 5 and 6 and in such richer examples the facestone and often the soffit are sculptured the sculpture being cut into their surfaces as indicated in fig 11 the concavities cut in the facestones of 1 2 4 5 6 are all indicative of sculpture in effect like that of fig xxvi vol ii of which archivolt fig 5 here is the actual profile the following are the references to the whole               1 riofoscari house              2

  13 and 14 transitional forms  illustration plate ix                gothic archivolts  there is little to be noted respecting these forms except that in fig 1 the two lower rolls with the angular projections between represent the fall of the mouldings of two proximate arches on the abacus of the bearing shaft their two cornices meeting each other and being gradually narrowed into the little angular intermediate piece their sculptures being slurred into the contracted space a curious proof of the earliness of the work the real archivolt moulding is the same as fig 4 c c including only the midmost of the three rolls in fig 1  it will be noticed that 2 5 6 and 8 are sculptured on the soffits as well as the faces 9 is the common profile of arches decorated only with colored marble the facestone being colored the soffit white the effect of such a moulding is seen in the small windows at the right hand of fig xxvi vol ii  the reader will now see that there is but little difficulty in identifying byzantine work the archivolt mouldings being so similar among themselves and so unlike any others we have next to examine the gothic forms  figs 13 and 14 in plate viii represent the first brick mouldings of the transitional period occurring in such instances as fig xxiii or fig xxxiii vol ii the soffit stone of the byzantine mouldings being taken away and this profile translated into solid stone forms the almost universal moulding of the windows of the second order these two brick mouldings are repeated for the sake of comparison at the top of plate ix opposite and the upper range of mouldings which they commence in that plate are the brick mouldings of venice in the early gothic period all the forms below are in stone and the moulding 2 translated into stone forms the universal archivolt of the early pointed arches of venice and windows of second and third orders the moulding 1 is much rarer and used for the most part in doors only  the reader will see at once the resemblance of character in the various flat brick mouldings 3 to 11 they belong to such arches as 1 and 2 in plate xvii vol ii or 6 b 6 c in plate xiv vol ii 7 and 8 being actually the mouldings of those two doors the whole group being perfectly defined and separate from all the other gothic work in venice and clearly the result of an effort to imitate in brickwork the effect of the flat sculptured archivolts of the byzantine times see vol ii chap vii § xxxvii  then comes the group 14 to 18 in stone derived from the mouldings 1 and 2 first by truncation 14 then by beading the truncated angle 15 16 the occurrence of the profile 16 in the three beautiful windows represented in the uppermost figure of plate xviii vol i renders that group of peculiar interest and is strong evidence of its antiquity then a cavetto is added 17 first shallow and then deeper 18 which is the common archivolt moulding of the central gothic door and window but in the windows of the early fourth order this moulding is complicated by various additions of dogtooth mouldings under the dentil as in 20 or the gabled dentil see fig 20 plate ix vol i as fig 21 or both as figs 23 24 all these varieties expire in the advanced period and the established moulding for windows is 29 the intermediate group 25 to 28 i found only in the high windows of the third order in the ducal palace or in the chapterhouse of the frari or in the arcades of the ducal palace the great outside lower arcade of the ducal palace has the profile 31 the lefthand side being the innermost  now observe all these archivolts without exception assume that the spectator looks from the outside only none are complete on both sides they are essentially window mouldings and have no resemblance to those of our perfect gothic arches prepared for traceries if they were all completely drawn in the plate they should be as fig 25 having a great depth of wall behind the mouldings but it was useless to represent this in every case the ducal palace begins to show mouldings on both sides 28 31 and 35 is a complete arch moulding from the apse of the frari that moulding though so perfectly developed is earlier than the ducal palace and with other features of the building indicates the completeness of the gothic system which made the architect of the ducal palace found his work principally upon that church  the other examples in this plate show the various modes of combination employed in richer archivolts the triple change of slope in 38 is very curious the references are as follows              1 transitional to

unmistakable resemblances the row 41 to 50 are contemporary abaci of capitals 52 53 54 56 are examples of late gothic abaci and observe especially these are all rounded at the top of the cavetto but

gothic time especially for dripstones of gables 11 and such others form little plinths or abaci at the spring of arches such as those shown at a fig xxiii vol ii finally a large number of superb byzantine cornices occur of the form shown at the top of the arch in plate v vol ii having a profile like 16 or 19 here with nodding leaves of acanthus thrown out from it being in fact merely one range of the leaves of a byzantine capital unwrapped and formed into a continuous line i had prepared a large mass of materials for the illustration of these cornices and the gothic ones connected with them but found the subject would take up another volume and was forced for the present to abandon it the lower series of profiles 7 to 12 in plate xv vol i shows how the leafornament is laid on the simple early cornices     vi traceries  we have only one subject more to examine the character of the early and late tracery bars  the reader may perhaps have been surprised at the small attention given to traceries in the course of the preceding volumes but the reason is that there are no complicated traceries at venice belonging to the good gothic time with the single exception of those of the casa cicogna and the magnificent arcades of the ducal palace gothic are so simple as to require little explanation  there are however two curious circumstances in the later traceries the first that they are universally considered by the builder as the old byzantines considered sculptured surfaces of stone as material out of which a certain portion is to be cut to fill his window a fine northern gothic tracery is a complete and systematic arrangement of arches and foliation adjusted to the form of the window but a venetian tracery is a piece of a larger composition cut to the shape of the window in the porta della carta in the church of the madonna dellorto in the casa bernardo on the grand canal in the old church of the misericordia and wherever else there are rich traceries in venice it will always be found that a certain arrangement of quatrefoils and other figures has been planned as if it were to extend indefinitely into miles of arcade and out of this colossal piece of marble lace a piece in the shape of a window is cut mercilessly and fearlessly whatever fragments and odd shapes of interstice remnants of this or that figure of the divided foliation may occur at the edge of the window it matters not all are cut across and shut in by the great outer archivolt  it is very curious to find the venetians treating what in other countries became of so great individual importance merely as a kind of diaper ground like that of their chequered colors on the walls there is great grandeur in the idea though the system of their traceries was spoilt by it but they always treated their buildings as masses of color rather than of line and the great traceries of the ducal palace itself are not spared any more than those of the minor palaces they are cut off at the flanks in the middle of the quatrefoils and the terminal mouldings take up part of the breadth of the poor half of a quatrefoil at the extremity  one other circumstance is notable also in good northern gothic the tracery bars are of a constant profile the same on both sides and if the plan of the tracery leaves any interstices so small that there is not room for the full profile of the tracery bar all round them those interstices are entirely closed the tracery bars being supposed to have met each other but in venice if an interstice becomes anywhere inconveniently small the tracery bar is sacrificed cut away or in some way altered in profile in order to afford more room for the light especially in the early traceries so that one side of a tracery bar is often quite different from the other for instance in the bars 1 and 2 plate xi from the frari and st john and paul the uppermost side is towards a great opening and there was room for the bevel or slope to the cusp but in the other side the opening was too small and the bar falls vertically to the cusp in 5 the uppermost side is to the narrow aperture and the lower to the small one and in fig 9 from the casa cicogna the uppermost side is to the apertures of the tracery the lowermost to the arches beneath the great roll following the design of the tracery while 13 and 14 are left without the roll at the base of their cavettos on the uppermost sides which are turned to narrow apertures the earliness of the casa cicogna tracery is seen in a moment by its being moulded on the face only it is in fact nothing more than a series of quatrefoiled apertures in the solid wall of the house with mouldings on their faces and magnificent arches of pure pointed fifth order sustaining them below  illustration plate xi                tracery bars  the following are the references to the figures in the plate              1 frari             2 apse st john and paul             3 frari             4 ducal palace inner court

the frari and st john and paul venetian work consists of roll traceries of one general pattern it will be seen also that 10 and 11 from the frari furnish the first examples of the form afterwards completely developed in 17 the tracery bar of the ducal palace but that this bar differs from them in greater strength and squareness and in adding a recess between its smaller roll and the cusp observe that this is done for strength chiefly as in the contemporary tracery 21 of the upper windows no such additional thickness is used  figure 17 is slightly inaccurate the little curved recesses behind the smaller roll are not equal on each side that next the cusp is smallest being about 58 of an inch while that next the cavetto is about 78 to such an extent of subtlety did the old builders carry their love of change  the return of the cavetto in 21 23 and 26 is comparatively rare and is generally a sign of later date  illustration fig ii  illustration fig iii  the reader must observe that the great sturdiness of the form of the bars 5 9 17 24 25 is a consequence of the peculiar office of venetian traceries in supporting the mass of the building above already noticed in vol ii and indeed the forms of the venetian gothic are in many other ways influenced by the difficulty of obtaining stability on sandy foundations one thing is especially noticeable in all their arrangements of traceries namely the endeavor to obtain equal and horizontal pressure along the whole breadth of the building not the divided and local pressures of northern gothic this object is considerably aided by the structure of the balconies which are of great service in knitting the shafts together forming complete tiebeams of marble as well as a kind of rivets at their bases for instance at b fig ii is represented the masonry of the base of the upper arcade of the ducal palace showing the root of one of its main shafts with the binding balconies the solid stones which form the foundation are much broader than the balcony shafts so that the socketed arrangement is not seen it is shown as it would appear in a longitudinal section the balconies are not let into the circular shafts but fitted to their circular curves so as to grasp them and riveted with metal and the bars of stone which form the tops of the balconies are of great strength and depth the small trefoiled arches being cut out of them as in fig iii so as hardly to diminish their binding power in the lighter independent balconies they are often cut deeper but in all cases the bar of stone is nearly independent of the small shafts placed beneath it and would stand firm though these were removed as at a fig ii supported either by the main shafts of the traceries or by its own small pilasters with semishafts at their sides of the plan d fig ii in a continuous balcony and e at the angle of one  there is one more very curious circumstance illustrative of the venetian desire to obtain horizontal pressure in all the gothic staircases with which i am acquainted out of venice in which vertical shafts are used to support an inclined line those shafts are connected by arches rising each above the other with a little bracket above the capitals on the side where it is necessary to raise the arch or else though less gracefully with a longer curve to the lowest side of the arch  but the venetians seem to have had a morbid horror of arches which were not on a level they could not endure the appearance of the roof of one arch bearing against the side of another and rather than introduce the idea of obliquity into bearing curves they abandoned the arch principle altogether so that even in their richest gothic staircases where trefoiled arches exquisitely decorated are used on the landings they ran the shafts on the sloping stair simply into the bar of stone above them and used the excessively ugly and valueless arrangement of fig ii rather than sacrifice the sacred horizontality of their arch system  illustration fig iv  it will be noted in plate xi that the form and character of the tracery bars themselves are independent of the position or projection of the cusps on their flat sides in this respect also venetian traceries are peculiar the example 22 of the porta della carta being the only one in the plate which is subordinated according to the northern system in every other case the form of the aperture is determined either by a flat and solid cusp as in 6 or by a pierced cusp as in 4 the effect of the pierced cusp is seen in the uppermost figure plate xviii vol ii and its derivation from the solid cusp will be understood at once from the woodcut fig iv which represents a series of the flanking stones of any arch of the fifth order such as f in plate iii vol i  illustration fig v  the first on the left shows the condition of cusp in a perfectly simple and early gothic arch 2 and 3 are those of common arches of the fifth order 4 is the condition in more studied examples of the gothic advanced guard and 5 connects them all with the system of traceries introducing the common archivolt mouldings on the projecting edge of 2 and 3 we obtain the bold and deep fifth order window used down to the close of the fourteenth century or even later and always grand in its depth of cusp and consequently of shadow but the narrow cusp 4 occurs also in very early work and is piquant when set beneath a bold flat archivolt as in fig v from the corte del forno at santa marina the pierced cusp gives a peculiar lightness and brilliancy to the window but is not so sublime in the richer buildings the surface of the flat and solid cusp is decorated with a shallow trefoil see plate viii vol i or when the cusp is small with a triangular incision only as seen in figs 7 and 8 plate xi the recesses on the sides of the other cusps indicate their single or double lines of foliation the cusp of the ducal palace has a fillet only round its edge and a ball of red marble on its truncated point and is perfect in its grand simplicity but in general the cusps of venice are far inferior to those of verona and of the other cities of italy chiefly because there was always some confusion in the mind of the designer between true cusps and the mere bending inwards of the arch of the fourth order the two series 4 a to 4 e and 5 a to 5 e in plate xiv vol ii are arranged so as to show this connexion as well as the varieties of curvature in the trefoiled arches of the fourth and fifth orders which though apparently slight on so small a scale are of enormous importance in distant effect a house in which the joints of the cusps project as much as in 5 c being quite piquant and grotesque when compared with one in which the cusps are subdued to the form 5 b 4 d and 4 e are veronese forms wonderfully effective and spirited the latter occurs at verona only but the former at venice also 5 d occurs in venice but is very rare and 5 e i found only once on the narrow canal close to the entrance door of the hotel danieli it was partly walled up but i obtained leave to take down the brickwork and lay open one side of the arch which may still be seen                                       the above particulars are enough to enable the reader to judge of the distinctness of evidence which the details of venetian architecture bear to its dates farther explanation of the plates would be vainly tedious but the architect who uses these volumes in venice will find them of value in enabling him instantly to class the mouldings which may interest him and for this reason i have given a larger number of examples than would otherwise have been sufficient for my purpose   footnotes    58 olim magistri prothi palatii nostri novicadorin p 127    59 a print dated 1585 barbarously

not like to be thanked here but i cannot     let her send into devonshire for magnolias and draw them for me     without thanking her    66 that is the house in the parish of the apostoli on the grand     canal noticed in vol ii and see also the venetian index under     head apostoli    67 close to the bridge over the main channel through murano is a     massive foursquare gothic palace containing some curious traceries     and many unique transitional forms of window among which these     windows of the fourth order occur with a roll within their dentil     band    68 thus for the sake of convenience we may generally call the     palace with the emblems of the evangelists on its spandrils vol     ii    69 the house with chequers like a chessboard on its spandrils     given in my folio

iv venetian index  the first of the following indices contains the names of persons the second those of places not in venice alluded to in the body of the work the third index consists of references to the subjects touched upon in the fourth called the venetian index i have named every building of importance in the city of venice itself or near it supplying for the convenience of the traveller short notices of those to which i had no occasion to allude in the text of the work and making the whole as complete a guide as i could with such added directions as i should have given to any private friend visiting the city as however in many cases the opinions i have expressed differ widely from those usually received and in other instances subjects which may be of much interest to the traveller have not come within the scope of my inquiry the reader had better take lazaris small guide in his hand also as he will find in it both the information i have been unable to furnish and the expression of most of the received opinions upon any subject of art  various inconsistencies will be noticed in the manner of indicating the buildings some being named in italian some in english and some half in one and half in the other but these inconsistencies are permitted in order to save trouble and make the index more practically useful for instance i believe the traveller will generally look for mark rather than for marco when he wishes to find the reference to st marks church but i think he will look for rocco rather than for roch when he is seeking for the account of the scuola di san rocco so also i have altered the character in which the titles of the plates are printed from the black letter in the first volume to the plain roman in the second and third finding experimentally that the former character was not easily legible and conceiving that the book would be none the worse for this practical illustration of its own principles in a daring sacrifice of symmetry to convenience  these alphabetical indices will however be of little use unless another and a very different kind of index be arranged in the mind of the reader an index explanatory of the principal purposes and contents of the various parts of this essay it is difficult to analyze the nature of the reluctance with which either a writer or painter takes it upon him to explain the meaning of his own work even in cases where without such explanation it must in a measure remain always disputable but i am persuaded that this reluctance is in most instances carried too far and that wherever there really is a serious purpose in a book or a picture the author does wrong who either in modesty or vanity both feelings have their share in producing the dislike of personal interpretation trusts entirely to the patience and intelligence of the readers or spectators to penetrate into their significance at all events i will as far as possible spare such trouble with respect to these volumes by stating here finally and clearly both what they intend and what they contain and this the rather because i have lately noticed with some surprise certain reviewers announcing as a discovery what i thought had lain palpably on the surface of the book namely that if mr ruskin be right all the architects and all the architectural teaching of the last three hundred years must have been wrong that is indeed precisely the fact and the very thing i meant to say which indeed i thought i had said over and over again i believe the architects of the last three centuries to have been wrong wrong without exception wrong totally and from the foundation this is exactly the point i have been endeavoring to prove from the beginning of this work to the end of it but as it seems not yet to have been stated clearly enough i will here try to put my entire theorem into an unmistakable form  the various nations who attained eminence in the arts before the time of christ each of them produced forms of architecture which in their various degrees of merit were almost exactly indicative of the degrees of intellectual and moral energy of the nations which originated them and each reached its greatest perfection at the time when the true energy and prosperity of the people who had invented it were at their culminating point many of these various styles of architecture were good considered in relation to the times and races which gave birth to them but none were absolutely good or perfect or fitted for the practice of all future time  the advent of christianity for the first time rendered possible the full development of the soul of man and therefore the full development of the arts of man  christianity gave birth to a new architecture not only immeasurably superior to all that had preceded it but demonstrably the best architecture that can exist perfect in construction and decoration and fit for the practice of all time  this architecture commonly called gothic though in conception perfect like the theory of a christian character never reached an actual perfection having been retarded and corrupted by various adverse influences but it reached its highest perfection hitherto manifested about the close of the thirteenth century being then indicative of a peculiar energy in the christian mind of europe  in the course of the fifteenth century owing to various causes which i have endeavored to trace in the preceding pages the christianity of europe was undermined and a pagan architecture was introduced in imitation of that of the greeks and romans  the architecture of the greeks and romans themselves was not good but it was natural and as i said before good in some respects and for a particular time  but the imitative architecture introduced first in the fifteenth century and practised ever since was neither good nor natural it was good in no respect and for no time all the architects who have built in that style have built what was worthless and therefore the greater part of the architecture which has been built for the last three hundred years and which we are now building is worthless we must give up this style totally despise it and forget it and build henceforward only in that perfect and christian style hitherto called gothic which is everlastingly the best  this is the theorem of these volumes  in support of this theorem the first volume contains in its first chapter a sketch of the actual history of christian architecture up to the period of the reformation and in the subsequent chapters an analysis of the entire system of the laws of architectural construction and decoration deducing from those laws positive conclusions as to the best forms and manners of building for all time  the second volume contains in its first five chapters an account of one of the most important and least known forms of christian architecture as exhibited in venice together with an analysis of its nature in the fourth chapter and which is a peculiarly important part of this section an account of the power of color over the human mind  the sixth chapter of the second volume contains an analysis of the nature of gothic architecture properly so called and shows that in its external form it complies precisely with the abstract laws of structure and beauty investigated in the first volume the seventh and eighth chapters of the second volume illustrate the nature of gothic architecture by various venetian examples the third volume investigates in its first chapter the causes and manner of the corruption of gothic architecture in its second chapter defines the nature of the pagan architecture which superseded it in the third chapter shows the connexion of that pagan architecture with the various characters of mind which brought about the destruction of the venetian nation and in the fourth chapter points out the dangerous tendencies in the modern mind which the practice of such an architecture indicates  such is the intention of the preceding pages which i hope will no more be doubted or mistaken as far as regards the manner of its fulfilment though i hope in the course of other inquiries to add much to the elucidation of the points in dispute i cannot feel it necessary to apologize for the imperfect handling of a subject which the labor of a long life had i been able to bestow it must still have left imperfectly treated     i  personal index       a    alberti duccio degli his tomb iii 74 80   alexander iii his defence by venetians i 7   ambrose st his verbal

womanhood virtues of as given by spenser ii 326       z    zigzag norman i 339     iv  venetian index   i have endeavored to make the following index as useful as possible to the traveller by indicating only the objects which are really worth his study a travellers interest stimulated as it is into strange vigor by the freshness of every impression and deepened by the sacredness of the charm of association which long familiarity with any scene too fatally wears away71 is too precious a thing to be heedlessly wasted and as it is physically impossible to see and to understand more than a certain quantity of art in a given time the attention bestowed on secondrate works in such a city as venice is not merely lost but actually harmfuldeadening the interest and confusing the memory with respect to those which it is a duty to enjoy and a disgrace to forget the reader need not fear being misled by any omissions for i have conscientiously pointed out every characteristic example even of the styles which i dislike and have referred to lazari in all instances in which my own information failed but if he is in any wise willing to trust me i should recommend him to devote his principal attention if he is fond of paintings to the works of tintoret paul veronese and john bellini not of course neglecting titian yet remembering that titian can be well and thoroughly studied in almost any great european gallery while tintoret and bellini can be judged of only in venice and paul veronese though gloriously represented by the two great pictures in the louvre and many others throughout europe is yet not to be fully estimated until he is seen at play among the fantastic chequers of the venetian ceilings  i have supplied somewhat copious notices of the pictures of tintoret because they are much injured difficult to read and entirely neglected by other writers on art i cannot express the astonishment and indignation i felt on finding in kuglers handbook a paltry cenacolo painted probably in a couple of hours for a couple of zecchins for the monks of st trovaso quoted as characteristic of this master just as foolish readers quote separate stanzas of peter bell or the idiot boy as characteristic of wordsworth finally the reader is requested to observe that the dates assigned to the various buildings named in the following index are almost without exception conjectural that is to say founded exclusively on the internal evidence of which a portion has been given in the final appendix it is likely therefore that here and there in particular instances further inquiry may prove me to have been deceived but such occasional errors are not of the smallest importance with respect to the general conclusions of the preceding pages which will be found to rest on too broad a basis to be disturbed       a   accademia delle belle arti notice above the door the two basreliefs    of st leonard and st christopher chiefly remarkable for their rude    cutting at so late a date as 1377 but the niches under which they    stand are unusual in their bent gables and in little crosses within    circles which fill their cusps the traveller is generally too much    struck by titians great picture of the assumption to be able to    pay proper attention to the other works in this gallery let him    however ask himself candidly how much of his admiration is    dependent merely upon the picture being larger than any other in the    room and having bright masses of red and blue in it let him be    assured that the picture is in reality not one whit the better for    being either large or gaudy in color and he will then be better    disposed to give the pains necessary to discover the merit of the more    profound and solemn works of bellini and tintoret one of the most    wonderful works in the whole gallery is tintorets death of abel on    the left of the assumption the adam and eve on the right of it    is hardly inferior and both are more characteristic examples of the    master and in many respects better pictures than the much vaunted    miracle of st mark all the works of bellini in this room are of    great beauty and interest in the great room that which contains    titians presentation of the virgin the traveller should examine    carefully all the pictures by vittor carpaccio and gentile bellini    which represent scenes in ancient venice they are full of interesting    architecture and costume marco basaitis agony in the garden is a    lovely example of the religious school the tintorets in this room are    all second rate but most of the veronese are good and the large ones    are magnificent   aliga see giorgio   alvise church of st i have never been in this church but lazari    dates its interior with decision as of the year 1388 and it may be    worth a glance if the traveller has time   andrea church of st well worth visiting for the sake of the    peculiarly sweet and melancholy effect of its little grassgrown    campo opening to the lagoon and the alps the sculpture over the    door st peter walking on the water is a quaint piece of    renaissance work note the distant rocky landscape and the oar of the    existing gondola floating by st andrews boat the church is of the    later gothic period much defaced but still picturesque the lateral    windows are bluntly trefoiled and good of their time   angeli church delgli at murano the sculpture of the annunciation    over the entrancegate is graceful in exploring murano it is worth    while to row up the great canal thus far for the sake of the opening    to the lagoon   antonino church of st of no importance   apollinare church of st of no importance   apostoli church of the the exterior is nothing there is said to be    a picture by veronese in the interior the fall of the manna i have    not seen it but if it be of importance the traveller should compare    it carefully with tintorets in the scuola di san rocco and san    giorgio maggiore   apostoli palace at ii 253 on the grand canal near the rialto    opposite the fruitmarket a most important transitional palace its    sculpture in the first story is peculiarly rich and curious i think    venetian in imitation of byzantine the sea story and first floor are    of the first half of the thirteenth century the rest modern observe    that only one wing of the sea story is left the other half having    been modernized the traveller should land to look at the capital    drawn in plate ii of vol iii fig 7   arsenal its gateway is a curiously picturesque example of renaissance    workmanship admirably sharp and expressive in its ornamental    sculpture it is in many parts like some of the best byzantine work    the greek lions in front of it appear to me to deserve more praise    than they have received though they are awkwardly balanced between    conventional and imitative representation having neither the severity    proper to the one nor the veracity necessary for the other       b   badoer palazzo in the campo san giovanni in bragola a magnificent    example of the fourteenth century gothic circa 13101320 anterior to    the ducal palace and showing beautiful ranges of the fifth order    window with fragments of the original balconies and the usual    lateral window larger than any of the rest in the centre of its    arcade on the first floor is the inlaid ornament drawn in plate viii    vol i the fresco painting on the walls is of later date and i    believe the heads which form the finials have been inserted afterwards    also the original windows having been pure fifth order     the building is now a ruin inhabited by the lowest orders the first    floor when i was last in venice by a laundress   baffo palazzo in the campo st maurizio the commonest late    renaissance a few olive leaves and vestiges of two figures still    remain upon it of the frescoes by paul veronese with which it was    once adorned   balbi palazzo in volta di canal of no importance   barbarigo palazzo on the grand canal next the casa pisani late    renaissance noticeable only as a house in which some of the best    pictures of titian were allowed to be ruined by damp and out of which    they were then sold to the emperor of russia   barbaro palazzo on the grand canal next the palazzo cavalli these    two buildings form the principal objects in the foreground of the view    which almost every artist seizes on his first traverse of the grand    canal the church of the salute forming a most graceful distance    neither is however of much value except in general effect but the    barbaro is the best and the pointed arcade in its side wall seen    from the narrow canal between it and the cavalli is good gothic of    the earliest fourteenth century type   barnaba church of st of no importance   bartolomeo church of st i did not go to look at the works of    sebastian del piombo which it contains fully crediting m lazaris    statement that they have been barbaramente sfigurati da mani    imperite che pretendevano ristaurarli otherwise the church is of no    importance   basso church of st of no importance   battagia palazzo on the grand canal of no importance   beccherie see querini   bembo palazzo on the grand canal next the casa manin a noble    gothic pile circa 13501380 which before it was painted by the    modern venetians with the two most valuable colors of tintoret bianco    e nero by being whitewashed above and turned into a coal warehouse    below must have been among the most noble in effect on the whole    grand canal it still forms a beautiful group with the rialto some    large shipping being generally anchored at its quay its sea story and    entresol are of earlier date i believe than the rest the doors of    the former are byzantine see above final appendix under head    jambs and above the entresol is a beautiful byzantine cornice    built into the wall and harmonizing well with the gothic work   bembo palazzo in the calle magno at the campo de due pozzi close    to the arsenal noticed by lazari and selvatico as having a very    interesting staircase it is early gothic circa 1330 but not a whit    more interesting than many others of similar date and design see    contarini porta de ferro morosini sanudo and minelli   benedetto campo of st do not fail to see the superb though    partially ruinous gothic palace fronting this little square it is    very late gothic just passing into renaissance unique in venice in    masculine character united with the delicacy of the incipient style    observe especially the brackets of the balconies the flowerwork on    the cornices and the arabesques on the angles of the balconies    themselves   benedetto church of st of no importance   bernardo palazzo on the grand canal a very noble pile of early    fifteenth century gothic founded on the ducal palace the traceries    in its lateral windows are both rich and unusual   bernardo palazzo at st polo a glorious palace on a narrow canal    in a part of venice now inhabited by the lower orders only it is    rather late central gothic circa 13801400 but of the finest kind    and superb in its effect of color when seen from the side a capital    in the interior court is much praised by selvatico and lazari because    its foglie dacanto anything by the by but acanthus quasi    agitate de vento si attorcigliano dintorno alla campana concetto    non indegno della bellepoca greca does this mean epoca    bisantina the capital is simply a translation into gothic sculpture    of the byzantine ones of st marks and the fondaco de turchi see    plate viii vol i fig 14 and is far inferior to either but    taken as a whole i think that after the ducal palace this is the    noblest in effect of all in venice   brenta banks of the i 354 villas on the i 354   businello casa ii 391   byzantine palaces generally ii 118       c   camerlenghi palace of the beside the rialto a graceful work of the    early renaissance 1525 passing into roman renaissance its details    are inferior to most of the work of the school the camerlenghi    properly camerlenghi di comune were the three officers or ministers    who had care of the administration of public expenses   cancellaria ii 293   canciano church of st of no importance   cappello palazzo at st aponal of no interest some say that bianca    cappello fled from it but the tradition seems to fluctuate between    the various houses belonging to her family   caritÀ church of the once an interesting gothic church of the    fourteenth century lately defaced and applied to some of the usual    important purposes of the modern italians the effect of its ancient    façade may partly be guessed at from the pictures of canaletto but    only guessed at canaletto being less to be trusted for renderings of    details than the rudest and most ignorant painter of the thirteenth    century   carmini church of the a most interesting church of late thirteenth    century work but much altered and defaced its nave in which the    early shafts and capitals of the pure truncate form are unaltered is    very fine in effect its lateral porch is quaint and beautiful    decorated with byzantine circular sculptures of which the central one    is given in vol ii plate xi fig 5 and supported on two shafts    whose capitals are the most archaic examples of the pure rose form    that i know in venice     there is a glorious tintoret over the first altar on the right in    entering the circumcision of christ i do not know an aged head    either more beautiful or more picturesque than that of the high    priest the cloister is full of notable tombs nearly all dated one    of the fifteenth century to the left on entering is interesting from    the color still left on the leaves and flowers of its sculptured    roses   cassano church of st this church must on no account be missed as it    contains three tintorets of which one the crucifixion is among    the finest in europe there is nothing worth notice in the building    itself except the jamb of an ancient door left in the renaissance    buildings facing the canal which has been given among the examples    of byzantine jambs and the traveller may therefore devote his    entire attention to the three pictures in the chancel     1 the crucifixion on the left of the high altar it is    refreshing to find a picture taken care of and in a bright though not    a good light so that such parts of it as are seen at all are seen    well it is also in a better state than most pictures in galleries    and most remarkable for its new and strange treatment of the subject    it seems to have been painted more for the artists own delight than    with any labored attempt at composition the horizon is so low that    the spectator must fancy himself lying at full length on the grass or    rather among the brambles and luxuriant weeds of which the foreground    is entirely composed among these the seamless robe of christ has    fallen at the foot of the cross the rambling briars and wild grasses    thrown here and there over its folds of rich but pale crimson    behind them and seen through them the heads of a troop of roman    soldiers are raised against the sky and above them their spears and    halberds form a thin forest against the horizontal clouds the three    crosses are put on the extreme right of the picture and its centre is    occupied by the executioners one of whom standing on a ladder    receives from the other at once the sponge and the tablet with the    letters inri the madonna and st john are on the extreme left    superbly painted like all the rest but quite subordinate in fact    the whole mind of the painter seems to have been set upon making the    principals accessary and the accessaries principal we look first at    the grass and then at the scarlet robe and then at the clump of    distant spears and then at the sky and last of all at the cross as    a piece of color the picture is notable for its extreme modesty    there is not a single very full or bright tint in any part and yet    the color is delighted in throughout not the slightest touch of it    but is delicious it is worth notice also and especially because    this picture being in a fresh state we are sure of one fact that    like nearly all other great colorists tintoret was afraid of light    greens in his vegetation he often uses dark blue greens in his    shadowed trees but here where the grass is in full light it is all    painted with various hues of sober brown more especially where it    crosses the crimson robe the handling of the whole is in his noblest    manner and i consider the picture generally quite beyond all price    it was cleaned i believe some years ago but not injured or at    least as little injured as it is possible for a picture to be which    has undergone any cleaning process whatsoever     2 the resurrection over the high altar the lower part of this    picture is entirely concealed by a miniature temple about five feet    high on the top of the altar certainly an insult little expected by    tintoret as by getting on steps and looking over the said temple    one may see that the lower figures of the picture are the most    labored it is strange that the painter never seemed able to conceive    this subject with any power and in the present work he is    marvellously hampered by various types and conventionalities it is    not a painting of the resurrection but of roman catholic saints    thinking about the resurrection on one side of the tomb is a bishop    in full robes on the other a female saint i know not who beneath    it an angel playing on an organ and a cherub blowing it and other    cherubs flying about the sky with flowers the whole conception being    a mass of renaissance absurdities it is moreover heavily painted    overdone and overfinished and the forms of the cherubs utterly    heavy and vulgar i cannot help fancying the picture has been restored    in some way or another but there is still great power in parts of it    if it be a really untouched tintoret it is a highly curious example    of failure from overlabor on a subject into which his mind was not    thrown the color is hot and harsh and felt to be so more painfully    from its opposition to the grand coolness and chastity of the    crucifixion the face of the angel playing the organ is highly    elaborated so also the flying cherubs     3 the descent into hades on the righthand side of the high    altar much injured and little to be regretted i never was more    puzzled by any picture the painting being throughout careless and in    some places utterly bad and yet not like modern work the principal    figure however of eve has either been redone or is scholars work    altogether as i suspect most of the rest of the picture it looks    as if tintoret had sketched it when he was ill left it to a bad    scholar to work on with and then finished it in a hurry but he has    assuredly had something to do with it it is not likely that anybody    else would have refused all aid from the usual spectral company with    which common painters fill the scene bronzino for instance covers    his canvas with every form of monster that his sluggish imagination    could coin tintoret admits only a somewhat haggard adam a graceful    eve two or three venetians in court dress seen amongst the smoke    and a satan represented as a handsome youth recognizable only by the    claws on his feet the picture is dark and spoiled but i am pretty    sure there are no demons or spectres in it this is quite in    accordance with the masters caprice but it considerably diminishes    the interest of a work in other ways unsatisfactory there may once    have been something impressive in the shooting in of the rays at the    top of the cavern as well as in the strange grass that grows in the    bottom whose infernal character is indicated by its all being knotted    together but so little of these parts can be seen that it is not    worth spending time on a work certainly unworthy of the master and in    great part probably never seen by him   cattarina church of st said to contain a chefdoeuvre of paul    veronese the marriage of st catherine i have not seen it   cavalli palazzo opposite the academy of arts an imposing pile on    the grand canal of renaissance gothic but of little merit in the    details and the effect of its traceries has been of late destroyed by    the fittings of modern external blinds its balconies are good of the    later gothic type see barbaro   cavalli palazzo next the casa grimani or postoffice but on the    other side of

interesting stone arch of the early thirteenth century already drawn    in my folio work in the interior court is a beautiful remnant of    staircase with a piece of balcony at the top circa 1350 and one of    the most richly and carefully wrought in venice the palace judging    by these remnants all that are now left of it except a single    traceried window of the same date at the turn of the

gothic in venice but notable    more for richness than excellence of design in one respect however    it deserves to be regarded with attention as showing how much beauty    and dignity may be bestowed on a very small and unimportant    dwellinghouse by gothic sculpture foolish criticisms upon it have    appeared in english accounts of foreign buildings objecting to it on    the ground of its being illproportioned the simple fact being    that there was no room in this part of the canal for a wider house    and that its builder made its rooms as comfortable as he could and    its windows and balconies of a convenient size for those who were to    see through them and stand on them and left the proportions    outside to take care of themselves which indeed they have very    sufficiently done for though the house thus honestly confesses its    diminutiveness it is nevertheless one of the principal ornaments of    the very noblest reach of the grand canal and would be

count the number of figures in this    picture of which the grouping is so intricate that at the upper part    it is not easy to distinguish one figure from another but i counted    150 important figures in one half of it alone so that as there are    nearly as many in subordinate position the total number cannot be    under 500 i believe this is on the whole tintorets    chefdoeuvre though it is so vast that no one takes the trouble    to read it and therefore less wonderful pictures are preferred to it    i have not myself been able to study except a few fragments of it all    executed in his finest manner but it may assist a hurried observer to    point out to him that the whole composition is divided into concentric    zones represented one above another like the stories of a cupola    round the figures of christ and the madonna at the central and    highest point both these figures are exceedingly dignified and    beautiful between each zone or belt of the nearer figures the white    distances of heaven are seen filled with floating spirits the picture    is on the whole wonderfully preserved and the most precious thing    that venice possesses she will not possess it long for the venetian    academicians finding it exceedingly unlike their own works declare    it to want harmony and are going to retouch it to their own ideas of    perfection     2 siege of zara the first picture on the right on entering the    sala del scrutinio it is a mere battle piece in which the figures    like the arrows are put in by the score there are high merits in the    thing and so much invention that it is possible tintoret may have    made the sketch for it but if executed by him at all he has done it    merely in the temper in which a signpainter meets the wishes of an    ambitious landlord he seems to have been ordered to represent all the    events of the battle at once and to have felt that provided he gave    men arrows and ships enough his employers would be perfectly    satisfied the picture is a vast one some thirty feet by fifteen     various other pictures will be pointed out by the custode in these    two rooms as worthy of attention but they are only historically not    artistically interesting the works of paul veronese on the ceiling    have been repainted and the rest of the pictures on the walls are by    secondrate men the traveller must once for all be warned against    mistaking the works of domenico robusti domenico tintoretto a very    miserable painter for those of his illustrious father jacopo     3 the doge grimani kneeling before faith by titian in the sala    delle quattro porte to be observed with care as one of the most    striking examples of titians want of feeling and coarseness of    conception see above vol i p 12 as a work of mere art it is    however of great value the traveller who has been accustomed to    deride turners indistinctness of touch ought to examine carefully    the mode of painting the venice in the distance at the bottom of this    picture     4 frescoes on the roof of the sala delle quattro porte by    tintoret once magnificent beyond description now mere wrecks the    plaster crumbling away in large flakes but yet deserving of the most    earnest study     5 christ taken down from the cross by tintoret at the upper end    of the sala dei pregadi one of the most interesting mythic pictures    of venice two doges being represented beside the body of christ and    a most noble painting executed however for distant effect and seen    best from the end of the room     6 venice queen of the sea by tintoret central compartment of the    ceiling in the sala dei pregadi notable for the sweep of its vast    green surges and for the daring character of its entire conception    though it is wild and careless and in many respects unworthy of the    master note the way in which he has used the fantastic forms of the    sea weeds with respect to what was above stated iii 158 as to his    love of the grotesque     7 the doge loredano in prayer to the virgin by tintoret in the    same room sickly and pale in color yet a grand work to be studied    however more for the sake of seeing what a great man does to order    when he is wearied of what is required from him than for its own    merit     8 st george and the princess there are besides the paradise    only six pictures in the ducal palace as far as i know which    tintoret painted carefully and those are all exceedingly fine the    most finished of these are in the anticollegio but those that are    most majestic and characteristic of the master are two oblong ones    made to fill the panels of the walls in the antichiesetta these two    each i suppose about eight feet by six are in his most quiet and    noble manner there is excessively little color in them their    prevalent tone being a greyish brown opposed with grey black and a    very warm russet they are thinly painted perfect in tone and quite    untouched the first of them is st george and the dragon the    subject being treated in a new and curious way the principal figure    is the princess who sits astride on the dragons neck holding him by    a bridle of silken riband st george stands above and behind her    holding his hands over her head as if to bless her or to keep the    dragon quiet by heavenly power and a monk stands by on the right    looking gravely on there is no expression or life in the dragon    though the white flashes in its eye are very ghastly but the whole    thing is entirely typical and the princess is not so much represented    riding on the dragon as supposed to be placed by st george in an    attitude of perfect victory over her chief enemy she has a full rich    dress of dull red but her figure is somewhat ungraceful st george    is in grey armor and grey drapery and has a beautiful face his    figure entirely dark against the distant sky there is a study for    this picture in the manfrini palace     9 st andrew and st jerome this the companion picture has even    less color than its opposite it is nearly all brown and grey the    figleaves and oliveleaves brown the faces brown the dresses brown    and st andrew holding a great brown cross there is nothing that can    be called color except the grey of the sky which approaches in some    places a little to blue and a single piece of dirty brickred in st    jeromes dress and yet tintorets greatness hardly ever shows more    than in the management of such sober tints i would rather have these    two small brown pictures and two others in the academy perfectly    brown also in their general tonethe cain and abel and the adam    and evethan all the other small pictures in venice put together    which he painted in bright colors for altar pieces but i never saw    two pictures which so nearly approached grisailles as these and yet    were delicious pieces of color i do not know if i am right in calling    one of the saints st andrew he stands holding a great upright wooden    cross against the sky st jerome reclines at his feet against a    rock over which some glorious fig leaves and olive branches are    shooting every line of them studied with the most exquisite care and    yet cast with perfect freedom     10 bacchus and ariadne the most beautiful of the four careful    pictures by tintoret which occupy the angles of the anticollegio    once one of the noblest pictures in the world but now miserably    faded the sun being allowed to fall on it all day long the design of    the forms of the leafage round the head of the bacchus and the    floating grace of the female figure above will however always give    interest to this picture unless it be repainted     the other three tintorets in this room are careful and fine but far    inferior to the bacchus and the vulcan and the cyclops is a    singularly meagre and vulgar study of common models     11 europa by paul veronese in the same room one of the very few    pictures which both possess and deserve a high reputation     12 venice enthroned by paul veronese on the roof of the same    room one of the grandest pieces of frank color in the ducal palace     13 venice and the doge sebastian venier at the upper end of the    sala del collegio an unrivalled paul veronese far finer even than    the europa     14 marriage of st catherine by tintoret in the same room an    inferior picture but the figure of st catherine is quite exquisite    note how her veil falls over her form showing the sky through it as    an alpine cascade falls over a marble rock     there are three other tintorets on the walls of this room but all    inferior though full of power note especially the painting of the    lions wings and of the colored carpet in the one nearest the    throne the doge alvise mocenigo adoring the redeemer     the roof is entirely by paul veronese and the traveller who really    loves painting ought to get leave to come to this room whenever he    chooses and should pass the sunny summer mornings there again and    again wandering now and then into the anticollegio and sala dei    pregadi and coming back to rest under the wings of the couched lion    at the feet of the mocenigo he will no otherwise enter so deeply    into the heart of venice       e   emo palazzo on the grand canal of no interest

restored and spoiled all but the stonework of the main windows the    restoration was necessary however for when i was in venice in 1845    this palace was a foul ruin its great hall a mass of mud used as a    back receptacle of a stonemasons yard and its rooms whitewashed    and scribbled over with indecent caricatures it has since been    partially strengthened and put in order but as the venetian    municipality have now given it to the austrians to be used as    barracks it will probably soon be reduced to its former condition    the lower palaces at the side of this building are

is utterly worthless    the verdantique pillar in the south transept is a very noble example    of the jewel shaft see the note at p 83 vol ii   giacomo di rialto church of st a picturesque little church on the    piazza di rialto it has been grievously restored but the pillars and    capitals of its nave are certainly of the eleventh century those of    its portico are of good central gothic and it will surely not be left    unvisited on this ground if on no other that it stands on the site    and still retains the name of the first church ever built on that    rialto which formed the nucleus of future venice and became    afterwards the mart of her merchants   giobbe church of st near the cana reggio its principal entrance is    a very fine example of early renaissance sculpture note in it    especially its beautiful use of the flower of the convolvulus there    are said to be still more beautiful examples of the same period in    the interior the cloister though much defaced is of the gothic    period and worth a glance   giorgio de greci church of st the greek church it contains no    valuable objects of art but its service is worth attending by those    who have never seen the greek ritual   giorgio de schiavoni church of st said to contain a very precious    series of paintings by victor carpaccio otherwise of no interest   giorgio in aliga st george in the seaweed church of st unimportant    in itself but the most beautiful view of venice at sunset is from a    point at about two thirds of the distance from the city to the island   giorgio maggiore church of st a building which owes its interesting    effect chiefly to its isolated position being seen over a great space    of lagoon the traveller should especially notice in its façade the    manner in which the central renaissance architects of whose style    this church is a renowned example endeavored to fit the laws they had    established to the requirements of their age churches were required    with aisles and clerestories that is to say with a high central nave    and lower wings and the question was how to face this form with    pillars of one proportion the noble romanesque architects built story    above story as at pisa and lucca but the base palladian architects    dared not do this they must needs retain some image of the greek    temple but the greek temple was all of one height a low gable roof    being borne on ranges of equal pillars so the palladian builders    raised first a greek temple with pilasters for shafts and through    the middle of its roof or horizontal beam that is to say of the    cornice which externally represented this beam they lifted another    temple on pedestals adding these barbarous appendages to the shafts    which otherwise would not have been high enough fragments of the    divided cornice or tiebeam being left between the shafts and the    great door of the church thrust in between the pedestals it is    impossible to conceive a design more gross more barbarous more    childish in conception more servile in plagiarism more insipid in    result more contemptible under every point of rational regard     observe also that when palladio had got his pediment at the top of    the church he did not know what to do with it he had no idea of    decorating it except by a round hole in the middle the traveller    should compare both in construction and decoration the church of the    redentore with this of san giorgio now a dark penetration is often    a most precious assistance to a building dependent upon color for its    effect for a cavity is the only means in the architects power of    obtaining certain and vigorous shadow and for this purpose a    circular penetration surrounded by a deep russet marble moulding is    beautifully used in the centre of the white field on the side of the    portico of st marks but palladio had given up color and pierced    his pediment with a circular cavity merely because he had not wit    enough to fill it with sculpture the interior of the church is like a    large assembly room and would have been undeserving of a moments    attention but that it contains some most precious pictures namely     1 gathering the manna on the left hand of the high altar one of    tintorets most remarkable landscapes a brook flowing through a    mountainous country studded with thickets and palm trees the    congregation have been long in the wilderness and are employed in    various manufactures much more than in gathering the manna one group    is forging another grinding manna in a mill another making shoes    one woman making a piece of dress some washing the main purpose of    tintoret being evidently to indicate the continuity of the supply of    heavenly food another painter would have made the congregation    hurrying to gather it and wondering at it tintoret at once makes us    remember that they have been fed with it by the space of forty    years it is a large picture full of interest and power but    scattered in effect and not striking except from its elaborate    landscape     2 the last supper opposite the former these two pictures have    been painted for their places the subjects being illustrative of the    sacrifice of the mass this latter is remarkable for its entire    homeliness in the general treatment of the subject the entertainment    being represented like any large supper in a secondrate italian inn    the figures being all comparatively uninteresting but we are reminded    that the subject is a sacred one not only by the strong light shining    from the head of christ but because the smoke of the lamp which hangs    over the table turns as it rises into a multitude of angels all    painted in grey the color of the smoke and so writhed and twisted    together that the eye hardly at first distinguishes them from the    vapor out of which they are formed ghosts of countenances and filmy    wings filling up the intervals between the completed heads the idea    is highly characteristic of the master the picture has been    grievously injured but still shows miracles of skill in the    expression of candlelight mixed with twilight variously reflected    rays and half tones of the dimly lighted chamber mingled with the    beams of the lantern and those from the head of christ flashing along    the metal and glass upon the table and under it along the floor and    dying away into the recesses of the room     3 martyrdom of various saints altar piece of the third altar in    the south aisle a moderately sized picture and now a very    disagreeable one owing to the violent red into which the color that    formed the glory of the angel at the top is changed it has been    hastily painted and only shows the artists power in the energy of    the figure of an executioner drawing a bow and in the magnificent    ease with which the other figures are thrown together in all manner of    wild groups and defiances of probability stones and arrows are flying    about in the air at random     4 coronation of the virgin fourth altar in the same aisle    painted more for the sake of the portraits at the bottom than of the    virgin at the top a good picture but somewhat tame for tintoret and    much injured the principal figure in black is still however very    fine     5 resurrection of christ at the end of the north aisle in the    chapel beside the choir another picture painted chiefly for the sake    of the included portraits and remarkably cold in general conception    its color has however been gay and delicate lilac yellow and blue    being largely used in it the flag which our saviour bears in his    hand has been once as bright as the sail of a venetian fishingboat    but the colors are now all chilled and the picture is rather crude    than brilliant a mere wreck of what it was and all covered with    droppings of wax at the bottom     6 martyrdom of st stephen altar piece in the north transept    the saint is in a rich prelates dress looking as if he had just been    saying mass kneeling in the foreground and perfectly serene the    stones are flying about him like hail and the ground is covered with    them as thickly as if it were a river bed but in the midst of them    at the saints right hand there is a book lying crushed but open    two or three stones which have torn one of its leaves lying upon it    the freedom and ease with which the leaf is crumpled is just as    characteristic of the master as any of the grander features no one    but tintoret could have so crushed a leaf but the idea is still more    characteristic of him for the book is evidently meant for the mosaic    history which stephen had just been expounding and its being crushed    by the stones shows how the blind rage of the jews was violating their    own law in the murder of stephen in the upper part of the picture are    three figureschrist the father and st michael christ of course    at the right hand of the father as stephen saw him standing but    there is little dignity in this part of the conception in the middle    of the picture which is also the middle distance are three or four    men throwing stones with tintorets usual vigor of gesture and    behind them an immense and confused crowd so that at first we    wonder where st paul is but presently we observe that in the front    of this crowd and almost exactly in the centre of the picture    there is a figure seated on the ground very noble and quiet and with    some loose garments thrown across its knees it is dressed in vigorous    black and red the figure of the father in the sky above is dressed in    black and red also and these two figures are the centres of color to    the whole design it is almost impossible to praise too highly the    refinement of conception which withdrew the unconverted st paul into    the distance so as entirely to separate him from the immediate    interest of the scene and yet marked the dignity to which he was    afterward to be raised by investing him with the colors which    occurred nowhere else in the picture except in the dress which veils    the form of the godhead it is also to be noted as an interesting    example of the value which the painter put upon color only another    composer would have thought it necessary to exalt the future apostle    by some peculiar dignity of action or expression the posture of the    figure is indeed grand but inconspicuous tintoret does not depend    upon it and thinks that the figure is quite ennobled enough by being    made a keynote of color     it is also worth observing how boldly imaginative is the treatment    which covers the ground with piles of stones and yet leaves the    martyr apparently unwounded another painter would have covered him    with blood and elaborated the expression of pain upon his    countenance tintoret leaves us under no doubt as to what manner of    death he is dying he makes the air hurtle with the stones but he    does not choose to make his picture disgusting or even painful the    face of the martyr is serene and exulting and we leave the picture    remembering only how he fell asleep   giovanelli palazzo at the ponte di noale a fine example of    fifteenth century gothic founded on the ducal palace   giovanni e paolo church of st72 foundation of iii 69 an    impressive church though none of its gothic is comparable with that    of the north or with that of verona the western door is interesting    as one of the last conditions of gothic design passing into    renaissance very rich and beautiful of its kind especially the    wreath of fruit and flowers which forms its principal molding the    statue of bartolomeo colleone in the little square beside the church    is certainly one of the noblest works in italy i have never seen    anything approaching it in animation in vigor of portraiture or    nobleness of line the reader will need lazaris guide in making the    circuit of the church which is full of interesting monuments but i    wish especially to direct his attention to two pictures besides the    celebrated peter martyr namely     1 the crucifixion by tintoret on the wall of the lefthand aisle    just before turning into the transept a picture fifteen feet long by    eleven or twelve high i do not believe that either the miracle of    st mark or the great crucifixion in the scuola di san rocco cost    tintoret more pains than this comparatively small work which is now    utterly neglected covered with filth and cobwebs and fearfully    injured as a piece of color and light and shade it is altogether    marvellous of all the fifty figures which the picture contains there    is not one which in any way injures or contends with another nay    there is not a single fold of garment or touch of the pencil which    could be spared every virtue of tintoret as a painter is there in    its highest degreecolor at once the most intense and the most    delicate the utmost decision in the arrangement of masses of light    and yet half tones and modulations of endless variety and all    executed with a magnificence of handling which no words are energetic    enough to describe i have hardly ever seen a picture in which there    was so much decision and so little impetuosity and in which so    little was conceded to haste to accident or to weakness it is too    infinite a work to be describable but among its minor passages of    extreme beauty should especially be noticed the manner in which the    accumulated forms of the human body which fill the picture from end    to end are prevented from being felt heavy by the grace and    elasticity of two or three sprays of leafage which spring from a    broken root in the foreground and rise conspicuous in shadow against    an interstice filled by the pale blue grey and golden light in which    the distant crowd is invested the office of this foliage being in an    artistical point of view correspondent to that of the trees set by    the sculptors of the ducal palace on its angles but they have a far    more important meaning in the picture than any artistical one if the    spectator will look carefully at the root which i have called broken    he will find that in reality it is not broken but cut the other    branches of the young tree having lately been cut away when we    remember that one of the principal incidents in great san rocco    crucifixion is the ass feeding on withered palm leaves we shall be at    no loss to understand the great painters purpose in lifting the    branch of this mutilated olive against the dim light of the distant    sky while close beside it st joseph of arimathea drags along the    dust a white garmentobserve the principal light of the    picturestained with the blood of that king before whom five days    before his crucifiers had strewn their own garments in the way     2 our lady with the camerlenghi in the centre chapel of the three    on the right of the choir a remarkable instance of the theoretical    manner of representing scriptural facts which at this time as noted    in the second chapter of this volume was undermining the belief of    the facts themselves three venetian chamberlains desired to have    their portraits painted and at the same time to express their    devotion to the madonna to that end they are painted kneeling before    her and in order to account for their all three being together and    to give a thread or clue to the story of the picture they are    represented as the three magi but lest the spectator should think it    strange that the magi should be in the dress of venetian chamberlains    the scene is marked as a mere ideality by surrounding the person of    the virgin with saints who lived five hundred years after her she has    for attendants st theodore st sebastian and st carlo query st    joseph one hardly knows whether most to regret the spirit which was    losing sight of the verities of religious history in imaginative    abstractions or to praise the modesty and piety which desired rather    to be represented as kneeling before the virgin than in the discharge    or among the insignia of important offices of state     as an adoration of the magi the picture is of course sufficiently    absurd the st sebastian leans back in the corner to be out of the    way the three magi kneel without the slightest appearance of    emotion to a madonna seated in a venetian loggia of the fifteenth    century and three venetian servants behind bear their offerings in a    very homely sack tied up at the mouth as a piece of portraiture and    artistical composition the work is altogether perfect perhaps the    best piece of tintorets portraitpainting in existence it is very    carefully and steadily wrought and arranged with consummate skill on    a difficult plan the canvas is a long oblong i think about eighteen    or twenty feet long by about seven high one might almost fancy the    painter had been puzzled to bring the piece into use the figures    being all thrown into positions which a little diminish their height    the nearest chamberlain is kneeling the two behind him bowing    themselves slightly the attendants behind bowing lower the madonna    sitting the st theodore sitting still lower on the steps at her    feet and the st sebastian leaning back so that all the lines of the    picture incline more or less from right to left as they ascend this    slope which gives unity to the detached groups is carefully    exhibited by what a mathematician would call coordinatesthe upright    pillars of the loggia and the horizontal clouds of the beautiful sky    the color is very quiet but rich and deep the local tones being    brought out with intense force and the cast shadows subdued the    manner being much more that of titian than of tintoret the sky    appears full of light though it is as dark as the flesh of the faces    and the forms of its floating clouds as well as of the hills over    which they rise are drawn with a deep remembrance of reality there    are hundreds of pictures of tintorets more amazing than this but i    hardly know one that i more love     the reader ought especially to study the sculpture round the altar of    the capella del rosario as an example of the abuse of the sculptors    art every accessory being labored out with as much ingenuity and    intense effort to turn sculpture into painting the grass trees and    landscape being as far realized as possible and in altorelievo    these basreliefs are by various artists and therefore exhibit the    folly of the age not the error of an individual     the following alphabetical list of the tombs in this church which are    alluded to as described in the text with references to the pages

magnificent measures justness of    drawing nobleness of coloring and perfect manliness of treatment    with the purest religious feeling he did as far as it is possible to    do it instinctively and unaffectedly what the caracci only pretended    to do titian colors better but has not his piety leonardo draws    better but has not his color angelico is more heavenly but has not    his manliness far less his powers of art   giovanni elemosinario church of st said to contain a titian and a    bonifazio of no other interest   giovanni in bragola church of st a gothic church of the fourteenth

giustiniani palazzo next the casa foscari on the grand canal    lazari i know not on what authority says that this palace was built    by the giustiniani family before 1428 it is one of those founded    directly on the ducal palace together with the casa foscari at its    side and there could have been no doubt of their date on this ground    but it would be interesting after what we have seen of the progress    of the ducal palace to ascertain the exact year of the erection of    any of these imitations     this palace contains some unusually rich detached windows full of    tracery of which the profiles are given in the appendix under the    title of the palace of the younger foscari it being popularly    reported to have belonged to the son of the doge   giustinian lolin palazzo on the

 of the rude ecclesiastical gothic contemporary with the ducal palace    the entrance to its cloisters from the grand canal is somewhat    later a noble square door with two windows on each side of it the    grandest examples in venice of the late window of the fourth order     the cloister to which this door gives entrance is exactly    contemporary with the finest work of the ducal palace circa 1350 it    is the loveliest cortile i know in venice its capitals consummate in    design and execution and the low wall on which they stand showing    remnants of sculpture unique as far as i know in

lazzaro de mendicanti church of st of no importance   libreria vecchia a graceful building of the central renaissance    designed by sansovino 1536 and much admired by all architects of the    school it was continued by scamozzi down the whole side of st    marks place adding another story above it which modern critics    blame as destroying the eurithmia never considering that had the    two low stories of the library been continued along the entire length    of the piazza they would have looked so low that the entire dignity    of the square would have been lost as it is the library is left in    its originally good proportions and the larger mass of the procuratie    nuove forms a more majestic though less graceful side for the great    square     but the real faults of the building are not in its number of stories    but in the design of the parts it is one of the grossest examples of    the base renaissance habit of turning keystones into brackets    throwing them out in bold projection not less than a foot and a half    beyond the mouldings of the arch a practice utterly barbarous    inasmuch as it evidently tends to dislocate the entire arch if any    real weight were laid on the extremity of the keystone and it is also    a very characteristic example of the vulgar and painful mode of    filling spandrils by naked figures in altorelievo leaning against    the arch on each side and appearing as if they were continually in    danger of slipping off many of these figures have however some    merit in themselves and the whole building is graceful and effective    of its kind the continuation of the procuratie nuove at the western    extremity of st marks place together with various apartments in the    great line of the procuratie nuove forms the royal palace the    residence of the emperor when at venice this building is entirely    modern built in 1810 in imitation of the procuratie nuove and on    the site of sansovinos church of san geminiano     in this range of buildings including the royal palace the procuratie    nuove the old library and the zecca which is connected with them    the latter being an ugly building of very modern date not worth    notice architecturally there are many most valuable pictures among    which i would especially direct attention first to those in the    zecca namely a beautiful and strange madonna by benedetto diana    two noble bonifazios and two groups by tintoret of the provveditori    della zecca by no means to be missed whatever may be sacrificed to    see them on account of the quietness and veracity of their unaffected    portraiture and the absolute freedom from all vanity either in the    painter or in his subjects     next in the antisala of the old library observe the sapienza of    titian in the centre of the ceiling a most interesting work in the    light brilliancy of its color and the resemblance to paul veronese    then in the great hall of the old library examine the two large    tintorets st mark saving a saracen from drowning and the    stealing of his body from constantinople both rude but great note    in the latter the dashing of the rain on the pavement and running of    the water about the feet of the figures then in the narrow spaces    between the windows there are some magnificent single figures by    tintoret among the finest things of the kind in italy or in europe    finally in the gallery of pictures in the palazzo reale among other    good works of various kinds are two of the most interesting    bonifazios in venice the children of israel in their journeyings    in one of which if i recollect right the quails are coming in flight    across a sunset sky forming one of the earliest instances i know of a    thoroughly natural and turneresque effect being felt and rendered by    the old masters the picture struck me chiefly from this circumstance    but the notebook in which i had described it and its companion    having been lost on my way home i cannot now give a more special    account of them except that they are long full of crowded figures    and peculiarly light in color and handling as compared with    bonifazios work in

transept door the finding of the cross by tintoret    a carefully painted and attractive picture but by no means a good    specimen of the master as far as regards power of conception he does    not seem to have entered into his subject there is no wonder no    rapture no entire devotion in any of the figures they are only    interested and pleased in a mild way and the kneeling woman who hands    the nails to a man stooping forward to receive them on the right hand    does so with the air of a person saying you had better take care of    them they may be wanted another time this general coldness in    expression is much increased by the presence of several figures on the    right and left introduced for the sake of portraiture merely and    the reality as well as the feeling of the scene is destroyed by our    seeing one of the youngest and weakest of the women with a huge cross    lying across her knees the whole weight of it resting upon her as    might have been expected where the conception is so languid the    execution is little delighted in it is throughout steady and    powerful but in no place affectionate and in no place impetuous if    tintoret had always painted in this way he would have sunk into a    mere mechanist it is however a genuine and tolerably well preserved    specimen and its female figures are exceedingly graceful that of st    helena very queenly though by no means agreeable in feature among    the male portraits on the left there is one different from the usual    types which occur either in venetian paintings or venetian populace    it is carefully painted and more like a scotch presbyterian minister    than a greek the background is chiefly composed of architecture    white remarkably uninteresting in color and still more so in form    this is to be noticed as one of the unfortunate results of the    renaissance teaching at this period had tintoret backed his empress    helena with byzantine architecture the

and may be briefly described as a beehive set on a low    hexagonal tower with dashes of stonework about its windows like the    flourishes of an idle penman     the cloister of this church is pretty and the attached cemetery is    worth entering for the sake of feeling the strangeness of the quiet    sleeping ground in the midst of the sea   michiel dalle colonne palazzo of no importance

most interesting and finished    example in venice of the byzantine renaissance and one of the most    important in italy of the cinquecento style all its sculptures    should be examined with great care as the best possible examples of a    bad style observe for instance that in spite of the beautiful work    on the square pillars which support the gallery at the west end they    have no more architectural effect than two wooden posts the same kind    of failure in boldness of purpose exists throughout and the building    is in fact rather a small museum of unmeaning though refined    sculpture than a piece of architecture     its grotesques are admirable examples of the base raphaelesque design    examined above iii 136 note especially the childrens heads tied up    by the hair in the lateral sculptures at the top of the altar steps    a rude workman who could hardly have carved the head at all might    have allowed this or any other mode of expressing discontent with his    own doings but the man who could carve a childs head so perfectly    must have been wanting in all human feeling to cut it off and tie it    by the hair to a vine leaf observe in the ducal palace though far    ruder in skill the heads always emerge from the leaves they are    never tied to them   misericordia church of the church itself is nothing and contains    nothing worth the travellers time but the albergo de confratelli    della misericordia at its side is a very interesting and beautiful    relic of the gothic renaissance lazari says del secolo xiv but i    believe it to be later its traceries are very curious and rich and    the sculpture of its capitals very fine for the late time close to    it on the righthand side of the canal which is crossed by the wooden    bridge is one of the richest gothic doors in venice remarkable for    the appearance of antiquity in the general design and stiffness of its    figures though it bears its date 1505 its extravagant crockets are    almost the only features which but for this written date would at    first have confessed its lateness but on examination the figures    will be found as bad and spiritless as they are apparently archaic    and completely exhibiting the renaissance palsy of imagination     the general effect is however excellent the whole arrangement    having been borrowed from earlier work     the action of the statue of the madonna who extends her robe to    shelter a group of diminutive figures representative of the society    for whose house the sculpture was executed may be also seen in most    of the later venetian figures of the virgin which occupy similar    situations the image of christ is placed in a medallion on her    breast thus fully though conventionally expressing the idea of    selfsupport which is so often partially indicated by the great    religious painters in their representations of the infant jesus   moisÈ church of st iii 124 notable as one of the basest examples    of the basest school of the renaissance it contains one important    picture namely christ washing the disciples feet by tintoret on    the left side of the chapel north of the choir this picture has been    originally dark is now much fadedin parts i believe altogether    destroyedand is hung in the worst light of a chapel where on a    sunny day at noon one could not easily read without a candle i    cannot therefore give much information respecting it but it is    certainly one of the least successful of the painters works and both    careless and unsatisfactory in its composition as well as its color    one circumstance is noticeable as in a considerable degree detracting    from the interest of most of tintorets representations of our saviour    with his disciples he never loses sight of the fact that all were    poor and the latter ignorant and while he never paints a senator or    a saint once thoroughly canonized except as a gentleman he is very    careful to paint the apostles in their living intercourse with the    saviour in such a manner that the spectator may see in an instant as    the pharisee did of old that they were unlearned and ignorant men    and whenever we find them in a room it is always such a one as would    be inhabited by the lower classes there seems some violation of this    practice in the dais or flight of steps at the top of which the    saviour is placed in the present picture but we are quickly reminded    that the guests chamber or upper room ready prepared was not likely    to have been in a palace by the humble furniture upon the floor    consisting of a tub with a copper saucepan in it a coffeepot and a    pair of bellows curiously associated with a symbolic cup with a    wafer which however is in an injured part of the canvas and may    have been added by the priests i am totally unable to state what the    background of the picture is or has been and the only point farther    to be noted about it is the solemnity which in spite of the familiar    and homely circumstances above noticed the painter has given to the    scene by placing the saviour in the act of washing the feet of    peter at the top of a circle of steps on which the other apostles    kneel in adoration and astonishment   moro palazzo see othello   morosini palazzo near the ponte dell ospedaletto at san giovannie    paolo outside it is not interesting though the gateway shows remains    of brickwork of the thirteenth century its interior court is    singularly beautiful the staircase of early fourteenth century gothic    has originally been superb and the window in the angle above is the    most perfect that i know in venice of the kind the lightly sculptured    coronet is exquisitely introduced at the top of its spiral shaft     this palace still belongs to the morosini family to whose present    representative the count carlo morosini the reader is indebted for    the note on the character of his ancestors above iii 213

palace though less impressive in effect than the casa foscari or casa    bernardo it is of purer architecture than either and quite unique in    the delicacy of the form of the cusps in the central group of windows    which are shaped like broad scimitars the upper foil of the windows    being very small if the traveller will compare these windows with    the neighboring traceries of the ducal

worship of the golden calf the presentation of the virgin and    martyrdom of st agnes the first two are among his largest and    mightiest works but grievously injured by damp and neglect and    unless the traveller is accustomed to decipher the thoughts in a    picture patiently he need not hope to derive any pleasure from them    but no pictures will better reward a resolute study the following    account of the last judgment given in the second volume of modern    painters will be useful in enabling the traveller to enter into the    meaning of the picture but its real power is only to be felt by    patient examination of it     by tintoret only has this unimaginable event the last judgment been    grappled with in its verity not typically nor symbolically but as    they may see it who shall not sleep but be changed only one    traditional circumstance he has received with dante and michael    angelo the boat of the condemned but the impetuosity of his mind    bursts out even in the adoption of this image he has not stopped at    the scowling ferryman of the one nor at the sweeping blow and demon    dragging of the other but seized hylas like by the limbs and    tearing up the earth in his agony the victim is dashed into his    destruction nor is it the sluggish lethe nor the fiery lake that    bears the cursed vessel but the oceans of the earth and the waters of    the firmament gathered into one white ghastly cataract the river of    the wrath of god roaring down into the gulf where the world has    melted with its fervent heat choked with the ruins of nations and    the limbs of its corpses tossed out of its whirling like    waterwheels batlike out of the holes and caverns and shadows of    the earth the bones gather and the clay heaps heave rattling and    adhering into halfkneaded anatomies that crawl and startle and    struggle up among the putrid weeds with the clay clinging to their    clotted hair and their heavy eyes sealed by the earth darkness yet    like his of old who went his way unseeing to the siloam pool shaking    off one by one the dreams of the prisonhouse hardly hearing the    clangor of the trumpets of the armies of god blinded yet more as    they awake by the white light of the new heaven until the great    vortex of the four winds bears up their bodies to the judgment seat    the firmament is all full of them a very dust of human souls that    drifts and floats and falls into the interminable inevitable light    the bright clouds are darkened with them as with thick snow currents    of atom life in the arteries of heaven now soaring up slowly and    higher and higher still till the eye and the thought can follow no    farther borne up wingless by their inward faith and by the angel    powers invisible now hurled in countless drifts of horror before the    breath of their condemnation     note in the opposite picture the way the clouds are wrapped about in    the distant sinai     the figure of the little madonna in the presentation should be    compared with titians in his picture of the same subject in the    academy i prefer tintorets infinitely and note how much finer is    the feeling with which tintoret has relieved the glory round her head    against the pure sky than that which influenced titian in encumbering    his distance with architecture     the martyrdom of st

circumstance    which gives peculiar firmness to the figure of the angel and    associates itself with the general expression of strength in the    whole building namely that the sole of the advanced foot is set    perfectly level as if placed on the ground instead of being thrown    back behind like a herons as in most modern figures of this kind     the sculptures themselves are not good but

church of st notable only for the most interesting pictures by    tintoret which it contains namely     1 san rocco before the pope on the left of the door as we enter    a delightful picture in his best manner but not much labored and    like several other pictures in this church it seems to me to have    been executed at some period of the painters life when he was either    in ill health or else had got into a mechanical way of painting from    having made too little reference to nature for a long time there is    something stiff and forced in the white draperies on both sides and a    general character about the whole which i can feel better than i can    describe but which if i had been the painters physician would have    immediately caused me to order him to shut up his paintingroom and    take a voyage to the levant and back again the figure of the pope    is however extremely beautiful and is not unworthy in its jewelled    magnificence here dark against the sky of comparison with the figure    of the high priest in the presentation in the scuola di san rocco     2 annunciation on the other side of the door on entering a    most disagreeable and dead picture having all the faults of the age    and none of the merits of the painter it must be a matter of future    investigation to me what could cause the fall of his mind from a    conception so great and so fiery as that of the annunciation in the    scuola di san rocco to this miserable reprint of an idea worn out    centuries before one of the most inconceivable things in it    considered as the work of tintoret is that where the angels robe    drifts away behind his limb one cannot tell by the character of the    outline or by the tones of the color whether the cloud comes in    before the robe or whether the robe cuts upon the cloud the virgin    is uglier than that of the scuola and not half so real and the    draperies are crumpled in the most commonplace and ignoble folds it    is a picture well worth study as an example of the extent to which    the greatest mind may be betrayed by the abuse of its powers and the    neglect of its proper food in the study of nature     3 pool of bethesda on the right side of the church in its    centre the lowest of the two pictures which occupy the wall a noble    work but eminently disagreeable as must be all pictures of this    subject and with the same character in it of undefinable want which    i have noticed in the two preceding works the main figure in it is    the cripple who has taken up his bed but the whole effect of this    action is lost by his not turning to christ but flinging it on his    shoulder like a triumphant porter with a huge load and the corrupt    renaissance architecture among which the figures are crowded is both    ugly in itself and much too small for them it is worth noticing for    the benefit of persons who find fault with the perspective of the    preraphaelites that the perspective of the brackets beneath these    pillars is utterly absurd and that in fine the presence or absence    of perspective has nothing to do with the merits of a great picture    not that the perspective of the preraphaelites is false in any case    that i have examined the objection being just as untenable as it is    ridiculous     4 san rocco in the desert above the lastnamed picture a single    recumbent figure in a not very interesting landscape deserving less    attention than a picture of st martin just opposite to ita noble    and knightly figure on horseback by pordenone to which i cannot pay a    greater compliment than by saying that i was a considerable time in    doubt whether or not it was another tintoret     5 san rocco in the hospital on the righthand side of the altar    there are four vast pictures by tintoret in the dark choir of this    church not only important by their size each being some twentyfive    feet long by ten feet high but also elaborate compositions and    remarkable one for its extraordinary landscape and the other as the    most studied picture in which the painter has introduced horses in    violent action in order to show what waste of human mind there is in    these dark churches of venice it is worth recording that as i was    examining these pictures there came in a party of eighteen german    tourists not hurried nor jesting among themselves as large parties    often do but patiently submitting to their cicerone and evidently    desirous of doing their duty as intelligent travellers they sat down    for a long time on the benches of the nave looked a little at the    pool of bethesda walked up into the choir and there heard a lecture    of considerable length from their valetdeplace upon some subject    connected with the altar itself which being in german i did not    understand they then turned and went slowly out of the church not    one of the whole eighteen ever giving a single glance to any of the    four tintorets and only one of them as far as i saw even raising    his eyes to the walls on which they hung and immediately withdrawing    them with a jaded and nonchalant expression easily interpretable    into nothing but old black pictures the two tintorets above    noticed at the end of the church were passed also without a glance    and this neglect is not because the pictures have nothing in them    capable of arresting the popular mind but simply because they are    totally in the dark or confused among easier and more prominent    objects of attention this picture which i have called st rocco in    the hospital shows him i suppose in his general ministrations at    such places and is one of the usual representations of a disgusting    subject from which neither orcagna nor tintoret seems ever to have    shrunk it is a very noble picture carefully composed and highly    wrought but to me gives no pleasure first on account of its    subject secondly on account of its dull brown tone all overit    being impossible or nearly so in such a scene and at all events    inconsistent with its feeling to introduce vivid color of any kind    so it is a brown study of diseased limbs in a close room     6 cattle piece above the picture last described i can give no    other name to this picture whose subject i can neither guess nor    discover the picture being in the dark and the guidebooks leaving    me in the same position all i can make out of it is that there is a    noble landscape with cattle and figures it seems to me the best    landscape of tintorets in venice except the flight into egypt and    is even still more interesting from its savage character the    principal trees being pines something like titians in his st    francis receiving the stigmata and chestnuts on the slopes and in    the hollows of the hills the animals also seem firstrate but it is    too high too much faded and too much in the dark to be made out it    seems never to have been rich in color rather cool and grey and very    full of light     7 finding of body of san rocco on the lefthand side of the    altar an elaborate but somewhat confused picture with a flying    angel in a blue drapery but it seemed to me altogether uninteresting    or perhaps requiring more study than i was able to give it     8 san rocco in campo d armata so this picture is called by the    sacristan i could see no san rocco in it nothing but a wild group of    horses and warriors in the most magnificent confusion of fall and    flight ever painted by man they seem all dashed different ways as if    by a whirlwind and a whirlwind there must be or a thunderbolt    behind them for a huge tree is torn up and hurled into the air beyond    the central figure as if it were a shivered lance two of the horses    meet in the midst as if in a tournament but in madness of fear not    in hostility on the horse to the right is a standardbearer who    stoops as from some foe behind him with the lance laid across his    saddlebow level and the flag stretched out behind him as he flies    like the sail of a ship drifting from its mast the central horseman    who meets the shock of storm or enemy whatever it be is hurled    backwards from his seat like a stone from a sling and this figure    with the shattered tree trunk behind it is the most noble part of the    picture there is another grand horse on the right however also in    full action two gigantic figures on foot on the left meant to be    nearer than the others would it seems to me have injured the    picture had they been clearly visible but time has reduced them to    perfect subordination    rocco scuola di san bases of i 291 431 soffit ornaments of i    337 an interesting building of the early renaissance 1517 passing    into roman renaissance the wreaths of leafage about its shafts are    wonderfully delicate and fine though misplaced     as regards the pictures which it contains it is one of the three most    precious buildings in italy buildings i mean consistently decorated    with a series of paintings at the time of their erection and still    exhibiting that series in its original order i suppose there can be    little question but that the three most important edifices of this    kind in italy are the sistine chapel the campo santo of pisa and the    scuola di san rocco at venice the first is painted by michael angelo    the second by orcagna benozzo gozzoli pietro laurati and several    other men whose works are as rare as they are precious and the third    by tintoret     whatever the traveller may miss in venice he should therefore give    unembarrassed attention and unbroken time to the scuola di san rocco    and i shall accordingly number the pictures and note in them one    by one what seemed to me most worthy of observation     there are sixtytwo in all but eight of these are merely of children    or childrens heads and two of unimportant figures the number of    valuable pictures is fiftytwo arranged on the walls and ceilings of    three rooms so badly lighted in consequence of the admirable    arrangements of the renaissance architect that it is only in the    early morning that some of the pictures can be seen at all nor can    they ever be seen but imperfectly they were all painted however for    their places in the dark and as compared with tintorets other    works are therefore for the most part nothing more than vast    sketches made to produce under a certain degree of shadow the    effect of finished pictures their treatment is thus to be considered    as a kind of scenepainting differing from ordinary scenepainting    only in this that the effect aimed at is not that of a natural    scene but a perfect picture they differ in this respect from all    other existing works for there is not as far as i know any other    instance in which a great master has consented to work for a room    plunged into almost total obscurity it is probable that none but    tintoret would have undertaken the task and most fortunate that he    was forced to it for in this magnificent scenepainting we have of    course more wonderful examples both of his handling and knowledge    of effect than could ever have been exhibited in finished pictures    while the necessity of doing much with few strokes keeps his mind so    completely on the stretch throughout the work while yet the velocity    of production prevented his being wearied that no other series of    his works exhibits powers so exalted on the other hand owing to the    velocity and coarseness of the painting it is more liable to injury    through drought or damp and as the walls have been for years    continually running down with rain and what little sun gets into the    place contrives to fall all day right on one or other of the pictures    they are nothing but wrecks of what they were and the ruins of    paintings originally coarse are not likely ever to be attractive to    the public mind twenty or thirty years ago they were taken down to be    retouched but the man to whom the task was committed providentially    died and only one of them was spoiled i have found traces of his    work upon another but not to an extent very seriously destructive    the rest of the sixtytwo or at any rate all that are in the upper    room appear entirely intact     although as compared with his other works they are all very scenic    in execution there are great differences in their degrees of finish    and curiously enough some on the ceilings and others in the darkest    places in the lower room are very nearly finished pictures while the    agony in the garden which is in one of the best lights in the upper    room appears to have been painted in a couple of hours with a broom    for a brush     for the travellers greater convenience i shall give a rude plan of    the arrangement and list of the subjects of each group of pictures    before examining them in detail     first group on the walls of the room on the ground floor     illustration        1 annunciation                5 the magdalen       2 adoration of magi           6 st mary of egypt       3 flight into egypt           7 circumcision       4 massacre of innocents       8 assumption of virgin        at the turn of the stairs leading to the upper room       9 visitation     1 the annunciation this which first strikes the eye is a very    just representative of the whole group the execution being carried to    the utmost limits of boldness consistent with completion it is a    wellknown picture and need not therefore be specially described but    one or two points in it require notice the face of the virgin is very    disagreeable to the spectator from below giving the idea of a woman    about thirty who had never been handsome if the face is untouched    it is the only instance i have ever seen of tintorets failing in an    intended effect for when seen near the face is comely and youthful    and expresses only surprise instead of the pain and fear of which it    bears the aspect in the distance i could not get near enough to see    whether it had been retouched it looks like tintorets work though    rather hard but as there are unquestionable marks in the retouching    of this picture it is possible that some slight restoration of lines    supposed to be faded entirely alter the distant expression of the    face one of the evident pieces of repainting is the scarlet of the    madonnas lap which is heavy and lifeless a far more injurious one    is the strip of sky seen through the doorway by which the angel    enters which has originally been of the deep golden color of the    distance on the left and which the blundering restorer has daubed    over with whitish blue so that it looks like a bit of the wall    luckily he has not touched the outlines of the angels black wings on    which the whole expression of the picture depends this angel and the    group of small cherubs above form a great swinging chain of which the    dove representing the holy spirit forms the bend the angels in their    flight seem to be attached to this as the train of fire is to a    rocket all of them appearing to have swooped down with the swiftness    of a falling star     2 adoration of the magi the most finished picture in the scuola    except the crucifixion and perhaps the most delightful of the    whole it unites every source of pleasure that a picture can possess    the highest elevation of principal subject mixed with the lowest    detail of picturesque incident the dignity of the highest ranks of    men opposed to the simplicity of the lowest the quietness and    serenity of an incident in cottage life contrasted with the    turbulence of troops of horsemen and the spiritual power of angels    the placing of the two doves as principal points of light in the front    of the picture in order to remind the spectator of the poverty of the    mother whose child is receiving the offerings and adoration of three    monarchs is one of tintorets master touches the whole scene    indeed is conceived in his happiest manner nothing can be at once    more humble or more dignified than the bearing of the kings and there    is a sweet reality given to the whole incident by the madonnas    stooping forward and lifting her hand in admiration of the vase of    gold which has been set before the christ though she does so with    such gentleness and quietness that her dignity is not in the least    injured by the simplicity of the action as if to illustrate the means    by which the wise men were brought from the east the whole picture is    nothing but a large star of which christ is the centre all the    figures even the timbers of the roof radiate from the small bright    figure on which the countenances of the flying angels are bent the    star itself gleaming through the timbers above being quite    subordinate the composition would almost be too artificial were it    not broken by the luminous distance where the troop of horsemen are    waiting for the kings these with a dog running at full speed at    once interrupt the symmetry of the lines and form a point of relief    from the over concentration of all the rest of the action     3 flight into egypt one of the principal figures here is the    donkey i have never seen any of the nobler animalslion or leopard    or horse or dragonmade so sublime as this quiet head of the    domestic ass chiefly owing to the grand motion in the nostril and    writhing in the ears the space of the picture is chiefly occupied by    lovely landscape and the madonna and st joseph are pacing their way    along a shady path upon the banks of a river at the side of the    picture i had not any conception until i got near how much pains    had been taken with the virgins head its expression is as sweet and    as intense as that of any of raffaelles its reality far greater the    painter seems to have intended that everything should be subordinate    to the beauty of this single head and the work is a wonderful proof    of the way in which a vast field of canvas may be made conducive to    the interest of a single figure this is partly accomplished by    slightness of painting so that on close examination while there is    everything to astonish in the masterly handling and purpose there is    not much perfect or very delightful painting in fact the two figures    are treated like the living figures in a scene at the theatre and    finished to perfection while the landscape is painted as hastily as    the scenes and with the same kind of opaque size color it has    however suffered as much as any of the series and it is hardly fair    to judge of its tones and colors in its present state     4 massacre of the innocents the following account of this picture    given in modern painters may be useful to the traveller and is    therefore here repeated i have before alluded to the painfulness of    raffaelles treatment of the massacre of the innocents fuseli affirms    of it that in dramatic gradation he disclosed all the mother    through every image of pity and terror if this be so i think the    philosophical spirit has prevailed over the imaginative the    imagination never errs it sees all that is and all the relations    and bearings of it but it would not have confused the mortal frenzy    of maternal terror with various development of maternal character    fear rage and agony at their utmost pitch sweep away all    character humanity itself would be lost in maternity the woman would    become the mere personification of animal fury or fear for this    reason all the ordinary representations of this subject are i think    false and cold the artist has not heard the shrieks nor mingled with    the fugitives he has sat down in his study to convulse features    methodically and philosophize over insanity not so tintoret    knowing or feeling that the expression of the human face was in    such circumstances not to be rendered and that the effort could only    end in an ugly falsehood he denies himself all aid from the features    he feels that if he is to place himself or us in the midst of that    maddened multitude there can be no time allowed for watching    expression still less does he depend on details of murder or    ghastliness of death there is no blood no stabbing or cutting but    there is an awful substitute for these in the chiaroscuro the scene    is the outer vestibule of a palace the slippery marble floor is    fearfully barred across by sanguine shadows so that our eyes seem to    become bloodshot and strained with strange horror and deadly vision a    lake of life before them like the burning seen of the doomed moabite    on the water that came by the way of edom a huge flight of stairs    without parapet descends on the left down this rush a crowd of women    mixed with the murderers the child in the arms of one has been seized    by the limbs she hurls herself over the edge and falls head    downmost dragging the child out of the grasp by her weightshe    will be dashed dead in a secondclose to us is the great struggle a    heap of the mothers entangled in one mortal writhe with each other    and the swords one of the murderers dashed down and crushed beneath    them the sword of another caught by the blade and dragged at by a    womans naked hand the youngest and fairest of the women her child    just torn away from a death grasp and clasped to her breast with the    grip of a steel vice falls backwards helpless over the heap right    on the sword points all knit together and hurled down in one    hopeless frenzied furious abandonment of body and soul in the    effort to save far back at the bottom of the stairs there is    something in the shadow like a heap of clothes it is a woman sitting    quietquite quietstill as any stone she looks down steadfastly    on her dead child laid along on the floor before her and her hand is    pressed softly upon her brow     i have nothing to add to the above description of this picture except    that i believe there may have been some change in the color of the    shadow that crosses the pavement the chequers of the pavements are    in the light golden white and pale grey in the shadow red and dark    grey the white in the sunshine becoming red in the shadow i formerly    supposed that this was meant to give greater horror to the scene and    it is very like tintoret if it be so but there is a strangeness and    discordance in it which makes me suspect the colors may have changed     5 the magdalen this and the picture opposite to it st mary of    egypt have been painted to fill up narrow spaces between the windows    which were not large enough to receive compositions and yet in which    single figures would have looked awkwardly thrust into the corner    tintoret has made these spaces as large as possible by filling them    with landscapes which are rendered interesting by the introduction of    single figures of very small size he has not however considered his    task of making a small piece of wainscot look like a large one worth    the stretch of his powers and has painted these two landscapes just    as carelessly and as fast as an upholsterers journeyman finishing a    room at a railroad hotel the color is for the most part opaque and    dashed or scrawled on in the manner of a scenepainter and as during    the whole morning the sun shines upon the one picture and during the    afternoon upon the other hues which were originally thin and    imperfect are now dried in many places into mere dirt upon the    canvas with all these drawbacks the pictures are of very high    interest for although as i said hastily and carelessly they are    not languidly painted on the contrary he has been in his hottest and    grandest temper and in this first one magdalen the laurel tree    with its leaves driven hither and thither among flakes of fiery cloud    has been probably one of the greatest achievements that his hand    performed in landscape its roots are entangled in underwood of which    every leaf seems to be articulated yet all is as wild as if it had    grown there instead of having been painted there has been a mountain    distance too and a sky of stormy light of which i infinitely regret    the loss for though its masses of light are still discernible its    variety of hue is all sunk into a withered brown there is a curious    piece of execution in the striking of the light upon a brook which    runs under the roots of the laurel in the foreground these roots are    traced in shadow against the bright surface of the water another    painter would have drawn the light first and drawn the dark roots    over it tintoret has laid in a brown ground which he has left for the    roots and painted the water through their interstices with a few    mighty rolls of his brush laden with white     6 st mary of egypt this picture differs but little in the plan    from the one opposite except that st mary has her back towards us    and the magdalen her face and that the tree on the other side of the    brook is a palm instead of a laurel the brook jordan is however    here much more important and the water painting is exceedingly fine    of all painters that i know in old times tintoret is the fondest of    running water there was a sort of sympathy between it and his own    impetuous spirit the rest of the landscape is not of much interest    except so far as it is pleasant to see trunks of trees drawn by single    strokes of the brush     7 the circumcision of christ the custode has some story about this    picture having been painted in imitation of paul veronese i much    doubt if tintoret ever imitated any body but this picture is the    expression of his perception of what veronese delighted in the    nobility that there may be in mere golden tissue and colored drapery    it is in fact a picture of the moral power of gold and color and    the chief use of the attendant priest is to support upon his shoulders    the crimson robe with its square tablets of black and gold and yet    nothing is withdrawn from the interest or dignity of the scene    tintoret has taken immense pains with the head of the highpriest i    know not any existing old mans head so exquisitely tender or so    noble in its lines he receives the infant christ in his arms    kneeling and looking down upon the child with infinite veneration and    love and the flashing of golden rays from its head is made the centre    of light and all interest the whole picture is like a golden charger    to receive the child the priests dress is held up behind him that    it may occupy larger space the tables and floor are covered with    chequerwork the shadows of the temple are filled with brazen lamps    and above all are hung masses of curtains whose crimson folds are    strewn over with golden flakes next to the adoration of the magi    this picture is the most laboriously finished of the scuola di san    rocco and it is unquestionably the highest existing type of the    sublimity which may be thrown into the treatment of accessaries of    dress and decoration     8 assumption of the virgin on the tablet or panel of stone which    forms the side of the tomb out of which the madonna rises is this    inscription in large letters rest antonius florian 1834 exactly    in proportion to a mans idiocy is always the size of the letters in    which he writes his name on the picture that he spoils the old    mosaicists in st marks have not in a single instance as far as i    know signed their names but the spectator who wishes to know who    destroyed the effect of the nave may see his name inscribed twice    over in letters half a foot high bartolomeo bozza i have never seen    tintorets name signed except in the great crucifixion but this    antony florian i have no doubt repainted the whole side of the tomb    that he might put his name on it the picture is of course ruined    wherever he touched it that is to say half over the circle of    cherubs in the sky is still pure and the design of the great painter    is palpable enough yet in the grand flight of the horizontal angel on    whom the madonna half leans as she ascends it has been a noble    picture and is a grievous loss but happily there are so many pure    ones that we need not spend time in gleaning treasures out of the    ruins of this     9 visitation a small picture painted in his very best manner    exquisite in its simplicity unrivalled in vigor well preserved and    as a piece of painting certainly one of the most precious in venice    of course it does not show any of his high inventive powers nor can a    picture of four middlesized figures be made a proper subject of    comparison with large canvases containing forty or fifty but it is    for this very reason painted with such perfect ease and yet with no    slackness either of affection or power that there is no picture that    i covet so much it is besides altogether free from the renaissance    taint of dramatic effect the gestures are as simple and natural as    giottos only expressed by grander lines such as none but tintoret    ever reached the draperies are dark relieved against a light sky    the horizon being excessively low and the outlines of the drapery so    severe that the intervals between the figures look like ravines    between great rocks and have all the sublimity of an alpine valley at    twilight this precious picture is hung about thirty feet above the    eye but by looking at it in a strong light it is discoverable that    the saint elizabeth is dressed in green and crimson the virgin in the    peculiar red which all great colorists delight ina sort of glowing    brickcolor or brownish scarlet opposed to rich golden brownish    black and both have white kerchiefs or drapery thrown over their    shoulders zacharias leans on his staff behind them in a black dress    with white sleeves the stroke of brilliant white light which    outlines the knee of saint elizabeth is a curious instance of the    habit of the painter to relieve his dark forms by a sort of halo of    more vivid light which until lately one would have been apt to    suppose a somewhat artificial and unjustifiable means of effect the    daguerreotype has shown what the naked eye never could that the    instinct of the great painter was true and that there is actually    such a sudden and sharp line of light round the edges of dark objects    relieved by luminous space     opposite this picture is a most precious titian the annunciation    full of grace and beauty i think the madonna one of the sweetest    figures he ever painted but if the traveller has entered at all into    the spirit of tintoret he will immediately feel the comparative    feebleness and conventionality of the titian note especially the mean    and petty folds of the angels drapery and compare them with the    draperies of the opposite picture the larger pictures at the sides of    the stairs by zanchi and negri are utterly worthless     illustration second group on the walls of the upper room        10 adoration of shepherds     17 resurrection of lazarus       11 baptism                    18 ascension       12 resurrection               19 pool of bethesda       13 agony in garden            20 temptation       14 last supper                21 st rocco       15 altar piece st rocco     22 st sebastian       16 miracle of loaves     10 the adoration of the shepherds this picture commences the    series of the upper room which as already noticed is painted with    far less care than that of the lower it is one of the painters    inconceivable caprices that the only canvases that are in good light    should be covered in this hasty manner while those in the dungeon    below and on the ceiling above are all highly labored it is    however just possible that the covering of these walls may have been    an afterthought when he had got tired of his work they are also    for the most part illustrative of a principle of which i am more and    more convinced every day that historical and figure pieces ought not    to be made vehicles for effects of light the light which is fit for a    historical picture is that tempered semisunshine of which in    general the works of titian are the best examples and of which the    picture we have just passed the visitation is a perfect example    from the hand of one greater than titian so also the three    crucifixions of san rocco san cassano and st john and paul the    adoration of the magi here and in general the finest works of    the master but tintoret was not a man to work in any formal or    systematic manner and exactly like turner we find him recording    every effect which nature herself displays still he seems to regard    the pictures which deviate from the great general principle of    colorists rather as tours de force than as sources of pleasure and    i do not think there is any instance of his having worked out one of    these tricky pictures with thorough affection except only in the case    of the marriage of cana by tricky pictures i mean those which    display light entering in different directions and attract the eye to    the effects rather than to the figure which displays them of this    treatment we have already had a marvellous instance in the    candlelight picture of the last supper in san giorgio maggiore    this adoration of the shepherds has probably been nearly as    wonderful when first painted the madonna is seated on a kind of    hammock floor made of rope netting covered with straw it divides the    picture into two stories of which the uppermost contains the virgin    with two women who are adoring christ and shows light entering from    above through the loose timbers of the roof of the stable as well as    through the bars of a square window the lower division shows this    light falling behind the netting upon the stable floor occupied by a    cock and a cow and against this light are relieved the figures of the    shepherds for the most part in demitint but with flakes of more    vigorous sunshine falling here and there upon them from above the    optical illusion has originally been as perfect as one of hunts best    interiors but it is most curious that no part of the work seems to    have been taken any pleasure in by the painter it is all by his hand    but it looks as if he had been bent only on getting over the ground    it is literally a piece of scenepainting and is exactly what we    might fancy tintoret to have done had he been forced to paint scenes    at a small theatre at a shilling a day i cannot think that the whole    canvas though fourteen feet high and ten wide or thereabouts could    have taken him more than a couple of days to finish and it is very    noticeable that exactly in proportion to the brilliant effects of    light is the coarseness of the execution for the figures of the    madonna and of the women above which are not in any strong effect    are painted with some care while the shepherds and the cow are alike    slovenly and the latter which is in full sunshine is recognizable    for a cow more by its size and that of its horns than by any care    given to its form it is interesting to contrast this slovenly and    mean sketch with the asss head in the flight into egypt on which    the painter exerted his full power as an effect of light however    the work is of course most interesting one point in the treatment    is especially noticeable there is a peacock in the rack beyond the    cow and under other circumstances one cannot doubt that tintoret    would have liked a peacock in full color and would have painted it    green and blue with great satisfaction it is sacrificed to the light    however and is painted in warm grey with a dim eye or two in the    tail this process is exactly analogous to turners taking the colors    out of the flags of his ships in the gosport another striking point    is the litter with which the whole picture is filled in order more to    confuse the eye there is straw sticking from the roof straw all over    the hammock floor and straw struggling hither and thither all over    the floor itself and to add to the confusion the glory around the    head of the infant instead of being united and serene is broken into    little bits and is like a glory of chopped straw but the most    curious thing after all is the want of delight in any of the    principal figures and the comparative meanness and commonplaceness of    even the folds of the drapery it seems as if tintoret had determined    to make the shepherds as uninteresting as possible but one does not    see why their very clothes should be ill painted and their    disposition unpicturesque i believe however though it never struck    me until i had examined this picture that this is one of the    painters fixed principles he does not with german sentimentality    make shepherds and peasants graceful or sublime but he purposely    vulgarizes them not by making their actions or their faces boorish or    disagreeable but rather by painting them ill and composing their    draperies tamely as far as i recollect at present the principle is    universal with him exactly in proportion to the dignity of character    is the beauty of the painting he will not put out his strength upon    any man belonging to the lower classes and in order to know what the    painter is one must see him at work on a king a senator or a    saint the curious connexion of this with the aristocratic tendencies    of the venetian nation when we remember that tintoret was the    greatest man whom that nation produced may become very interesting    if followed out i forgot to note that though the peacock is painted    with great regardlessness of color there is a feature in it which no    common painter would have observedthe peculiar flatness of the    back and undulation of the shoulders the birds body is all there    though its feathers are a good deal neglected and the same thing is    noticeable in a cock who is pecking among the straw near the    spectator though in other respects a shabby cock enough the fact is    i believe he had made his shepherds so commonplace that he dare not    paint his animals well otherwise one would have looked at nothing in    the picture but the peacock cock and cow i cannot tell what the    shepherds are offering they look like milk bowls but they are    awkwardly held up with such twistings of body as would have certainly    spilt the milk a woman in front has a basket of eggs but this i    imagine to be merely to keep up the rustic character of the scene and    not part of the shepherds offerings     11 baptism there is more of the true picture quality in this work    than in the former one but still very little appearance of enjoyment    or care the color is for the most part grey and uninteresting and    the figures are thin and meagre in form and slightly painted so much    so that of the nineteen figures in the distance about a dozen are    hardly worth calling figures and the rest are so sketched and    flourished in that one can hardly tell which is which there is one    point about it very interesting to a landscape painter the river is    seen far into the distance with a piece of copse bordering it the    sky beyond is dark but the water nevertheless receives a brilliant    reflection from some unseen rent in the clouds so brilliant that    when i was first at venice not being accustomed to tintorets slight    execution or to see pictures so much injured i took this piece of    water for a piece of sky the effect as tintoret has arranged it is    indeed somewhat unnatural but it is valuable as showing his    recognition of a principle unknown to half the historical painters of    the present daythat the reflection seen in the water is totally    different from the object seen above it and that it is very possible    to have a bright light in reflection where there appears nothing but    darkness to be reflected the clouds in the sky itself are round    heavy and lightless and in a great degree spoil what would otherwise    be a fine landscape distance behind the rocks on the right a single    head is seen with a collar on the shoulders it seems to be intended    for a portrait of some person connected with the picture     12 resurrection another of the effect of light pictures and not    a very striking one the best part of it being the two distant figures    of the maries seen in the dawn of the morning the conception of the    resurrection itself is characteristic of the worst points of tintoret    his impetuosity is here in the wrong place christ bursts out of the    rock like a thunderbolt and the angels themselves seem likely to be    crushed under the rent stones of the tomb had the figure of christ    been sublime this conception might have been accepted but on the    contrary it is weak mean and painful and the whole picture is    languidly or roughly painted except only the figtree at the top of    the rock which by a curious caprice is not only drawn in the    painters best manner but has golden ribs to all its leaves making    it look like one of the beautiful crossed or chequered patterns of    which he is so fond in his dresses the leaves themselves being a dark    olive brown     13 the agony in the garden i cannot at present understand the    order of these subjects but they may have been misplaced this of    all the san rocco pictures is the most hastily painted but it is    not like those we have been passing clodly painted it seems to    have been executed altogether with a hearthbroom and in a few hours    it is another of the effects and a very curious one the angel who    bears the cup to christ is surrounded by a red halo yet the light    which falls upon the shoulders of the sleeping disciples and upon the    leaves of the olivetrees is cool and silvery while the troop coming    up to seize christ are seen by torchlight judas who is the second    figure points to christ but turns his head away as he does so as    unable to look at him this is a noble touch the foliage is also    exceedingly fine though what kind of olivetree bears such leaves i    know not each of them being about the size of a mans hand if there    be any which bear such foliage their olives must be the size of    cocoanuts this however is true only of the underwood which is    perhaps not meant for olive there are some taller trees at the top    of the picture whose leaves are of a more natural size on closely    examining the figures of the troops on the left i find that the    distant ones are concealed all but the limbs by a sort of arch of    dark color which is now so injured that i cannot tell whether it was    foliage or ground i suppose it to have been a mass of close foliage    through which the troop is breaking its way judas rather showing them    the path than actually pointing to christ as it is written judas    who betrayed him knew the place st peter as the most zealous of    the three disciples the only one who was to endeavor to defend his    master is represented as awakening and turning his head toward the    troop while james and john are buried in profound slumber laid in    magnificent languor among the leaves the picture is singularly    impressive when seen far enough off as an image of thick forest    gloom amidst the rich and tender foliage of the south the leaves    however tossing as in disturbed night air and the flickering of the    torches and of the branches contrasted with the steady flame which    from the angels presence is spread over the robes of the disciples    the strangest feature in the whole is that the christ also is    represented as sleeping the angel seems to appear to him in a dream     14 the last supper a most unsatisfactory picture i think about    the worst i know of tintorets where there is no appearance of    retouching he always makes the disciples in this scene too vulgar    they are here not only vulgar but diminutive and christ is at the    end of the table the smallest figure of them all the principal    figures are two mendicants sitting on steps in front a kind of    supporters but i suppose intended to be waiting for the fragments a    dog in still more earnest expectation is watching the movements of    the disciples who are talking together judas having just gone out    christ is represented as giving what one at first supposes is the sop    to judas but as the disciple who received it has a glory and there    are only eleven at table it is evidently the sacramental bread the    room in which they are assembled is a sort of large kitchen and the    host is seen employed at a dresser in the background this picture has    not only been originally poor but is one of those exposed all day to    the sun and is dried into mere dusty canvas where there was once    blue there is now nothing     15 saint rocco in glory one of the worst order of tintorets with    apparent smoothness and finish yet languidly painted as if in    illness or fatigue very dark and heavy in tone also its figures for    the most part of an awkward middle size about five feet high and    very uninteresting st rocco ascends to heaven looking down upon a    crowd of poor and sick persons who are blessing and adoring him one    of these kneeling at the bottom is very nearly a repetition though    a careless and indolent one of that of st stephen in st giorgio    maggiore and of the central figure in the paradise of the ducal    palace it is a kind of lay figure of which he seems to have been    fond its clasped hands are here shockingly paintedi should think    unfinished it forms the only important light at the bottom relieved    on a dark ground at the top of the picture the figure of st rocco    is seen in shadow against the light of the sky and all the rest is in    confused shadow the commonplaceness of this composition is curiously    connected with the languor of thought and touch throughout the work     16 miracle of the loaves hardly anything but a fine piece of    landscape is here left it is more exposed to the sun than any other    picture in the room and its draperies having been in great part    painted in blue are now mere patches of the color of starch the    scene is also very imperfectly conceived the twentyone figures    including christ and his disciples very ill represent a crowd of    seven thousand still less is the marvel of the miracle expressed by    perfect ease and rest of the reclining figures in the foreground who    do not so much as look surprised considered merely as reclining    figures and as pieces of effect in half light they have once been    fine the landscape which represents the slope of a woody hill has a    very grand and faraway look behind it is a great space of streaky    sky almost prismatic in color rosy and golden clouds covering up its    blue and some fine vigorous trees thrown against it painted in about    ten minutes each however by curly touches of the brush and looking    rather more like seaweed than foliage     17 resurrection of lazarus very strangely and not impressively    conceived christ is half reclining half sitting at the bottom of    the picture while lazarus is disencumbered of his graveclothes at    the top of it the scene being the side of a rocky hill and the mouth    of the tomb probably once visible in the shadow on the left but all    that is now discernible is a man having his limbs unbound as if    christ were merely ordering a prisoner to be loosed there appears    neither awe nor agitation nor even much astonishment in any of the    figures of the group but the picture is more vigorous than any of the    three last mentioned and the upper part of it is quite worthy of the    master especially its noble figtree and laurel which he has    painted in one of his usual fits of caprice as carefully as that in    the resurrection of christ opposite perhaps he has some meaning in    this he may have been thinking of the verse behold the figtree    and all the trees when they now shoot forth c in the present    instance the leaves are dark only and have no golden veins the    uppermost figures also come dark against the sky and would form a    precipitous mass like a piece of the rock itself but that they are    broken in upon by one of the limbs of lazarus bandaged and in full    light which to my feeling sadly injures the picture both as a    disagreeable object and a light in the wrong place the grass and    weeds are throughout carefully painted but the lower figures are of    little interest and the face of the christ a grievous failure     18 the ascension i have always admired this picture though it is    very slight and thin in execution and cold in color but it is    remarkable for its thorough effect of open air and for the sense of    motion and clashing in the wings of the angels which sustain the    christ they owe this effect a good deal to the manner in which they    are set edge on all seem like swordblades cutting the air it is    the most curious in conception of all the pictures in the scuola for    it represents beneath the ascension a kind of epitome of what took    place before the ascension in the distance are two apostles walking    meant i suppose for the two going to emmaus nearer are a group    round a table to remind us of christ appearing to them as they sat at    meat and in the foreground is a single reclining figure of i    suppose st peter because we are told that he was seen of cephas    then of the twelve but this interpretation is doubtful for why    should not the vision by the lake of tiberias be expressed also and    the strange thing of all is the scene for christ ascended from the    mount of olives but the disciples are walking and the table is set    in a little marshy and grassy valley like some of the bits near    maison neuve on the jura with a brook running through it so    capitally expressed that i believe it is this which makes me so fond    of the picture the reflections are as scientific in the diminution    in the image of large masses of bank above as any of turners and    the marshy and reedy ground looks as if one would sink into it but    what all this has to do with the ascension i cannot see the figure of    christ is not undignified but by no means either interesting or    sublime     19 pool of bethesda i have no doubt the principal figures have    been repainted but as the colors are faded and the subject    disgusting i have not paid this picture sufficient attention to say    how far the injury extends nor need any one spend time upon it    unless after having first examined all the other tintorets in venice    all the great italian painters appear insensible to the feeling of    disgust at disease but this study of the population of an hospital is    without any points of contrast and i wish tintoret had not    condescended to paint it this and the six preceding paintings have    all been uninterestingi believe chiefly owing to the observance in    them of sir joshuas rule for the heroic that drapery is to be mere    drapery and not silk nor satin nor brocade however wise such a    rule may be when applied to works of the purest religious art it is    anything but wise as respects works of color tintoret is never quite    himself unless he has fur or velvet or rich stuff of one sort or the    other or jewels or armor or something that he can put play of color    into among his figures and not dead folds of linseywoolsey and i    believe that even the best pictures of raffaelle and angelico are not    a little helped by their hems of robes jewelled crowns priests    copes and so on and the pictures that have nothing of this kind in    them as for instance the transfiguration are to my mind not a    little dull     20 temptation this picture singularly illustrates what has just    been observed it owes great part of its effect to the lustre of the    jewels in the armlet of the evil angel and to the beautiful colors of    his wings these are slight accessaries apparently but they enhance    the value of all the rest and they have evidently been enjoyed by the    painter the armlet is seen by reflected light its stones shining by    inward lustre this occult fire being the only hint given of the real    character of the tempter who is otherways represented in the form of    a beautiful angel though the face is sensual we can hardly tell how    far it was intended to be therefore expressive of evil for tintorets    good angels have not always the purest features but there is a    peculiar subtlety in this telling of the story by so slight a    circumstance as the glare of the jewels in the darkness it is curious    to compare this imagination with that of the mosaics in st marks in    which satan is a black monster with horns and head and tail    complete the whole of the picture is powerfully and carefully    painted though very broadly it is a strong effect of light and    therefore as usual subdued in color the painting of the stones in    the foreground i have always thought and still think the best piece    of rock drawing before turner and the most amazing instance of    tintorets perceptiveness afforded by any of his pictures     21 st rocco three figures occupy the spandrils of the window    above this and the following picture painted merely in light and    shade two larger than life one rather smaller i believe these to be    by tintoret but as they are quite in the dark so that the execution    cannot be seen and very good designs of the kind have been furnished    by other masters i cannot answer for them the figure of st rocco    as well as its companion st sebastian is colored they occupy the    narrow intervals between the windows and are of course invisible    under ordinary circumstances by a great deal of straining of the    eyes and sheltering them with the hand from the light some little    idea of the design may be obtained the st rocco is a fine figure    though rather coarse but at all events worth as much light as would    enable us to see it     22 st sebastian this the companion figure is one of the finest    things in the whole room and assuredly the most majestic saint    sebastian in existence as far as mere humanity can be majestic for    there is no effort at any expression of angelic or saintly    resignation the effort is simply to realize the fact of the    martyrdom and it seems to me that this is done to an extent not even    attempted by any other painter i never saw a man die a violent death    and therefore cannot say whether this figure be true or not but it    gives the grandest and most intense impression of truth the figure is    dead and well it may be for there is one arrow through the forehead    and another through the heart but the eyes are open though glazed    and the body is rigid in the position in which it last stood the left    arm raised and the left limb advanced something in the attitude of a    soldier sustaining an attack under his shield while the dead eyes are    still turned in the direction from which the arrows came but the most    characteristic feature is the way these arrows are fixed in the    common martyrdoms of st sebastian they are stuck into him here and    there like pins as if they had been shot from a great distance and    had come faltering down entering the flesh but a little way and    rather bleeding the saint to death than mortally wounding him but    tintoret had no such ideas about archery he must have seen bows drawn    in battle like that of jehu when he smote jehoram between the    harness all the arrows in the saints body lie straight in the same    direction broadfeathered and strongshafted and sent apparently    with the force of thunderbolts every one of them has gone through him    like a lance two through the limbs one through the arm one through    the heart and the last has crashed through the forehead nailing the    head to the tree behind as if it had been dashed in by a    sledgehammer the face in spite of its ghastliness is beautiful    and has been serene and the light which enters first and glistens on    the plumes of the arrows dies softly away upon the curling hair and    mixes with the glory upon the forehead there is not a more remarkable    picture in venice and yet i do not suppose that one in a thousand of    the travellers who pass through the scuola so much as perceives there    is a picture in the place which it occupies     illustration third group on the roof of the upper room        23 moses striking the rock       29 elijah       24 plague of serpents            30 jonah       25 fall of manna                 31 joshua       26 jacobs dream                 32 sacrifice of isaac       27 ezekiels vision              33 elijah at the brook       28 fall of man                   34 paschal feast                  35 elisha feeding the people     23 moses striking the rock we now come to the series of pictures    upon which the painter concentrated the strength he had reserved for    the upper room and in some sort wisely for though it is not    pleasant to examine pictures on a ceiling they are at least    distinctly visible without straining the eyes against the light they    are carefully conceived and thoroughly well painted in proportion to    their distance from the eye this carefulness of thought is apparent    at a glance the moses striking the rock embraces the whole of the    seventeenth chapter of exodus and even something more for it is not    from that chapter but from parallel passages that we gather the facts    of the impatience of moses and the wrath of god at the waters of    meribah both which facts are shown by the leaping of the stream out    of the rock halfadozen ways at once forming a great arch over the    head of moses and by the partial veiling of the countenance of the    supreme being this latter is the most painful part of the whole    picture at least as it is seen from below and i believe that in some    repairs of the roof this head must have been destroyed and repainted    it is one of tintorets usual fine thoughts that the lower part of the    figure is veiled not merely by clouds but in a kind of watery    sphere showing the deity coming to the israelites at that particular    moment as the lord of the rivers and of the fountain of the waters    the whole figure as well as that of moses and the greater number of    those in the foreground is at once dark and warm black and red being    the prevailing colors while the distance is bright gold touched with    blue and seems to open into the picture like a break of blue sky    after rain how exquisite is this expression by mere color of the    main force of the fact represented that is to say joy and    refreshment after sorrow and scorching heat but when we examine of    what this distance consists we shall find still more cause for    admiration the blue in it is not the blue of sky it is obtained by    blue stripes upon white tents glowing in the sunshine and in front of    these tents is seen that great battle with amalek of which the account    is given in the remainder of the chapter and for which the israelites    received strength in the streams which ran out of the rock in horeb    considered merely as a picture the opposition of cool light to warm    shadow is one of the most remarkable pieces of color in the scuola    and the great mass of foliage which waves over the rocks on the left    appears to have been elaborated with his highest power and his most    sublime invention but this noble passage is much injured and now    hardly visible     24 plague of serpents the figures in the distance are remarkably    important in this picture moses himself being among them in fact    the whole scene is filled chiefly with middlesized figures in order    to increase the impression of space it is interesting to observe the    difference in the treatment of this subject by the three great    painters michael angelo rubens and tintoret the first two equal    to the latter in energy had less love of liberty they were fond of    binding their compositions into knots tintoret of scattering his far    and wide they all alike preserve the unity of composition but the    unity in the first two is obtained by binding and that of the last by    springing from one source and together with this feeling comes his    love of space which makes him less regard the rounding and form of    objects themselves than their relations of light and shade and    distance therefore rubens and michael angelo made the fiery serpents    huge boa constrictors and knotted the sufferers together with them    tintoret does not like to be so bound so he makes the serpents little    flying and fluttering monsters like lampreys with wings and the    children of israel instead of being thrown into convulsed and    writhing groups are scattered fainting in the fields far away in    the distance as usual tintorets conception while thoroughly    characteristic of himself is also truer to the words of scripture we    are told that the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they    bit the people we are not told that they crushed the people to    death and while thus the truest it is also the most terrific    conception m angelos would be terrific if one could believe in it    but our instinct tells us that boa constrictors do not come in armies    and we look upon the picture with as little emotion as upon the handle    of a vase or any other form worked out of serpents where there is no    probability of serpents actually occurring but there is a probability    in tintorets conception we feel that it is not impossible that there    should come up a swarm of these small winged reptiles and their    horror is not diminished by their smallness not that they have any of    the grotesque terribleness of german invention they might have been    made infinitely uglier with small pains but it is their    veritableness which makes them awful they have triangular heads    with sharp beaks or muzzle and short rather thick bodies with bony    processes down the back like those of sturgeons and small wings    spotted with orange and black and round glaring eyes not very large    but very ghastly with an intense delight in biting expressed in them    it is observable that the venetian painter has got his main idea of    them from the seahorses and small reptiles of the lagoons these    monsters are fluttering and writhing about everywhere fixing on    whatever they come near with their sharp venomous heads and they are    coiling about on the ground and all the shadows and thickets are full    of them so that there is no escape anywhere and in order to give    the idea of greater extent to the plague tintoret has not been    content with one horizon i have before mentioned the excessive    strangeness of this composition in having a cavern open in the right    of the foreground through which is seen another sky and another    horizon at the top of the picture the divine being is seen borne by    angels apparently passing over the congregation in wrath involved in    masses of dark clouds while behind an angel of mercy is descending    toward moses surrounded by a globe of white light this globe is    hardly seen from below it is not a common glory but a transparent    sphere like a bubble which not only envelopes the angel but crosses    the figure of moses throwing the upper part of it into a subdued pale    color as if it were crossed by a sunbeam tintoret is the only    painter who plays these tricks with transparent light the only man    who seems to have perceived the effects of sunbeams mists and    clouds in the far away atmosphere and to have used what he saw on    towers clouds or mountains to enhance the sublimity of his figures    the whole upper part of this picture is magnificent less with respect    to individual figures than for the drift of its clouds and    originality and complication of its light and shade it is something    like raffaelles vision of ezekiel but far finer it is difficult    to understand how any painter who could represent floating clouds so    nobly as he has done here could ever paint the odd round pillowy    masses which so often occur in his more carelessly designed sacred    subjects the lower figures are not so interesting and the whole is    painted with a view to effect from below and gains little by close    examination     25 fall of manna in none of these three large compositions has the    painter made the slightest effort at expression in the human    countenance everything is done by gesture and the faces of the    people who are drinking from the rock dying from the serpentbites    and eating the manna are all alike as calm as if nothing was    happening in addition to this as they are painted for distant    effect the heads are unsatisfactory and coarse when seen near and    perhaps in this last picture the more so and yet the story is    exquisitely told we have seen in the church of san giorgio maggiore    another example of his treatment of it where however the gathering    of manna is a subordinate employment but here it is principal now    observe we are told of the manna that it was found in the morning    that then there lay round about the camp a small round thing like the    hoarfrost and that when the sun waxed hot it melted tintoret has    endeavored therefore first of all to give the idea of coolness the    congregation are reposing in a soft green meadow surrounded by blue    hills and there are rich trees above them to the branches of one of    which is attached a great grey drapery to catch the manna as it comes    down in any other picture such a mass of drapery would assuredly have    had some vivid color but here it is grey the fields are cool frosty    green the mountains cold blue and to complete the expression and    meaning of all this there is a most important point to be noted in    the form of the deity seen above through an opening in the clouds    there are at least ten or twelve other pictures in which the form of    the supreme being occurs to be found in the scuola di san rocco    alone and in every one of these instances it is richly colored the    garments being generally red and blue but in this picture of the    manna the figure is snow white thus the painter endeavors to show    the deity as the giver of bread just as in the striking of the rock    we saw that he represented him as the lord of the rivers the    fountains and the waters there is one other very sweet incident at    the bottom of the picture four or five sheep instead of pasturing    turn their heads aside to catch the manna as it comes down or seem to    be licking it off each others fleeces the tree above to which the    drapery is tied is the most delicate and delightful piece of leafage    in all the scuola it has a large sharp leaf something like that of a    willow but five times the size     26 jacobs dream a picture which has good effect from below but    gains little when seen near it is an embarrassing one for any    painter because angels always look awkward going up and down stairs    one does not see the use of their wings tintoret has thrown them into    buoyant and various attitudes but has evidently not treated the    subject with delight and it is seen to all the more disadvantage    because just above the painting of the ascension in which the full    fresh power of the painter is developed one would think this latter    picture had been done just after a walk among hills for it is full of    the most delicate effects of transparent cloud more or less veiling    the faces and forms of the angels and covering with white light the    silvery sprays of the palms while the clouds in the jacobs dream    are the ordinary rotundities of the studio     27 ezekiels vision i suspect this has been repainted it is so    heavy and dead in color a fault however observable in many of the    small pictures on the ceiling and perhaps the natural result of the    fatigue of such a mind as tintorets a painter who threw such intense    energy into some of his works can hardly but have been languid in    others in a degree never experienced by the more tranquil minds of    less powerful workmen and when this languor overtook him whilst he    was at work on pictures where a certain space had to be covered by    mere force of arm this heaviness of color could hardly but have been    the consequence it shows itself chiefly in reds and other hot hues    many of the pictures in the ducal palace also displaying it in a    painful degree this ezekiels vision is however in some measure    worthy of the master in the wild and horrible energy with which the    skeletons are leaping up about the prophet but it might have been    less horrible and more sublime no attempt being made to represent the    space of the valley of dry bones and the whole canvas being occupied    only by eight figures of which five are half skeletons it it is    strange that in such a subject the prevailing hues should be red and    brown     28 fall of man the two canvases last named are the most    considerable in size upon the roof after the centre pieces we now    come to the smaller subjects which surround the striking the rock    of these this fall of man is the best and i should think it very    fine anywhere but in the scuola di san rocco there is a grand light    on the body of eve and the vegetation is remarkably rich but the    faces are coarse and the composition uninteresting i could not get    near enough to see what the grey object is upon which eve appears to    be sitting nor could i see any serpent it is made prominent in the    picture of the academy of this same subject so that i suppose it is    hidden in the darkness together with much detail which it would be    necessary to discover in order to judge the work justly     29 elijah  a prophet holding down his face which is covered    with his hand god is talking with him apparently in rebuke the    clothes on his breast are rent and the action of the figures might    suggest the idea of the scene between the deity and elijah at horeb    but there is no suggestion of the past magnificent sceneryof the    wind the earthquake or the fire so that the conjecture is good for    very little the painting is of small interest the faces are vulgar    and the draperies have too much vapid historical dignity to be    delightful     30 jonah the whale here occupies fully onehalf of the canvas    being correspondent in value with a landscape background his mouth is    as large as a cavern and yet unless the mass of red color in the    foreground be a piece of drapery his tongue is too large for it he    seems to have lifted jonah out upon it and not yet drawn it back so    that it forms a kind of crimson cushion for him to kneel upon in his    submission to the deity the head to which this vast tongue belongs is    sketched in somewhat loosely and there is little remarkable about it    except its size nor much in the figures though the submissiveness of    jonah is well given the great thought of michael angelo renders one    little charitable to any less imaginative treatment of this subject     31 joshua  this is a most interesting picture and it is a    shame that its subject is not made out for it is not a common one    the figure has a sword in its hand and looks up to a sky full of    fire out of which the form of the deity is stooping represented as    white and colorless on the other side of the picture there is seen    among the clouds a pillar apparently falling and there is a crowd at    the feet of the principal figure carrying spears unless this be    joshua at the fall of jericho i cannot tell what it means it is    painted with great vigor and worthy of a better place     32 sacrifice of isaac in conception it is one of the least worthy    of the master in the whole room the three figures being thrown into    violent attitudes as inexpressive as they are strained and    artificial it appears to have been vigorously painted but vulgarly    that is to say the light is concentrated upon the white beard and    upturned countenance of abraham as it would have been in one of the    dramatic effects of the french school the result being that the head    is very bright and very conspicuous and perhaps in some of the late    operations upon the roof recently washed and touched in consequence    every one who comes into the room is first invited to observe the    bella testa di abramo the only thing characteristic of tintoret is    the way in which the pieces of ragged wood are tossed hither and    thither in the pile upon which isaac is bound although this    scattering of the wood is inconsistent with the scriptural account of    abrahams deliberate procedure for we are told of him that he set    the wood in order but tintoret had probably not noticed this and    thought the tossing of the timber into the disordered heap more like    the act of the father in his agony     33 elijah at the brook cherith  i cannot tell if i have rightly    interpreted the meaning of this picture which merely represents a    noble figure couched upon the ground and an angel appearing to him    but i think that between the dark tree on the left and the recumbent    figure there is some appearance of a running stream at all events    there is of a mountainous and stony place the longer i study this    master the more i feel the strange likeness between him and turner    in our never knowing what subject it is that will stir him to    exertion we have lately had him treating jacobs dream ezekiels    vision abrahams sacrifice and jonahs prayer all of them subjects    on which the greatest painters have delighted to expend their    strength with coldness carelessness and evident absence of    delight and here on a sudden in a subject so indistinct that one    cannot be sure of its meaning and embracing only two figures a man    and an angel forth he starts in his full strength i believe he must    somewhere or another the day before have seen a kingfisher for this    picture seems entirely painted for the sake of the glorious downy    wings of the angelwhite clouded with blue as the birds head and    wings are with greenthe softest and most elaborate in plumage that    i have seen in any of his works but observe also the general    sublimity obtained by the mountainous lines of the drapery of the    recumbent figure dependent for its dignity upon these forms alone as    the face is more than half hidden and what is seen of it    expressionless     34 the paschal feast i name this picture by the title given in the    guidebooks it represents merely five persons watching the increase    of a small fire lighted on a table or altar in the midst of them it    is only because they have all staves in their hands that one may    conjecture this fire to be that kindled to consume the paschal    offering the effect is of course a fire light and like all mere    fire lights that i have ever seen totally devoid of interest     35 elisha feeding the people i again guess at the subject the    picture only represents a figure casting down a number of loaves    before a multitude but as elisha has not elsewhere occurred i    suppose that these must be the barley loaves brought from    baalshalisha in conception and manner of painting this picture and    the last together with the others abovementioned in comparison with    the elijah at cherith may be generally described as dregs of    tintoret they are tired dead dragged out upon the canvas    apparently in the heavyhearted state which a man falls into when he    is both jaded with toil and sick of the work he is employed upon they    are not hastily painted on the contrary finished with considerably    more care than several of the works upon the walls but those as for    instance the agony in the garden are hurried sketches with the    mans whole heart in them while these pictures are exhausted    fulfilments of an appointed task whether they were really amongst the    last painted or whether the painter had fallen ill at some    intermediate time i cannot say but we shall find him again in his    utmost strength in the room which we last enter     illustration fourth group inner room on the upper floor                                on the roof        36 to 39 childrens heads          41 to 44 children       40 st rocco in heaven             45 to 56 allegorical figures

 62 crucifixion     36 to 39 four childrens heads which it is much to be regretted    should be thus lost in filling small vacuities of the ceiling     40 st rocco in heaven the central picture of the roof in the    inner room from the wellknown anecdote respecting the production of    this picture whether in all its details true or not we may at least    gather that having been painted in competition with paul veronese and    other powerful painters of the day it was probably tintorets    endeavor to make it as popular and showy as possible it is quite    different from his common works bright in all its tints and tones    the faces carefully drawn and of an agreeable type the outlines    firm and the shadows few the whole resembling correggio more than    any venetian painter it is however an example of the danger even    to the greatest artist of leaving his own style for it lacks all the    great virtues of tintoret without obtaining the lusciousness of    correggio one thing at all events is remarkable in itthat    though painted while the competitors were making their sketches it    shows no sign of haste or inattention     41 to 44 figures of children merely decorative     45 to 56 allegorical figures on the roof if these were not in the    same room with the crucifixion they would attract more public    attention than any works in the scuola as there are here no black    shadows nor extravagances of invention but very beautiful figures    richly and delicately colored a good deal resembling some of the best    works of andrea del sarto there is nothing in them however    requiring detailed examination the two figures between the windows    are very slovenly if they are his at all and there are bits of    marbling and fruit filling the cornices which may or may not be his    if they are they are tired work and of small importance     59 christ before pilate a most interesting picture but which is    unusual best seen on a dark day when the white figure of christ    alone draws the eye looking almost like a spirit the painting of the    rest of the picture being both somewhat thin and imperfect there is a    certain meagreness about all the minor figures less grandeur and    largeness in the limbs and draperies and less solidity it seems    even in the color although its arrangements are richer than in many    of the compositions above described i hardly know whether it is owing    to this thinness of color or on purpose that the horizontal clouds    shine through the crimson flag in the distance though i should think    the latter for the effect is most beautiful the passionate action of    the scribe in lifting his hand to dip the pen into the inkhorn is    however affected and overstrained and the pilate is very mean    perhaps intentionally that no reverence might be withdrawn from the    person of christ in work of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries    the figures of pilate and herod are always intentionally made    contemptible     ecce homo as usual tintorets own peculiar view of the subject    christ is laid fainting on the ground with a soldier standing on one    side of him while pilate on the other withdraws the robe from the    scourged and wounded body and points it out to the jews both this    and the picture last mentioned resemble titian more than tintoret in    the style of their treatment     61 christ bearing his cross tintoret is here recognizable again in    undiminished strength he has represented the troops and attendants    climbing calvary by a winding path of which two turns are seen the    figures on the uppermost ledge and christ in the centre of them    being relieved against the sky but instead of the usual simple    expedient of the bright horizon to relieve the dark masses there is    here introduced on the left the head of a white horse which blends    itself with the sky in one broad mass of light the power of the    picture is chiefly in effect the figure of christ being too far off    to be very interesting and only the malefactors being seen on the    nearer path but for this very reason it seems to me more impressive    as if one had been truly present at the scene though not exactly in    the right place for seeing it     62 the crucifixion i must leave this picture to work its will on    the spectator for it is beyond all analysis and above all praise       s   sagredo palazzo on the grand canal ii 256 much defaced but full    of interest its sea story is restored its first floor has a most    interesting arcade of the early thirteenth century third order    windows its upper windows are the finest fourth and fifth orders of    early fourteenth century the group of fourth orders in the centre    being brought into some resemblance to the late gothic traceries by    the subsequent introduction of the quatrefoils above them   salute church of sta maria della on the grand canal ii 378 one    of the earliest buildings of the grotesque renaissance rendered    impressive by its position size and general proportions these    latter are exceedingly good the grace of the whole building being    chiefly dependent on the inequality of size in its cupolas and pretty    grouping of the two campaniles behind them it is to be generally    observed that the proportions of buildings have nothing whatever to    do with the style or general merits of their architecture an    architect trained in the worst schools and utterly devoid of all    meaning or purpose in his work may yet have such a natural gift of    massing and grouping as will render all his structures effective when    seen from a distance such a gift is very general with the late    italian builders so that many of the most contemptible edifices in    the country have good stage effect so long as we do not approach them    the church of the salute is farther assisted by the beautiful flight    of steps in front of it down to the canal and its façade is rich and    beautiful of its kind and was chosen by turner for the principal    object in his wellknown view of the grand canal the principal faults    of the building are the meagre windows in the sides of the cupola and    the ridiculous disguise of the buttresses under the form of colossal    scrolls the buttresses themselves being originally a hypocrisy for    the cupola is stated by lazari to be of timber and therefore needs    none the sacristy contains several precious pictures the three on    its roof by titian much vaunted are indeed as feeble as they are    monstrous but the small titian st mark with sts cosmo and    damian was when i first saw it to my judgment by far the first    work of titians in venice it has since been restored by the academy    and it seemed to me entirely destroyed but i had not time to examine    it carefully     at the end of the larger sacristy is the lunette which once decorated    the tomb of the doge francesco dandolo see above page 74 and at    the side of it one of the most highly finished tintorets in venice    namely     the marriage in cana an immense picture some twentyfive feet long    by fifteen high and said by lazari to be one of the few which    tintoret signed with his name i am not surprised at his having done    so in this case evidently the work has been a favorite with him and    he has taken as much pains as it was ever necessary for his colossal    strength to take with anything the subject is not one which admits of    much singularity or energy in composition it was always a favorite    one with veronese because it gave dramatic interest to figures in gay    costumes and of cheerful countenances but one is surprised to find    tintoret whose tone of mind was always grave and who did not like to    make a picture out of brocades and diadems throwing his whole    strength into the conception of a marriage feast but so it is and    there are assuredly no female heads in any of his pictures in venice    elaborated so far as those which here form the central light neither    is it often that the works of this mighty master conform themselves to    any of the rules acted upon by ordinary painters but in this instance    the popular laws have been observed and an academy student would be    delighted to see with what severity the principal light is arranged in    a central mass which is divided and made more brilliant by a vigorous    piece of shadow thrust into the midst of it and which dies away in    lesser fragments and sparkling towards the extremities of the picture    this mass of light is as interesting by its composition as by its    intensity the cicerone who escorts the stranger round the sacristy in    the course of five minutes and allows him some forty seconds for the    contemplation of a picture which the study of six months would not    entirely fathom directs his attention very carefully to the bell    effetto di prospettivo the whole merit of the picture being in the    eyes of the intelligent public that there is a long table in it one    end of which looks farther off than the other but there is more in    the bell effetto di prospettivo than the observance of the common    laws of optics the table is set in a spacious chamber of which the    windows at the end let in the light from the horizon and those in the    side wall the intense blue of an eastern sky the spectator looks all    along the table at the farther end of which are seated christ and the    madonna the marriage guests on each side of iton one side men on    the other women the men are set with their backs to the light which    passing over their heads and glancing slightly on the tablecloth    falls in full length along the line of young venetian women who thus    fill the whole centre of the picture with one broad sunbeam made up    of fair faces and golden hair close to the spectator a woman has    risen in amazement and stretches across the table to show the wine in    her cup to those opposite her dark red dress intercepts and enhances    the mass of gathered light it is rather curious considering the    subject of the picture that one cannot distinguish either the bride    or the bridegroom but the fourth figure from the madonna in the line    of women who wears a white headdress of lace and rich chains of    pearls in her hair may well be accepted for the former and i think    that between her and the woman on the madonnas left hand the unity of    the line of women is intercepted by a male figure be this as it may    this fourth female face is the most beautiful as far as i recollect    that occurs in the works of the painter with the exception only of    the madonna in the flight into egypt it is an ideal which occurs    indeed elsewhere in many of his works a face at once dark and    delicate the italian cast of feature moulded with the softness and    childishness of english beauty some half a century ago but i have    never seen the ideal so completely worked out by the master the face    may best be described as one of the purest and softest of stothards    conceptions executed with all the strength of tintoret the other    women are all made inferior to this one but there are beautiful    profiles and bendings of breasts and necks along the whole line the    men are all subordinate though there are interesting portraits among    them perhaps the only fault of the picture being that the faces are a    little too conspicuous seen like balls of light among the crowd of    minor figures which fill the background of the picture the tone of    the whole is sober and majestic in the highest degree the dresses are    all broad masses of color and the only parts of the picture which lay    claim to the expression of wealth or splendor are the headdresses of    the women in this respect the conception of the scene differs widely    from that of veronese and approaches more nearly to the probable    truth still the marriage is not an unimportant one an immense crowd    filling the background forming superbly rich mosaic of color against    the distant sky taken as a whole the picture is perhaps the most    perfect example which human art has produced of the utmost possible    force and sharpness of shadow united with richness of local color in    all the other works of tintoret and much more of other colorists    either the light and shade or the local color is predominant in the    one case the picture has a tendency to look as if painted by    candlelight in the other it becomes daringly conventional and    approaches the conditions of glasspainting this picture unites    color as rich as titians with light and shade as forcible as    rembrandts and far more decisive     there are one or two other interesting pictures of the early venetian    schools in this sacristy and several important tombs in the adjoining    cloister among which that of francesco dandolo transported here from    the church of the frari deserves especial attention see above p    74   salvatore church of st base renaissance occupying the place of the    ancient church

the it possesses a fine john bellini and is renowned    through venice for its precious marbles i omitted to notice above in    speaking of the buildings of the grotesque renaissance that many of    them are remarkable for a kind of dishonesty even in the use of    true marbles resulting not from motives of economy but from mere    love of juggling and falsehood for their own sake i hardly know which    condition of mind is meanest that which has pride in plaster made to    look like marble or that which takes delight in marble made to look    like silk several of the later churches in venice more especially    those of the jesuiti of san clemente and this of the scalzi rest    their chief claims to admiration on their having curtains and cushions    cut out of rock the most ridiculous example is in san clemente and    the most curious and costly are in the scalzi which latter church is    a perfect type of the vulgar abuse of marble in every possible way by    men who had no eye for color and no understanding of any merit in a    work of art but that which arises from costliness of material and    such powers of imitation as are devoted in england to the manufacture    of peaches and eggs out of derbyshire spar   sebastian church of st the tomb and of old the monument of paul    veronese it is full of his noblest pictures or of what once were    such

having been offered me for sale    ground and all or stone by stone as i chose by its present    proprietor when i was last in venice more real good might at present    be effected by any wealthy person who would devote his resources to    the preservation of such monuments wherever they exist by freehold    purchase of the entire ruin and afterwards by taking proper charge of    it and forming a garden round it than by any other mode of    protecting or encouraging art there is no school no lecturer like a    ruin of the early ages   severo fondamenta san palace at ii 264   silvestro church of st of no importance in itself but it contains    two very interesting pictures the first a st thomas of canterbury    with the baptist and st francis by girolamo santa croce a superb    example of the venetian religious school the second by tintoret    namely     the baptism of christ over the first altar on the right of the    nave an upright picture some ten feet wide by fifteen high the top    of it is arched representing the father supported by angels it    requires little knowledge of tintoret to see that these figures are    not by his hand by returning to the opposite side of the nave the    join in the canvas may be plainly seen the upper part of the picture    having been entirely added on whether it had this upper part before    it was repainted or whether originally square cannot now be told    but i believe it had an upper part which has been destroyed i am not    sure if even the dove and the two angels which are at the top of the    older part of the picture are quite genuine the rest of it is    magnificent though both the figures of the saviour and the baptist    show some concession on the part of the painter to the imperative    requirement of his age that nothing should be done except in an    attitude neither are there any of his usual fantastic imaginations    there is simply the christ in the water and the st john on the shore    without attendants disciples or witnesses of any kind but the power    of the light and shade and the splendor of the landscape which on    the whole is well preserved render it a most interesting example the    jordan is represented as a mountain brook receiving a tributary    stream in a cascade from the rocks in which st john stands there is    a rounded stone in the centre of the current and the parting of the    water at this as well as its rippling among the roots of some dark    trees on the left are among the most accurate remembrances of nature    to be found in any of the works of the great masters i hardly know    whether most to wonder at the power of the man who thus broke through    the neglect of nature which was universal at his time or at the    evidences visible throughout the whole of the conception that he was    still content to paint from slight memories of what he had seen in    hill countries instead of following out to its full depth the    fountain which he had opened there is not a stream among the hills of    priuli which in any quarter of a mile of its course would not have    suggested to him finer forms of cascade than those which

small and very carefully finished picture but    marvellously temperate and quiet in treatment especially considering    the subject which one would have imagined likely to inspire the    painter with one of his most fantastic visions as if on purpose to    disappoint us both the effect and the conception of the figures are    perfectly quiet and appear the result much more of careful study than    of vigorous imagination the effect is one of plain daylight there    are a few clouds drifting in the distance but with no wildness in    them nor is there any energy or heat in the flames which mantle about    the waist of one of the figures but for the noble workmanship we    might almost fancy it the production of a modern academy yet as we    begin to read the picture the painters mind becomes felt st    anthony is surrounded by four figures one of which only has the form    of a demon and he is in the background engaged in no more terrific    act of violence toward st anthony than endeavoring to pull off his    mantle he has however a scourge over his shoulder but this is    probably intended for st anthonys weapon of selfdiscipline which    the fiend with a very protestant turn of mind is carrying off a    broken staff with a bell hanging to it at the saints feet also    expresses his interrupted devotion the three other figures beside him    are bent on more cunning mischief the woman on the left is one of    tintorets best portraits of a young and brighteyed venetian beauty    it is curious that he has given so attractive a countenance to a type    apparently of the temptation to violate the power of poverty for this    woman places one hand in a vase full of coins and shakes golden    chains with the other on the opposite side of the saint another    woman admirably painted but of a far less attractive countenance is    a type of the lusts of the flesh yet there is nothing gross or    immodest in her dress or gesture she appears to have been baffled    and for the present to have given up addressing the saint she lays    one hand upon her breast and might be taken for a very respectable    person but that there are flames playing about her loins a recumbent    figure on the ground is of less intelligible character but may    perhaps be meant for indolence at all events he has torn the saints    book to pieces i forgot to note that under the figure representing    avarice there is a creature like a pig whether actual pig or not is    unascertainable for the church is dark the little light that comes    on the picture falls on it the wrong way and one third of the lower    part of it is hidden by a white case containing a modern daub lately    painted by way of an altar piece the meaning as well as the merit    of the grand old picture being now far beyond the comprehension both    of priests and people     2 the last supper on the lefthand side of the chapel of the    sacrament a picture which has been through the hands of the academy    and is therefore now hardly worth notice its conception seems always    to have been vulgar and far below tintorets usual standard there is    singular baseness in the circumstance that one of the near apostles    while all the others are as usual intent upon christs words one    of you shall betray me is going to help himself to wine out of a    bottle which stands behind him in so doing he stoops towards the    table the flask being on the floor if intended for the action of    judas at this moment there is the painters usual originality in the    thought but it seems to me rather done to obtain variation of    posture in bringing the red dress into strong contrast with the    tablecloth the color has once been fine and there are fragments of    good painting still left but the light does not permit these to be    seen and there is too much perfect work of the masters in venice to    permit us to spend time on retouched remnants the picture is only    worth mentioning because it is ignorantly and ridiculously referred    to by kugler as characteristic of tintoret       v   vitali church of st said to contain a picture by vittor carpaccio    over the high altar otherwise of no importance    volto santo church of the an interesting but desecrated ruin of the    fourteenth century fine in style its roof retains some fresco    coloring but as far as i recollect of later date than the    architecture       z   zaccaria church of st early renaissance and fine of its kind a    gothic chapel attached to it is of great beauty it contains the best    john bellini in venice after that of san g grisostomo the virgin    with four saints and is said to contain another john bellini and a    tintoret neither of which i have seen   zitelle church of the of no importance   zobenigo church of santa maria iii 124 it contains one valuable    tintoret namely     christ with sta justina and st augustin over the third altar on    the south side of the nave a picture of small size and upright    about ten feet by eight christ appears to be descending out of the    clouds between the two saints who are both kneeling on the sea shore    it is a venetian sea breaking on a flat beach like the lido with a    scarlet galley in the middle distance of which the chief use is to    unite the two figures by a point of color both the saints are    respectable venetians of the lower class in homely dresses and with    homely faces the whole picture is quietly painted and somewhat    slightly free from all extravagance and displaying little power    except in the general truth or harmony of colors so easily laid on it    is better preserved than usual and worth dwelling upon as an instance    of the style of the master when at rest   footnotes    71  am

questions hourly do i ask myself          and not a stone in a crossway inscribed          to mantua to ferrara but excites          surprise and doubt and selfcongratulation      alas after a few short months spent even in the scenes dearest to     history we can feel thus no more    72 i have always called this church in the text simply st john     and paul not sts john and paul just as the
