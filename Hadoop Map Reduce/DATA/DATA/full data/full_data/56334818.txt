56334818	a daughter of the snows  by  jack london  author of the son of the wolf the call of the wild the people of the abyss etc  with illustrations by frederick c yohn  grosset  dunlap publishersnew york  1902        chapter i  all ready miss welse though im sorry we cant spare one of the steamers boats  frona welse arose with alacrity and came to the first officers side  were so busy he explained and goldrushers are such perishable freight at least  i understand she interrupted and i too am behaving as though i were perishable  and i am sorry for the trouble i am giving you butbut  she turned quickly and pointed to the shore  do you see that big loghouse  between the clump of pines and the river  i was born there  guess id be in a hurry myself he muttered sympathetically as he piloted her along the crowded deck  everybody was in everybody elses way nor was there one who failed to proclaim it at the top of his lungs  a thousand goldseekers were clamoring for the immediate landing of their outfits  each hatchway gaped wide open and from the lower depths the shrieking donkeyengines were hurrying the misassorted outfits skyward  on either side of the steamer rows of scows received the flying cargo and on each of these scows a sweating mob of men charged the descending slings and heaved bales and boxes about in frantic search  men waved shipping receipts and shouted over the steamerrails to them  sometimes two and three identified the same article and war arose  the twocircle and the circleanddot brands caused endless jangling while every whipsaw discovered a dozen claimants  the purser insists that he is going mad the first officer said as he helped frona welse down the gangway to the landing stage and the freight clerks have turned the cargo over to the passengers and quit work  but were not so unlucky as the star of bethlehem he reassured her pointing to a steamship at anchor a quarter of a mile away  half of her passengers have packhorses for skaguay and white pass and the other half are bound over the chilcoot  so theyve mutinied and everythings at a standstill  hey you he cried beckoning to a whitehall which hovered discreetly on the outer rim of the floating confusion  a tiny launch pulling heroically at a huge towbarge attempted to pass between but the boatman shot nervily across her bow and just as he was clear unfortunately caught a crab  this slewed the boat around and brought it to a stop  watch out the first officer shouted  a pair of seventyfoot canoes loaded with outfits goldrushers and indians and under full sail drove down from the counter direction one of them veered sharply towards the landing stage but the other pinched the whitehall against the barge  the boatman had unshipped his oars in time but his small craft groaned under the pressure and threatened to collapse  whereat he came to his feet and in short nervous phrases consigned all canoemen and launchcaptains to eternal perdition  a man on the barge leaned over from above and baptized him with crisp and crackling oaths while the whites and indians in the canoe laughed derisively  aw gwan one of them shouted  why dont yeh learn to row  the boatmans fist landed on the point of his critics jaw and dropped him stunned upon the heaped merchandise  not content with this summary act he proceeded to follow his fist into the other craft  the miner nearest him tugged vigorously at a revolver which had jammed in its shiny leather holster while his brother argonauts laughing waited the outcome  but the canoe was under way again and the indian helmsman drove the point of his paddle into the boatmans chest and hurled him backward into the bottom of the whitehall  when the flood of oaths and blasphemy was at full tide and violent assault and quick death seemed most imminent the first officer had stolen a glance at the girl by his side  he had expected to find a shocked and frightened maiden countenance and was not at all prepared for the flushed and deeply interested face which met his eyes  i am sorry he began  but she broke in as though annoyed by the interruption no no not at all  i am enjoying it every bit  though i am glad that mans revolver stuck  if it had not  we might have been delayed in getting ashore the first officer laughed and therein displayed his tact  that man is a robber he went on indicating the boatman who had now shoved his oars into the water and was pulling alongside  he agreed to charge only twenty dollars for putting you ashore  said hed have made it twentyfive had it been a man  hes a pirate mark me and he will surely hang some day  twenty dollars for a halfhours work think of it  easy sport  easy cautioned the fellow in question at the same time making an awkward landing and dropping one of his oars overside youve no call to be flingin names about he added defiantly wringing out his shirtsleeve wet from rescue of the oar  youve got good ears my man began the first officer  and a quick fist the other snapped in  and a ready tongue  need it in my business  no gettin long without it among you seasharks  pirate am i  and you with a thousand passengers packed like sardines  charge em double firstclass passage feed em steerage grub and bunk em worse n pigs  pirate eh  me  a redfaced man thrust his head over the rail above and began to bellow lustily  i want my stock landed  come up here mr thurston  now  right away  fifty cayuses of  mine eating their heads off in this dirty kennel of yours and itll be a sick time youll have if you dont hustle them ashore as fast as godll let you  im losing a thousand dollars a day and i wont stand it  do you hear  i wont stand it youve robbed me right and left from the time you cleared dock in seattle and by the hinges of hell i wont stand it any more  ill break this company as sure as my names thad ferguson  dye hear my spiel  im thad ferguson and you cant come and see me any too quick for your health  dye hear  pirate eh the boatman soliloquized  who  me  mr thurston waved his hand appeasingly at the redfaced man and turned to the girl  id like to go ashore with you and as far as the store but you see how busy we are  goodby and a lucky trip to you ill tell off a couple of men at once and break out your baggage  have it up at the store tomorrow morning sharp  she took his hand lightly and stepped aboard  her weight gave the leaky boat a sudden lurch and the water hurtled across the bottom boards to her shoetops but she took it coolly enough settling herself in the sternsheets and tucking her feet under her  hold on the officer cried  this will never do miss welse  come on back and ill get one of our boats over as soon as i can  ill see you inin heaven first retorted the boatman shoving off let go he threatened  mr thurston gripped tight hold of the gunwale and as reward for his chivalry had his knuckles rapped sharply by the oarblade  then he forgot himself and miss welse also and swore and swore fervently  i dare say our farewell might have been more dignified she called back to him her laughter rippling across the water  jove he muttered doffing his cap gallantly  there is a woman and a sudden hunger seized him and a yearning to see himself mirrored always in the gray eyes of frona welse  he was not analytical he did not know why but he knew that with her he could travel to the end of the earth  he felt a distaste for his profession and a temptation to throw it all over and strike out for the klondike whither she was going then he glanced up the beetling side of the ship saw the red face of thad ferguson and forgot the dream he had for an instant dreamed   splash  a handful of water from his strenuous oar struck her full in the face  hope you dont mind it miss he apologized  im doin the best i know how which aint much  so it seems she answered goodnaturedly  not that i love the sea bitterly but ive got to turn a few honest dollars somehow and this seemed the likeliest way  i oughter a ben in klondike by now if id had any luck at all  tell you how it was i lost my outfit on windy arm halfway in after packin it clean across the pass  zip  splash  she shook the water from her eyes squirming the while as some of it ran down her warm back  youll do he encouraged her  youre the right stuff for this country  goin all the way in  she nodded cheerfully  then youll do  but as i was sayin after i lost my outfit i hit back for the coast bein broke to hustle up another one  thats why im chargin highpressure rates  and i hope you dont feel sore at what i made you pay  im no worse than the rest miss sure  i had to dig up a hundred for this old tub which aint worth ten down in the states  same kind of prices everywhere  over on the skaguay trail horseshoe nails is just as good as a quarter any day  a man goes up to the bar and calls for a whiskey  whiskeys half a dollar  well he drinks his whiskey plunks down two horseshoe nails and its ok  no kick comin on horseshoe nails  they use em to make change  you must be a brave man to venture into the country again after such an experience  wont you tell me your name  we may meet on the inside  who  me  oh im del bishop pocketminer and if ever we run across each other remember id give you the last shirti mean remember my last bit of grub is yours  thank you she answered with a sweet smile for she was a woman who loved the things which rose straight from the heart  he stopped rowing long enough to fish about in the water around his feet for an old cornbeef can  youd better do some bailin he ordered tossing her the can shes leakin worse since that squeeze  frona smiled mentally tucked up her skirts and bent to the work  at every dip like great billows heaving along the skyline the glacierfretted mountains rose and fell  sometimes she rested her back and watched the teeming beach towards which they were heading and again the landlocked arm of the sea in which a score or so of great steamships lay at anchor  from each of these to the shore and back again flowed a steady stream of scows launches canoes and all sorts of smaller craft  man the mighty toiler reacting upon a hostile environment she thought going back in memory to the masters whose wisdom she had shared in lectureroom and midnight study  she was a ripened child of the age and fairly understood the physical world and the workings thereof  and she had a love for the world and a deep respect  for some time del bishop had only punctuated the silence with splashes from his oars but a thought struck him  you havent told me your name he suggested with complacent delicacy  my name is welse she answered  frona welse  a great awe manifested itself in his face and grew to a greater and greater awe  youarefronawelse he enunciated slowly  jacob welse aint your old man is he  yes i am jacob welses daughter at your service  he puckered his lips in a long low whistle of understanding and stopped rowing  just you climb back into the stern and take your feet out of that water he commanded  and gimme holt that can  am i not bailing satisfactorily she demanded indignantly  yep  youre doin all right but but you areare  just what i was before you knew who i was  now you go on rowingthats your share of the work and ill take care of mine  oh youll do he murmured ecstatically bending afresh to the oars and jacob welse is your old man  i oughter a known it sure  when they reached the sandspit crowded with heterogeneous piles of merchandise and buzzing with men she stopped long enough to shake hands with her ferryman  and though such a proceeding on the part of his feminine patrons was certainly unusual del bishop squared it easily with the fact that she was jacob welses daughter  remember my last bit of grub is yours he reassured her still holding her hand  and your last shirt too dont forget  well youre aaa crackerjack he exploded with a final squeeze sure  her short skirt did not block the free movement of her limbs and she discovered with pleasurable surprise that the quick tripping step of the city pavement had departed from her and that she was swinging off in the long easy stride which is born of the trail and which comes only after much travail and endeavor  more than one goldrusher shooting keen glances at her ankles and graygaitered calves affirmed del bishops judgment  and more than one glanced up at her face and glanced again for her gaze was frank with the frankness of comradeship and in her eyes there was always a smiling light just trembling on the verge of dawn and did the onlooker smile her eyes smiled also  and the smiling light was proteanmoodedmerry sympathetic joyous quizzicalthe complement of whatsoever kindled it  and sometimes the light spread over all her face till the smile prefigured by it was realized  but it was always in frank and open comradeship  and there was much to cause her to smile as she hurried through the crowd across the sandspit and over the flat towards the logbuilding she had pointed out to mr thurston  time had rolled back and locomotion and transportation were once again in the most primitive stages  men who had never carried more than parcels in all their lives had now become bearers of burdens  they no longer walked upright under the sun but stooped the body forward and bowed the head to the earth every back had become a packsaddle and the strapgalls were beginning to form  they staggered beneath the unwonted effort and legs became drunken with weariness and titubated in divers directions till the sunlight darkened and bearer and burden fell by the way  other men exulting secretly piled their goods on twowheeled gocarts and pulled out blithely enough only to stall at the first spot where the great round boulders invaded the trail  whereat they generalized anew upon the principles of alaskan travel discarded the gocart or trundled it back to the beach and sold it at fabulous price to the last man landed tenderfeet with ten pounds of colts revolvers cartridges and huntingknives belted about them wandered valiantly up the trail and crept back softly shedding revolvers cartridges and knives in despairing showers  and so in gasping and bitter sweat these sons of adam suffered for adams sin  frona felt vaguely disturbed by this great throbbing rush of goldmad men and the old scene with its clustering associations seemed blotted out by these toiling aliens  even the old landmarks appeared strangely unfamiliar  it was the same yet not the same  here on the grassy flat where she had played as a child and shrunk back at the sound of her voice echoing from glacier to glacier ten thousand men tramped ceaselessly up and down grinding the tender herbage into the soil and mocking the stony silence  and just up the trail were ten thousand men who had passed by and over the chilcoot were ten thousand more  and behind all down the islandstudded alaskan coast even to the horn were yet ten thousand more harnessers of wind and steam hasteners from the ends of the earth  the dyea river as of old roared turbulently down to the sea but its ancient banks were gored by the feet of many men and these men labored in surging rows at the dripping towlines and the deepladen boats followed them as they fought their upward way  and the will of man strove with the will of the water and the men laughed at the old dyea river and gored its banks deeper for the men who were to follow  the doorway of the store through which she had once run out and in and where she had looked with awe at the unusual sight of a stray trapper or furtrader was now packed with a clamorous throng of men where of old one letter waiting a claimant was a thing of wonder she now saw by peering through the window the mail heaped up from floor to ceiling  and it was for this mail the men were clamoring so insistently  before the store by the scales was another crowd  an indian threw his pack upon the scales the white owner jotted down the weight in a notebook and another pack was thrown on  each pack was in the straps ready for the packers back and the precarious journey over the chilcoot  frona edged in closer  she was interested in freights  she remembered in her day when the solitary prospector or trader had his outfit packed over for six centsone hundred and twenty dollars a ton  the tenderfoot who was weighing up consulted his guidebook  eight cents he said to the indian  whereupon the indians laughed scornfully and chorused forty cents  a pained expression came into his face and he looked about him anxiously  the sympathetic light in fronas eyes caught him and he regarded her with intent blankness  in reality he was busy reducing a threeton outfit to terms of cash at forty dollars per hundredweight  twentyfour hundred dollars for thirty miles he cried  what can i do  frona shrugged her shoulders  youd better pay them the forty cents she advised else they will take off their straps  the man thanked her but instead of taking heed went on with his haggling  one of the indians stepped up and proceeded to unfasten his packstraps  the tenderfoot wavered but just as he was about to give in the packers jumped the price on him to fortyfive cents  he smiled after a sickly fashion and nodded his head in token of surrender  but another indian joined the group and began whispering excitedly  a cheer went up and before the man could realize it they had jerked off their straps and departed spreading the news as they went that freight to lake linderman was fifty cents  of a sudden the crowd before the store was perceptibly agitated  its members whispered excitedly one to another and all their eyes were focussed upon three men approaching from up the trail  the trio were ordinarylooking creatures illclad and even ragged  in a more stable community their apprehension by the village constable and arrest for vagrancy would have been immediate  french louis the tenderfeet whispered and passed the word along  owns three eldorado claims in a block the man next to frona confided to her  worth ten millions at the very least  french louis striding a little in advance of his companions did not look it  he had parted company with his hat somewhere along the route and a frayed silk kerchief was wrapped carelessly about his head  and for all his ten millions he carried his own travelling pack on his broad shoulders  and that one the one with the beard thats swiftwater bill another of the eldorado kings  how do you know frona asked doubtingly  know the man exclaimed  know  why his picture has been in all the papers for the last six weeks  see he unfolded a newspaper  and a pretty good likeness too  ive looked at it so much id know his mug among a thousand  then who is the third one she queried tacitly accepting him as a fount of authority  her informant lifted himself on his toes to see better  i dont know he confessed sorrowfully then tapped the shoulder of the man next to him  who is the lean smoothfaced one  the one with the blue shirt and the patch on his knee  just then frona uttered a glad little cry and darted forward  matt she cried  matt mccarthy  the man with the patch shook her hand heartily though he did not know her and distrust was plain in his eyes  oh you dont remember me she chattered  and dont you dare say you do  if there werent so many looking id hug you you old bear  and so big bear went home to the little bears she recited solemnly and the little bears were very hungry  and big bear said guess what i have got my children  and one little bear guessed berries and one little bear guessed salmon and tother little bear guessed porcupine then big bear laughed whoof  whoof and said a nice big fat man  as he listened recollection avowed itself in his face and when she had finished his eyes wrinkled up and he laughed a peculiar laughable silent laugh  sure an its well i know ye he explained but for the life iv me i cant put me finger on ye  she pointed into the store and watched him anxiously  now i have ye  he drew back and looked her up and down and his expression changed to disappointment  it cuddent be  i mistook ye ye cud niver alived in that shanty thrusting a thumb in the direction of the store  frona nodded her head vigorously  thin its yer ownself afther all  the little motherless darlin with the goold hair i combed the knots out iv manys the time  the little witch that run barefoot an barelegged over all the place  yes yes she corroborated gleefully  the little divil that

philosophers brains  but lets wander inside on the heels of louis an swiftwater  andys still tindin store im told an well see if i still linger in the pages iv his mimory  and i also frona seized him by the hand  it was a bad habit she had of seizing the hands of those she loved  its ten years since i went away  the irishman forged his way through the crowd like a piledriver and frona followed easily in the lee of his bulk  the tenderfeet watched them reverently for to them they were as northland divinities  the buzz of conversation rose again  whos the girl somebody asked  and just as frona passed inside the door she caught the opening of the answer jacob welses daughter never heard of jacob welse  where have you been keeping yourself     chapter ii  she came out of the wood of glistening birch and with the first fires of the sun blazoning her unbound hair raced lightly across the dewdripping meadow  the earth was fat with excessive moisture and soft to her feet while the dank vegetation slapped against her knees and cast off flashing sprays of liquid diamonds  the flush of the morning was in her cheek and its fire in her eyes and she was aglow with youth and love  for she had nursed at the breast of naturein forfeit of a motherand she loved the old trees and the creeping green things with a passionate love and the dim murmur of growing life was a gladness to her ears and the damp earthsmells were sweet to her nostrils  where the upperreach of the meadow vanished in a dark and narrow forest aisle amid cleanstemmed dandelions and colorbursting buttercups she came upon a bunch of great alaskan violets  throwing herself at full length she buried her face in the fragrant coolness and with her hands drew the purple heads in circling splendor about her own  and she was not ashamed  she had wandered away amid the complexities and smirch and withering heats of the great world and she had returned simple and clean and wholesome  and she was glad of it as she lay there slipping back to the old days when the universe began and ended at the skyline and when she journeyed over the pass to behold the abyss  it was a primitive life that of her childhood with few conventions but such as there were stern ones  and they might be epitomized as she had read somewhere in her later years as the faith of food and blanket  this faith had her father kept she thought remembering that his name sounded well on the lips of men  and this was the faith she had learnedthe faith she had carried with her across the abyss and into the world where men had wandered away from the old truths and made themselves selfish dogmas and casuistries of the subtlest kinds the faith she had brought back with her still fresh and young and joyous  and it was all so simple she had contended why should not their faith be as her faiththe faith of food and blanket  the faith of trail and hunting camp  the faith with which strong clean men faced the quick danger and sudden death by field and flood  why not the faith of jacob welse  of matt mccarthy  of the indian boys she had played with  of the indian girls she had led to amazonian war  of the very wolfdogs straining in the harnesses and running with her across the snow  it was healthy it was real it was good she thought and she was glad  the rich notes of a robin saluted her from the birch wood and opened her ears to the day  a partridge boomed afar in the forest and a treesquirrel launched unerringly into space above her head and went on from limb to limb and tree to tree scolding graciously the while from the hidden river rose the shouts of the toiling adventurers already parted from sleep and fighting their way towards the pole  frona arose shook back her hair and took instinctively the old path between the trees to the camp of chief george and the dyea tribesmen she came upon a boy breechclouted and bare like a copper god  he was gathering wood and looked at her keenly over his bronze shoulder she bade him goodmorning blithely in the dyea tongue but he shook his head and laughed insultingly and paused in his work to hurl shameful words after her  she did not understand for this was not the old way and when she passed a great and glowering sitkan buck she kept her tongue between her teeth  at the fringe of the forest the camp confronted her  and she was startled  it was not the old camp of a score or more of lodges clustering and huddling together in the open as though for company but a mighty camp  it began at the very forest and flowed in and out among the scattered treeclumps on the flat and spilled over and down to the river bank where the long canoes were lined up ten and twelve deep  it was a gathering of the tribes like unto none in all the past and a thousand miles of coast made up the tally  they were all strange indians with wives and chattels and dogs  she rubbed shoulders with juneau and wrangel men and was jostled by wildeyed sticks from over the passes fierce chilcats and queen charlotte islanders  and the looks they cast upon her were black and frowning saveand far worsewhere the merrier souls leered patronizingly into her face and chuckled unmentionable things  she was not frightened by this insolence but angered for it hurt her and embittered the pleasurable homecoming  yet she quickly grasped the significance of it the old patriarchal status of her fathers time had passed away and civilization in a scorching blast had swept down upon this people in a day  glancing under the raised flaps of a tent she saw haggardfaced bucks squatting in a circle on the floor  by the door a heap of broken bottles advertised the vigils of the night  a white man low of visage and shrewd was dealing cards about and gold and silver coins leaped into heaping bets upon the blanket board  a few steps farther on she heard the cluttering whirl of a wheel of fortune and saw the indians men and women chancing eagerly their sweatearned wages for the gaudy prizes of the game  and from tepee and lodge rose the cracked and crazy strains of cheap musicboxes  an old squaw peeling a willow pole in the sunshine of an open doorway raised her head and uttered a shrill cry  heehee  tenas heehee she muttered as well and as excitedly as her toothless gums would permit  frona thrilled at the cry  tenas heehee  little laughter  her name of the long gone indian past  she turned and went over to the old woman  and hast thou so soon forgotten tenas heehee she mumbled  and thine eyes so young and sharp  not so soon does neepoosa forget  it is thou neepoosa frona cried her tongue halting from the disuse of years  ay it is neepoosa the old woman replied drawing her inside the tent and despatching a boy hotfooted on some errand  they sat down together on the floor and she patted fronas hand lovingly peering meanwhile bleareyed and misty into her face  ay it is neepoosa grown old quickly after the manner of our women  neepoosa who dandled thee in her arms when thou wast a child  neepoosa who gave thee thy name tenas heehee  who fought for thee with death when thou wast ailing and gathered growing things from the woods and grasses of the earth and made of them tea and gave thee to drink  but i mark little change for i knew thee at once  it was thy very shadow on the ground that made me lift my head  a little change mayhap  tall thou art and like a slender willow in thy grace and the sun has kissed thy cheeks more lightly of the years but there is the old hair flying wild and of the color of the brown seaweed floating on the tide and the mouth quick to laugh and loth to cry  and the eyes are as clear and true as in the days when neepoosa chid thee for wrongdoing and thou wouldst not put false words upon thy tongue  ai  ai  not as thou art the other women who come now into the land  and why is a white woman without honor among you frona demanded your men say evil things to me in the camp and as i came through the woods even the boys  not in the old days when i played with them was this shame so  ai  ai neepoosa made answer  it is so  but do not blame them pour not thine anger upon their heads  for it is true it is the fault of thy women who come into the land these days  they can point to no man and say that is my man  and it is not good that women should he thus  and they look upon all men boldeyed and shameless and their tongues are unclean and their hearts bad  wherefore are thy women without honor among us  as for the boys they are but boys  and the men how should they know  the tentflaps were poked aside and an old man came in  he grunted to frona and sat down  only a certain eager alertness showed the delight he took in her presence  so tenas heehee has come back in these bad days he vouchsafed in a shrill quavering voice  and why bad days muskim frona asked  do not the women wear brighter colors  are not the bellies fuller with flour and bacon and white mans grub  do not the young men contrive great wealth what of their packstraps and paddles  and art thou not remembered with the ancient offerings of meat and fish and blanket  why bad days muskim  true he replied in his fine priestly way a reminiscent flash of the old fire lighting his eyes  it is very true  the women wear brighter colors  but they have found favor in the eyes of thy white men and they look no more upon the young men of their own blood wherefore the tribe does not increase nor do the little children longer clutter the way of our feet  it is so  the bellies are fuller with the white mans grub but also are they fuller with the white mans bad whiskey  nor could it be otherwise that the young men contrive great wealth but they sit by night over the cards and it passes from them and they speak harsh words one to another and in anger blows are struck and there is bad blood between them  as for old muskim there are few offerings of meat and fish and blanket  for the young women have turned aside from the old paths nor do the young men longer honor the old totems and the old gods  so these are bad days tenas heehee and they behold old muskim go down in sorrow to the grave  ai  ai  it is so wailed neepoosa  because of the madness of thy people have my people become mad muskim continued  they come over the salt sea like the waves of the sea thy people and they goah who knoweth where  ai  who knoweth where neepoosa lamented rocking slowly back and forth  ever they go towards the frost and cold and ever do they come more people wave upon wave  ai  ai  into the frost and cold  it is a long way and dark and cold  she shivered then laid a sudden hand on fronas arm  and thou goest  frona nodded  and tenas heehee goest  ai  ai  ai  the tentflap lifted and matt mccarthy peered in  its yerself frona is it  with breakfast waitin this halfhour on ye an old andy fumin an frettin like the old woman he is  goodmornin to ye neepoosa he addressed fronas companions an to ye muskim though belike yeve little mimory iv me face  the old couple grunted salutation and remained stolidly silent  but hurry with ye girl turning back to frona  me steamer starts by midday an its little ill see iv ye at the best  an likewise theres andy an the breakfast pipin hot both iv them     chapter iii  frona waved her hand to andy and swung out on the trail  fastened tightly to her back were her camera and a small travelling satchel  in addition she carried for alpenstock the willow pole of neepoosa  her dress was of the mountaineering sort shortskirted and scant allowing the greatest play with the least material and withal gray of color and modest  her outfit on the backs of a dozen indians and in charge of del bishop had got under way hours before  the previous day on her return with matt mccarthy from the siwash camp she had found del bishop at the store waiting her  his business was quickly transacted for the proposition he made was terse and to the point  she was going into the country  he was intending to go in  she would need somebody if she had not picked any one yet why he was just the man  he had forgotten to tell her the day he took her ashore that he had been in the country years before and knew all about it  true he hated the water and it was mainly a water journey but he was not afraid of it he was afraid of nothing  further he would fight for her at the drop of the hat  as for pay when they got to dawson a good word from her to jacob welse and a years outfit would be his  no no no grubstake about it no strings on him  he would pay for the outfit later on when his sack was dusted  what did she think about it anyway  and frona did think about it for ere she had finished breakfast he was out hustling the packers together  she found herself making better speed than the majority of her fellows who were heavily laden and had to rest their packs every few hundred yards  yet she found herself hard put to keep the pace of a bunch of scandinavians ahead of her  they were huge strapping blondhaired giants each striding along with a hundred pounds on his back and all harnessed to a gocart which carried fully six hundred more  their faces were as laughing suns and the joy of life was in them  the toil seemed childs play and slipped from them lightly  they joked with one another and with the passersby in a meaningless tongue and their great chests rumbled with cavernechoing laughs  men stood aside for them and looked after them enviously for they took the rises of the trail on the run and rattled down the counter slopes and ground the ironrimmed wheels harshly over the rocks  plunging through a dark stretch of woods they came out upon the river at the ford  a drowned man lay on his back on the sandbar staring upward unblinking at the sun  a man in irritated tones was questioning over and over wheres his pardner  aint he got a pardner  two more men had thrown off their packs and were coolly taking an inventory of the dead mans possessions  one called aloud the various articles while the other checked them off on a piece of dirty wrappingpaper  letters and receipts wet and pulpy strewed the sand  a few gold coins were heaped carelessly on a white handkerchief  other men crossing back and forth in canoes and skiffs took no notice  the scandinavians glanced at the sight and their faces sobered for a moment  wheres his pardner  aint he got a pardner the irritated man demanded of them  they shook their heads  they did not understand english  they stepped into the water and splashed onward  some one called warningly from the opposite bank whereat they stood still and conferred together  then they started on again  the two men taking the inventory turned to watch  the current rose nigh to their hips but it was swift and they staggered while now and again the cart slipped sideways with the stream  the worst was over and frona found herself holding her breath  the water had sunk to the knees of the two foremost men when a strap snapped on one nearest the cart  his pack swung suddenly to the side overbalancing him  at the same instant the man next to him slipped and each jerked the other under  the next two were whipped off their feet while the cart turning over swept from the bottom of the ford into the deep water  the two men who had almost emerged threw themselves backward on the pullropes  the effort was heroic but giants though they were the task was too great and they were dragged inch by inch downward and under  their packs held them to the bottom save him whose strap had broken this one struck out not to the shore but down the stream striving to keep up with his comrades  a couple of hundred feet below the rapid dashed over a toothedreef of rocks and here a minute later they appeared  the cart still loaded showed first smashing a wheel and turning over and over into the next plunge  the men followed in a miserable tangle  they were beaten against the submerged rocks and swept on all but one  frona in a canoe a dozen canoes were already in pursuit saw him grip the rock with bleeding fingers  she saw his white face and the agony of the effort but his hold relaxed and he was jerked away just as his free comrade swimming mightily was reaching for him  hidden from sight they took the next plunge showing for a second still struggling at the shallow foot of the rapid  a canoe picked up the swimming man but the rest disappeared in a long stretch of swift deep water  for a quarter of an hour the canoes plied fruitlessly about then found the dead men gently grounded in an eddy  a towrope was requisitioned from an upcoming boat and a pair of horses from a packtrain on the bank and the ghastly jetsam hauled ashore  frona looked at the five young giants lying in the mud brokenboned limp uncaring  they were still harnessed to the cart and the poor worthless packs still clung to their backs the sixth sat in the midst dryeyed and stunned  a dozen feet away the steady flood of life flowed by and frona melted into it and went on   the dark spruceshrouded mountains drew close together in the dyea canyon and the feet of men churned the wet sunless earth into mire and boghole  and when they had done this they sought new paths till there were many paths  and on such a path frona came upon a man spread carelessly in the mud  he lay on his side legs apart and one arm buried beneath him pinned down by a bulky pack  his cheek was pillowed restfully in the ooze and on his face there was an expression of content  he brightened when he saw her and his eyes twinkled cheerily  bout time you hove along he greeted her  been waitin an hour on you as it is  thats it as frona bent over him  just unbuckle that strap  the pesky thing  twas just out o my reach all the time  are you hurt she asked  he slipped out of his straps shook himself and felt the twisted arm nope  sound as a dollar thank you  and no kick to register either  he reached over and wiped his muddy hands on a lowbowed spruce  just my luck but i got a good rest so whats the good of makin a beef about it  you see i tripped on that little root there and slip slump slam and slushthere i was down and out and the buckle just out o reach  and there i lay for a blasted hour everybody hitting the lower path  but why didnt you call out to them  and make em climb up the hill to me  them all tuckered out with their own work  not on your life  wasnt serious enough  if any other man d make me climb up just because hed slipped down id take him out o the mud all right all right and punch and punch him back into the mud again  besides i knew somebody was bound to come along my way after a while  oh youll do she cried appropriating del bishops phrase  youll do for this country  yep he called back shouldering his pack and starting off at a lively clip  and anyway i got a good rest  the trail dipped through a precipitous morass to the rivers brink  a slender pinetree spanned the screaming foam and bent midway to touch the water  the surge beat upon the taper trunk and gave it a rhythmical swaying motion while the feet of the packers had worn smooth its wavewashed surface  eighty feet it stretched in ticklish insecurity  frona stepped upon it felt it move beneath her heard the bellowing of the water saw the mad rushand shrank back  she slipped the knot of her shoelaces and pretended great care in the tying thereof as a bunch of indians came out of the woods above and down through the mud  three or four bucks led the way followed by many squaws all bending in the headstraps to the heavy packs  behind came the children burdened according to their years and in the rear half a dozen dogs tongues lagging out and dragging forward painfully under their several loads  the men glanced at her sideways and one of them said something in an undertone   frona could not hear but the snicker which went down the line brought the flush of shame to her brow and told her more forcibly than could the words  her face was hot for she sat disgraced in her own sight but she gave no sign  the leader stood aside and one by one and never more than one at a time they made the perilous passage at the bend in the middle their weight forced the tree under and they felt for their footing up to the ankles in the cold driving torrent even the little children made it without hesitancy and then the dogs whining and reluctant but urged on by the man  when the last had crossed over he turned to frona  um horse trail he said pointing up the mountain side  much better you take um horse trail  more far much better  but she shook her head and waited till he reached the farther bank for she felt the call not only upon her own pride but upon the pride of her race and it was a greater demand than her demand just as the race was greater than she  so she put foot upon the log and with the eyes of the alien people upon her walked down into the foamwhite swirl   she came upon a man weeping by the side of the trail  his pack clumsily strapped sprawled on the ground  he had taken off a shoe and one naked foot showed swollen and blistered  what is the matter she asked halting before him  he looked up at her then down into the depths where the dyea river cut the gloomy darkness with its living silver  the tears still welled in his eyes and he sniffled  what is the matter she repeated  can i be of any help  no he replied  how can you help  my feet are raw and my back is nearly broken and i am all tired out  can you help any of these things  well judiciously i am sure it might be worse  think of the men who have just landed on the beach  it will take them ten days or two weeks to backtrip their outfits as far as you have already got yours  but my partners have left me and gone on he moaned a sneaking appeal for pity in his voice  and i am all alone and i dont feel able to move another step  and then think of my wife and babies  i left them down in the states  oh if they could only see me now  i cant go back to them and i cant go on  its too much for me  i cant stand it this working like a horse  i was not made to work like a horse  ill die i know i will if i do  oh what shall i do  what shall i do  why did your comrades leave you  because i was not so strong as they because i could not pack as much or as long  and they laughed at me and left me  have you ever roughed it frona asked  no  you look well put up and strong  weigh probably one hundred and sixtyfive  one hundredand seventy he corrected  you dont look as though you had ever been troubled with sickness never an invalid  nno  and your comrades  they are miners  never mining in their lives  they worked in the same establishment with me  thats what makes it so hard dont you see  wed known one another for years  and to go off and leave me just because i couldnt keep up  my friend and frona knew she was speaking for the race you are strong as they  you can work just as hard as they pack as much  but you are weak of heart  this is no place for the weak of heart  you cannot work like a horse because you will not  therefore the country has no use for you  the north wants strong menstrong of soul not body  the body does not count  so go back to the states  we do not want you here  if you come you will die and what then of your wife and babies  so sell out your outfit and go back  you will be home in three weeks  goodby   she passed through sheep camp  somewhere above a mighty glacier under the pent pressure of a subterranean reservoir had burst asunder and hurled a hundred thousand tons of ice and water down the rocky gorge  the trail was yet slippery with the slime of the flood and men were rummaging disconsolately in the rubbish of overthrown tents and caches  but here and there they worked with nervous haste and the stark corpses by the trailside attested dumbly to their labor  a few hundred yards beyond the work of the rush went on uninterrupted  men rested their packs on jutting stones swapped escapes whilst they regained their breath then stumbled on to their toil again   the midday sun beat down upon the stone scales  the forest had given up the struggle and the dizzying heat recoiled from the unclothed rock  on either hand rose the icemarred ribs of earth naked and strenuous in their nakedness  above towered stormbeaten chilcoot  up its gaunt and ragged front crawled a slender string of men  but it was an endless string  it came out of the last fringe of dwarfed shrub below drew a black line across a dazzling stretch of ice and filed past frona where she ate her lunch by the way  and it went on up the pitch of the steep growing fainter and smaller till it squirmed and twisted like a column of ants and vanished over the crest of the pass  even as she looked chilcoot was wrapped in rolling mist and whirling cloud and a storm of sleet and wind roared down upon the toiling pigmies  the light was swept out of the day and a deep gloom prevailed but frona knew that somewhere up there clinging and climbing and immortally striving the long line of ants still twisted towards the sky  and she thrilled at the thought strong with mans ancient love of mastery and stepped into the line which came out of the storm behind and disappeared into the storm before  she blew through the gap of the pass in a whirlwind of vapor with hand and foot clambered down the volcanic ruin of chilcoots mighty father and stood on the bleak edge of the lake which filled the pit of the crater  the lake was angry and whitecapped and though a hundred caches were waiting ferriage no boats were plying back and forth  a rickety skeleton of sticks in a shell of greased canvas lay upon the rocks  frona sought out the owner a brightfaced young fellow with sharp black eyes and a salient jaw  yes he was the ferryman but he had quit work for the day  water too rough for freighting  he charged twentyfive dollars for passengers but he was not taking passengers today  had he not said it was too rough  that was why  but you will take me surely she asked  he shook his head and gazed out over the lake  at the far end its rougher than you see it here  even the big wooden boats wont tackle it  the last that tried with a gang of packers aboard was blown over on the west shore  we could see them plainly  and as theres no trail around from there theyll have to camp it out till the blow is over  but theyre better off than i am  my camp outfit is at happy camp and i cant very well stay here frona smiled winsomely but there was no appeal in the smile no feminine helplessness throwing itself on the strength and chivalry of the male  do reconsider and take me across  no  ill give you fifty  no i say  but im not afraid you know  the young fellows eyes flashed angrily  he turned upon her suddenly but on second thought did not utter the words forming on his lips  she realized the unintentional slur she had cast and was about to explain but on second thought she too remained silent for she read him and knew that it was perhaps the only way for her to gain her point  they stood there bodies inclined to the storm in the manner of seamen on sloped decks unyieldingly looking into each others eyes  his hair was plastered in wet ringlets on his forehead while hers in longer wisps beat furiously about her face  come on then  he flung the boat into the water with an angry jerk and tossed the oars aboard  climb in  ill take you but not for your fifty dollars  you pay the regulation price and thats all  a gust of the gale caught the light shell and swept it broadside for a score of feet  the spray drove inboard in a continuous stinging shower and frona at once fell to work with the bailingcan  i hope were blown ashore he shouted stooping forward to the oars it would be embarrassingfor you he looked up savagely into her face  no she modified but it would be very miserable for both of usa night without tent blankets or fire  besides were not going to blow ashore   she stepped out on the slippery rocks and helped him heave up the canvas craft and tilt the water out  on either side uprose bare wet walls of rock  a heavy sleet was falling steadily through which a few streaming caches showed in the gathering darkness  youd better hurry up he advised thanking her for the assistance and relaunching the boat  two miles of stiff trail from here to happy camp  no wood until you get there so youd best hustle along goodby  frona reached out and took his hand and said you are a brave man  oh i dont know  he returned the grip with usury and looked his admiration   a dozen tents held grimly to their pegs on the extreme edge of the timber line at happy camp  frona weary with the day went from tent to tent  her wet skirts clung heavily to her tired limbs while the wind buffeted her brutally about  once through a canvas wall she heard a man apostrophizing gorgeously and felt sure that it was del bishop  but a peep into the interior told a different tale so she wandered fruitlessly on till she reached the last tent in the camp she untied the flap and looked in  a spluttering candle showed the one occupant a man down on his knees and blowing lustily into the firebox of a smoky yukon stove     chapter iv  she cast off the lower flapfastenings and entered  the man still blew into the stove unaware of his company  frona coughed and he raised a pair of smokereddened eyes to hers  certainly he said casually enough  fasten the flaps and make yourself comfortable  and thereat returned to his borean task  hospitable to say the least she commented to herself obeying his command and coming up to the stove  a heap of dwarfed spruce gnarled and wet and cut to proper stovelength lay to one side  frona knew it well creeping and crawling and twisting itself among the rocks of the shallow alluvial deposit unlike its arboreal prototype rarely lifting its head more than a foot from the earth  she looked into the oven found it empty and filled it with the wet wood  the man arose to his feet coughing from the smoke which had been driven into his lungs and nodding approval  when he had recovered his breath sit down and dry your skirts  ill get supper  he put a coffeepot on the front lid of the stove emptied the bucket into it and went out of the tent after more water  as his back disappeared frona dived for her satchel and when he returned a moment later he found her with a dry skirt on and wringing the wet one out while he fished about in the grubbox for dishes and eating utensils she stretched a spare bit of rope between the tentpoles and hung the skirt on it to dry  the dishes were dirty and as he bent over and washed them she turned her back and deftly changed her stockings  her childhood had taught her the value of wellcared feet for the trail she put her wet shoes on a pile of wood at the back of the stove substituting for them a pair of soft and dainty housemoccasins of indian make  the fire had now grown strong and she was content to let her undergarments dry on her body  during all this time neither had spoken a word  not only had the man remained silent but he went about his work in so preoccupied a way that it seemed to frona that he turned a deaf ear to the words of explanation she would have liked to utter  his whole bearing conveyed the impression that it was the most ordinary thing under the sun for a young woman to come in out of the storm and night and partake of his hospitality  in one way she liked this but in so far as she did not comprehend it she was troubled  she had a perception of a something being taken for granted which she did not understand  once or twice she moistened her lips to speak but he appeared so oblivious of her presence that she withheld  after opening a can of corned beef with the axe he fried half a dozen thick slices of bacon set the fryingpan back and boiled the coffee from the grubbox he resurrected the half of a cold heavy flapjack  he looked at it dubiously and shot a quick glance at her  then he threw the sodden thing out of doors and dumped the contents of a seabiscuit bag upon a camp cloth  the seabiscuit had been crumbled into chips and fragments and generously soaked by the rain till it had become a mushy pulpy mass of dirty white  its all i have in the way of bread he muttered but sit down and we will make the best of it  one moment  and before he could protest frona had poured the seabiscuit into the fryingpan on top of the grease and bacon  to this she added a couple of cups of water and stirred briskly over the fire  when it had sobbed and sighed with the heat for some few minutes she sliced up the corned beef and mixed it in with the rest and by the time she had seasoned it heavily with salt and black pepper a savory steam was rising from the concoction  must say its pretty good stuff he said balancing his plate on his knee and sampling the mess avidiously  what do you happen to call it  slumgullion she responded curtly and thereafter the meal went on in silence  frona helped him to the coffee studying him intently the while  and not only was it not an unpleasant face she decided but it was strong strong she amended potentially rather than actually  a student she added for she had seen many students eyes and knew the lasting impress of the midnight oil long continued and his eyes bore the impress  brown eyes she concluded and handsome as the males should be handsome but she noted with surprise when she refilled his plate with slumgullion that they were not at all brown in the ordinary sense but hazelbrown  in the daylight she felt certain and in times of best health they would seem gray and almost bluegray  she knew it well her one girl chum and dearest friend had had such an eye  his hair was chestnutbrown glinting in the candlelight to gold and the hint of waviness in it explained the perceptible droop to his tawny moustache  for the rest his face was cleanshaven and cut on a good masculine pattern  at first she found fault with the more than slight cheekhollows under the cheekbones but when she measured his wellknit slenderly muscular figure with its deep chest and heavy shoulders she discovered that she preferred the hollows at least they did not imply lack of nutrition  the body gave the lie to that while they themselves denied the vice of overfeeding  height five feet nine she summed up from out of her gymnasium experience and age anywhere between twentyfive and thirty though nearer the former most likely  havent many blankets he said abruptly pausing to drain his cup and set it over on the grubbox  i dont expect my indians back from lake linderman till morning and the beggars have packed over everything except a few sacks of flour and the bare camp outfit  however ive a couple of heavy ulsters which will serve just as well  he turned his back as though he did not expect a reply and untied a rubbercovered roll of blankets  then he drew the two ulsters from a clothesbag and threw them down on the bedding  vaudeville artist i suppose  he asked the question seemingly without interest as though to keep the conversation going and in fact as if he knew the stereotyped answer beforehand  but to frona the question was like a blow in the face she remembered neepoosas philippic against the white women who were coming into the land and realized the falseness of her position and the way in which he looked upon her  but he went on before she could speak  last night i had two vaudeville queens and three the night before  only there was more bedding then  its unfortunate isnt it the aptitude they display in getting lost from their outfits  yet somehow i have failed to find any lost outfits so far  and they are all queens it seems  no understudies or minor turns about themno no  and i presume you are a queen too  the tooready blood sprayed her cheek and this made her angrier than did he for whereas she was sure of the steady grip she had on herself her flushed face betokened a confusion which did not really possess her  no she answered coolly i am not a vaudeville artist  he tossed several sacks of flour to one side of the stove without replying and made of them the foundation of a bed and with the remaining sacks he duplicated the operation on the opposite side of the stove  but you are some kind of an artist then he insisted when he had finished with an open contempt on the artist  unfortunately i am not any kind of an artist at all  he dropped the blanket he was folding and straightened his back hitherto he had no more than glanced at her but now he scrutinized her carefully every inch of her from head to heel and back again the cut of her garments and the very way she did her hair  and he took his time about it  oh  i beg pardon was his verdict followed by another stare  then you are a very foolish woman dreaming of fortune and shutting your eyes to the dangers of the pilgrimage  it is only meet that two kinds of women come into this country  those who by virtue of wifehood and daughterhood are respectable and those who are not respectable vaudeville stars and artists they call themselves for the sake of decency and out of courtesy we countenance it  yes yes i know  but remember the women who come over the trail must be one or the other there is no middle course and those who attempt it are bound to fail so you are a very very foolish girl and you had better turn back while there is yet a chance  if you will view it in the light of a loan from a stranger i will advance your passage back to the states and start an indian over the trail with you tomorrow for dyea  once or twice frona had attempted to interrupt him but he had waved her imperatively to silence with his hand  i thank you she began but he broke in  oh not at all not at all  i thank you she repeated but it happens thatathat you are mistaken  i have just come over the trail from dyea and expect to meet my outfit already in camp here at happy camp  they started hours ahead of me and i cant understand how i passed themyes i do too  a boat was blown over to the west shore of crater lake this afternoon and they must have been in it  that is where i missed them and came on as for my turning back i appreciate your motive for suggesting it but my father is in dawson and i have not seen him for three years  also i have come through from dyea this day and am tired and i would like to get some rest  so if you still extend your hospitality ill go to bed  impossible  he kicked the blankets to one side sat down on the flour sacks and directed a blank look upon her  areare there any women in the other tents she asked hesitatingly i did not see any but i may have overlooked  a man and his wife were but they pulled stakes this morning  no there are no other women exceptexcept two or three in a tent whicherwhich will not do for you  do you think i am afraid of their hospitality she demanded hotly as you said they are women  but i said it would not do he answered absently staring at the straining canvas and listening to the roar of the storm  a man would die in the open on a night like this  and the other tents are crowded to the walls he mused  i happen to know  they have stored all their caches inside because of the water and they havent room to turn around  besides a dozen other strangers are stormbound with them  two or three asked to spread their beds in here tonight if they couldnt pinch room elsewhere  evidently they have but that does not argue that there is any surplus space left and anyway  he broke off helplessly  the inevitableness of the situation was growing  can i make deep lake tonight frona asked forgetting herself to sympathize with him then becoming conscious of what she was doing and bursting into laughter  but you couldnt ford the river in the dark  he frowned at her levity  and there are no camps between  are you afraid she asked with just the shadow of a sneer  not for myself  well then i think ill go to bed  i might sit up and keep the fire going he suggested after a pause  fiddlesticks she cried  as though your foolish little code were saved in the least  we are not in civilization  this is the trail to the pole  go to bed  he elevated his shoulders in token of surrender  agreed  what shall i do then  help me make my bed of course  sacks laid crosswise  thank you sir but i have bones and muscles that rebel  here  pull them around this way  under her direction he laid the sacks lengthwise in a double row  this left an uncomfortable hollow with lumpy sackcorners down the middle but she smote them flat with the side of the axe and in the same manner lessened the slope to the walls of the hollow  then she made a triple longitudinal fold in a blanket and spread it along the bottom of the long depression  hum he soliloquized  now i see why i sleep so badly  here goes and he speedily flung his own sacks into shape  it is plain you are unused to the trail she informed him spreading the topmost blanket and sitting down  perhaps so he made answer  but what do you know about this trail life he growled a little later  enough to conform she rejoined equivocally pulling out the dried wood from the oven and replacing it with wet  listen to it  how it storms he exclaimed  its growing worse if worse be possible  the tent reeled under the blows of the wind the canvas booming hollowly at every shock while the sleet and rain rattled overhead like skirmishfire grown into a battle  in the lulls they could hear the water streaming off at the sidewalls with the noise of small cataracts   he reached up curiously and touched the wet roof  a burst of water followed instantly at the point of contact and coursed down upon the grubbox  you mustnt do that frona cried springing to her feet  she put her finger on the spot and pressing tightly against the canvas ran it down to the sidewall  the leak at once stopped  you mustnt do it you know she reproved  jove was his reply  and you came through from dyea today  arent you stiff  quite a bit she confessed candidly and sleepy  goodnight she called to him several minutes later stretching her body luxuriously in the warm blankets  and a quarter of an hour after that oh i say  are you awake  yes his voice came muffled across the stove  what is it  have you the shavings cut  shavings he queried sleepily  what shavings  for the fire in the morning of course  so get up and cut them  he obeyed without a word but ere he was done she had ceased to hear him  the ubiquitous bacon was abroad on the air when she opened her eyes day had broken and with it the storm  the wet sun was shining cheerily over the drenched landscape and in at the widespread flaps already work had begun and groups of men were filing past under their packs  frona turned over on her side  breakfast was cooked  her host had just put the bacon and fried potatoes in the oven and was engaged in propping the door ajar with two sticks of firewood  goodmorning she greeted  and goodmorning to you he responded rising to his feet and picking up the waterbucket  i dont hope that you slept well for i know you did  frona laughed  im going out after some water he vouchsafed  and when i return i shall expect you ready for breakfast  after breakfast basking herself in the sun frona descried a familiar bunch of men rounding the tail of the glacier in the direction of crater lake  she clapped her hands  there comes my outfit and del bishop as shamefaced as can be im sure at his failure to connect  turning to the man and at the same time slinging camera and satchel over her shoulder so i must say goodby not forgetting to thank you for your kindness  oh not at all not at all  pray dont mention it  id do the same for any  vaudeville artist  he looked his reproach but went on  i dont know your name nor do i wish to know it  well i shall not be so harsh for i do know your name mister vance corliss  i saw it on the shipping tags of course she explained and i want you to come and see me when you get to dawson  my name is frona welse  goodby  your father is not jacob welse he called after her as she ran lightly down towards the trail  she turned her head and nodded  but del bishop was not shamefaced nor even worried  trust a welse to land on their feet on a soft spot he had consoled himself as he dropped off to sleep the night before  but he was angrymadder n hops in his own vernacular  goodmornin he saluted  and its plain by your face you had a comfortable night of it and no thanks to me  you werent worried were you she asked  worried  about a welse  who  me  not on your life  i was too busy tellin crater lake what i thought of it  i dont like the water  i told you so  and its always playin me scurvynot that im afraid of it though  hey you pete turning to the indians  hit er up  got to make linderman by noon  frona welse vance corliss was repeating to himself  the whole thing seemed a dream and he reassured himself by turning and looking after her retreating form  del bishop and the indians were already out of sight behind a wall of rock  frona was just rounding the base  the sun was full upon her and she stood out radiantly against the black shadow of the wall beyond  she waved her alpenstock and as he doffed his cap rounded the brink and disappeared     chapter v  the position occupied by jacob welse was certainly an anomalous one he was a giant trader in a country without commerce a ripened product of the nineteenth century flourishing in a society as primitive as that of the mediterranean vandals  a captain of industry and a splendid monopolist he dominated the most independent aggregate of men ever drawn together from the ends of the earth  an economic missionary a commercial st paul he preached the doctrines of expediency and force believing in the natural rights of man a child himself of democracy he bent all men to his absolutism  government of jacob welse for jacob welse and the people by jacob welse was his unwritten gospel singlehanded he had carved out his dominion till he gripped the domain of a dozen roman provinces  at his ukase the population ebbed and flowed over a hundred thousand miles of territory and cities sprang up or disappeared at his bidding  yet he was a common man  the air of the world first smote his lungs on the open prairie by the river platte the blue sky over head and beneath the green grass of the earth pressing against his tender nakedness  on the horses his eyes first opened still saddled and gazing in mild wonder on the miracle for his trapper father had but turned aside from the trail that the wife might have quiet and the birth be accomplished  an hour or so and the two which were now three were in the saddle and overhauling their trapper comrades  the party had not been delayed no time lost  in the morning his mother cooked the breakfast over the campfire and capped it with a fiftymile ride into the next sundown  the trapper father had come of the sturdy welsh stock which trickled into early ohio out of the jostling east and the mother was a nomadic daughter of the irish emigrant settlers of ontario  from both sides came the wanderlust of the blood the fever to be moving to be pushing on to the edge of things  in the first year of his life ere he had learned the way of his legs jacob welse had wandered ahorse through a thousand miles of wilderness and wintered in a huntinglodge on the headwaters of the red river of the north  his first footgear was moccasins his first taffy the tallow from a moose  his first generalizations were that the world was composed of great wastes and white vastnesses and populated with indians and white hunters like his father  a town was a cluster of deerskin lodges a tradingpost a seat of civilization and a factor god almighty himself  rivers and lakes existed chiefly for mans use in travelling  viewed in this light the mountains puzzled him but he placed them away in his classification of the inexplicable and did not worry  men died sometimes  but their meat was not good to eat and their hides worthlessperhaps because they did not grow fur  pelts were valuable and with a few bales a man might purchase the earth  animals were made for men to catch and skin  he did not know what men were made for unless perhaps for the factor  as he grew older he modified these concepts but the process was a continual source of naive apprehension and wonderment  it was not until he became a man and had wandered through half the cities of the states that this expression of childish wonder passed out of his eyes and left them wholly keen and alert  at his boys first contact with the cities while he revised his synthesis of things he also generalized afresh  people who lived in cities were effeminate  they did not carry the points of the compass in their heads and they got lost easily  that was why they elected to stay in the cities  because they might catch cold and because they were afraid of the dark they slept under shelter and locked their doors at night  the women were soft and pretty but they could not lift a snowshoe far in a days journey  everybody talked too much  that was why they lied and were unable to work greatly with their hands  finally there was a new human force called bluff  a man who made a bluff must be dead sure of it or else be prepared to back it up  bluff was a very good thingwhen exercised with discretion  later though living his life mainly in the woods and mountains he came to know that the cities were not all bad that a man might live in a city and still be a man  accustomed to do battle with natural forces he was attracted by the commercial battle with social forces the masters of marts and exchanges dazzled but did not blind him and he studied them and strove to grasp the secrets of their strength and further in token that some good did come out of nazareth in the full tide of manhood he took to himself a citybred woman  but he still yearned for the edge of things and the leaven in his blood worked till they went away and above the dyea beach on the rim of the forest built the big log tradingpost  and here in the mellow of time he got a proper focus on things and unified the phenomena of society precisely as he had already unified the phenomena of nature there was naught in one which could not be expressed in terms of the other  the same principles underlaid both the same truths were manifest of both  competition was the secret of creation  battle was the law and the way of progress  the world was made for the strong and only the strong inherited it and through it all there ran an eternal equity  to be honest was to be strong  to sin was to weaken to bluff an honest man was to be dishonest  to bluff a bluffer was to smite with the steel of justice  the primitive strength was in the arm the modern strength in the brain  though it had shifted ground the struggle was the same old struggle  as of old time men still fought for the mastery of the earth and the delights thereof  but the sword had given way to the ledger the mailclad baron to the softgarbed industrial lord and the centre of imperial political power to the seat of commercial exchanges  the modern will had destroyed the ancient brute  the stubborn earth yielded only to force  brain was greater than body  the man with the brain could best conquer things primitive  he did not have much education as education goes  to the three rs his mother taught him by campfire and candlelight he had added a somewhat miscellaneous bookknowledge but he was not burdened with what he had gathered  yet he read the facts of life understandingly and the sobriety which comes of the soil was his and the clear earthvision  and so it came about that jacob welse crossed over the chilcoot in an early day and disappeared into the vast unknown  a year later he emerged at the russian missions clustered about the mouth of the yukon on bering sea  he had journeyed down a river three thousand miles long he had seen things and dreamed a great dream  but he held his tongue and went to work and one day the defiant whistle of a crazy sternwheel tub saluted the midnight sun on the dank riverstretch by fort o yukon  it was a magnificent adventure  how he achieved it only jacob welse can tell but with the impossible to begin with plus the impossible he added steamer to steamer and heaped enterprise upon enterprise  along many a thousand miles of river and tributary he built tradingposts and warehouses  he forced the white mans axe into the hands of the aborigines and in every village and between the villages rose the cords of fourfoot firewood for his boilers  on an island in bering sea where the river and the ocean meet he established a great distributing station and on the north pacific he put big ocean steamships while in his offices in seattle and san francisco it took clerks by the score to keep the order and system of his business  men drifted into the land  hitherto famine had driven them out but jacob welse was there now and his grubstores so they wintered in the frost and groped in the frozen muck for gold  he encouraged them grubstaked them carried them on the books of the company  his steamers dragged them up the koyokuk in the old days of arctic city wherever pay was struck he built a warehouse and a store  the town followed  he explored he speculated he developed  tireless indomitable with the steelglitter in his dark eyes he was everywhere at once doing all things  in the opening up of a new river he was in the van and at the tailend also hurrying forward the grub  on the outside he fought tradecombinations made alliances with the corporations of the earth and forced discriminating tariffs from the great carriers  on the inside he sold flour and blankets and tobacco built sawmills staked townsites and sought properties in copper iron and coal and that the miners should be wellequipped ransacked the lands of the arctic even as far as siberia for nativemade snowshoes muclucs and parkas  he bore the country on his shoulders saw to its needs did its work every ounce of its dust passed through his hands every postcard and letter of credit  he did its banking and exchange carried and distributed its mails  he frowned upon competition frightened out predatory capital bluffed militant syndicates and when they would not backed his bluff and broke them  and for all yet found time and place to remember his motherless girl and to love her and to fit her for the position he had made     chapter vi  so i think captain you will agree that we must exaggerate the seriousness of the situation  jacob welse helped his visitor into his fur greatcoat and went on  not that it is not serious but that it may not become more serious  both you and i have handled famines before  we must frighten them and frighten them now before it is too late  take five thousand men out of dawson and there will be grub to last  let those five thousand carry their tale of famine to dyea and skaguay and they will prevent five thousand more coming in over the ice  quite right  and you may count on the hearty cooperation of the police mr welse  the speaker a strongfaced grizzled man heavyset and of military bearing pulled up his collar and rested his hand on the doorknob  i see already thanks to you the newcomers are beginning to sell their outfits and buy dogs  lord wont there be a stampede out over the ice as soon as the river closes down  and each that sells a thousand pounds of grub and goes lessens the proposition by one empty stomach and fills another that remains  when does the laura start  this morning with three hundred grubless men aboard  would that they were three thousand  amen to that  and by the way when does your daughter arrive  most any day now  jacob welses eyes warmed  and i want you to dinner when she does and bring along a bunch of your young bucks from the barracks  i dont know all their names but just the same extend the invitation as though from me personally  i havent cultivated the social side muchno time but see to it that the girl enjoys herself fresh from the states and london and shes liable to feel lonesome you understand  jacob welse closed the door tilted his chair back and cocked his feet on the guardrail of the stove  for one halfminute a girlish vision wavered in the shimmering air above the stove then merged into a woman of fair saxon type  the door opened  mr welse mr foster sent me to find out if he is to go on filling signed warehouse orders  certainly mr smith  but tell him to scale them down by half  if a man holds an order for a thousand pounds give him five hundred  he lighted a cigar and tilted back again in his chair  captain mcgregor wants to see you sir  send him in  captain mcgregor strode in and remained standing before his employer the rough hand of the new world had been laid upon the scotsman from his boyhood but sterling honesty was written in every line of his bitterseamed face while a prognathous jaw proclaimed to the onlooker that honesty was the best policyfor the onlooker at any rate should he wish to do business with the owner of the jaw  this warning was backed up by the nose sidetwisted and broken and by a long scar which ran up the forehead and disappeared in the graygrizzled hair  we throw off the lines in an hour sir so ive come for the last word  good  jacob welse whirled his chair about  captain mcgregor  ay  i had other work cut out for you this winter but i have changed my mind and chosen you to go down with the laura  can you guess why  captain mcgregor swayed his weight from one leg to the other and a shrewd chuckle of a smile wrinkled the corners of his eyes  going to be trouble he grunted  and i couldnt have picked a better man  mr bally will give you detailed instructions as you go aboard  but let me say this if we cant scare enough men out of the country therell be need for every pound of grub at fort yukon  understand  ay  so no extravagance  you are taking three hundred men down with you the chances are that twice as many more will go down as soon as the river freezes  youll have a thousand to feed through the winter  put them on rationsworking rationsand see that they work  cordwood six dollars per cord and piled on the bank where steamers can make a landing  no work no rations  understand  ay  a thousand men can get ugly if they are idle  they can get ugly anyway  watch out they dont rush the caches  if they dodo your duty  the other nodded grimly  his hands gripped unconsciously while the scar on his forehead took on a livid hue  there are five steamers in the ice  make them safe against the spring breakup  but first transfer all their cargoes to one big cache  you can defend it better and make the cache impregnable  send a messenger down to fort burr asking mr carter for three of his men  he doesnt need them  nothing much is doing at circle city  stop in on the way down and take half of mr burdwells men  youll need them  therell be gunfighters in plenty to deal with  be stiff  keep things in check from the start  remember the man who shoots first comes off with the whole hide  and keep a constant eye on the grub  and on the fortyfivenineties captain mcgregor rumbled back as he passed out the door  john meltonmr melton sir  can he see you  see here welse whats this mean  john melton followed wrathfully on the heels of the clerk and he almost walked over him as he flourished a paper before the head of the company  read that  whats it stand for  jacob welse glanced over it and looked up coolly  one thousand pounds of grub  thats what i say but that fellow youve got in the warehouse says nofive hundreds all its good for  he spoke the truth  but  it stands for one thousand pounds but in the warehouse it is only good for five hundred  that your signature thrusting the receipt again into the others line of vision  yes  then what are you going to do about it  give you five hundred  what are you going to do about it  refuse to take it  very good  there is no further discussion  yes there is  i propose to have no further dealings with you  im rich enough to freight my own stuff in over the passes and i will next year  our business stops right now and for all time  i cannot object to that  you have three hundred thousand dollars in dust deposited with me  go to mr atsheler and draw it at once  the man fumed impotently up and down  cant i get that other five hundred  great god man  ive paid for it  you dont intend me to starve  look here melton  jacob welse paused to knock the ash from his cigar  at this very moment what are you working for  what are you trying to get  a thousand pounds of grub  for your own stomach  the bonanzo king nodded his head  just so  the lines showed more sharply on jacob welses forehead you are working for your own stomach  i am working for the stomachs of twenty thousand  but you filled tim mcreadys thousand pounds yesterday all right  the scaledown did not go into effect until today  but why am i the one to get it in the neck hard  why didnt you come yesterday and tim mcready today  meltons face went blank and jacob welse answered his own question with shrugging shoulders  thats the way it stands melton  no favoritism  if you hold me responsible for tim mcready i shall hold you responsible for not coming yesterday  better we both throw it upon providence  you went through the forty mile famine you are a white man  a bonanzo property or a block of bonanzo properties does not entitle you to a pound more than the oldest penniless sourdough or the newest baby born  trust me  as long as i have a pound of grub you shall not starve  stiffen up  shake hands  get a smile on your face and make the best of it  still savage of spirit though rapidly toning down the king shook hands and flung out of the room  before the door could close on his heels a loosejointed yankee shambled in thrust a moccasined foot to the side and hooked a chair under him and sat down  say he opened up confidentially peoples gittin scairt over the grub proposition i guess some  hello dave  that you  spose so  but ez i was saying therell be a lively stampede fer the outside soon as the river freezes  think so  unh huh  then im glad to hear it  its what the country needs  going to join them  not in a thousand years  dave harney threw his head back with smug complacency  freighted my truck up to the mine yesterday  want a bit too soon about it either  but say     suthin happened to the sugar  had it all on the last sled an jest where the trail turns off the klondike into bonanzo what does that sled do but break through the ice  i never seen the beat of itthe last sled of all an all the sugar  so i jest thought id drop in today an git a hundred pounds or so  white or brown i aint pertickler  jacob welse shook his head and smiled but harney hitched his chair closer  the clerk of yourn said he didnt know an ez there want no call to pester him i said id jest drop round an see you  i dont care what its wuth  make it a hundred even thatll do me handy  say he went on easily noting the decidedly negative poise of the others head  ive got a tolerable sweet tooth i have  recollect the taffy i made over on preacher creek that time  i declare how time does fly  that was all of six years ago if its a day  moren that surely  seven by the jimcracky  but ez i was sayin id ruther do without my plug of star than sugar  an about that sugar  got my dogs outside  better go round to the warehouse an git it eh  pretty good idea  but he saw the no shaping on jacob welses lips and hurried on before it could be uttered  now i dont want to hog it  wouldnt do that fer the world  so if yer short i can put up with seventyfive he studied the others face an i might do with fifty  i preciate your position an i aint lowdown critter enough to pester  whats the good of spilling words dave  we havent a pound of sugar to spare  ez i was sayin i aint no hog an seein s its you welse ill make to scrimp along on twentyfive  not an ounce  not the least leetle mite  well well dont git het up  well jest fergit i ast you fer any an ill drop round some likelier time  so long  say  he threw his jaw to one side and seemed to stiffen the muscles of his ear as he listened intently  thats the lauras whistle  shes startin soon  goin to see her off  come along  jacob welse pulled on his bearskin coat and mittens and they passed through the outer offices into the main store  so large was it that the tenscore purchasers before the counters made no apparent crowd many were seriousfaced and more than one looked darkly at the head of the company as he passed  the clerks were selling everything except grub and it was grub that was in demand  holding it for a rise famine prices a redwhiskered miner sneered  jacob welse heard it but took no notice  he expected to hear it many times and more unpleasantly ere the scare was over  on the sidewalk he stopped to glance over the public bulletins posted against the side of the building  dogs lost found and for sale occupied some space but the rest was devoted to notices of sales of outfits  the timid were already growing frightened  outfits of five hundred pounds were offering at a dollar a pound without flour others with flour at a dollar and a half  jacob welse saw melton talking with an anxiousfaced newcomer and the satisfaction displayed by the bonanzo king told that he had succeeded in filling his winters cache  why dont you smell out the sugar dave jacob welse asked pointing to the bulletins  dave harney looked his reproach  mebbe you think i aint ben smellin  ive clean wore my dogs out chasin round from klondike city to the hospital  cant git yer fingers on it fer love or money  they walked down the blocklong sidewalk past the warehouse doors and the long teams of waiting huskies curled up in wolfish comfort in the snow  it was for this snow the first permanent one of the fall that the miners upcreek had waited to begin their freighting  curious aint it dave hazarded suggestively as they crossed the main street to the river bank  mighty curiousme ownin two fivehundredfoot eldorado claims an a fraction wuth five millions if im wuth a cent an no sweetenin fer my coffee or mush  why goshdangit this country kin go to blazes  ill sell out  ill quit it cold  illillgo back to the states  oh no you wont jacob welse answered  ive heard you talk before  you put in a year up stuart river on straight meat if i havent forgotten  and you ate salmonbelly and dogs up the tanana to say nothing of going through two famines and you havent turned your back on the country yet  and you never will  and youll die here as sure as thats the lauras spring being hauled aboard  and i look forward confidently to the day when i shall ship you out in a leadlined box and burden the san francisco end with the trouble of winding up your estate  you are a fixture and you know it  as he talked he constantly acknowledged greetings from the passersby those who knew him were mainly oldtimers and he knew them all by name though there was scarcely a newcomer to whom his face was not familiar  ill jest bet ill be in paris in 1900 the eldorado king protested feebly  but jacob welse did not hear  there was a jangling of gongs as mcgregor saluted him from the pilothouse and the laura slipped out from the bank  the men on the shore filled the air with goodluck farewells and last advice but the three hundred grubless ones turning their backs on the golden dream were moody and dispirited and made small response  the laura backed out through a channel cut in the shoreice swung about in the current and with a final blast put on full steam ahead  the crowd thinned away and went about its business leaving jacob welse the centre of a group of a dozen or so  the talk was of the famine but it was the talk of men  even dave harney forgot to curse the country for its sugar shortage and waxed facetious over the newcomerschechaquos he called them having recourse to the siwash tongue  in the midst of his remarks his quick eye lighted on a black speck floating down with the mushice of the river  jest look at that he cried  a peterborough canoe runnin the ice  twisting and turning now paddling now shoving clear of the floating cakes the two men in the canoe worked in to the rimice along the edge of which they drifted waiting for an opening  opposite the channel cut out by the steamer they drove their paddles deep and darted into the calm dead water  the waiting group received them with open arms helping them up the bank and carrying their shell after them  in its bottom were two leather mailpouches a couple of blankets coffeepot and fryingpan and a scant grubsack  as for the men so frosted were they and so numb with the cold that they could hardly stand  dave harney proposed whiskey and was for haling them away at once but one delayed long enough to shake stiff hands with jacob welse  shes coming he announced  passed her boat an hour back  it ought to be round the bend any minute  ive got despatches for you but ill see you later  got to get something into me first  turning to go with harney he stopped suddenly and pointed up stream  there she is now  just coming out past the bluff  run along boys an git yer whiskey harney admonished him and his mate  tell m its on me double dose an jest excuse me not drinkin with you fer im goin to stay  the klondike was throwing a thick flow of ice partly mush and partly solid and swept the boat out towards the middle of the yukon  they could see the struggle plainly from the bankfour men standing up and poling a way through the jarring cakes  a yukon stove aboard was sending up a trailing pillar of blue smoke and as the boat drew closer they could see a woman in the stern working the long steeringsweep  at sight of this there was a snap and sparkle in jacob welses eyes  it was the first omen and it was good he thought  she was still a welse a struggler and a fighter  the years of her culture had not weakened her  though tasting of the fruits of the first remove from the soil she was not afraid of the soil she could return to it gleefully and naturally  so he mused till the boat drove in icerimed and battered against the edge of the rimice  the one white man aboard sprang out painter in hand to slow it down and work into the channel  but the rimice was formed of the night and the front of it shelved off with him into the current  the nose of the boat sheered out under the pressure of a heavy cake so that he came up at the stern  the womans arm flashed over the side to his collar and at the same instant sharp and authoritative her voice rang out to the indian oarsmen to back water still holding the mans head above water she threw her body against the sweep and guided the boat sternforemost into the opening  a few more strokes and it grounded at the foot of the bank  she passed the collar of the chattering man to dave harney who dragged him out and started him off on the trail of the mailcarriers  frona stood up her cheeks glowing from the quick work  jacob welse hesitated  though he stood within reach of the gunwale a gulf of three years was between  the womanhood of twenty added unto the girl of seventeen made a sum more prodigious than he had imagined  he did not know whether to bearhug the radiant young creature or to take her hand and help her ashore  but there was no apparent hitch for she leaped beside him and was into his arms  those above looked away to a man till the two came up the bank hand in hand  gentlemen my daughter  there was a great pride in his face  frona embraced them all with a comrade smile and each man felt that for an instant her eyes had looked straight into his     chapter vii  that vance corliss wanted to see more of the girl he had divided blankets with goes with the saying  he had not been wise enough to lug a camera into the country but none the less by a yet subtler process a sunpicture had been recorded somewhere on his cerebral tissues  in the flash of an instant it had been done  a wave message of light and color a molecular agitation and integration a certain minute though definite corrugation in a brain recessand there it was a picture complete  the blazing sunlight on the beetling black a slender gray form radiant starting forward to the vision from the marge where light and darkness met a fresh young morning smile wreathed in a flame of burning gold  it was a picture he looked at often and the more he looked the greater was his desire to see frona welse again  this event he anticipated with a thrill with the exultancy over change which is common of all life  she was something new a fresh type a woman unrelated to all women he had met  out of the fascinating unknown a pair of hazel eyes smiled into his and a hand soft of touch and strong of grip beckoned him  and there was an allurement about it which was as the allurement of sin  not that vance corliss was anybodys fool nor that his had been an anchorites existence but that his upbringing rather had given his life a certain puritanical bent  awakening intelligence and broader knowledge had weakened the early influence of an austere mother but had not wholly eradicated it  it was there deep down very shadowy but still a part of him  he could not get away from it  it distorted ever so slightly his concepts of things  it gave a squint to his perceptions and very often when the sex feminine was concerned determined his classifications  he prided himself on his largeness when he granted that there were three kinds of women  his mother had only admitted two  but he had outgrown her  it was incontestable that there were three kindsthe good the bad and the partly good and partly bad  that the last usually went bad he believed firmly  in its very nature such a condition could not be permanent  it was the intermediary stage marking the passage from high to low from best to worst  all of which might have been true even as he saw it but with definitions for premises conclusions cannot fail to be dogmatic  what was good and bad  there it was  that was where his mother whispered with dead lips to him  nor alone his mother but divers conventional generations even back to the sturdy ancestor who first uplifted from the soil and looked down  for vance corliss was many times removed from the red earth and though he did not know it there was a clamor within him for a return lest he perish  not that he pigeonholed frona according to his inherited definitions he refused to classify her at all  he did not dare  he preferred to pass judgment later when he had gathered more data  and there was the allurement the gathering of the data the great critical point where purity reaches dreamy hands towards pitch and refuses to call it pitchtill defiled  no vance corliss was not a cad  and since purity is merely a relative term he was not pure  that there was no pitch under his nails was not because he had manicured diligently but because it had not been his luck to run across any pitch  he was not good because he chose to be because evil was repellant but because he had not had opportunity to become evil  but from this on the other hand it is not to be argued that he would have gone bad had he had a chance  he was a product of the sheltered life  all his days had been lived in a sanitary dwelling the plumbing was excellent  the air he had breathed had been mostly ozone artificially manufactured  he had been sunbathed in balmy weather and brought in out of the wet when it rained  and when he reached the age of choice he had been too fully occupied to deviate from the straight path along which his mother had taught him to creep and toddle and along which he now proceeded to walk upright without thought of what lay on either side  vitality cannot be used over again  if it be expended on one thing there is none left for the other thing  and so with vance corliss scholarly lucubrations and healthy exercises during his college days had consumed all the energy his normal digestion extracted from a wholesome omnivorous diet  when he did discover a bit of surplus energy he worked it off in the society of his mother and of the conventional minds and prim teas she surrounded herself with  result a very nice young man of whom no maids mother need ever be in trepidation a very strong young man whose substance had not been wasted in riotous living a very learned young man with a freiberg mining engineers diploma and a ba sheepskin from yale and lastly a very selfcentred selfpossessed young man  now his greatest virtue lay in this he had not become hardened in the mould baked by his several forbears and into which he had been pressed by his mothers hands  some atavism had been at work in the making of him and he had reverted to that ancestor who sturdily uplifted  but so far this portion of his heritage had lain dormant  he had simply remained adjusted to a stable environment  there had been no call upon the adaptability which was his  but whensoever the call came being so constituted it was manifest that he should adapt should adjust himself to the unwonted pressure of new conditions  the maxim of the rolling stone may be all true but notwithstanding in the scheme of life the inability to become fixed is an excellence par excellence though he did not know it this inability was vance corlisss most splendid possession  but to return  he looked forward with great sober glee to meeting frona welse and in the meanwhile consulted often the sunpicture he carried of her  though he went over the pass and down the lakes and river with a push of money behind him london syndicates are never niggardly in such matters  frona beat him into dawson by a fortnight while on his part money in the end overcame obstacles on hers the name of welse was a talisman greater than treasure  after his arrival a couple of weeks were consumed in buying a cabin presenting his letters of introduction and settling down  but all things come in the fulness of time and so one night after the river closed he pointed his moccasins in the direction of jacob welses house  mrs schoville the gold commissioners wife gave him the honor of her company   corliss wanted to rub his eyes  steamheating apparatus in the klondike  but the next instant he had passed out of the hall through the heavy portieres and stood inside the drawingroom  and it was a drawingroom  his moosehide moccasins sank luxuriantly into the deep carpet and his eyes were caught by a turner sunrise on the opposite wall  and there were other paintings and things in bronze  two dutch fireplaces were roaring full with huge backlogs of spruce  there was a piano and somebody was singing  frona sprang from the stool and came forward greeting him with both hands  he had thought his sunpicture perfect but this firepicture this young creature with the flush and warmth of ringing life quite eclipsed it  it was a whirling moment as he held her two hands in his one of those moments when an incomprehensible orgasm quickens the blood and dizzies the brain  though the first syllables came to him faintly mrs schovilles voice brought him back to himself  oh she cried  you know him  and frona answered yes we met on the dyea trail and those who meet on the dyea trail can never forget  how romantic  the gold commissioners wife clapped her hands  though fat and forty and phlegmatic of temperament between exclamations and handclappings her waking existence was mostly explosive  her husband secretly averred that did god himself deign to meet her face to face she would smite together her chubby hands and cry out how romantic  how did it happen she continued  he didnt rescue you over a cliff or that sort of thing did he  do say that he did  and you never said a word about it mr corliss  do tell me  im just dying to know  oh nothing like that he hastened to answer  nothing much  i that is we  he felt a sinking as frona interrupted  there was no telling what this remarkable girl might say  he gave me of his hospitality that was all she said  and i can vouch for his fried potatoes while for his coffee it is excellentwhen one is very hungry  ingrate he managed to articulate and thereby to gain a smile ere he was introduced to a cleanly built lieutenant of the mounted police who stood by the fireplace discussing the grub proposition with a dapper little man very much out of place in a white shirt and stiff collar  thanks to the particular niche in society into which he happened to be born corliss drifted about easily from group to group and was much envied therefore by del bishop who sat stiffly in the first chair he had dropped into and who was waiting patiently for the first person to take leave that he might know how to compass the manoeuvre  in his minds eye he had figured most of it out knew just how many steps required to carry him to the door was certain he would have to say goodby to frona but did not know whether or not he was supposed to shake hands all around  he had just dropped in to see frona and say howdee as he expressed it and had unwittingly found himself in company  corliss having terminated a buzz with a miss mortimer on the decadence of the french symbolists encountered del bishop  but the pocketminer remembered him at once from the one glimpse he had caught of corliss standing by his tentdoor in happy camp  was almighty obliged to him for his nights hospitality to miss frona seein as hed ben sidetracked down the line that any kindness to her was a kindness to him and that hed remember it by god as long as he had a corner of a blanket to pull over him  hoped it hadnt put him out  miss fronad said that bedding was scarce but it wasnt a cold night more blowy than crisp so he reckoned there couldnt a ben much shiverin  all of which struck corliss as perilous and he broke away at the first opportunity leaving the pocketminer yearning for the door  but dave harney who had not come by mistake avoided gluing himself to the first chair  being an eldorado king he had felt it incumbent to assume the position in society to which his numerous millions entitled him and though unused all his days to social amenities other than the outhanging latchstring and the general pot he had succeeded to his own satisfaction as a knight of the carpet  quick to take a cue he circulated with an aplomb which his striking garments and long shambling gait only heightened and talked choppy and disconnected fragments with whomsoever he ran up against  the miss mortimer who spoke parisian french took him aback with her symbolists but he evened matters up with a goodly measure of the bastard lingo of the canadian voyageurs and left her gasping and meditating over a proposition to sell him twentyfive pounds of sugar white or brown but she was not unduly favored for with everybody he adroitly turned the conversation to grub and then led up to the eternal proposition sugar or bust he would conclude gayly each time and wander on to the next  but he put the capstone on his social success by asking frona to sing the touching ditty i left my happy home for you  this was something beyond her though she had him hum over the opening bars so that she could furnish the accompaniment  his voice was more strenuous than sweet and del bishop discovering himself at last joined in raucously on the choruses  this made him feel so much better that he disconnected himself from the chair and when he finally got home he kicked up his sleepy tentmate to tell him about the high time hed had over at the welses  mrs schoville tittered and thought it all so unique and she thought it so unique several times more when the lieutenant of mounted police and a couple of compatriots roared rule britannia and god save the queen and the americans responded with my country tis of thee and john brown  then big alec beaubien the circle city king demanded the marseillaise and the company broke up chanting die wacht am rhein to the frosty night  dont come on these nights frona whispered to corliss at parting we havent spoken three words and i know we shall be good friends did dave harney succeed in getting any sugar out of you  they mingled their laughter and corliss went home under the aurora borealis striving to reduce his impressions to some kind of order     chapter viii  and why should i not be proud of my race  fronas cheeks were flushed and her eyes sparkling  they had both been harking back to childhood and she had been telling corliss of her mother whom she faintly remembered  fair and flaxenhaired typically saxon was the likeness she had drawn filled out largely with knowledge gained from her father and from old andy of the dyea post the discussion had then turned upon the race in general and frona had said things in the heat of enthusiasm which affected the more conservative mind of corliss as dangerous and not solidly based on fact  he deemed himself too large for race egotism and insular prejudice and had seen fit to laugh at her immature convictions  its a common characteristic of all peoples he proceeded to consider themselves superior racesa naive natural egoism very healthy and very good but none the less manifestly untrue  the jews conceived themselves to be gods chosen people and they still so conceive themselves  and because of it they have left a deep mark down the page of history she interrupted  but time has not proved the stability of their conceptions  and you must also view the other side  a superior people must look upon all others as inferior peoples  this comes home to you  to be a roman were greater than to be a king and when the romans rubbed against your savage ancestors in the german forests they elevated their brows and said an inferior people barbarians  but we are here now  we are and the romans are not  the test is time  so far we have stood the test the signs are favorable that we shall continue to stand it  we are the best fitted  egotism  but wait  put it to the test  as she spoke her hand flew out impulsively to his  at the touch his heart pulsed upward there was a rush of blood and a tightening across the temples  ridiculous but delightful he thought  at this rate he could argue with her the night through  the test she repeated withdrawing her hand without embarrassment we are a race of doers and fighters of globeencirclers and zoneconquerors  we toil and struggle and stand by the toil and struggle no matter how hopeless it may be  while we are persistent and resistant we are so made that we fit ourselves to the most diverse conditions  will the indian the negro or the mongol ever conquer the teuton  surely not  the indian has persistence without variability if he does not modify he dies if he does try to modify he dies anyway the negro has adaptability but he is servile and must be led  as for the chinese they are permanent  all that the other races are not the anglosaxon or teuton if you please is  all that the other races have not the teuton has  what race is to rise up and overwhelm us  ah you forget the slav corliss suggested slyly  the slav  her face fell  true the slav  the only stripling in this world of young men and graybeards  but he is still in the future and in the future the decision rests  in the mean time we prepare  if may be we shall have such a start that we shall prevent him growing  you know because he was better skilled in chemistry knew how to manufacture gunpowder that the spaniard destroyed the aztec  may not we who are possessing ourselves of the world and its resources and gathering to ourselves all its knowledge may not we nip the slav ere he grows a thatch to his lip  vance corliss shook his head noncommittally and laughed  oh  i know i become absurd and grow overwarm she exclaimed  but after all one reason that we are the salt of the earth is because we have the courage to say so  and i am sure your warmth spreads he responded  see im beginning to glow myself  we are not gods but natures chosen people we angles and saxons and normans and vikings and the earth is our heritage  let us arise and go forth  now you are laughing at me and besides we have already gone forth why have you fared into the north if not to lay hands on the race legacy   she turned her head at the sound of approaching footsteps and cried for greeting i appeal to you captain alexander  i summon you to bear witness  the captain of police smiled in his sternly mirthful fashion as he shook hands with frona and corliss  bear witness he questioned ah yes    bear witness o my comrades what a hardbit gang were we   the servants of the sweephead but the masters of the sea  he quoted the verse with a savage solemnity exulting through his deep voice  this and the appositeness of it quite carried frona away and she had both his hands in hers on the instant  corliss was aware of an inward wince at the action  it was uncomfortable  he did not like to see her so promiscuous with those warm strong hands of hers  did she so favor all men who delighted her by word or deed  he did not mind her fingers closing round his but somehow it seemed wanton when shared with the next comer  by the time he had thought thus far frona had explained the topic under discussion and captain alexander was testifying  i dont know much about your slav and other kin except that they are good workers and strong but i do know that the white man is the greatest and best breed in the world  take the indian for instance the white man comes along and beats him at all his games outworks him outroughs him outfishes him outhunts him  as far back as their myths go the alaskan indians have packed on their backs  but the goldrushers as soon as they had learned the tricks of the trade packed greater loads and packed them farther than did the indians why last may the queens birthday we had sports on the river  in the one two three four and five men canoe races we beat the indians right and left  yet they had been born to the paddle and most of us had never seen a canoe until mangrown  but why is it corliss queried  i do not know why  i only know that it is  i simply bear witness  i do know that we do what they cannot do and what they can do we do better  frona nodded her head triumphantly at corliss  come acknowledge your defeat so that we may go in to dinner  defeat for the time being at least  the concrete facts of paddles and packstraps quite overcome your dogmatics  ah i thought so  more time  all the time in the world  but let us go in  well see what my father thinks of itand mr kellar  a symposium on anglosaxon supremacy   frost and enervation are mutually repellant  the northland gives a keenness and zest to the blood which cannot be obtained in warmer climes  naturally so then the friendship which sprang up between corliss and frona was anything but languid  they met often under her fathers rooftree and went many places together  each found a pleasurable attraction in the other and a satisfaction which the things they were not in accord with could not mar  frona liked the man because he was a man  in her wildest flights she could never imagine linking herself with any man no matter how exalted spiritually who was not a man physically  it was a delight to her and a joy to look upon the strong males of her kind with bodies comely in the sight of god and muscles swelling with the promise of deeds and work  man to her was preeminently a fighter  she believed in natural selection and in sexual selection and was certain that if man had thereby become possessed of faculties and functions they were for him to use and could but tend to his good  and likewise with instincts  if she felt drawn to any person or thing it was good for her to be so drawn good for herself  if she felt impelled to joy in a wellbuilt frame and wellshaped muscle why should she restrain  why should she not love the body and without shame  the history of the race and of all races sealed her choice with approval  down all time the weak and effeminate males had vanished from the worldstage   only the strong could inherit the earth  she had been born of the strong and she chose to cast her lot with the strong  yet of all creatures she was the last to be deaf and blind to the things of the spirit  but the things of the spirit she demanded should be likewise strong  no halting no stuttered utterance tremulous waiting minor wailing  the mind and the soul must be as quick and definite and certain as the body  nor was the spirit made alone for immortal dreaming  like the flesh it must strive and toil  it must be workaday as well as idle day  she could understand a weakling singing sweetly and even greatly and in so far she could love him for his sweetness and greatness but her love would have fuller measure were he strong of body as well  she believed she was just  she gave the flesh its due and the spirit its due but she had over and above her own choice her own individual ideal  she liked to see the two go hand in hand  prophecy and dyspepsia did not affect her as a felicitous admixture  a splendid savage and a weakkneed poet  she could admire the one for his brawn and the other for his song but she would prefer that they had been made one in the beginning  as to vance corliss  first and most necessary of all there was that physiological affinity between them that made the touch of his hand a pleasure to her  though souls may rush together if body cannot endure body happiness is reared on sand and the structure will be ever unstable and tottery  next corliss had the physical potency of the hero without the grossness of the brute  his muscular development was more qualitative than quantitative and it is the qualitative development which gives rise to beauty of form  a giant need not be proportioned in the mould nor a thew be symmetrical to be massive  and finallynone the less necessary but still finallyvance corliss was neither spiritually dead nor decadent  he affected her as fresh and wholesome and strong as reared above the soil but not scorning the soil  of course none of this she reasoned out otherwise than by subconscious processes  her conclusions were feelings not thoughts  though they quarrelled and disagreed on innumerable things deep down underlying all there was a permanent unity  she liked him for a certain stern soberness that was his and for his saving grace of humor  seriousness and banter were not incompatible  she liked him for his gallantry made to work with and not for display  she liked the spirit of his offer at happy camp when he proposed giving her an indian guide and passagemoney back to the united states  he could do as well as talk  she liked him for his outlook for his innate liberality which she felt to be there somehow no matter that often he was narrow of expression  she liked him for his mind  though somewhat academic somewhat tainted with latterday scholasticism it was still a mind which permitted him to be classed with the intellectuals  he was capable of divorcing sentiment and emotion from reason  granted that he included all the factors he could not go wrong  and here was where she found chief fault with himhis narrowness which precluded all the factors his narrowness which gave the lie to the breadth she knew was really his  but she was aware that it was not an irremediable defect and that the new life he was leading was very apt to rectify it  he was filled with culture what he needed was a few more of lifes facts  and she liked him for himself which is quite different from liking the parts which went to compose him  for it is no miracle for two things added together to produce not only the sum of themselves but a third thing which is not to be found in either of them  so with him  she liked him for himself for that something which refused to stand out as a part or a sum of parts for that something which is the cornerstone of faith and which has ever baffled philosophy and science  and further to like with frona welse did not mean to love  first and above all vance corliss was drawn to frona welse because of the clamor within him for a return to the soil  in him the elements were so mixed that it was impossible for women many times removed to find favor in his eyes  such he had met constantly but not one had ever drawn from him a superfluous heartbeat  though there had been in him a growing instinctive knowledge of lack of unitythe lack of unity which must precede always the love of man and womannot one of the daughters of eve he had met had flashed irresistibly in to fill the void  elective affinity sexual affinity or whatsoever the intangible essence known as love is had never been manifest  when he met frona it had at once sprung fullfledged into existence  but he quite misunderstood it took it for a mere attraction towards the new and unaccustomed  many men possessed of birth and breeding have yielded to this clamor for return  and giving the apparent lie to their own sanity and moral stability many such men have married peasant girls or barmaids  and those to whom evil apportioned itself have been prone to distrust the impulse they obeyed forgetting that nature makes or mars the individual for the sake always of the type  for in every such case of return the impulse was soundonly that time and space interfered and propinquity determined whether the object of choice should be barmaid or peasant girl   happily for vance corliss time and space were propitious and in frona he found the culture he could not do without and the clean sharp tang of the earth he needed  in so far as her education and culture went she was an astonishment  he had met the scientifically smattered young woman before but frona had something more than smattering  further she gave new life to old facts and her interpretations of common things were coherent and vigorous and new  though his acquired conservatism was alarmed and cried danger he could not remain cold to the charm of her philosophizing while her scholarly attainments were fully redeemed by her enthusiasm  though he could not agree with much that she passionately held he yet recognized that the passion of sincerity and enthusiasm was good  but her chief fault in his eyes was her unconventionality  woman was something so inexpressibly sacred to him that he could not bear to see any good woman venturing where the footing was precarious  whatever good woman thus ventured overstepping the metes and bounds of sex and status he deemed did so of wantonness  and wantonness of such order was akin towell he could not say it when thinking of frona though she hurt him often by her unwise acts  however he only felt such hurts when away from her  when with her looking into her eyes which always looked back or at greeting and parting pressing her hand which always pressed honestly it seemed certain that there was in her nothing but goodness and truth  and then he liked her in many different ways for many different things for her impulses and for her passions which were always elevated  and already from breathing the northland air he had come to like her for that comradeship which at first had shocked him  there were other acquired likings her lack of prudishness for instance which he awoke one day to find that he had previously confounded with lack of modesty and it was only the day before that day that he drifted before he thought into a discussion with her of camille  she had seen bernhardt and dwelt lovingly on the recollection  he went home afterwards a dull pain gnawing at his heart striving to reconcile frona with the ideal impressed upon him by his mother that innocence was another term for ignorance  notwithstanding by the following day he had worked it out and loosened another finger of the maternal grip  he liked the flame of her hair in the sunshine the glint of its gold by the firelight and the waywardness of it and the glory  he liked her neatshod feet and the graygaitered calvesalas now hidden in longskirted dawson  he liked her for the strength of her slenderness and to walk with her swinging her step and stride to his or to merely watch her come across a room or down the street was a delight  life and the joy of life romped through her blood abstemiously filling out and rounding off each shapely muscle and soft curve  and he liked it all  especially he liked the swell of her forearm which rose firm and strong and tantalizing and sought shelter all too quickly under the looseflowing sleeve  the coordination of physical with spiritual beauty is very strong in normal men and so it was with vance corliss  that he liked the one was no reason that he failed to appreciate the other  he liked frona for both and for herself as well  and to like with him though he did not know it was to love     chapter ix  vance corliss proceeded at a fair rate to adapt himself to the northland life and he found that many adjustments came easy  while his own tongue was alien to the brimstone of the lord he became quite used to strong language on the part of other men even in the most genial conversation  carthey a little texan who went to work for him for a while opened or closed every second sentence on an average with the mild expletive by damn  it was also his invariable way of expressing surprise disappointment consternation or all the rest of the tribe of sudden emotions  by pitch and stress and intonation the protean oath was made to perform every function of ordinary speech  at first it was a constant source of irritation and disgust to corliss but erelong he grew not only to tolerate it but to like it and to wait for it eagerly  once cartheys wheeldog lost an ear in a hasty contention with a dog of the hudson bay and when the young fellow bent over the animal and discovered the loss the blended endearment and pathos of the by damn which fell from his lips was a relation to corliss  all was not evil out of nazareth he concluded sagely and like jacob welse of old revised his philosophy of life accordingly  again there were two sides to the social life of dawson  up at the barracks at the welses and a few other places all men of standing were welcomed and made comfortable by the womenkind of like standing there were teas and dinners and dances and socials for charity and the usual run of things all of which however failed to wholly satisfy the men  down in the town there was a totally different though equally popular other side  as the country was too young for clublife the masculine portion of the community expressed its masculinity by herding together in the saloonsthe ministers and missionaries being the only exceptions to this mode of expression business appointments and deals were made and consummated in the saloons enterprises projected shop talked the latest news discussed and a general good fellowship maintained  there all life rubbed shoulders and kings and dogdrivers oldtimers and chechaquos met on a common level  and it so happened probably because sawmills and housespace were scarce that the saloons accommodated the gambling tables and the polished dancehouse floors  and here because he needs must bend to custom corlisss adaptation went on rapidly  and as carthey who appreciated him soliloquized the best of it is he likes it damn well by damn  but any adjustment must have its painful periods and while corlisss general change went on smoothly in the particular case of frona it was different  she had a code of her own quite unlike that of the community and perhaps believed woman might do things at which even the salooninhabiting males would be shocked  and because of this she and corliss had their first disagreeable disagreement  frona loved to run with the dogs through the biting frost cheeks tingling blood bounding body thrust forward and limbs rising and falling ceaselessly to the pace  and one november day with the first cold snap on and the spirit thermometer frigidly marking sixtyfive below she got out the sled harnessed her team of huskies and flew down the river trail  as soon as she cleared the town she was off and running  and in such manner running and riding by turns she swept through the indian village below the bluffs made an eightmile circle up moosehide creek and back crossed the river on the ice and several hours later came flying up the west bank of the yukon opposite the town  she was aiming to tap and return by the trail for the woodsleds which crossed thereabout but a mile away from it she ran into the soft snow and brought the winded dogs to a walk  along the rim of the river and under the frown of the overhanging cliffs she directed the path she was breaking  here and there she made detours to avoid the outjutting talus and at other times followed the ice in against the precipitous walls and hugged them closely around the abrupt bends  and so at the head of her huskies she came suddenly upon a woman sitting in the snow and gazing across the river at smokecanopied dawson  she had been crying and this was sufficient to prevent fronas scrutiny from wandering farther  a tear turned to a globule of ice rested on her cheek and her eyes were dim and moist there was anexpression of hopeless fathomless woe  oh frona cried stopping the dogs and coming up to her  you are hurt  can i help you she queried though the stranger shook her head  but you mustnt sit there  it is nearly seventy below and youll freeze in a few minutes  your cheeks are bitten already  she rubbed the afflicted parts vigorously with a mitten of snow and then looked down on the warm returning glow  i beg pardon  the woman rose somewhat stiffly to her feet  and i thank you but i am perfectly warm you see settling the fur cape more closely about her with a snuggling movement and i had just sat down for the moment  frona noted that she was very beautiful and her womans eye roved over and took in the splendid furs the make of the gown and the beadwork of the moccasins which peeped from beneath  and in view of all this and of the fact that the face was unfamiliar she felt an instinctive desire to shrink back  and i havent hurt myself the woman went on  just a mood that was all looking out over the dreary endless white  yes frona replied mastering herself i can understand  there must be much of sadness in such a landscape only it never comes that way to me  the sombreness and the sternness of it appeal to me but not the sadness  and that is because the lines of our lives have been laid in different places the other ventured reflectively  it is not what the landscape is but what we are  if we were not the landscape would remain but without human significance  that is what we invest it with    truth is within ourselves it takes no rise   from outward things whateer you may believe  fronas eyes brightened and she went on to complete the passage    there is an inmost centre in us all   where truth abides in fulness and around  andandhow does it go  i have forgotten    wall upon wall the gross flesh hems it in  the woman ceased abruptly her voice trilling off into silvery laughter with a certain bitter reckless ring to it which made frona inwardly shiver  she moved as though to go back to her dogs but the womans hand went out in a familiar gesturetwin to fronas ownwhich went at once to fronas heart  stay a moment she said with an undertone of pleading in the words and talk with me  it is long since i have met a womanshe paused while her tongue wandered for the wordwho could quote paracelsus you arei know you you seeyou are jacob welses daughter frona welse i believe  frona nodded her identity hesitated and looked at the woman with secret intentness  she was conscious of a great and pardonable curiosity of a frank outreaching for fuller knowledge  this creature so like so different old as the oldest race and young as the last rosetinted babe flung far as the farthermost fires of men and eternal as humanity itselfwhere were they unlike this woman and she  her five senses told her not by every law of life they were no only only by the fastdrawn lines of social caste and social wisdom were they not the same  so she thought even as for one searching moment she studied the others face  and in the situation she found an uplifting awfulness such as comes when the veil is thrust aside and one gazes on the mysteriousness of deity  she remembered her feet take hold of hell her house is the way to the grave going down to the chamber of death and in the same instant strong upon her was the vision of the familiar gesture with which the womans hand had gone out in mute appeal and she looked aside out over the dreary endless white and for her too the day became filled with sadness  she gave an involuntary halfnervous shiver though she said naturally enough come let us walk on and get the blood moving again i had no idea it was so cold till i stood still  she turned to the dogs mushon  king  you sandy  mush  and back again to the woman i am quite chilled and as for you you must be  quite warm of course  you have been running and your clothes are wet against you while i have kept up the needful circulation and no more i saw you when you leaped off the sled below the hospital and vanished down the river like a diana of the snows  how i envied you  you must enjoy it  oh i do frona answered simply  i was raised with the dogs  it savors of the greek  frona did not reply and they walked on in silence  yet frona wished though she dared not dare that she could give her tongue free rein and from out of the others bitter knowledge for her own souls sake and sanity draw the pregnant human generalizations which she must possess  and over her welled a wave of pity and distress and she felt a discomfort for she knew not what to say or how to voice her heart and when the others speech broke forth she hailed it with a great relief  tell me the woman demanded halfeagerly halfmasterly tell me about yourself  you are new to the inside  where were you before you came in  tell me  so the difficulty was solved in a way and frona talked on about herself with a successfully feigned girlhood innocence as though she did not appreciate the other or understand her illconcealed yearning for that which she might not have but which was fronas  there is the trail you are trying to connect with  they had rounded the last of the cliffs and fronas companion pointed ahead to where the walls receded and wrinkled to a gorge out of which the sleds drew the firewood across the river to town  i shall leave you there she concluded  but are you not going back to dawson frona queried  it is growing late and you had better not linger  no     i     her painful hesitancy brought frona to a realization of her own thoughtlessness  but she had made the step and she knew she could not retrace it  we will go back together she said bravely  and in candid allknowledge of the other i do not mind  then it was that the blood surged into the womans cold face and her hand went out to the girl in the old old way  no no i beg of you she stammered  i beg of you     i     i prefer to continue my walk a little farther  see  some one is coming now  by this time they had reached the woodtrail and fronas face was flaming as the others had flamed  a light sled dogs alope and swinging down out of the gorge was just upon them  a man was running with the team and he waved his hand to the two women  vance frona exclaimed as he threw his leaddogs in the snow and brought the sled to a halt  what are you doing over here  is the syndicate bent upon cornering the firewood also  no  were not so bad as that  his face was full of smiling happiness at the meeting as he shook hands with her  but carthey is leaving megoing prospecting somewhere around the north pole i believeand i came across to look up del bishop if hell serve  he turned his head to glance expectantly at her companion and she saw the smile go out of his face and anger come in  frona was helplessly aware that she had no grip over the situation and though a rebellion at the cruelty and injustice of it was smouldering somewhere deep down she could only watch the swift culmination of the little tragedy  the woman met his gaze with a halfshrinking as from an impending blow and with a softness of expression which entreated pity  but he regarded her long and coldly then deliberately turned his back  as he did this frona noted her face go tired and gray and the hardness and recklessness of her laughter were there painted in harsh tones and a bitter devil rose up and lurked in her eyes  it was evident that the same bitter devil rushed hotly to her tongue  but it chanced just then that she glanced at frona and all expression was brushed from her face save the infinite tiredness  she smiled wistfully at the girl and without a word turned and went down the trail  and without a word frona sprang upon her sled and was off  the way was wide and corliss swung in his dogs abreast of hers  the smouldering rebellion flared up and she seemed to gather to herself some of the womans recklessness  you brute  the words left her mouth sharp clearcut breaking the silence like the lash of a whip  the unexpectedness of it and the savagery took corliss aback  he did not know what to do or say  oh you coward  you coward  frona  listen to me  but she cut him off  no  do not speak  you can have nothing to say you have behaved abominably  i am disappointed in you  it is horrible horrible  yes it was horriblehorrible that she should walk with you have speech with you be seen with you  not until the sun excludes you do i exclude you she flung back at him  but there is a fitness of things  fitness she turned upon him and loosed her wrath  if she is unfit are you fit  may you cast the first stone with that smugly sanctimonious air of yours  you shall not talk to me in this fashion  ill not have it  he clutched at her sled and even in the midst of her anger she noticed it with a little thrill of pleasure  shall not  you coward  he reached out as though to lay hands upon her and she raised her coiled whip to strike  but to his credit he never flinched his white face calmly waited to receive the blow  then she deflected the stroke and the long lash hissed out and fell among the dogs  swinging the whip briskly she rose to her knees on the sled and called frantically to the animals  hers was the better team and she shot rapidly away from corliss  she wished to get away not so much from him as from herself and she encouraged the huskies into wilder and wilder speed she took the steep riverbank in full career and dashed like a whirlwind through the town and home  never in her life had she been in such a condition never had she experienced such terrible anger  and not only was she already ashamed but she was frightened and afraid of herself     chapter x  the next morning corliss was knocked out of a late bed by bash one of jacob welses indians  he was the bearer of a brief little note from frona which contained a request for the mining engineer to come and see her at his first opportunity  that was all that was said and he pondered over it deeply  what did she wish to say to him  she was still such an unknown quantityand never so much as now in the light of the day beforethat he could not guess  did she desire to give him his dismissal on a definite wellunderstood basis  to take advantage of her sex and further humiliate him  to tell him what she thought of him in coolly considered coldmeasured terms  or was she penitently striving to make amends for the unmerited harshness she had dealt him  there was neither contrition nor anger in the note no clew nothing save a formally worded desire to see him  so it was in a rather unsettled and curious frame of mind that he walked in upon her as the last hour of the morning drew to a close  he was neither on his dignity nor off his attitude being strictly noncommittal against the moment she should disclose hers  but without beating about the bush in that way of hers which he had come already to admire she at once showed her colors and came frankly forward to him  the first glimpse of her face told him the first feel of her hand before she had said a word told him that all was well  i am glad you have come she began  i could not be at peace with myself until i had seen you and told you how sorry i am for yesterday and how deeply ashamed i  there there  its not so bad as all that  they were still standing and he took a step nearer to her  i assure you i can appreciate your side of it and though looking at it theoretically it was the highest conduct demanding the fullest meed of praise still in all frankness there is much toto  yes  much to deplore in it from the social standpoint  and unhappily we cannot leave the social standpoint out of our reckoning  but so far as i may speak for myself you have done nothing to feel sorry for or be ashamed of  it is kind of you she cried graciously  only it is not true and you know it is not true  you know that you acted for the best you know that i hurt you insulted you you know that i behaved like a fishwife and you do know that i disgusted you  no no  he raised his hand as though to ward from her the blows she dealt herself  but yes yes  and i have all reason in the world to be ashamed  i can only say this in defence the woman had affected me deeplyso deeply that i was close to weeping  then you came on the sceneyou know what you didand the sorrow for her bred an indignation against you andwell i worked myself into a nervous condition such as i had never experienced in my life  it was hysteria i suppose  anyway i was not myself  we were neither of us ourselves  now you are untrue  i did wrong but you were yourself as much so then as now  but do be seated  here we stand as though you were ready to run away at first sign of another outbreak  surely you are not so terrible he laughed adroitly pulling his chair into position so that the light fell upon her face  rather you are not such a coward  i must have been terrible yesterday  ii almost struck you  and you were certainly brave when the whip hung over you  why you did not even attempt to raise a hand and shield yourself  i notice the dogs your whip falls among come nevertheless to lick your hand and to be petted  ergo she queried audaciously  ergo it all depends he equivocated  and notwithstanding i am forgiven  as i hope to be forgiven  then i am gladonly you have done nothing to be forgiven for  you acted according to your light and i to mine though it must be acknowledged that mine casts the broader flare  ah  i have it clapping her hands in delight i was not angry with you yesterday nor did i behave rudely to you or even threaten you  it was utterly impersonal the whole of it  you simply stood for society for the type which aroused my indignation and anger and as its representative you bore the brunt of it  dont you see  i see and cleverly put only while you escape the charge of maltreating me yesterday you throw yourself open to it today  you make me out all that is narrowminded and mean and despicable which is very unjust  only a few minutes past i said that your way of looking at it theoretically considered was irreproachable  but not so when we include society  but you misunderstand me vance  listen  her hand went out to his and he was content to listen  i have always upheld that what is is well  i grant the wisdom of the prevailing social judgment in this matter  though i deplore it i grant it for the human is so made but i grant it socially only  i as an individual choose to regard such things differently  and as between individuals so minded why should it not be so regarded  dont you see  now i find you guilty as between you and me yesterday on the river you did not so regard it  you behaved as narrowmindedly as would have the society you represent  then you would preach two doctrines he retaliated  one for the elect and one for the herd  you would be a democrat in theory and an aristocrat in practice  in fact the whole stand you are making is nothing more or less than jesuitical  i suppose with the next breath you will be contending that all men are born free and equal with a bundle of natural rights thrown in  you are going to have del bishop work for you by what equal freeborn right will he work for you or you suffer him to work  no he denied  i should have to modify somewhat the questions of equality and rights  and if you modify you are lost she exulted  for you can only modify in the direction of my position which is neither so jesuitical nor so harsh as you have defined it  but dont let us get lost in dialectics  i want to see what i can see so tell me about this woman  not a very tasteful topic corliss objected  but i seek knowledge  nor can it be wholesome knowledge  frona tapped her foot impatiently and studied him  she is beautiful very beautiful she suggested  do you not think so  as beautiful as hell  but still beautiful she insisted  yes if you will have it so  and she is as cruel and hard and hopeless as she is beautiful  yet i came upon her alone by the trail her face softened and tears in her eyes  and i believe with a womans ken that i saw a side of her to which you are blind  and so strongly did i see it that when you appeared my mind was blank to all save the solitary wail oh the pity of it  the pity of it  and she is a woman even as i and i doubt not that we are very much alike  why she even quoted browning  and last week he cut her short in a single sitting she gambled away thirty thousand of jack dorseys dustdorsey with two mortgages already on his dump  they found him in the snow next morning with one chamber empty in his revolver  frona made no reply but walking over to the candle deliberately thrust her finger into the flame  then she held it up to corliss that he might see the outraged skin red and angry  and so i point the parable  the fire is very good but i misuse it and i am punished  you forget he objected  the fire works in blind obedience to natural law  lucile is a free agent  that which she has chosen to do that she has done  nay it is you who forget for just as surely dorsey was a free agent but you said lucile  is that her name  i wish i knew her better  corliss winced  dont  you hurt me when you say such things  and why pray  becausebecause  yes  because i honor woman highly  frona you have always made a stand for frankness and i can now advantage by it  it hurts me because of the honor in which i hold you because i cannot bear to see taint approach you  why when i saw you and that woman together on the trail iyou cannot understand what i suffered  taint  there was a tightening about her lips which he did not notice and a just perceptible lustre of victory lighted her eyes  yes taintcontamination he reiterated  there are some things which it were not well for a good woman to understand  one cannot dabble with mud and remain spotless  that opens the field wide  she clasped and unclasped her hands gleefully  you have said that her name was lucile you display a knowledge of her you have given me facts about her you doubtless retain many which you dare not give in short if one cannot dabble and remain spotless how about you  but i am  a man of course  very good  because you are a man you may court contamination  because i am a woman i may not  contamination contaminates does it not  then you what do you here with me  out upon you  corliss threw up his hands laughingly  i give in  you are too much for me with your formal logic  i can only fall back on the higher logic which you will not recognize  which is  strength  what man wills for woman that will he have  i take you then on your own ground she rushed on  what of lucile  what man has willed that he has had  so you and all men have willed since the beginning of time  so poor dorsey willed  you cannot answer so let me speak something that occurs to me concerning that higher logic you call strength  i have met it before  i recognized it in you yesterday on the sleds  in me  in you when you reached out and clutched at me  you could not down the primitive passion and for that matter you did not know it was uppermost  but the expression on your face i imagine was very like that of a womanstealing caveman  another instant and i am sure you would have laid violent hands upon me  then i ask your pardon  i did not dream  there you go spoiling it all  ii quite liked you for it  dont you remember i too was a cavewoman brandishing the whip over your head  but i am not done with you yet sir doubleface even if you have dropped out of the battle  her eyes were sparkling mischievously and the wee laughtercreases were forming on her cheek  i purpose to unmask you  as clay in the hands of the potter he responded meekly  then you must remember several things  at first when i was very humble and apologetic you made it easier for me by saying that you could only condemn my conduct on the ground of being socially unwise remember  corliss nodded  then just after you branded me as jesuitical i turned the conversation to lucile saying that i wished to see what i could see  again he nodded  and just as i expected i saw  for in only a few minutes you began to talk about taint and contamination and dabbling in mudand all in relation to me  there are your two propositions sir  you may only stand on one and i feel sure that you stand on the last one  yes i am right  you do  and you were insincere confess when you found my conduct unwise only from the social point of view  i like sincerity  yes he began i was unwittingly insincere  but i did not know it until further analysis with your help put me straight  say what you will frona my conception of woman is such that she should not court defilement  but cannot we be as gods knowing good and evil  but we are not gods he shook his head sadly  only the men are  that is newwomanish talk he frowned  equal rights the ballot and all that  oh  dont she protested  you wont understand me you cant  i am no womans rights creature and i stand not for the new woman but for the new womanhood  because i am sincere because i desire to be natural and honest and true and because i am consistent with myself you choose to misunderstand it all and to lay wrong strictures upon me i do try to be consistent and i think i fairly succeed but you can see neither rhyme nor reason in my consistency  perhaps it is because you are unused to consistent natural women because more likely you are only familiar with the hothouse breedspretty helpless wellrounded stallfatted little things blissfully innocent and criminally ignorant  they are not natural or strong nor can they mother the natural and strong  she stopped abruptly  they heard somebody enter the hall and a heavy softmoccasined tread approaching  we are friends she added hurriedly and corliss answered with his eyes  aint intrudin am i  dave harney grinned broad insinuation and looked about ponderously before coming up to shake hands  not at all corliss answered    weve bored each other till we were pining for some one to come along  if you hadnt we would soon have been quarrelling wouldnt we miss welse  i dont think he states the situation fairly she smiled back  in fact we had already begun to quarrel

sence navigation closed an if they set up all night they wont be up early enough in the mornin to git ahead of dave harneyeven on a sugar proposition     chapter xi  over in the corner vance corliss leaned against the piano deep in conversation with colonel trethaway  the latter keen and sharp and wiry for all his white hair and sixtyodd years was as young in appearance as a man of thirty   a veteran mining engineer with a record which put him at the head of his profession he represented as large american interests as corliss did british  not only had a cordial friendship sprung up between them but in a business way they had already been of large assistance to each other  and it was well that they should stand togethera pair who held in grip and could direct at will the potent capital which two nations had contributed to the development of the land under the pole  the crowded room was thick with tobacco smoke  a hundred men or so garbed in furs and warmcolored wools lined the walls and looked on but the mumble of their general conversation destroyed the spectacular feature of the scene and gave to it the geniality of common comradeship  for all its bizarre appearance it was very like the livingroom of the home when the members of the household come together after the work of the day  kerosene lamps and tallow candles glimmered feebly in the murky atmosphere while large stoves roared their redhot and whitehot cheer  on the floor a score of couples pulsed rhythmically to the swinging waltztime music  starched shirts and frock coats were not  the men wore their wolf and beaverskin caps with the gaytasselled earflaps flying free while on their feet were the mooseskin moccasins and walrushide muclucs of the north  here and there a woman was in moccasins though the majority danced in frail ballroom slippers of silk and satin  at one end of the hall a great open doorway gave glimpse of another large room where the crowd was even denser  from this room in the lulls in the music came the pop of corks and the clink of glasses and as an undertone the steady click and clatter of chips and roulette balls  the small door at the rear opened and a woman befurred and muffled came in on a wave of frost  the cold rushed in with her to the warmth taking form in a misty cloud which hung close to the floor hiding the feet of the dancers and writhing and twisting until vanquished by the heat  a veritable frost queen my lucile colonel trethaway addressed her  she tossed her head and laughed and as she removed her capes and streetmoccasins chatted with him gayly  but of corliss though he stood within a yard of her she took no notice  half a dozen dancing men were waiting patiently at a little distance till she should have done with the colonel  the piano and violin played the opening bars of a schottische and she turned to go but a sudden impulse made corliss step up to her  it was wholly unpremeditated he had not dreamed of doing it  i am very sorry he said  her eyes flashed angrily as she turned upon him  i mean it he repeated holding out his hand  i am very sorry  i was a brute and a coward  will you forgive me  she hesitated and with the wisdom bought of experience searched him for the ulterior motive  then her face softened and she took his hand  a warm mist dimmed her eyes  thank you she said  but the waiting men had grown impatient and she was whirled away in the arms of a handsome young fellow conspicuous in a cap of yellow siberian wolfskin  corliss came back to his companion feeling unaccountably good and marvelling at what he had done  its a damned shame  the colonels eye still followed lucile and vance understood   corliss ive lived my threescore and lived them well and do you know woman is a greater mystery than ever  look at them look at them all  he embraced the whole scene with his eyes butterflies bits of light and song and laughter dancing dancing down the last tailreach of hell  not only lucile but the rest of them  look at may there with the brow of a madonna and the tongue of a gutterdevil  and myrtlefor all the world one of gainsboroughs old english beauties stepped down from the canvas to riot out the century in dawsons dancehalls  and laura there wouldnt she make a mother  cant you see the child in the curve of her arm against her breast  theyre the best of the boiling i knowa new country always gathers the bestbut theres something wrong corliss something wrong  the heats of life have passed with me and my vision is truer surer  it seems a new christ must arise and preach a new salvationeconomic or sociologicin these latter days it matters not so long as it is preached  the world has need of it  the room was wont to be swept by sudden tides and notably between the dances when the revellers ebbed through the great doorway to where corks popped and glasses tinkled  colonel trethaway and corliss followed out on the next ebb to the bar where fifty men and women were lined up  they found themselves next to lucile and the fellow in the yellow wolfskin cap  he was undeniably handsome and his looks were enhanced by a warm overplus of blood in the cheeks and a certain mellow fire in the eyes  he was not technically drunk for he had himself in perfect physical control but his was the soulexhilaration which comes of the juice of the grape  his voice was raised the least bit and joyous and his tongue made quick and wittyjust in the unstable condition when vices and virtues are prone to extravagant expression  as he raised his glass the man next to him accidentally jostled his arm  he shook the wine from his sleeve and spoke his mind  it was not a nice word but one customarily calculated to rouse the fighting blood  and the other mans blood roused for his fist landed under the wolfskin cap with force sufficient to drive its owner back against corliss  the insulted man followed up his attack swiftly   the women slipped away leaving a free field for the men some of whom were for crowding in and some for giving room and fair play  the wolfskin cap did not put up a fight or try to meet the wrath he had invoked but with his hands shielding his face strove to retreat the crowd called upon him to stand up and fight  he nerved himself to the attempt but weakened as the man closed in on him and dodged away  let him alone  he deserves it the colonel called to vance as he showed signs of interfering  he wont fight  if he did i think i could almost forgive him  but i cant see him pummelled vance objected  if he would only stand up it wouldnt seem so brutal  the blood was streaming from his nose and from a slight cut over one eye when corliss sprang between  he attempted to hold the two men apart but pressing too hard against the truculent individual overbalanced him and threw him to the floor  every man has friends in a barroom fight and before vance knew what was taking place he was staggered by a blow from a chum of the man he had downed  del bishop who had edged in let drive promptly at the man who had attacked his employer and the fight became general  the crowd took sides on the moment and went at it  colonel trethaway forgot that the heats of life had passed and swinging a threelegged stool danced nimbly into the fray  a couple of mounted police on liberty joined him and with half a dozen others safeguarded the man with the wolfskin cap  fierce though it was and noisy it was purely a local disturbance  at the far end of the bar the barkeepers still dispensed drinks and in the next room the music was on and the dancers afoot  the gamblers continued their play and at only the near tables did they evince any interest in the affair  knockm down an dragm out del bishop grinned as he fought for a brief space shoulder to shoulder with corliss  corliss grinned back met the rush of a stalwart dogdriver with a clinch and came down on top of him among the stamping feet  he was drawn close and felt the fellows teeth sinking into his ear  like a flash he surveyed his whole future and saw himself going oneeared through life and in the same dash as though inspired his thumbs flew to the mans eyes and pressed heavily on the balls  men fell over him and trampled upon him but it all seemed very dim and far away  he only knew as he pressed with his thumbs that the mans teeth wavered reluctantly  he added a little pressure a little more and the man would have been eyeless and the teeth slackened and slipped their grip  after that as he crawled out of the fringe of the melee and came to his feet by the side of the bar all distaste for fighting left him he had found that he was very much like other men after all and the imminent loss of part of his anatomy had scraped off twenty years of culture  gambling without stakes is an insipid amusement and corliss discovered likewise that the warm blood which rises from hygienic gymnasium work is something quite different from that which pounds hotly along when thew matches thew and flesh impacts on flesh and the stake is life and limb  as he dragged himself to his feet by means of the barrail he saw a man in a squirrelskin parka lift a beermug to hurl at trethaway a couple of paces off  and the fingers which were more used to testtubes and water colors doubled into a hard fist which smote the mugthrower cleanly on the point of the jaw  the man merely dropped the glass and himself on the floor  vance was dazed for the moment then he realized that he had knocked the man unconsciousthe first in his lifeand a pang of delight thrilled through him  colonel trethaway thanked him with a look and shouted get on the outside  work to the door corliss  work to the door  quite a struggle took place before the stormdoors could be thrown open but the colonel still attached to the threelegged stool effectually dissipated the opposition and the opera house disgorged its turbulent contents into the street  this accomplished hostilities ceased after the manner of such fights and the crowd scattered  the two policemen went back to keep order accompanied by the rest of the allies while corliss and the colonel followed by the wolfskin cap and del bishop proceeded up the street  blood and sweat  blood and sweat colonel trethaway exulted  talk about putting the vim into one  why im twenty years younger if im a day  corliss your hand  i congratulate you i do i heartily do candidly i didnt think it was in you  youre a surprise sir a surprise  and a surprise to myself corliss answered  the reaction had set in and he was feeling sick and faint  and you also are a surprise the way you handled that stool  yes now  i flatter myself i did fairly well with it  did you seewell look at that  he held up the weapon in question still tightly clutched and joined in the laugh against himself  whom have i to thank gentlemen  they had come to a pause at the corner and the man they had rescued was holding out his hand  my name is st vincent he went on and  what name del bishop queried with sudden interest  st vincent gregory st vincent  bishops fist shot out and gregory st vincent pitched heavily into the snow  the colonel instinctively raised the stool then helped corliss to hold the pocketminer back  are you crazy man vance demanded  the skunk  i wish id hit m harder was the response  then oh thats all right  let go o me  i wont hit m again  let go o me im goin home  goodnight  as they helped st vincent to his feet vance could have sworn he heard the colonel giggling  and he confessed to it later as he explained it was so curious and unexpected  but he made amends by taking it upon himself to see st vincent home  but why did you hit him corliss asked unavailingly for the fourth time after he had got into his cabin  the mean crawlin skunk the pocketminer gritted in his blankets whatd you stop me for anyway  i wish id hit m twice as hard     chapter xii  mr harney pleased to meet you  dave i believe dave harney  dave harney nodded and gregory st vincent turned to frona  you see miss welse the world is none so large  mr harney and i are not strangers after all  the eldorado king studied the others face until a glimmering intelligence came to him  hold on he cried as st vincent started to speak i got my finger on you  you were smoothfaced then  lets see86 fall of 87 summer of 88yep thats when  summer of 88 i come floatin a raft out of stewart river loaded down with quarters of moose an strainin to make the lower country fore they went bad  yep an down the yukon you come in a linderman boat  an i was holdin strong ez it was wednesday an my pardner ez it was friday an you put us straightsunday i blieve it was  yep sunday  i declare  nine years ago  and we swapped moosesteaks fer flour an bakin soda ananan sugar  by the jimcracky  im glad to see you  he shoved out his hand and they shook again  come an see me he invited as he moved away  ive a right tidy little shack up on the hill and another on eldorado  latchstrings always out  come an see me an stay ez long ez youve a mind to sorry to quit you cold but i got to traipse down to the opery house and collect my taxessugar  miss fronall tell you  you are a surprise mr st vincent  frona switched back to the point of interest after briefly relating harneys saccharine difficulties  the country must indeed have been a wilderness nine years ago and to think that you went through it at that early day  do tell me about it  gregory st vincent shrugged his shoulders there is very little to tell  it was an ugly failure filled with many things that are not nice and containing nothing of which to be proud  but do tell me i enjoy such things  they seem closer and truer to life than the ordinary everyday happenings  a failure as you call it implies something attempted  what did you attempt  he noted her frank interest with satisfaction  well if you will i can tell you in few words all there is to tell  i took the mad idea into my head of breaking a new path around the world and in the interest of science and journalism particularly journalism i proposed going through alaska crossing the bering straits on the ice and journeying to europe by way of northern siberia  it was a splendid undertaking most of it being virgin ground only i failed  i crossed the straits in good order but came to grief in eastern siberiaall because of tamerlane is the excuse i have grown accustomed to making  a ulysses  mrs schoville clapped her hands and joined them  a modern ulysses  how romantic  but not an othello frona replied  his tongue is a sluggard  he leaves one at the most interesting point with an enigmatical reference to a man of a bygone age  you take an unfair advantage of us mr st vincent and we shall be unhappy until you show how tamerlane brought your journey to an untimely end  he laughed and with an effort put aside his reluctance to speak of his travels  when tamerlane swept with fire and sword over eastern asia states were disrupted cities overthrown and tribes scattered like stardust  in fact a vast people was hurled broadcast over the land fleeing before the mad lust of the conquerors these refugees swung far into siberia circling to the north and east and fringing the rim of the polar basin with a spray of mongol tribesam i not tiring you  no no mrs schoville exclaimed  it is fascinating  your method of narration is so vivid  it reminds me ofof  of macaulay st vincent laughed goodnaturedly  you know i am a journalist and he has strongly influenced my style  but i promise you i shall tone down  however to return had it not been for these mongol tribes i should not have been halted in my travels  instead of being forced to marry a greasy princess and to become proficient in interclannish warfare and reindeerstealing i should have travelled easily and peaceably to st petersburg  oh these heroes  are they not exasperating frona  but what about the reindeerstealing and the greasy princesses  the gold commissioners wife beamed upon him and glancing for permission to frona he went on  the coast people were esquimo stock merrynatured and happy and inoffensive  they called themselves the oukilion or the sea men  i bought dogs and food from them and they treated me splendidly  but they were subject to the chow chuen or interior people who were known as the deer men  the chow chuen were a savage indomitable breed with all the fierceness of the untamed mongol plus double his viciousness as soon as i left the coast they fell upon me confiscated my goods and made me a slave  but were there no russians mrs schoville asked  russians  among the chow chuen  he laughed his amusement geographically they are within the white tsars domain but politically no  i doubt if they ever heard of him  remember the interior of northeastern siberia is hidden in the polar gloom a terra incognita where few men have gone and none has returned  but you  i chance to be the exception  why i was spared i do not know  it just so happened  at first i was vilely treated beaten by the women and children clothed in vermininfested mangy furs and fed on refuse they were utterly heartless  how i managed to survive is beyond me but i know that often and often at first i meditated suicide  the only thing that saved me during that period from taking my own life was the fact that i quickly became too stupefied and bestial what of my suffering and degradation  halffrozen halfstarved undergoing untold misery and hardship beaten many and many a time into insensibility i became the sheerest animal  on looking back much of it seems a dream  there are gaps which my memory cannot fill  i have vague recollections of being lashed to a sled and dragged from camp to camp and tribe to tribe  carted about for exhibition purposes i suppose much as we do lions and elephants and wild men  how far i so journeyed up and down that bleak region i cannot guess though it must have been several thousand miles  i do know that when consciousness returned to me and i really became myself again i was fully a thousand miles to the west of the point where i was captured  it was springtime and from out of a forgotten past it seemed i suddenly opened my eyes  a reindeer thong was about my waist and made fast to the tailend of a sled  this thong i clutched with both hands like an organgrinders monkey for the flesh of my body was raw and in great sores from where the thong had cut in  a low cunning came to me and i made myself agreeable and servile that night i danced and sang and did my best to amuse them for i was resolved to incur no more of the maltreatment which had plunged me into darkness  now the deer men traded with the sea men and the sea men with the whites especially the whalers  so later i discovered a deck of cards in the possession of one of the women and i proceeded to mystify the chow chuen with a few commonplace tricks  likewise with fitting solemnity i perpetrated upon them the little i knew of parlor legerdemain  result i was appreciated at once and was better fed and better clothed  to make a long story short i gradually became a man of importance first the old people and the women came to me for advice and later the chiefs  my slight but rough and ready knowledge of medicine and surgery stood me in good stead and i became indispensable  from a slave i worked myself to a seat among the head men and in war and peace so soon as i had learned their ways was an unchallenged authority  reindeer was their medium of exchange their unit of value as it were and we were almost constantly engaged in cattle forays among the adjacent clans or in protecting our own herds from their inroads  i improved upon their methods taught them better strategy and tactics and put a snap and go into their operations which no neighbor tribe could withstand  but still though i became a power i was no nearer my freedom  it was laughable for i had overreached myself and made myself too valuable  they cherished me with exceeding kindness but they were jealously careful  i could go and come and command without restraint but when the trading parties went down to the coast i was not permitted to accompany them  that was the one restriction placed upon my movements  also it is very tottery in the high places and when i began altering their political structures i came to grief again  in the process of binding together twenty or more of the neighboring tribes in order to settle rival claims i was given the overlordship of the federation but old piune was the greatest of the underchiefsa king in a wayand in relinquishing his claim to the supreme leadership he refused to forego all the honors  the least that could be done to appease him was for me to marry his daughter ilswunga  nay he demanded it  i offered to abandon the federation but he would not hear of it  and  and mrs schoville murmured ecstatically  and i married ilswunga which is the chow chuen name for wild deer poor ilswunga  like swinburnes iseult of brittany and i tristram the last i saw of her she was playing solitaire in the mission of irkutsky and stubbornly refusing to take a bath  oh mercy  its ten oclock mrs schoville suddenly cried her husband having at last caught her eye from across the room  im so sorry i cant hear the rest mr st vincent how you escaped and all that  but you must come and see me  i am just dying to hear  and i took you for a tenderfoot a chechaquo frona said meekly as st vincent tied his earflaps and turned up his collar preparatory to leaving  i dislike posing he answered matching her meekness  it smacks of insincerity it really is untrue  and it is so easy to slip into it look at the oldtimerssourdoughs as they proudly call themselves just because they have been in the country a few years they let themselves grow wild and woolly and glorify in it  they may not know it but it is a pose  in so far as they cultivate salient peculiarities they cultivate falseness to themselves and live lies  i hardly think you are wholly just frona said in defence of her chosen heroes  i do like what you say about the matter in general and i detest posing but the majority of the oldtimers would be peculiar in any country under any circumstances  that peculiarity is their own it is their mode of expression  and it is i am sure just what makes them go into new countries  the normal man of course stays at home  oh i quite agree with you miss welse he temporized easily  i did not intend it so sweepingly  i meant to brand that sprinkling among them who are poseurs  in the main as you say they are honest and sincere and natural  then we have no quarrel  but mr st vincent before you go would you care to come tomorrow evening  we are getting up theatricals for christmas  i know you can help us greatly and i think it will not be altogether unenjoyable to you  all the younger people are interestedthe officials officers of police mining engineers gentlemen rovers and so forth to say nothing of the nice women  you are bound to like them  i am sure i shall as he took her hand  tomorrow did you say  tomorrow evening  goodnight  a brave man she told herself as she went bade from the door and a splendid type of the race     chapter xiii  gregory st vincent swiftly became an important factor in the social life of dawson  as a representative of the amalgamated press association he had brought with him the best credentials a powerful influence could obtain and over and beyond he was well qualified socially by his letters of introduction  it developed in a quiet way that he was a wanderer and explorer of no small parts and that he had seen life and strife pretty well all over the earths crust  and withal he was so mild and modest about it that nobody not even among the men was irritated by his achievements  incidentally he ran across numerous old acquaintances  jacob welse he had met at st michaels in the fall of 88 just prior to his crossing bering straits on the ice  a month or so later father barnum who had come up from the lower river to take charge of the hospital had met him a couple of hundred miles on his way north of st michaels  captain alexander of the police had rubbed shoulders with him in the british legation at peking  and bettles another oldtimer of standing had met him at fort o yukon nine years before  so dawson ever prone to look askance at the casual comer received him with open arms  especially was he a favorite with the women  as a promoter of pleasures and an organizer of amusements he took the lead and it quickly came to pass that no function was complete without him not only did he come to help in the theatricals but insensibly and as a matter of course he took charge  frona as her friends charged was suffering from a stroke of ibsen so they hit upon the dolls house and she was cast for nora  corliss who was responsible by the way for the theatricals having first suggested them was to take torvalds part but his interest seemed to have died out or at any rate he begged off on the plea of business rush  so st vincent without friction took torvalds lines  corliss did manage to attend one rehearsal  it might have been that he had come tired from forty miles with the dogs and it might have been that torvald was obliged to put his arm about nora at divers times and to toy playfully with her ear but one way or the other corliss never attended again  busy he certainly was and when not away on trail he was closeted almost continually with jacob welse and colonel trethaway  that it was a deal of magnitude was evidenced by the fact that welses mining interests involved alone mounted to several millions  corliss was primarily a worker and doer and on discovering that his thorough theoretical knowledge lacked practical experience he felt put upon his mettle and worked the harder  he even marvelled at the silliness of the men who had burdened him with such responsibilities simply because of his pull and he told trethaway as much  but the colonel while recognizing his shortcomings liked him for his candor and admired him for his effort and for the quickness with which he came to grasp things actual  del bishop who had refused to play any hand but his own had gone to work for corliss because by so doing he was enabled to play his own hand better  he was practically unfettered while the opportunities to further himself were greatly increased  equipped with the best of outfits and a magnificent dogteam his task was mainly to run the various creeks and keep his eyes and ears open  a pocketminer first last and always he was privately on the constant lookout for pockets which occupation did not interfere in the least with the duty he owed his employer  and as the days went by he stored his mind with miscellaneous data concerning the nature of the various placer deposits and the lay of the land against the summer when the thawed surface and the running water would permit him to follow a trace from creekbed to sideslope and source  corliss was a good employer paid well and considered it his right to work men as he worked himself  those who took service with him either strengthened their own manhood and remained or quit and said harsh things about him  jacob welse noted this trait with appreciation and he sounded the mining engineers praises continually  frona heard and was gratified for she liked the things her father liked and she was more gratified because the man was corliss  but in his rush of business she saw less of him than formerly while st vincent came to occupy a greater and growing portion of her time  his healthful optimistic spirit pleased her while he corresponded well to her idealized natural man and favorite racial type  her first doubtthat if what he said was truehad passed away  all the evidence had gone counter  men who at first questioned the truth of his wonderful adventures gave in after hearing him talk  those to any extent conversant with the parts of the world he made mention of could not but acknowledge that he knew what he talked about  young soley representing bannocks news syndicate and holmes of the fairweather recollected his return to the world in 91 and the sensation created thereby  and sid winslow pacific coast journalist had made his acquaintance at the wanderers club shortly after he landed from the united states revenue cutter which had brought him down from the north further as frona well saw he bore the earmarks of his experiences they showed their handiwork in his whole outlook on life  then the primitive was strong in him and his was a passionate race pride which fully matched hers  in the absence of corliss they were much together went out frequently with the dogs and grew to know each other thoroughly  all of which was not pleasant to corliss especially when the brief intervals he could devote to her were usually intruded upon by the correspondent  naturally corliss was not drawn to him and other men who knew or had heard of the opera house occurrence only accepted him after a tentative fashion  trethaway had the indiscretion once or twice to speak slightingly of him but so fiercely was he defended by his admirers that the colonel developed the good taste to thenceforward keep his tongue between his teeth  once corliss listening to an extravagant panegyric bursting from the lips of mrs schoville permitted himself the luxury of an incredulous smile but the quick wave of color in fronas face and the gathering of the brows warned him  at another time he was unwise enough and angry enough to refer to the opera house broil  he was carried away and what he might have said of that nights happening would have redounded neither to st vincents credit nor to his own had not frona innocently put a seal upon his lips ere he had properly begun  yes she said  mr st vincent told me about it  he met you for the first time that night i believe  you all fought royally on his sideyou and colonel trethaway  he spoke his admiration unreservedly and to tell the truth with enthusiasm  corliss made a gesture of depreciation  no no  from what he said you must have behaved splendidly  and i was most pleased to hear  it must be great to give the brute the rein now and again and healthy too  great for us who have wandered from the natural and softened to sickly ripeness  just to shake off artificiality and rage up and down and yet the inmost mentor serene and passionless viewing all and saying this is my other self behold  i who am now powerless am the power behind and ruleth still this other self mine ancient violent elder self rages blindly as the beast but tis i sitting apart who discern the merit of the cause and bid him rage or bid him cease  oh to be a man  corliss could not help a humoring smile which put frona upon defence at once  tell me vance how did it feel  have i not described it rightly were the symptoms yours  did you not hold aloof and watch yourself play the brute  he remembered the momentary daze which came when he stunned the man with his fist and nodded  and pride she demanded inexorably  or shame  aa little of both and more of the first than the second he confessed  at the time i suppose i was madly exultant then afterwards came the shame and i tossed awake half the night  and finally  pride i guess  i couldnt help it couldnt down it  i awoke in the morning feeling as though i had won my spurs  in a subconscious way i was inordinately proud of myself and time and again mentally i caught myself throwing chests  then came the shame again and i tried to reason back my selfrespect  and last of all pride  the fight was fair and open  it was none of my seeking  i was forced into it by the best of motives  i am not sorry and i would repeat it if necessary  and rightly so fronas eyes were sparkling  and how did mr st vincent acquit himself  he      oh i suppose all right creditably  i was too busy watching my other self to take notice  but he saw you  most likely so  i acknowledge my negligence  i should have done better the chances are had i thought it would have been of interest to youpardon me  just my bungling wit  the truth is i was too much of a greenhorn to hold my own and spare glances on my neighbors  so corliss went away glad that he had not spoken and keenly appreciating st vincents craft whereby he had so adroitly forestalled adverse comment by telling the story in his own modest selfeffacing way   two men and a woman  the most potent trinity of factors in the creating of human pathos and tragedy  as ever in the history of man since the first father dropped down from his arboreal home and walked upright so at dawson  necessarily there were minor factors not least among which was del bishop who in his aggressive way stepped in and accelerated things  this came about in a trailcamp on the way to miller creek where corliss was bent on gathering in a large number of lowgrade claims which could only be worked profitably on a large scale  ill not be wastin candles when i make a strike savve the pocketminer remarked savagely to the coffee which he was settling with a chunk of ice  not on your life i guess rather not  kerosene corliss queried running a piece of baconrind round the fryingpan and pouring in the batter  kerosene hell  you wont see my trail for smoke when i get a gait on for gods country my wad in my poke and the sunshine in my eyes  say howd a good juicy tenderloin strike you just now green onions fried potatoes and fixins on the side  shelp me thats the first proposition ill hump myself up against  then a general whoopla for a weekseattle or frisco i

over me  great pocket country down there to the east and along the desert  and no house on the ranch  cert  with sweet peas growin up the sides and in back a patch for vegetablesstringbeans and spinach and radishes cucumbers and sparagrass turnips carrots cabbage and such  and a woman inside to draw me back when i get to runnin loco after the pockets  say you know all about minin  did you

off and get married  its the only thingll save you and even then mebbe it wont  i ought a done it years ago  i might a made something of myself if i had jerusalem the jobs ive jumped and the good things chucked in my time just because of pockets  say corliss you want to get married you do and right off  im tellin you straight  take warnin from me and dont stay single any longer than godll let you sure  corliss laughed  sure i mean it  im oldern you and know what im talkin  now theres a bit of a thing down in dawson id like to see you get your hands on  you was made for each other both of you  corliss was past the stage when he would have treated bishops meddling as an impertinence  the trail which turns men into the same blankets and makes them brothers was the great leveller of distinctions as he had come to learn  so he flopped a flapjack and held his tongue  why dont you waltz in and win del demanded insistently  dont you cotton to her  i know you do or you wouldnt come back to cabin after bein with her awalkinlike on air  better waltz in while you got a chance  why there was emmy a tidy bit of flesh as women go and we took to each other on the jump  but i kept achasin pockets and chasin pockets and delayin  and then a big black lumberman a kanuck began sidlin up to her and i made up my mind to speakonly i went off after one more pocket just one more and when i got back she was mrs somebody else  so take warnin  theres that writerguy that skunk i poked outside the opera house  hes walkin right in and gettin thick and heres you just like me aracin round all creation and lettin matrimony slide  mark my words corliss  some fine frost youll come slippin into camp and find em housekeepin  sure  with nothin left for you in life but pocketing  the picture was so unpleasant that corliss turned surly and ordered him to shut up  who  me del asked so aggrievedly that corliss laughed  what would you do then he asked  me  in all kindness ill tell you  as soon as you get back you go and see her  make dates with her ahead till you got to put em on paper to remember em all  get a cinch on her spare time ahead so as to shut the other fellow out  dont

he comes nosin around tryin to file on it youll beat his head off  bishop got up stretched and went outside to feed the dogs  dont forget to beat his head off he called back  and if youre squeamish about it just call on me  i wont keep m waitin long     chapter xiv  ah the salt water miss welse the strong salt water and the big waves and the heavy boats for smooth or roughthat i know  but the fresh water and the little canoes eggshells fairy bubbles a big breath a sigh a heartpulse too much and pouf over you go not so that i do not know  baron courbertin smiled selfcommiseratingly and went on but it is delightful magnificent  i have watched and envied  some day i shall learn  it is not so difficult st vincent interposed  is it miss welse just a sure and delicate poise of mind and body  like the tightrope dancer  oh you are incorrigible frona laughed  i feel certain that you know as much about canoes as we  and you knowa woman  cosmopolitan as the frenchman was the independence and ability for doing of the yankee women were a perpetual wonder to him  how  when i was a very little girl at dyea among the indians  but next spring after the river breaks well give you your first lessons mr st vincent and i  so you see you will return to civilization with accomplishments  and you will surely love it  under such charming tutorship he murmured gallantly  but you mr st vincent do you think i shall be so successful that i may come to love it  do you love ityou who stand always in the background sparing of speech inscrutable as though able but unwilling to speak from out the eternal wisdom of a vast experience  the baron turned quickly to frona  we are old friends did i not tell you  so i may what you americans call josh with him  is it not so mr st vincent  gregory nodded and frona said i am sure you met at the ends of the earth somewhere  yokohama st vincent cut in shortly eleven years ago in cherryblossom time  but baron courbertin does me an injustice which stings unhappily because it is not true  i am afraid when i get started that i talk too much about myself  a martyr to your friends frona conciliated  and such a teller of good tales that your friends cannot forbear imposing upon you  then tell us a canoe story the baron begged  a good one  awhat you yankees calla hairraiser  they drew up to mrs schovilles fat woodburning stove and st  vincent told of the great whirlpool in the box canyon of the terrible corkscrew in the mane of the white horse rapids and of his cowardly comrade who walking around had left him to go through alonenine years before when the yukon was virgin  half an hour later mrs schoville bustled in with corliss in her wake  that hill  the last of my breath she gasped pulling off her mittens never saw such luck she declared none the less vehemently the next moment  this play will never come off  i never shall be mrs linden  how can i  krogstads gone on a stampede to indian river and no one knows when hell be back  krogstad to corliss is mr maybrick you know  and mrs alexander has the neuralgia and cant stir out  so theres no rehearsal today thats flat  she attitudinized dramatically yes in my first terror  but a day has passed and in that day i have seen incredible things in this house  helmer must know everything  there must be an end to this unhappy secret  o krogstad you need me and ii need you and you are over on the indian river making sourdough bread and i shall never see you more  they clapped their applause  my only reward for venturing out and keeping you all waiting was my meeting with this ridiculous fellow  she shoved corliss forward  oh you have not met  baron courbertin mr corliss  if you strike it rich baron i advise you to sell to mr corliss  he has the moneybags of croesus and will buy anything so long as the title is good  and if you dont strike sell anyway  hes a professional philanthropist you know  but would you believe it addressing the general group this ridiculous fellow kindly offered to see me up the hill and gossip along the waygossip though he refused pointblank to come in and watch the rehearsal  but when he found there wasnt to be any he changed about like a weathervane  so here he is claiming to have been away to miller creek but between ourselves there is no telling what dark deeds  dark deeds  look frona broke in pointing to the tip of an amber mouthpiece which projected from vances outside breastpocket  a pipe my congratulations  she held out her hand and he shook goodhumoredly  all dels fault he laughed  when i go before the great white throne it is he who shall stand forth and be responsible for that particular sin  an improvement nevertheless she argued  all that is wanting is a good round swearword now and again  oh i assure you i am not unlearned he retorted  no man can drive dogs else  i can swear from hell to breakfast by damn and back again if you will permit me to the last link of perdition  by the bones of pharaoh and the blood of judas for instance are fairly efficacious with a string of huskies but the best of my dogdriving nomenclature mores the pity women cannot stand  i promise you however in spite of hell and high water  oh  oh mrs schoville screamed thrusting her fingers into her ears  madame baron courbertin spoke up gravely it is a fact a lamentable fact that the dogs of the north are responsible for more mens souls than all other causes put together  is it not so  i leave it to the gentlemen  both corliss and st vincent solemnly agreed and proceeded to detonate the lady by swapping heartrending and apposite dog tales  st vincent and the baron remained behind to take lunch with the gold commissioners wife leaving frona and corliss to go down the hill together  silently consenting as though to prolong the descent they swerved to the right cutting transversely the myriad footpaths and sled roads which led down into the town  it was a middecember day clear and cold and the hesitant highnoon sun having laboriously dragged its pale orb up from behind the southern landrim balked at the great climb to the zenith and began its shamefaced slide back beneath the earth  its oblique rays refracted from the floating frost particles till the air was filled with glittering jeweldustresplendent blazing flashing light and fire but cold as outer space  they passed down through the scintillant magical sheen their moccasins rhythmically crunching the snow and their breaths wreathing mysteriously from their lips in sprayed opalescence  neither spoke nor cared to speak so wonderful was it all  at their feet under the great vault of heaven a speck in the midst of the white vastness huddled the golden citypuny and sordid feebly protesting against immensity mans challenge to the infinite  calls of men and cries of encouragement came sharply to them from close at hand and they halted  there was an eager yelping a scratching of feet and a string of icerimed wolfdogs with hotlolling tongues and dripping jaws pulled up the slope and turned into the path ahead of them  on the sled a long and narrow box of roughsawed spruce told the nature of the freight  two dogdrivers a woman walking blindly and a blackrobed priest made up the funeral cortege  a few paces farther on the dogs were again put against the steep and with whine and shout and clatter the unheeding clay was hauled on and upward to its icehewn hillside chamber  a zoneconqueror frona broke voice  corliss found his thought following hers and answered these battlers of frost and fighters of hunger  i can understand how the dominant races have come down out of the north to empire  strong to venture strong to endure with infinite faith and infinite patience is it to be wondered at  frona glanced at him in eloquent silence  we smote with our swords he chanted to me it was a joy like having my bright bride by me on the couch  i have marched with my bloody sword and the raven has followed me  furiously we fought the fire passed over the dwellings of men we slept in the blood of those who kept the gates  but do you feel it vance she cried her hand flashing out and resting on his arm  i begin to feel i think  the north has taught me is teaching me  the old things come back with new significance  yet i do not know  it seems a tremendous egotism a magnificent dream  but you are not a negro or a mongol nor are you descended from the negro or mongol  yes he considered i am my fathers son and the line goes back to the seakings who never slept under the smoky rafters of a roof or drained the alehorn by inhabited hearth  there must be a reason for the deadstatus of the black a reason for the teuton spreading over the earth as no other race has ever spread  there must be something in race heredity else i would not leap at the summons  a great race vance  half of the earth its heritage and all of the sea  and in threescore generations it has achieved it allthink of it threescore generationsand today it reaches out widerarmed than ever the smiter and the destroyer among nations the builder and the lawgiver  oh vance my love is passionate but god will forgive for it is good  a great race greatly conceived and if to perish greatly to perish  dont you remember  trembles yggdrasils ash yet standing groans that ancient tree and the jotun loki is loosed  the shadows groan on the ways of hel until the fire of surt has consumed the tree  hrym steers from the east the waters rise the mundane snake is coiled in jotunrage  the worm heats the water and the eagle screams the pale of beak tears carcases the ship naglfar is loosed  surt from the south comes with flickering flame shines from his sword the valgods sun  swaying there like a furred valkyrie above the final carnage of men and gods she touched his imagination and the blood surged exultingly along unknown channels thrilling and uplifting  the stony hills are dashed together the giantesses totter men tread the path of hel and heaven is cloven  the sun darkens earth in ocean sinks fall from heaven the bright stars fires breath assails the allnourishing tree towering fire plays against heaven itself  outlined against the blazing air her brows and lashes white with frost the jeweldust striking and washing against hair and face and the southsun lighting her with a great redness the man saw her as the genius of the race  the traditions of the blood laid hold of him and he felt strangely at one with the whiteskinned yellowhaired giants of the younger world  and as he looked upon her the mighty past rose before him and the caverns of his being resounded with the shock and tumult of forgotten battles  with bellowing of stormwinds and crash of smoking north sea waves he saw the sharpbeaked fighting galleys and the seaflung northmen greatmuscled deepchested sprung from the elements men of sword and sweep marauders and scourgers of the warm southlands  the din of twenty centuries of battle was roaring in his ear and the clamor for return to type strong upon him  he seized her hands passionately  be the bright bride by me frona  be the bright bride by me on the couch  she started and looked down at him questioningly  then the import of it reached her and she involuntarily drew back  the sun shot a last failing flicker across the earth and vanished  the fire went out of the air and the day darkened  far above the hearsedogs howled mournfully  no he interrupted as words formed on her lips  do not speak  i know my answer your answer     now     i was a fool     come let us go down  it was not until they had left the mountain behind them crossed the flat and come out on the river by the sawmill that the bustle and skurry of human life made it seem possible for them to speak  corliss had walked with his eyes moodily bent to the ground and frona with head erect and looking everywhere stealing an occasional glance to his face where the road rose over the log runway of the mill the footing was slippery and catching at her to save her from falling their eyes met  ii am grieved she hesitated  and then in unconscious selfdefence it was so     i had not expected itjust then  else you would have prevented he asked bitterly  yes  i think i should have  i did not wish to give you pain  then you expected it some time  and feared it  but i had hoped     i     vance i did not come into the klondike to get married  i liked you at the beginning and i have liked you more and morenever so much as todaybut  but you had never looked upon me in the light of a possible husbandthat is what you are trying to say  as he spoke he looked at her sidewise and sharply and when her eyes met his with the same old frankness the thought of losing her maddened him  but i have she answered at once  i have looked upon you in that light but somehow it was not convincing  why i do not know  there was so much i found to like in you so much  he tried to stop her with a dissenting gesture but she went on  so much to admire  there was all the warmth of friendship and closer friendshipa growing camaraderie in fact but nothing more  though i did not wish more i should have welcomed it had it come  as one welcomes the unwelcome guest  why wont you help me vance instead of making it harder  it is hard on you surely but do you imagine that i am enjoying it  i feel because of your pain and further i know when i refuse a dear friend for a lover the dear friend goes from me  i do not part with friends lightly  i see doubly bankrupt friend and lover both  but they are easily replaced  i fancy i was half lost before i spoke  had i remained silent it would have been the same anyway  time softens new associations new thoughts and faces men with marvellous adventures  she stopped him abruptly  it is useless vance no matter what you may say  i shall not quarrel with you  i can understand how you feel  if i am quarrelsome then i had better leave you  he halted suddenly and she stood beside him  here comes dave harney  he will see you home  its only a step  you are doing neither yourself nor me kindness  she spoke with final firmness  i decline to consider this the end  we are too close to it to understand it fairly  you must come and see me when we are both calmer  i refuse to be treated in this fashion  it is childish of you she shot a hasty glance at the approaching eldorado king  i do not think i deserve it at your hands  i refuse to lose you as a friend  and i insist that you come and see me that things remain on the old footing  he shook his head  hello dave harney touched his cap and slowed down loosejointedly sorry you didnt take my tip  dogs gone up a dollar a pound since yesterday and still awhoopin  goodafternoon miss frona and mr corliss  goin my way  miss welse is  corliss touched the visor of his cap and halfturned on his heel  wherere you off to dave demanded  got an appointment he lied  remember frona called to him you must come and see me  too busy im afraid just now  goodby  so long dave  jemimy dave remarked staring after him but hes a hustler  always busywith big things too  wonder why he didnt go in for dogs     chapter xv  but corliss did go back to see her and before the day was out  a little bitter selfcommunion had not taken long to show him his childishness  the sting of loss was hard enough but the thought now they could be nothing to each other that her last impressions of him should be bad hurt almost as much and in a way even more  and further putting all to the side he was really ashamed  he had thought that he could have taken such a disappointment more manfully especially since in advance he had not been at all sure of his footing  so he called upon her walked with her up to the barracks and on the way with her help managed to soften the awkwardness which the morning had left between them  he talked reasonably and meekly which she countenanced and would have apologized roundly had she not prevented him  not the slightest bit of blame attaches to you she said  had i been in your place i should probably have done the same and behaved much more outrageously  for you were outrageous you know  but had you been in my place and i in yours he answered with a weak attempt at humor there would have been no need  she smiled glad that he was feeling less strongly about it  but unhappily our social wisdom does not permit such a reversal he added more with a desire to be saying something  ah she laughed  theres where my jesuitism comes in  i can rise above our social wisdom  you dont mean to saythat  there shocked as usual  no i could not be so crude as to speak outright but i might finesse as you whistplayers say  accomplish the same end only with greater delicacy  after all a distinction without a difference  could you he asked  i know i couldif the occasion demanded  i am not one to let what i might deem lifehappiness slip from me without a struggle  that judicially occurs only in books and among sentimentalists  as my father always says i belong to the strugglers and fighters  that which appeared to me great and sacred that would i battle for though i brought heaven tumbling about my ears  you have made me very happy vance she said at parting by the barracks gates  and things shall go along in the same old way  and mind not a bit less of you than formerly but rather much more   but corliss after several perfunctory visits forgot the way which led to jacob welses home and applied himself savagely to his work  he even had the hypocrisy at times to felicitate himself upon his escape and to draw bleak fireside pictures of the dismal future which would have been had he and frona incompatibly mated  but this was only at times  as a rule the thought of her made him hungry in a way akin to physical hunger and the one thing he found to overcome it was hard work and plenty of it  but even then what of trail and creek and camp and survey he could only get away from her in his waking hours in his sleep he was ignobly conquered and del bishop who was with him much studied his restlessness and gave a ready ear to his mumbled words  the pocketminer put two and two together and made a correct induction from the different little things which came under his notice  but this did not require any great astuteness  the simple fact that he no longer called on frona was sufficient evidence of an unprospering suit but del went a step farther and drew the corollary that st vincent was the cause of it all  several times he had seen the correspondent with frona going one place and another and was duly incensed thereat  ill fix m yet he muttered in camp one evening over on gold bottom  whom corliss queried  who  that newspaper man thats who  what for  awgeneral principles  whynt you let me paste m that night at the opera house  corliss laughed at the recollection  why did you strike him del  general principles del snapped back and shut up  but del bishop for all his punitive spirit did not neglect the main chance and on the return trip when they came to the forks of eldorado and bonanza he called a halt  say corliss he began at once dyou know what a hunch is  his employer nodded his comprehension  well ive got one  i aint never asked favors of you before but this once i want you to lay over here till tomorrow  seems to me my fruit ranch is most in sight  i can damn near smell the oranges aripenin  certainly corliss agreed  but better still ill run on down to dawson and you can come in when youve finished hunching  say del objected  i said it was a hunch and i want to ring you in on it savve  youre all right and youve learned a hell of a lot out of books  youre a regular highroller when it comes to the laboratory and all that but it takes yours truly to get down and read the face of nature without spectacles  now ive got a theory  corliss threw up his hands in affected dismay and the pocketminer began to grow angry  thats right  laugh  but its built right up on your own pet theory of erosion and changed riverbeds  and i didnt pocket among the mexicans two years for nothin  where dyou spose this eldorado gold came fromrough and no signs of washin  eh  theres where you need your spectacles  books have made you shortsighted  but never mind how  tisnt exactly pockets neither but i know what im spelling about  i aint been keepin tab on traces for my health  i can tell you mining sharps more about the lay of eldorado creek in one minute than you could figure out in a month of sundays  but never mind no offence  you lay over with me till tomorrow and you can buy a ranch longside of mine sure well all right  i can rest up and look over my notes while youre hunting your ancient riverbed  didnt i tell you it was a hunch del reproachfully demanded  and havent i agreed to stop over  what more do you want  to give you a fruit ranch thats what  just to go with me and nose round a bit thats all  i do not want any of your impossible fruit ranches  im tired and worried cant you leave me alone  i think i am more than fair when i humor you to the extent of stopping over  you may waste your time nosing around but i shall stay in camp  understand  burn my body but youre grateful  by the jumpin methuselah ill quit my job in two minutes if you dont fire me  me alayin wake nights and workin up my theory and calculatin on lettin you in and you asnorin and fronathis and fronathat  thatll do  stop it  the hell it will  if i didnt know more about goldmining than you do about courtin  corliss sprang at him but del dodged to one side and put up his fists then he ducked a wild right and left swing and sidestepped his way into firmer footing on the hard trail  hold on a moment he cried as corliss made to come at him again just a second  if i lick you will you come up the hillside with me  yes  and if i dont you can fire me  thats fair  come on  vance had no show whatever as del well knew who played with him feinting attacking retreating dazzling and disappearing every now and again out of his field of vision in a most exasperating way  as vance speedily discovered he possessed very little correlation between mind and body and the next thing he discovered was that he was lying in the snow and slowly coming back to his senses  howhow did you do it he stammered to the pocketminer who had his head on his knee and was rubbing his forehead with snow  oh youll do del laughed helping him limply to his feet  youre the right stuff  ill show you some time  youve got lots to learn yet what you wont find in books  but not now  weve got to wade in and make camp then youre comin up the hill with me  hee hee he chuckled later as they fitted the pipe of the yukon stove  slow sighted and short  couldnt follow me eh  but ill show you some time oh ill show you all right all right  grab an axe an come on he commanded when the camp was completed  he led the way up eldorado borrowed a pick shovel and pan at a cabin and headed up among the benches near the mouth of french creek vance though feeling somewhat sore was laughing at himself by this time and enjoying the situation  he exaggerated the humility with which he walked at the heel of his conqueror while the extravagant servility which marked his obedience to his hired man made that individual grin  youll do  youve got the makins in you  del threw down the tools and scanned the run of the snowsurface carefully  here take the axe shinny up the hill and lug me down some skookum dry wood  by the time corliss returned with the last load of wood the pocketminer had cleared away the snow and moss in divers spots and formed in general design a rude cross  cuttin her both ways he explained  mebbe ill hit her here or over there or up above but if theres anything in the hunch this is the place  bedrock dips in above and its deep there and most likely richer but too much work  this is the rim of the bench  cant be moren a couple of feet down  all we want is indications afterwards we can tap in from the side  as he talked he started fires here and there on the uncovered spaces but look here corliss i want you to mind this aint pocketin  this is just plain ordinary prentice work but pocketinhe straightened up his back and spoke reverentlybut pocketin is the deepest science and the finest art  delicate to a hairsbreadth hand and eye true and steady as steel  when youve got to burn your pan blueblack twice a day and out of a shovelful of gravel wash down to the one wee speck of flour goldwhy thats washin thats what it is  tell you what id sooner follow a pocket than eat  and you would sooner fight than do either  bishop stopped to consider   he weighed himself with care equal to that of retaining the one wee speck of flour gold  no i wouldnt neither  id take pocketin in mine every time  its as bad as dope corliss sure  if it once gets ahold of you youre a goner  youll never shake it look at me  and talk about pipedreams they cant burn a candle longside of it  he walked over and kicked one of the fires apart  then he lifted the pick and the steel point drove in and stopped with a metallic clang as though brought up by solid cement  aint thawed two inches he muttered stooping down and groping with his fingers in the wet muck  the blades of last years grass had been burned away but he managed to gather up and tear away a handful of the roots  hell  whats the matter corliss asked  hell he repeated in a passionless way knocking the dirtcovered roots against the pan  corliss went over and stooped to closer inspection  hold on he cried picking up two or three grimy bits of dirt and rubbing them with his fingers  a bright yellow flashed forth  hell the pocketminer reiterated tonelessly  first rattle out the box  begins at the grass roots and goes all the way down  head turned to the side and up eyes closed nostrils distended and quivering he rose suddenly to his feet and sniffed the air  corliss looked up wonderingly  huh the pocketminer grunted  then he drew a deep breath  cant you smell them oranges     chapter xvi  the stampede to french hill was on by the beginning of christmas week corliss and bishop had been in no hurry to record for they looked the ground over carefully before blazing their stakes and let a few close friends into the secretharney welse trethaway a dutch chechaquo who had forfeited both feet to the frost a couple of the mounted police an old pal with whom del had prospected through the black hills country the washerwoman at the forks and last and notably lucile corliss was responsible for her getting in on the lay and he drove and marked her stakes himself though it fell to the colonel to deliver the invitation to her to come and be rich  in accordance with the custom of the country those thus benefited offered to sign over halfinterests to the two discoverers  corliss would not tolerate the proposition  del was similarly minded though swayed by no ethical reasons  he had enough as it stood  got my fruit ranch paid for double the size i was calculatin on he explained and if i had any more i wouldnt know what to do with it sure  after the strike corliss took it upon himself as a matter of course to look about for another man but when he brought a keeneyed californian into camp del was duly wroth  not on your life he stormed  but you are rich now vance answered and have no need to work  rich hell the pocketminer rejoined  accordin to covenant you cant fire me and im goin to hold the job down as long as my sweet willll let me  savve  on friday morning early all interested parties appeared before the gold commissioner to record their claims  the news went abroad immediately  in five minutes the first stampeders were hitting the trail  at the end of half an hour the town was afoot  to prevent mistakes on their propertyjumping moving of stakes and mutilation of noticesvance and del after promptly recording started to return  but with the government seal attached to their holdings they took it leisurely the stampeders sliding past them in a steady stream midway del chanced to look behind  st vincent was in sight footing it at a lively pace the regulation stampeding pack on his shoulders the trail made a sharp bend at that place and with the exception of the three of them no one was in sight  dont speak to me  dont recognize me del cautioned sharply as he spoke buttoning his nosestrap across his face which served to quite hide his identity  theres a waterhole over there  get down on your belly and make a blind at gettin a drink  then go on by your lonely to the claims ive business of my own to handle  and for the love of your bother dont say a word to me or to the skunk  dont let m see your face  corliss obeyed wonderingly stepping aside from the beaten path lying down in the snow and dipping into the waterhole with an empty condensed milkcan  bishop bent on one knee and stooped as though fastening his moccasin  just as st vincent came up with him he finished tying the knot and started forward with the feverish haste of a man trying to make up for lost time  i say hold on my man the correspondent called out to him  bishop shot a hurried glance at him and pressed on  st vincent broke into a run till they were side by side again  is this the way  to the benches of french hill del snapped him short  betcher your life  thats the way im headin  so long  he ploughed forward at a tremendous rate and the correspondent halfrunning swung in behind with the evident intention of taking the pace  corliss still in the dark lifted his head and watched them go but when he saw the pocketminer swerve abruptly to the right and take the trail up adams creek the light dawned upon him and he laughed softly to himself  late that night del arrived in camp on eldorado exhausted but jubilant  didnt do a thing to him he cried before he was half inside the tentflaps  gimme a bite to eat grabbing at the teapot and running a hot flood down his throatcookinfat slush old moccasins candleends anything  then he collapsed upon the blankets and fell to rubbing his stiff legmuscles while corliss fried bacon and dished up the beans  what about m he exulted between mouthfuls  well you can stack your chips that he didnt get in on the french hill benches  how far is it my man in the wellmimicked patronizing tones of st vincent  how far is it with the patronage left out  how far to french hill weakly  how far do you think it is very weakly with a tremolo which hinted of repressed tears  how far  the pocketminer burst into roars of laughter which were choked by a misdirected flood of tea and which left him coughing and speechless  whered i leave m when he had recovered  over on the divide to indian river winded plumbeaten done for  just about able to crawl into the nearest camp and thats about all  ive covered fifty stiff miles myself so heres for bed  goodnight  dont call me in the mornin  he turned into the blankets allstanding and as he dozed off vance could hear him muttering how far is it my man  i say how far is it   regarding lucile corliss was disappointed  i confess i cannot understand her he said to colonel trethaway  i thought her bench claim would make her independent of the opera house  you cant get a dump out in a day the colonel interposed  but you can mortgage the dirt in the ground when it prospects as hers does  yet i took that into consideration and offered to advance her a few thousand noninterest bearing and she declined  said she didnt need itin fact was really grateful thanked me and said that any time i was short to come and see her  trethaway smiled and played with his watchchain  what would you life even here certainly means more to you and me than a bit of grub a piece of blanket and a yukon stove  she is as gregarious as the rest of us and probably a little more so  suppose you cut her off from the opera housewhat then  may she go up to the barracks and consort with the captains lady make social calls on mrs schoville or chum with frona  dont you see  will you escort her in daylight down the public street  will you vance demanded  ay the colonel replied unhesitatingly and with pleasure  and so will i but  he paused and gazed gloomily into the fire but see how she is going on with st vincent  as thick as thieves they are and always together  puzzles me trethaway admitted  i can grasp st vincents side of it  many irons in the fire and lucile owns a bench claim on the second tier of french hill  mark me corliss we can tell infallibly the day that frona consents to go to his bed and boardif she ever does consent  and that will be  the day st vincent breaks with lucile  corliss pondered and the colonel went on  but i cant grasp luciles side of it  what she can see in st vincent  her taste is no worse thanthan that of the rest of the women vance broke in hotly  i am sure that  frona could not display poor taste eh  corliss turned on his heel and walked out and left colonel trethaway smiling grimly  vance corliss never knew how many people directly and indirectly had his cause at heart that christmas week  two men strove in particular one for him and one for the sake of frona  pete whipple an oldtimer in the land possessed an eldorado claim directly beneath french hill also a woman of the country for a wifea swarthy breed not over pretty whose indian mother had mated with a russian furtrader some thirty years before at kutlik on the great delta  bishop went down one sunday morning to yarn away an hour or so with whipple but found the wife alone in the cabin  she talked a bastard english gibberish which was an anguish to hear so the pocketminer resolved to smoke a pipe and depart without rudeness  but he got her tongue wagging and to such an extent that he stopped and smoked many pipes and whenever she lagged urged her on again  he grunted and chuckled and swore in undertones while he listened punctuating her narrative regularly with hells which adequately expressed the many shades of interest he felt  in the midst of it the woman fished an ancient leatherbound volume all scarred and marred from the bottom of a dilapidated chest and thereafter it lay on the table between them  though it remained unopened she constantly referred to it by look and gesture and each time she did so a greedy light blazed in bishops eyes  at the end when she could say no more and had repeated herself from two to half a dozen times he pulled out his sack  mrs whipple set up the gold scales and placed the weights which he counterbalanced with a hundred dollars worth of dust  then he departed up the hill to the tent hugging the purchase closely and broke in on corliss who sat in the blankets mending moccasins  ill fix m yet del remarked casually at the same time patting the book and throwing it down on the bed  corliss looked up inquiringly and opened it  the paper was yellow with age and rotten from the weatherwear of trail while the text was printed in russian  i didnt know you were a russian scholar del he quizzed  but i cant read a line of it  neither can i mores the pity nor does whipples woman savve the lingo  i got it from her  but her old manhe was full russian you knowhe used to read it aloud to her  but she knows what she knows and what her old man knew and so do i  and what do the three of you know  oh thats tellin bishop answered coyly  but you wait and watch my smoke and when you see it risin youll know too   matt mccarthy came in over the ice christmas week summed up the situation so far as frona and st vincent were concerned and did not like it  dave harney furnished him with full information to which he added that obtained from lucile with whom he was on good terms perhaps it was because he received the full benefit of the sum of their prejudice but no matter how he at any rate answered rollcall with those who looked upon the correspondent with disfavor  it was impossible for them to tell why they did not approve of the man but somehow st vincent was never much of a success with men  this in turn might have been due to the fact that he shone so resplendently with women as to cast his fellows in eclipse for otherwise in his intercourse with men he was all that a man could wish  there was nothing domineering or overriding about him while he manifested a good fellowship at least equal to their own  yet having withheld his judgment after listening to lucile and harney matt mccarthy speedily reached a verdict upon spending an hour with st vincent at jacob welsesand this in face of the fact that what lucile had said had been invalidated by matts learning of her intimacy with the man in question  strong of friendship quick of heart and hand matt did not let the grass grow under his feet  tis ill be takin a social fling meself as befits a mimber iv the noble eldorado dynasty he explained and went up the hill to a whist party in dave harneys cabin  to himself he added an belike if satan takes his eye off his own ill put it to that young cub iv his  but more than once during the evening he discovered himself challenging his own judgment  probe as he would with his innocent wit matt found himself baffled  st vincent certainly rang true  simple lighthearted unaffected joking and being joked in all goodnature thoroughly democratic  matt failed to catch the faintest echo of insincerity  may the dogs walk on me grave he communed with himself while studying a hand which suffered from a plethora of trumps  is it the years are tellin puttin the frost in me veins and chillin the blood  a likely lad an is it for me to misjudge because his is atakin way with the ladies  just because the swate creatures smile on the lad an flutter warm at the sight iv him  bright eyes and brave men  tis the way they have iv lovin valor  theyre shuddered an shocked at the cruel an bloody dades iv war yet who so quick do they lose their hearts to as the brave butcherbye iv a sodger  why not the lads done brave things and the girls give him the warm soft smile  small reason that for me to be callin him the devils own cub  out upon ye matt mccarthy for a crusty old sourdough with vitals frozen an summer gone from yer heart  tis an ossification yeve become  but bide a wee matt bide a wee he supplemented wait till yeve felt the fale iv his flesh   the opportunity came shortly when st vincent with frona opposite swept in the full thirteen tricks  a rampse matt cried  vincent me lad a rampse  yer hand on it me brave  it was a stout grip neither warm nor clammy but matt shook his head dubiously  whats the good iv botherin he muttered to himself as he shuffled the cards for the next deal  ye old fool  find out first how frona darlin stands an if its pat she is thin tis time for doin  oh mccarthys all hunky dave harney assured them later on coming to the rescue of st vincent who was getting the rough side of the irishmans wit  the evening was over and the company was putting on its wraps and mittens  didnt tell you bout his visit to the cathedral did he when he was on the outside  well it was suthin like this ez he was explainin it to me  he went to the cathedral durin service an took in the priests and choirboys in their surplicesparkas he called eman watched the burnin of the holy incense  an do ye know dave he sez to me they got in an made a smudge and there want a darned mosquito in sight  true ivery word iv it  matt unblushingly fathered harneys yarn an did ye niver hear tell iv the time dave an me got drunk on condensed milk  oh  horrors cried mrs schoville  but how  do tell us  twas durin the time iv the candle famine at forty mile  cold snap on an dave slides into me shack to pass the time o day and glues his eyes on me case iv condensed milk  howd ye like a sip iv morans good whiskey he sez eyin the case iv milk the while  i confiss me mouth went wet at the naked thought iv it  but whats the use iv likin sez i with me sack bulgin with emptiness  candles worth tin dollars the dozen sez he a dollar apiece  will ye give six cans iv milk for a bottle iv the old stuff  howll ye do it sez i trust me sez he  give me the

cans freeze the milk into his candlemoulds an trade them in to bill moran for a bottle iv tanglefoot  as soon as he could be heard through the laughter harney raised his voice  its true as mccarthy tells but hes only told you the half cant you guess the rest matt  matt shook his head  bein short on milk myself an not over much sugar i doctored three of your cans with water which went to make the candles  an by the bye i had milk in my coffee for a month to come  its on me dave mccarthy admitted  tis only that yer me host or id be shockin the ladies with yer nortorious disgraces  but ill lave ye live this time dave  come spade the partin guests we must be movin  no ye dont ye young laddybuck he interposed as st vincent started to take frona down the hill tis her fosterdaddy sees her home this night  mccarthy laughed in his silent way and offered his arm to frona while st vincent joined in the laugh against himself dropped back and joined miss mortimer and baron courbertin  whats this im hearin about you an vincent matt bluntly asked as soon as they had drawn apart from the others  he looked at her with his keen gray eyes but she returned the look quite as keenly  how should i know what you have been hearing she countered  whin the talk goes round iv a maid an a man the one pretty an the other not unhandsome both young an neither married does it token aught but the one thing  yes  an the one thing the greatest thing in all the world  well frona was the least bit angry and did not feel inclined to help him  marriage iv course he blurted out  tis said it looks that way with the pair of ye  but is it said that it is that way  isnt the looks iv it enough  he demanded  no and you are old enough to know better  mr st vincent and iwe enjoy each other as friends that is all  but suppose it is as you say what of it  well mccarthy deliberated theres other talk goes round  tis said vincent is overthick with a jade down in the townlucile they speak iv her  all of which signifies  she waited and mccarthy watched her dumbly  i know lucile and i like her frona continued filling the gap of his silence and ostentatiously manoeuvring to help him on  do you know her  dont you like her  matt started to speak cleared his throat and halted  at last in desperation he blurted out for two cents frona id lay ye acrost me knee  she laughed  you dont dare  im not running barelegged at dyea  now dont be tasin he blarneyed  im not teasing  dont you like herlucile  an what iv it he challenged brazenly  just what i askedwhat of it  thin ill tell ye in plain words from a man old enough to be yer father  tis undacent damnably undacent for a man to kape company with a good young girl  thank you she laughed dropping a courtesy  then she added half in bitterness there have been others who  name me the man he cried hotly  there there go on  you were saying  that its a crying shame for a man to kape company withwith you an at the same time be chake by jowl with a woman iv her stamp  and why  to come drippin from the muck to dirty yer claneness  an ye can ask why  but wait matt wait a moment  granting your premises  little i know iv primises he growled  tis facts im dalin with  frona bit her lip  never mind  have it as you will but let me go on and i will deal with facts too  when did you last see lucile  an why are ye askin he demanded suspiciously  never mind why  the fact  well thin the fore part iv last night an much good may it do ye  and danced with her  a rollickin virginia reel an not sayin a word iv a quadrille or so  tis at square dances i excel meself  frona walked on in a simulated brown study no sound going up from the twain save the complaint of the snow from under their moccasins  well thin he questioned uneasily  an what iv it he insisted after another silence  oh nothing she answered  i was just wondering which was the muckiest mr st vincent or youor myself with whom you have both been cheek by jowl  now mccarthy was unversed in the virtues of social wisdom and though he felt somehow the error of her position he could not put it into definite thought so he steered wisely if weakly out of danger  its gettin mad ye are with yer old matt he insinuated who has yer own good at heart an because iv it makes a fool iv himself  no im not  but ye are  there leaning swiftly to him and kissing him  how could i remember the dyea days and be angry  ah frona darlin well may ye say it  im the dust iv the dirt under yer feet an ye may walk on meanything save get mad  i cud die for ye swing for ye to make ye happy  i cud kill the man that gave ye sorrow were it but a thimbleful an go plump into hell with a smile on me face an joy in me heart  they had halted before her door and she pressed his arm gratefully i am not angry matt  but with the exception of my father you are the only person i would have permitted to talk to me about thisthis affair in the way you have  and though i like you matt love you better than ever i shall nevertheless be very angry if you mention it again  you have no right  it is something that concerns me alone and it is wrong of you  to prevint ye walkin blind into danger  if you wish to put it that way yes  he growled deep down in his throat  what is it you are saying she asked  that ye may shut me mouth but that ye cant bind me arm  but you mustnt matt dear you mustnt  again he answered with a subterranean murmur  and i want you to promise me now that you will not interfere in my life that way by word or deed  ill not promise  but you must  ill not  further its gettin cold on the stoop an yell be frostin yer toes the pink little toes i fished splinters out iv at dyea  so its in with ye frona girl an goodnight  he thrust her inside and departed  when he reached the corner he stopped suddenly and regarded his shadow on the snow  matt mccarthy yer a damned fool  who iver heard iv a welse not knowin their own mind  as though yed niver had dalins with the stiffnecked breed ye calamitous son iv misfortune  then he went his way still growling deeply and at every growl the curious wolfdog at his heels bristled and bared its fangs     chapter xvii  tired  jacob welse put both hands on fronas shoulders and his eyes spoke the love his stiff tongue could not compass  the tree and the excitement and the pleasure were over with a score or so of children had gone home frostily happy across the snow the last guest had departed and christmas eve and christmas day were blending into one  she returned his fondness with gladeyed interest and they dropped into huge comfortable chairs on either side the fireplace in which the backlog was falling to ruddy ruin  and this time next year  he put the question seemingly to the glowing log and as if in ominous foreshadow it flared brightly and crumbled away in a burst of sparks  it is marvellous he went on dismissing the future in an effort to shake himself into a wholesomer frame of mind  it has been one long continuous miracle the last few months since you have been with me we have seen very little of each other you know since your childhood and when i think upon it soberly it is hard to realize that you are really mine sprung from me bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh  as the tanglehaired wild young creature of dyeaa healthy little natural animal and nothing moreit required no imagination to accept you as one of the breed of welse  but as frona the woman as you were tonight as you are now as i look at you as you have been since you came down the yukon it is hard     i cannot realize     i    he faltered and threw up his hands helplessly  i almost wish that i had given you no education that i had kept you with me faring with me adventuring with me achieving with me and failing with me  i would have known you now as we sit by the fire  as it is i do not to that which i did know there has been added somehow what shall i call it a subtlety complexityfavorite words of yourswhich is beyond me  no  he waved the speech abruptly from her lips  she came over and knelt at his feet resting her head on his knee and clasping his hand in firm sympathy  no that is not true  those are not the words  i cannot find them  i fail to say what i feel  let me try again underneath all you do carry the stamp of the breed  i knew i risked the loss of that when i sent you away but i had faith in the persistence of the blood and i took the chance doubted and feared when you were gone waited and prayed dumbly and hoped oftentimes hopelessly and then the day dawned the day of days  when they said your boat was coming death rose and walked on the one hand of me and on the other life everlasting  made or marred made or marredthe words rang through my brain till they maddened me  would the welse remain the welse  would the blood persist  would the young shoot rise straight and tall and strong green with sap and fresh and vigorous or would it droop limp and lifeless withered by the heats of the world other than the little simple natural dyea world  it was the day of days and yet it was a lingering watching waiting tragedy  you know i had lived the years lonely fought the lone fight and you away the only kin  if it had failed     but your boat shot from the bluffs into the open and i was halfafraid to look  men have never called me coward but i was nearer the coward then than ever and all before  ay that moment i had faced death easier  and it was foolish absurd  how could i know whether it was for good or ill when you drifted a distant speck on the river  still i looked and the miracle began for i did know  you stood at the steeringsweep  you were a welse  it seems so little in truth it meant so much  it was not to be expected of a mere woman but of a welse yes  and when bishop went over the side and you gripped the situation as imperatively as the sweep and your voice rang out and the siwashes bent their backs to your willthen was it the day of days  i tried always and remembered frona whispered  she crept up softly till her arm was about his neck and her head against his breast  he rested one arm lightly on her body and poured her bright hair again and again from his hand in glistening waves  as i said the stamp of the breed was unmarred but there was yet a difference  there is a difference  i have watched it studied it tried to make it out  i have sat at table proud by the side of you but dwarfed  when you talked of little things i was large enough to follow when of big things too small  i knew you had my hand on you when presto and you were away gonei was lost  he is a fool who knows not his own ignorance i was wise enough to know mine  art poetry musicwhat do i know of them  and they were the great things are the great things to you mean more to you than the little things i may comprehend  and i had hoped blindly foolishly that we might be one in the spirit as well as the one flesh  it has been bitter but i have faced it and understand  but to see my own red blood get away from me elude me rise above me  it stuns  god  i have heard you read from your browningno no do not speakand watched the play of your face the uplift and the passion of it and all the while the words droning in upon me meaningless musical maddening  and mrs schoville sitting there nursing an expression of idiotic ecstasy and understanding no more than i  i could have strangled her  why i have stolen away at night with your browning and locked myself in like a thief in fear  the text was senseless i have beaten my head with my fist like a wild man to try and knock some comprehension into it  for my life had worked itself out along one set groove deep and narrow  i was in the rut  i had done those things which came to my hand and done them well but the time was past i could not turn my hand anew  i who am strong and dominant who have played large with destiny who could buy body and soul a thousand painters and versifiers was baffled by a few paltry cents worth of printed paper  he spilled her hair for a moments silence  to come back  i had attempted the impossible gambled against the inevitable  i had sent you from me to get that which i had not dreaming that we would still be one  as though two could be added to two and still remain two  so to sum up the breed still holds but you have learned an alien tongue  when you speak it i am deaf  and bitterest of all i know that the new tongue is the greater  i do not know why i have said all this made my confession of weakness  oh father mine greatest of men she raised her head and laughed into his eyes the while brushing back the thick irongray hair which thatched the dome of his forehead  you who have wrestled more mightily done greater things than these painters and versifiers  you who know so well the law of change  might not the same plaint fall from your fathers lips were he to sit now beside you and look upon your work and you  yes yes  i have said that i understand  do not let us discuss it     a moments weakness  my father was a great man  and so mine  a struggler to the end of his days  he fought the great lone fight  and so mine  and died fighting  and so shall mine  so shall we all we welses  he shook her playfully in token of returning spirits  but i intend to sell outmines company everythingand study browning  still the fight  you cant discount the blood father  why were you not a boy he demanded abruptly  you would have been a splendid one  as it is a woman made to be the delight of some man you must pass from metomorrow next day this time next year who knows how soon  ah now i know the direction my thought has been trending  just as i know you do so do i recognize the inevitableness of it and the justness  but the man frona the man  dont she demurred  tell me of your fathers fight the last fight the great lone fight at treasure city  ten to one it was and well fought  tell me  no frona  do you realize that for the first time in our lives we talk together seriously as father and daughterfor the first time you have had no mother to advise no father for i trusted the blood and wisely and let you go  but there comes a time when the mothers counsel is needed and you you who never knew one  frona yielded in instant recognition and waiting snuggled more closely to him  this man st vincenthow is it between you  i     i do not know  how do you mean  remember always frona that you have free choice yours is the last word  still i would like to understand  i could     perhaps    i might be able to suggest  but nothing more  still a suggestion     there was something inexpressibly sacred about it yet she found herself tonguetied  instead of the one definite thing to say a muddle of ideas fluttered in her brain  after all could he understand  was there not a difference which prevented him from comprehending the motives which for her were impelling  for all her harking back to the primitive and stout defence of its sanity and truth did his native philosophy give him the same code which she drew from her acquired philosophy  then she stood aside and regarded herself and the queries she put and drew apart from them for they breathed of treason  there is nothing between us father she spoke up resolutely  mr st vincent has said nothing nothing  we are good friends we like each other we are very good friends  i think that is all  but you like each other you like him  is it in the way a woman must like a man before she can honestly share her life with him lose herself in him  do you feel with ruth so that when the time comes you can say thy people are my people and thy god my god  no  it may be but i cannot dare not face it say it or not say it think it or not think itnow  it is the great affirmation  when it comes it must come no one may know how or why in a great white flash like a revelation hiding nothing revealing everything in dazzling blinding truth  at least i so imagine  jacob welse nodded his head with the slow meditation of one who understands yet stops to ponder and weigh again  but why have you asked father  why has mr st vincent been raised i have been friends with other men  but i have not felt about other men as i do of st vincent  we may be truthful you and i and forgive the pain we give each other  my opinion counts for no more than anothers  fallibility is the commonest of curses  nor can i explain why i feel as i doi oppose much in the way you expect to when your great white flash sears your eyes  but in a word i do not like st vincent  a very common judgment of him among the men frona interposed driven irresistibly to the defensive  such consensus of opinion only makes my position stronger he returned but not disputatively  yet i must remember that i look upon him as men look  his popularity with women must proceed from the fact that women look differently than men just as women do differ physically and spiritually from men  it is deep too deep for me to explain  i but follow my nature and try to be just  but have you nothing more definite she asked groping for better comprehension of his attitude  can you not put into some sort of coherence some one certain thing of the things you feel  i hardly dare  intuitions can rarely be expressed in terms of thought  but let me try  we welses have never known a coward  and where cowardice is nothing can endure  it is like building on sand or like a vile disease which rots and rots and we know not when it may break forth  but it seems to me that mr st vincent is the last man in the world with whom cowardice may be associated  i cannot conceive of him in that light  the distress in her face hurt him  i know nothing against st vincent  there is no evidence to show that he is anything but what he appears  still i cannot help feeling it in my fallible human way yet there is one thing i have heard a sordid pothouse brawl in the opera house  mind you frona i say nothing against the brawl or the placemen are men but it is said that he did not act as a man ought that night  but as you say father men are men  we would like to have them other than they are for the world surely would be better but we must take them as they are  lucile  no no you misunderstand  i did not refer to her but to the fight he did not     he was cowardly  but as you say it is said  he told me about it not long afterwards and i do not think he would have dared had there been anything  but i do not make it as a charge jacob welse hastily broke in merely hearsay and the prejudice of the men would be sufficient to account for the tale  and it has no bearing anyway  i should not have brought it up for i have known good men funk in my timebuck fever as it were  and now let us dismiss it all from our minds  i merely wished to suggest and i suppose i have bungled  but understand this frona turning her face up to his understand above all things and in spite of them first last and always that you are my daughter and that i believe your life is sacredly yours not mine yours to deal with and to make or mar  your life is yours to live and in so far that i influence it you will not have lived your life nor would your life have been yours  nor would you have been a welse for there was never a welse yet who suffered dictation  they died first or went away to pioneer on the edge of things  why if you thought the dance house the proper or natural medium for selfexpression i might be sad but tomorrow i would sanction your going down to the opera house  it would be unwise to stop you and further it is not our way  the welses have ever stood by in many a lost cause and forlorn hope knee to knee and shoulder to shoulder conventions are worthless for such as we  they are for the swine who without them would wallow deeper  the weak must obey or be crushed not so with the strong  the mass is nothing the individual everything and it is the individual always that rules the mass and gives the law  a fig for what the world says  if the welse should procreate a bastard line this day it would be the way of the welse and you would be a daughter of the welse and in the face of hell and heaven of god himself we would stand together we of the one blood frona you and i  you are larger than i she whispered kissing his forehead and the caress of her lips seemed to him the soft impact of a leaf falling through the still autumn air  and as the heat of the room ebbed away he told of her foremother and of his and of the sturdy welse who fought the great lone fight and died fighting at treasure city     chapter xviii  the dolls house was a success  mrs schoville ecstasized over it in terms so immeasurable so unqualifiable that jacob welse standing near bent a glittering gaze upon her plump white throat and unconsciously clutched and closed his hand on an invisible windpipe dave harney proclaimed its excellence effusively though he questioned the soundness of noras philosophy and swore by his puritan gods that torvald was the longesteared jack in two hemispheres  even miss mortimer antagonistic as she was to the whole school conceded that the players had redeemed it while matt mccarthy announced that he didnt blame nora darlin the least bit though he told the gold commissioner privately that a song or so and a skirt dance wouldnt have hurt the performance  iv course the nora girl was right he insisted to harney both of whom were walking on the heels of frona and st vincent  id be seein  rubber  rubber yer granmother matt wrathfully exclaimed  ez i was sayin harney continued imperturbably rubber boots is goin to go skyhigh bout the time of washup  three ounces the pair an you kin put your chips on that for a high card  you kin gather em in now for an ounce a pair and clear two on the deal  a cinch matt a dead open an shut  the devil take you an yer cinches  its nora darlin i have in me mind the while  they bade goodby to frona and st vincent and went off disputing under the stars in the direction of the opera house  gregory st vincent heaved an audible sigh  at last  at last what frona asked incuriously  at last the first opportunity for me to tell you how well you did you carried off the final scene wonderfully so well that it seemed you were really passing out of my life forever  what a misfortune  it was terrible  no  but yes  i took the whole condition upon myself  you were not nora you were frona nor i torvald but gregory  when you made your exit capped and jacketed and travellingbag in hand it seemed i could not possibly stay and finish my lines  and when the door slammed and you were gone the only thing that saved me was the curtain  it brought me to myself or else i would have rushed after you in the face of the audience  it is strange how a simulated part may react upon one frona speculated  or rather  st vincent suggested  frona made no answer and they walked on without speech  she was still under the spell of the evening and the exaltation which had come to her as nora had not yet departed  besides she read between the lines of st vincents conversation and was oppressed by the timidity which comes over woman when she faces man on the verge of the greater intimacy  it was a clear cold night not overcoldnot more than forty belowand the land was bathed in a soft diffused flood of light which found its source not in the stars nor yet in the moon which was somewhere over on the other side of the world  from the southeast to the northwest a palegreenish glow fringed the rim of the heavens and it was from this the dim radiance was exhaled  suddenly like the ray of a searchlight a band of white light ploughed overhead  night turned to ghostly day on the instant then blacker night descended  but to the southeast a noiseless commotion was apparent  the glowing greenish gauze was in a ferment bubbling uprearing downfalling and tentatively thrusting huge bodiless hands into the upper ether  once more a cyclopean rocket twisted its fiery way across the sky from horizon to zenith and on and on in tremendous flight to horizon again  but the span could not hold and in its wake the black night brooded  and yet again broader stronger deeper lavishly spilling streamers to right and left it flaunted the midmost zenith with its gorgeous flare and passed on and down to the further edge of the world  heaven was bridged at last and the bridge endured  at this flaming triumph the silence of earth was broken and ten thousand wolfdogs in longdrawn unisoned howls sobbed their dismay and grief  frona shivered and st vincent passed his arm about her waist  the woman in her was aware of the touch of man and of a slight tingling thrill of vague delight but she made no resistance  and as the wolfdogs mourned at her feet and the aurora wantoned overhead she felt herself drawn against him closely  need i tell my story he whispered  she drooped her head in tired content on his shoulder and together they watched the burning vault wherein the stars dimmed and vanished ebbing flowing pulsing to some tremendous rhythm the prism colors hurled themselves in luminous deluge across the firmament  then the canopy of heaven became a mighty loom wherein imperial purple and deep seagreen blended wove and interwove with blazing woof and flashing warp till the most delicate of tulles fluorescent and bewildering was daintily and airily shaken in the face of the astonished night  without warning the span was sundered by an arrogant arm of black  the arch dissolved in blushing confusion  chasms of blackness yawned grew and rushed together  broken masses of strayed color and fading fire stole timidly towards the skyline  then the dome of night towered imponderable immense and the stars came back one by one and the wolfdogs mourned anew  i can offer you so little dear the man said with a slightly perceptible bitterness  the precarious fortunes of a gypsy wanderer  and the woman placing his hand and pressing it against her heart said as a great woman had said before her a tent and a crust of bread with you richard     chapter xix  howha was only an indian woman bred of a long line of fisheating meatrending carnivores and her ethics were as crude and simple as her blood  but long contact with the whites had given her an insight into their way of looking at things and though she grunted contemptuously in her secret soul she none the less understood their way perfectly  ten years previous she had cooked for jacob welse and served him in one fashion or another ever since and when on a dreary january morning she opened the front door in response to the deeptongued knocker even her stolid presence was shaken as she recognized the visitor  not that the average man or woman would have so recognized  but howhas faculties of observing and remembering details had been developed in a hard school where death dealt his blow to the lax and life saluted the vigilant  howha looked up and down the woman who stood before her  through the heavy veil she could barely distinguish the flash of the eyes while the hood of the parka effectually concealed the hair and the parka proper the particular outlines of the body  but howha paused and looked again  there was something familiar in the vague general outline  she quested back to the shrouded head again and knew the unmistakable poise  then howhas eyes went blear as she traversed the simple windings of her own brain inspecting the bare shelves taciturnly stored with the impressions of a meagre life  no disorder no confused mingling of records no devious and interminable impress of complex emotions tangled theories and bewildering abstractionsnothing but simple facts neatly classified and conveniently collated  unerringly from the stores of the past she picked and chose and put together in the instant present till obscurity dropped from the woman before her and she knew her word and deed and look and history  much better you go way quicketyquick howha informed her  miss welse  i wish to see her  the strange woman spoke in firm even tones which betokened the will behind but which failed to move howha  much better you go she repeated stolidly  here take this to frona welse andah would you thrusting her knee between the door and jamb and leave the door open  howha scowled but took the note for she could not shake off the grip of the ten years of servitude to the superior race     may i see you       lucile   so the note ran  frona glanced up expectantly at the indian woman  um kick toes outside howha explained  me tell um go way quicketyquick  eh  you tink yes  um no good  um  no  take herfrona was thinking quicklyno bring her up here  much better  go  howha grunted and yielded up the obedience she could not withhold though as she went down the stairs to the door in a tenebrous glimmering way she wondered that the accident of white skin or swart made master or servant as the case might be  in the one sweep of vision lucile took in frona smiling with extended hand in the foreground the dainty dressingtable the simple finery the thousand girlish evidences and with the sweet wholesomeness of it pervading her nostrils her own girlhood rose up and smote her  then she turned a bleak eye and cold ear on outward things  i am glad you came frona was saying  i have so wanted to see you again andbut do get that heavy parka off please  how thick it is and what splendid fur and workmanship  yes from siberia  a present from st vincent lucile felt like adding but said instead the siberians have not yet learned to scamp their work you know  she sank down into the lowseated rocker with a native grace which could not escape the beautyloving eye of the girl and with proudpoised head and silent tongue listened to frona as the minutes ticked away and observed with impersonal amusement fronas painful toil at making conversation  what has she come for frona asked herself as she talked on furs and weather and indifferent things  if you do not say something lucile i shall get nervous soon she ventured at last in desperation  has anything happened  lucile went over to the mirror and picked up from among the trinkets beneath a tiny openwork miniature of frona  this is you  how old were you  sixteen  a sylph but a cold northern one  the blood warms late with us frona reproved but is  none the less warm for that lucile laughed  and how old are you now  twenty  twenty lucile repeated slowly  twenty and resumed her seat you are twenty  and i am twentyfour  so little difference as that  but our blood warms early  lucile voiced her reproach across the unfathomable gulf which four years could not plumb  frona could hardly hide her vexation  lucile went over and looked at the miniature again and returned  what do you think of love she asked abruptly her face softening unheralded into a smile  love the girl quavered  yes love  what do you know about it  what do you think of it  a flood of definitions glowing and rosy sped to her tongue but frona swept them aside and answered love is immolation  very goodsacrifice  and now does it pay  yes it pays  of course it pays  who can doubt it  luciles eyes twinkled amusedly  why do you smile frona asked  look at me frona  lucile stood up and her face blazed  i am twentyfour  not altogether a fright not altogether a dunce  i have a heart  i have good red blood and warm  and i have loved  i do not remember the pay  i know only that i have paid  and in the paying were paid frona took up warmly  the price was the reward  if love be fallible yet you have loved you have done you have served  what more would you  the whelpage love lucile sneered  oh  you are unfair  i do you justice lucile insisted firmly  you would tell me that you know that you have gone unveiled and seen cleareyed that without placing more than lips to the brim you have divined the taste of the dregs and that the taste is good  bah  the whelpage love and oh frona i know you are full womanly and broad and lend no ear to little things butshe tapped a slender finger to foreheadit is all here  it is a heady brew and you have smelled the fumes overmuch  but drain the dregs turn down the glass and say that it is good  no god forbid she cried passionately there are good loves  you should find no masquerade but one fair and shining  frona was up to her old tricktheir common oneand her hand slid down luciles arm till hand clasped in hand  you say things which i feel are wrong yet may not answer  i can but how dare i  i dare not put mere thoughts against your facts  i who have lived so little cannot in theory give the lie to you who have lived so much  for he who lives more lives than one more lives than one must die  from out of her pain lucile spoke the words of her pain and frona throwing arms about her sobbed on her breast in understanding  as for lucile the slight nervous ingathering of the brows above her eyes smoothed out and she pressed the kiss of motherhood lightly and secretly on the others hair  for a spacethen the brows ingathered the lips drew firm and she put frona from her  you are going to marry gregory st vincent  frona was startled  it was only a fortnight old and not a word had been breathed  how do you know  you have answered  lucile watched fronas open face and the bold running advertisement and felt as the skilled fencer who fronts a tyro weak of wrist each opening naked to his hand  how do i know  she laughed harshly  when a man leaves ones arms suddenly lips wet with last kisses and mouth areek with last lies  and  forgets the way back to those arms  so  the blood of the welse pounded up and like a hot sun dried the mists from her eyes and left them flashing  then that is why you came  i could have guessed it had i given second thought to dawsons gossip  it is not too late luciles lip curled  and it is your way  and i am mindful  what is it  do you intend telling me what he has done what he has been to you  let me say that it is useless  he is a man as you and i are women  no lucile lied swallowing her astonishment  i had not thought that any action of his would affect you  i knew you were too great for that  buthave you considered me  frona caught her breath for a moment  then she straightened out her arms to hold the man in challenge to the arms of lucile  your father over again lucile exclaimed  oh you impossible welses  but he is not worthy of you frona welse she continued of me yes  he is not a nice man a great man nor a good  his love cannot match with yours  bah  he does not possess love passion of one sort and another is the best he may lay claim to  that you do not want  it is all at the best he can give you  and you pray what may you give him  yourself  a prodigious waste  but your fathers yellow  dont go on or i shall refuse to listen  it is wrong of you  so frona made her cease and then with bold inconsistency and what may the woman lucile give him  some few wild moments was the prompt response a burning burst of happiness and the regrets of hellwhich latter he deserves as do i  so the balance is maintained and all is well  butbut  for there is a devil in him she held on a most alluring devil which delights me on my soul it does and which pray god frona you may never know  for you have no devil mine matches his and mates  i am free to confess that the whole thing is only an attraction  there is nothing permanent about him nor about me  and theres the beauty the balance is preserved  frona lay back in her chair and lazily regarded her visitor lucile waited for her to speak  it was very quiet  well lucile at last demanded in a low curious tone at the same time rising to slip into her parka  nothing  i was only waiting  i am done  then let me say that i do not understand you frona summed up coldly  i cannot somehow just catch your motive  there is a flat ring to what you have said  however of this i am sure for some unaccountable reason you have been untrue to yourself today  do not ask me for as i said before i do not know where or how yet i am none the less convinced  this i do know you are not the lucile i met by the wood trail across the river  that was the true lucile little though i saw of her  the woman who is here today is a strange woman  i do not know her  sometimes it has seemed she was lucile but rarely  this woman has lied lied to me and lied to me about herself  as to what she said of the man at the worst that is merely an opinion  it may be she has lied about him likewise  the chance is large that she has  what do you think about it  that you are a very clever girl frona  that you speak sometimes more truly than you know and that at others you are blinder than you dream  there is something i could love in you but you have hidden it away so that i cannot find it  luciles lips trembled on the verge of speech  but she settled her parka about her and turned to go  frona saw her to the door herself and howha pondered over the white who made the law and was greater than the law  when the door had closed lucile spat into the street  faugh  st vincent  i have defiled my mouth with your name  and she spat again   come in  at the summons matt mccarthy pulled the latchstring pushed the door open and closed it carefully behind him  oh it is you  st vincent regarded his visitor with dark abstraction then recollecting himself held out his hand  why hello matt old man  my mind was a thousand miles away when you entered  take a stool and make yourself comfortable  theres the tobacco by your hand  take a try at it and give us your verdict  an well may his mind be a thousand miles away matt assured himself for in the dark he had passed a woman on the trail who looked suspiciously like lucile  but aloud sure an its daydramin ye mane  an small wondher  hows that the correspondent asked cheerily  by the same token that i met lucile down the trail a piece an the heels iv her moccasins pointing to yer shack  its a bitter tongue the jade slings on occasion matt chuckled  thats the worst of it  st vincent met him frankly  a man looks sidewise at them for a passing moment and they demand that the moment be eternal  off with the old loves a stiff proposition eh  i should say so  and you understand  its easy to see matt youve had some experience in your time  in me time  ill have ye know im not too old to still enjoy a bit iv a fling  certainly certainly  one can read it in your eyes  the warm heart and the roving eye matt  he slapped his visitor on the shoulder with a hearty laugh  an ive none the best iv ye vincent  tis a wicked lad ye are with a takin way with the ladiesas plain as the nose on yer face mannys the idle kiss yeve given an mannys the heart yeve broke but vincent bye did ye iver know the rale thing  how do you mean  the rale thing the rale thingthat iswell have ye been iver a father  st vincent shook his head  and niver have i  but have ye felt the love iv a father thin  i hardly know  i dont think so  well i have  an its the rale thing ill tell ye  if iver a man suckled a child i did or the next door to it  a girl child at that an shes woman grown now an if the thing is possible i love her more than her own bloodfather  bad luck exciptin her there was niver but one woman i loved an that woman had mated beforetime  not a soul did i brathe a word to trust me nor even herself  but she died  gods love be with her  his chin went down upon his chest and he quested back to a flaxenhaired saxon woman strayed like a bit of sunshine into the log store by the dyea river  he looked up suddenly and caught st vincents stare bent blankly to the floor as he mused on other things  a truce to foolishness vincent  the correspondent returned to himself with an effort and found the irishmans small blue eyes boring into him  are ye a brave man vincent  for a seconds space they searched each others souls  and in that space matt could have sworn he saw the faintest possible flicker or flutter in the mans eyes  he brought his fist down on the table with a triumphant crash  by god yer not  the correspondent pulled the tobacco jug over to him and rolled a cigarette  he rolled it carefully the delicate rice paper crisping in his hand without a tremor but all the while a red tide mounting up from beneath the collar of his shirt deepening in the hollows of the cheeks and thinning against the cheekbones above creeping spreading till all his face was aflame  tis good  an likely it saves me fingers a dirty job  vincent man the girl child which is woman grown slapes in dawson this night god help us you an me but well niver hit again the pillow as clane an pure as she  vincent a word to the wise yell niver lay holy hand or otherwise upon her  the devil which lucile had proclaimed began to quickena fuming fretting irrational devil  i do not like ye  i kape me raysons to meself  it is sufficient but take this to heart an take it well should ye be mad enough to make her yer wife iv that damned day yell niver see the inding nor lay eye upon the bridal bed  why man i cud bate ye to death with me two fists if need be  but its to be hoped ill do a nater job rest aisy  i promise ye  you irish pig  so the devil burst forth and all unaware for mccarthy found himself eyehigh with the muzzle of a colts revolver  is it loaded he asked  i belave ye  but why are ye lingerin lift the hammer will ye  the correspondents triggerfinger moved and there was a warning click  now pull it  pull it i say  as though ye cud with that flutter to yer eye  st vincent attempted to turn his head aside  look at me man mccarthy commanded  kape yer eyes on me when ye do it  unwillingly the sideward movement was arrested and his eyes returned and met the irishmans  now  st vincent ground his teeth and pulled the triggerat least he thought he did as men think they do things in dreams  he willed the deed flashed the order forth but the flutter of his soul stopped it  tis paralyzed is it that shaky little finger  matt grinned into the face of the tortured man  now turn it aside so an drop it gently    gently    gently  his voice crooned away in soothing diminuendo  when the trigger was safely down st vincent let the revolver fall from his hand and with a slight audible sigh sank nervelessly upon a stool  he tried to straighten himself but instead dropped down upon the table and buried his face in his palsied hands  matt drew on his mittens looking down upon him pityingly the while and went out closing the door softly behind him     chapter xx  where nature shows the rough hand the sons of men are apt to respond with kindred roughness  the amenities of life spring up only in mellow lands where the sun is warm and the earth fat  the damp and soggy climate of britain drives men to strong drink the rosy orient lures to the dream splendors of the lotus  the bigbodied whiteskinned northern dweller rude and ferocious bellows his anger uncouthly and drives a gross fist into the face of his foe  the supple southsojourner silken of smile and lazy of gesture waits and does his work from behind when no man looketh gracefully and without offence  their ends are one the difference lies in their ways and therein the climate and the cumulative effect thereof is the determining factor  both are sinners as men born of women have ever been but the one does his sin openly in the clear sight of god the otheras though god could not seeveils his iniquity with shimmering fancies hiding it like it were some splendid mystery  these be the ways of men each as the sun shines upon him and the wind blows against him according to his kind and the seed of his father and the milk of his mother  each is the resultant of many forces which go to make a pressure mightier than he and which moulds him in the predestined shape  but with sound legs under him he may run away and meet with a new pressure  he may continue running each new pressure prodding him as he goes until he dies and his final form will be that predestined of the many pressures  an exchange of cradlebabes and the baseborn slave may wear the purple imperially and the royal infant begs an alms as wheedlingly or cringe to the lash as abjectly as his meanest subject  a chesterfield with an empty belly chancing upon good fare will gorge as faithfully as the swine in the next sty  and an epicurus in the dirtigloo of the eskimos will wax eloquent over the whale oil and walrus blubber or die  thus in the young northland frosty and grim and menacing men stripped off the sloth of the south and gave battle greatly  and they stripped likewise much of the veneer of civilizationall of its follies most of its foibles and perhaps a few of its virtues  maybe so but they reserved the great traditions and at least lived frankly laughed honestly and looked one another in the eyes  and so it is not well for women born south of fiftythree and reared gently to knock loosely about the northland unless they be great of heart  they may be soft and tender and sensitive possessed of eyes which have not lost the lustre and the wonder and of ears used only to sweet sounds but if their philosophy is sane and stable large enough to understand and to forgive they will come to no harm and attain comprehension  if not they will see things and hear things which hurt and they will suffer greatly and lose faith in manwhich is the greatest evil that may happen them  such should be sedulously cherished and it were well to depute this to their menfolk the nearer of kin the better  in line it were good policy to seek out a cabin on the hill overlooking dawson orbest of allacross the yukon on the western bank  let them not move abroad unheralded and unaccompanied and the hillside back of the cabin may be recommended as a fit field for stretching muscles and breathing deeply a place where their ears may remain undefiled by the harsh words of men who strive to the utmost   vance corliss wiped the last tin dish and filed it away on the shelf lighted his pipe and rolled over on his back on the bunk to contemplate the mosschinked roof of his french hill cabin  this french hill cabin stood on the last dip of the hill into eldorado creek close to the maintravelled trail and its one window blinked cheerily of nights at those who journeyed late  the door was kicked open and del bishop staggered in with a load of firewood  his breath had so settled on his face in a white rime that he could not speak  such a condition was ever a hardship with the man so he thrust his face forthwith into the quivering heat above the stove  in a trice the frost was started and the thawed streamlets dancing madly on the whitehot surface beneath  then the ice began to fall from is beard in chunks rattling on the lidtops and simmering spitefully till spurted upward in clouds of steam  and so you witness an actual phenomenon illustrative of the three forms of matter vance laughed mimicking the monotonous tones of the demonstrator solid liquid and vapor  in another moment you will have the gas  thththats all very well bishop spluttered wrestling with an obstructing piece of ice until it was wrenched from his upper lip and slammed stoveward with a bang  how cold do you make it del  fifty  fifty the pocketminer demanded with unutterable scorn wiping his face  quicksilvers been solid for hours and its been gittin colder an colder ever since  fifty  ill bet my new mittens against your old moccasins that it aint a notch below seventy  think so  dye want to bet  vance nodded laughingly  centigrade or fahrenheit bishop asked suddenly suspicious  oh well if you want my old moccasins so badly vance rejoined feigning to be hurt by the others lack of faith why you can have them without betting  del snorted and flung himself down on the opposite bunk  think yer funny dont you  no answer forthcoming he deemed the retort conclusive rolled over and fell to studying the moss chinks  fifteen minutes of this diversion sufficed  play you a rubber of crib before bed he challenged across to the other bunk  ill go you corliss got up stretched and moved the kerosene lamp from the shelf to the table think it will hold out he asked surveying the oillevel through the cheap glass  bishop threw down the cribboard and cards and measured the contents of the lamp with his eye  forgot to fill it didnt i  too late now do it tomorrow  itll last the rubber out sure  corliss took up the cards but paused in the shuffling  weve a big trip before us del about a month from now the middle of march as near as i can plan itup the stuart river to mcquestion up mcquestion and back again down the mayo then across country to mazy may winding up at henderson creek  on the indian river  no corliss replied as he dealt the hands just below where the stuart taps the yukon  and then back to dawson before the ice breaks  the pocketminers eyes sparkled  keep us hustlin but say its a trip isnt it  hunch  ive received word from the parker outfit on the mayo and mcpherson isnt asleep on hendersonyou dont know him  theyre keeping quiet and of course one cant tell but     bishop nodded his head sagely while corliss turned the trump he had cut  a sure vision of a twentyfour hand was dazzling him when there was a sound of voices without and the door shook to a heavy knock  come in he bawled  an dont make such a row about it  look at thatto corliss at the same time facing his handfifteeneight fifteensixteen and eight are twentyfour  just my luck  corliss started swiftly to his feet  bishop jerked his head about two women and a man had staggered clumsily in through the door and were standing just inside momentarily blinded by the light  by all the prophets  cornell  the pocketminer wrung the mans hand and led him forward  you recollect cornell corliss  jake cornell thirtyseven and a half eldorado  how could i forget the engineer acknowledged warmly shaking his hand  that was a miserable night you put us up last fall about as miserable as the moosesteak was good that you gave us for breakfast  jake cornell hirsute and cadaverous of aspect nodded his head with emphasis and deposited a corpulent demijohn on the table  again he nodded his head and glared wildly about him  the stove caught his eye and he strode over to it lifted a lid and spat out a mouthful of ambercolored juice  another stride and he was back  course i recollect the night he rumbled the ice clattering from his hairy jaws  and im danged glad to see you thats a fact  he seemed suddenly to remember himself and added a little sheepishly the fact is were all danged glad to see you aint we girls  he twisted his head about and nodded his companions up  blanche my dear mr corlisshemit gives me    hem    it gives me pleasure to make you acquainted  cariboo blanche sir  cariboo blanche  pleased to meet you  cariboo blanche put out a frank hand and looked him over keenly  she was a fairfeatured blondish woman originally not unpleasing of appearance but now with lines all deepened and hardened as on the faces of men who have endured much weatherbeat  congratulating himself upon his social proficiency jake cornell cleared his throat and marshalled the second woman to the front  mr corliss the virgin i make you both acquainted  hem in response to the query in vances eyesyes the virgin  thats all just the virgin  she smiled and bowed but did not shake hands  a toff was her secret comment upon the engineer and from her limited experience she had been led to understand that it was not good form among toffs to shake hands  corliss fumbled his hand then bowed and looked at her curiously  she was a pretty lowbrowed creature darkly pretty with a wellfavored body and for all that the type was mean he could not escape the charm of her overbrimming vitality  she seemed bursting with it and every quick spontaneous movement appeared to spring from very excess of red blood and superabundant energy  pretty healthy proposition aint she jake cornell demanded following his hosts gaze with approval  none o your gammon jake the virgin snapped back with lip curled contemptuously for vances especial benefit  i fancy itd be more in keeping if youd look to pore blanche there  fact is were plum ding dong played out jake said  an blanche went through the ice just down the trail and her feets like to freezin  blanche smiled as corliss piloted her to a stool by the fire and her stern mouth gave no indication of the pain she was suffering  he turned away when the virgin addressed herself to removing the wet footgear while bishop went rummaging for socks and moccasins  didnt go in moren to the ankles cornell explained confidentially but thats plenty a night like this  corliss agreed with a nod of the head  spotted your light andhemand so we come  dont mind do you  why certainly not  no intrudin  corliss reassured him by laying hand on his shoulder and cordially pressing him to a seat  blanche sighed luxuriously  her wet stockings were stretched up and already steaming and her feet basking in the capacious warmth of bishops siwash socks  vance shoved the tobacco canister across but cornell pulled out a handful of cigars and passed them around  uncommon bad piece of trail just this side of the turn he remarked stentoriously at the same time flinging an eloquent glance at the demijohn  ice rotten from the springs and no sign till youre into it  turning to the woman by the stove howre you feeling blanche  tony she responded stretching her body lazily and redisposing her feet though my legs aint as limber as when we pulled out  looking to his host for consent cornell tilted the demijohn over his arm and partly filled the four tin mugs and an empty jelly glass  wots the matter with a toddy the virgin broke in or a punch  got any lime juice she demanded of corliss  you ave  jolly  she directed her dark eyes towards del  ere you cookie  trot out your mixingpan and sling the kettle for ot water  come on  all hands  jakes treat and ill show you ow  any sugar mr corliss  and nutmeg  cinnamon then  ok  itll do lively now cookie  aint she a peach cornell confided to vance watching her with mellow eyes as she stirred the steaming brew  but the virgin directed her attentions to the engineer  dont mind im sir she advised  es moren arfgorn aready aitting the jug every blessed stop  now my dear jake protested  dont you mydear me she sniffed  i dont like you  why  cos     she ladled the punch carefully into the mugs and meditated  cos you chew tobacco  cos youre whiskery  wot i take to is smoothfaced young chaps  dont take any stock in her nonsense the fraction king warned she just does it apurpose to get me mad  now then she commanded sharply  step up to your licker  eres ow  whatll it be cried blanche from the stove  the elevated mugs wavered and halted  the queen gawd bless er the virgin toasted promptly  and bill del bishop interrupted  again the mugs wavered  bill oo the virgin asked suspiciously  mckinley  she favored him with a smile  thank you cookie youre a trump now  eres a go gents  take it standing  the queen gawd bless er and bill mckinley  bottoms up thundered jake cornell and the mugs smote the table with clanging rims  vance corliss discovered himself amused and interested  according to frona he mused ironicallythis was learning life was adding to his sum of human generalizations  the phrase was hers and he rolled it over a couple of times  then again her engagement with st vincent crept into his thought and he charmed the virgin by asking her to sing  but she was coy and only after bishop had rendered the several score stanzas of flying cloud did she comply  her voice in a weakly way probably registered an octave and a half below that point it underwent strange metamorphoses while on the upper levels it was devious and rickety  nevertheless she sang take back your gold with touching effect which brought a fiery moisture into the eyes of the fraction king who listened greedily for the time being experiencing unwonted ethical yearnings  the applause was generous followed immediately by bishop who toasted the singer as the enchantress of bow bells to the reverberating bottoms up of jake cornell   two hours later frona welse rapped  it was a sharp insistent rap penetrating the din within and bringing corliss to the door  she gave a glad little cry when she saw who it was  oh it is you vance  i didnt know you lived here  he shook hands and blocked the doorway with his body  behind him the virgin was laughing and jake cornell  roaring    oh cable this message along the track   the prods out west but hes coming back   put plenty of veal for one on the rack     trolla lala la la la la la   what is it vance questioned  anything up  i think you might ask me in  there was a hint of reproach in fronas voice and of haste  i blundered through the ice and my feet are freezing  o gawd in the exuberant tones of the virgin came whirling over vances shoulder and the voices of blanche and bishop joining in a laugh against cornell and that worthys vociferous protestations  it seemed to him that all the blood of his body had rushed into his face but you cant come in frona  dont you hear them  but i must she insisted  my feet are freezing  with a gesture of resignation he stepped aside and closed the door after her  coming suddenly in from the darkness she hesitated a moment but in that moment recovered her sight and took in the scene the air was thick with tobacco smoke and the odor of it in the close room was sickening to one fresh from the pure outside  on the table a column of steam was ascending from the big mixingpan  the virgin fleeing before cornell was defending herself with a long mustard spoon  evading him and watching her chance she continually daubed his nose and cheeks with the yellow smear  blanche had twisted about from the stove to see the fun and del bishop with a mug at rest halfway to his lips was applauding the successive strokes  the faces of all were flushed  vance leaned nervelessly against the door  the whole situation seemed so unthinkably impossible  an insane desire to laugh came over him which resolved itself into a coughing fit  but frona realizing her own pressing need by the growing absence of sensation in her feet stepped forward  hello del she called  the mirth froze on his face at the familiar sound and he slowly and unwilling turned his head to meet her  she had slipped the hood of her parka back and her face outlined against the dark fur rosy with the cold and bright was like a shaft of the sun shot into the murk of a boozingken  they all knew her for who did not know jacob welses daughter  the virgin dropped the mustardspoon with a startled shriek while cornell passing a dazed hand across his yellow markings and consummating the general smear collapsed on the nearest stool cariboo blanche alone retained her selfpossession and laughed softly  bishop managed to articulate hello but was unable to stave off the silence which settled down  frona waited a second and then said goodevening all  this way  vance had recovered himself and seated her by the stove opposite blanche  better get your things off quickly and be careful of the heat  ill see what i can find for you  some cold water please she asked  it will take the frost out del will get it  i hope it is not serious  no  she shook her head and smiled up to him at the same time working away at her icecoated moccasins  there hasnt been time for more than surfacefreezing  at the worst the skin will peel off  an unearthly silence brooded in the cabin broken only by bishop filling a basin from the waterbucket and by corliss seeking out his smallest and daintiest housemoccasins and his warmest socks  frona rubbing her feet vigorously paused and looked up  dont let me chill the festivities just because im cold she laughed  please go on  jake cornell straightened up and cleared his throat inanely and the virgin looked overdignified but blanche came over and took the towel out of fronas hands  i wet my feet in the same place she said kneeling down and bringing a glow to the frosted feet  i suppose you can manage some sort of a fit with them  here  vance tossed over the housemoccasins and woollen wrappings which the two women with low laughs and confidential undertones proceeded to utilize  but what in the world were you doing on trail alone at this time of night vance asked  in his heart he was marvelling at the coolness and pluck with which she was carrying off the situation  i know beforehand that you will censure me she replied helping blanche arrange the wet gear over the fire  i was at mrs stantons but first you must know miss mortimer and i are staying at the pentlys for a week  now to start fresh again  i intended to leave mrs stantons before dark but her baby got into the kerosene her husband had gone down to dawson andwell we werent sure of the baby up to half an hour ago  she wouldnt hear of me returning alone but there was nothing to fear only i had not expected soft ice in such a snap  howd you fix the kid del asked intent on keeping the talk going now that it had started  chewing tobacco  and when the laughter had subsided she went on there wasnt any mustard and it was the best i could think of besides matt mccarthy saved my life with it once down at dyea when i had the croup  but you were singing when i came in she suggested do go on  jake cornell hawed prodigiously   and i got done  then you del  sing flying cloud as you used to coming down the river  oh e as said the virgin  then you sing  i am sure you do  she smiled into the virgins eyes and that lady delivered herself of a coster ballad with more art than she was aware  the chill of fronas advent was quickly dissipated and song and toast and merriment went round again  nor was frona above touching lips to the jelly glass in fellowship and she contributed her quota by singing annie laurie and ben bolt  also but privily she watched the drink saturating the besotted souls of cornell and the virgin  it was an experience and she was glad of it though sorry in a way for corliss who played the host lamely  but he had little need of pity  any other woman he said to himself a score of times looking at frona and trying to picture numerous women he had known by his mothers teapot knocking at the door and coming in as frona had done  then again it was only yesterday that it would have hurt him blanches rubbing her feet but now he gloried in fronas permitting it and his heart went out in a more kindly way to blanche  perhaps it was the elevation of the liquor but he seemed to discover new virtues in her rugged face  frona had put on her dried moccasins and risen to her feet and was listening patiently to jake cornell who hiccoughed a last incoherent toast  to thehicman he rumbled cavernously the manhicthat madethat made  the blessed country volunteered the virgin  true my dearhic  to the man that made the blessed country tohicto jacob welse  and a rider blanche cried  to jacob welses daughter  ay  standing  and bottoms up  oh shes a jolly good fellow del led off the drink ruddying his cheek  id like to shake hands with you just once blanche said in a low voice while the rest were chorusing  frona slipped her mitten which she had already put on and the pressure was firm between them  no she said to corliss who had put on his cap and was tying the earflaps blanche tells me the pentlys are only half a mile from here  the trail is straight  ill not hear of any one accompanying me  no  this time she spoke so authoritatively that he tossed his cap into the bunk  goodnight all she called sweeping the roisterers with a smile  but corliss saw her to the door and stepped outside  she glanced up to him  her hood was pulled only partly up and her face shone alluringly under the starlight  ifrona     i wish  dont be alarmed she whispered  ill not tell on you vance  he saw the mocking glint in her eyes but tried to go on  i wish to explain just how  no need  i understand  but at the same time i must confess i do not particularly admire your taste  frona the evident pain in his voice reached her  oh you big foolish she laughed  dont i know  didnt blanche tell me she wet her feet  corliss bowed his head  truly frona you are the most consistent woman i ever met  furthermore with a straightening of his form and a dominant assertion in his voice this is not the last  she tried to stop him but he continued  i feel i know that things will turn out differently  to fling your own words back at you all the factors have not been taken into consideration  as for st vincent    ill have you yet  for that matter now could not be too soon  he flashed out hungry arms to her but she read quicker than he moved and laughing eluded him and ran lightly down the trail  come back frona  come back he called i am sorry  no youre not came the answer  and id be sorry if you were goodnight  he watched her merge into the shadows then entered the cabin  he had utterly forgotten the scene within and at the first glance it startled him  cariboo blanche was crying softly to herself  her eyes were luminous and moist and as he looked a lone tear stole down her cheek  bishops face had gone serious  the virgin had sprawled head and shoulders on the table amid overturned mugs and dripping lees and cornell was tittubating over her hiccoughing and repeating vacuously youre all right my dear  youre all right  but the virgin was inconsolable  o gawd  wen i think on wot is an was     an no fault of mine  no fault of mine i tell you she shrieked with quick fierceness  ow was i born i ask  wot was my old man  a drunk a chronic  an my old woman  talk of whitechapel oo guv a cent for me or ow i was dragged up  oo cared a rap i say  oo cared a rap  a sudden revulsion came over corliss  hold your tongue he ordered  the virgin raised her head her loosened hair streaming about her like a furys  wot is she she sneered  sweeteart  corliss whirled upon her savagely face white and voice shaking with passion  the virgin cowered down and instinctively threw up her hands to protect her face  dont it me sir she whined  dont it me  he was frightened at himself and waited till he could gather control now he said calmly get into your things and go  all of you clear out  vamose  youre no man you aint the virgin snarled discovering that physical assault was not imminent  but corliss herded her particularly to the door and gave no heed  aturning ladies out she sniffed with a stumble over the threshold  no offence jake cornell muttered pacifically no offence  goodnight  sorry corliss said to blanche with the shadow of a forgiving smile as she passed out   youre a toff  thats wot you are a bloomin toff the virgin howled back as he shut the door  he looked blankly at del bishop and surveyed the sodden confusion on the table  then he walked over and threw himself down on his bunk bishop leaned an elbow on the table and pulled at his wheezy pipe  the lamp smoked flickered and went out but still he remained filling his pipe again and again and striking endless matches  del  are you awake corliss called at last  del grunted  i was a cur to turn them out into the snow  i am ashamed  sure was the affirmation  a long silence followed  del knocked the ashes out and raised up  sleep he called  there was no reply and he walked to the bunk softly and pulled the blankets over the engineer     chapter xxi  yes what does it all mean  corliss stretched lazily and cocked up his feet on the table  he was not especially interested but colonel trethaway persisted in talking seriously  thats it  the very thingthe old and ever young demand which man slaps into the face of the universe  the colonel searched among the scraps in his notebook  see holding up a soiled slip of typed paper i copied this out years ago  listen  what a monstrous spectre is this man this disease of the agglutinated dust lifting alternate feet or lying drugged with slumber killing feeding growing bringing forth small copies of himself grown up with hair like grass fitted with eyes that glitter in his face a thing to set children screaming  poor soul here for so little cast among so many hardships filled with desires so incommensurate and so inconsistent savagely surrounded savagely descended irremediably condemned to prey upon his fellowlives  infinitely childish often admirably valiant often touchingly kind sitting down to debate of right or wrong and the attributes of the deity rising up to battle for an egg or die for an idea  and all to what end he demanded hotly throwing down the paper this disease of the agglutinated dust  corliss yawned in reply  he had been on trail all day and was yearning for betweenblankets  here am i colonel trethaway modestly along in years fairly well preserved a place in the community a comfortable bank account no need to ever exert myself again yet enduring life bleakly and working ridiculously with a zest worthy of a man half my years  and to what end  i can only eat so much smoke so much sleep so much and this taildump of earth men call alaska is the worst of all possible places in the matter of grub tobacco and blankets  but it is the living strenuously which holds you corliss interjected  fronas philosophy the colonel sneered  and my philosophy and yours  and of the agglutinated dust  which is quickened with a passion you do not take into accountthe passion of duty of race of god  and the compensation trethaway demanded  each breath you draw  the mayfly lives an hour  i dont see it  blood and sweat  blood and sweat  you cried that after the rough and tumble in the opera house and every word of it was receipt in full  fronas philosophy  and yours and mine  the colonel threw up his shoulders and after a pause confessed  you see try as i will i cant make a pessimist out of myself  we are all compensated and i more fully than most men  what end i asked and the answer forthcame since the ultimate end is beyond us then the immediate  more compensation here and now  quite hedonistic  and rational  i shall look to it at once  i can buy grub and blankets for a score i can eat and sleep for only one ergo why not for two  corliss took his feet down and sat up  in other words  i shall get married andgive the community a shock  communities like shocks  thats one of their compensations for being agglutinative  i cant think of but one woman corliss essayed tentatively putting out his hand  trethaway shook it slowly  it is she  corliss let go and misgiving shot into his face  but st vincent  is your problem not mine  then lucile  certainly not  she played a quixotic little game of her own and botched it beautifully  ii do not understand  corliss brushed his brows in a dazed sort of way  trethaway parted his lips in a superior smile  it is not necessary that you should  the question is will you stand up with me  surely  but what a confoundedly long way around you took  it is not your usual method  nor was it with her the colonel declared twisting his moustache proudly   a captain of the northwest mounted police by virtue of his magisterial office may perform marriages in time of stress as well as execute exemplary justice  so captain alexander received a call from colonel trethaway and after he left jotted down an engagement for the next morning  then the impending groom went to see frona  lucile did not make the request he hastened to explain butwell the fact was she did not know any women and furthermore he the colonel knew whom lucile would like to ask did she dare  so he did it upon his own responsibility  and coming as a surprise he knew it would be a great joy to her  frona was taken aback by the suddenness of it  only the other day it was that lucile had made a plea to her for st vincent and now it was colonel trethaway  true there had been a false quantity somewhere but now it seemed doubly false  could it be after all that lucile was mercenary  these thoughts crowded upon her swiftly with the colonel anxiously watching her face the while  she knew she must answer quickly yet was distracted by an involuntary admiration for his bravery  so she followed perforce the lead of her heart and consented  yet the whole thing was rather strained when the four of them came together next day in captain alexanders private office  there was a gloomy chill about it  lucile seemed ready to cry and showed a repressed perturbation quite unexpected of her while try as she would frona could not call upon her usual sympathy to drive away the coldness which obtruded intangibly between them  this in turn had a consequent effect on vance and gave a certain distance to his manner which forced him out of touch even with the colonel  colonel trethaway seemed to have thrown twenty years off his erect shoulders and the discrepancy in the match which frona had felt vanished as she looked at him  he has lived the years well she thought and prompted mysteriously almost with vague apprehension she turned her eyes to corliss  but if the groom had thrown off twenty years vance was not a whit behind  since their last meeting he had sacrificed his brown moustache to the frost and his smooth face smitten with health and vigor looked uncommonly boyish and yet withal the naked upper lip advertised a stiffness and resolution hitherto concealed  furthermore his features portrayed a growth and his eyes which had been softly firm were now firm with the added harshness or hardness which is bred of coping with things and coping quicklythe stamp of executiveness which is pressed upon men who do and upon all men who do whether they drive dogs buck the sea or dictate the policies of empires  when the simple ceremony was over frona kissed lucile but lucile felt that there was a subtle something wanting and her eyes filled with unshed tears  trethaway who had felt the aloofness from the start caught an opportunity with frona while captain alexander and corliss were being pleasant to mrs trethaway  whats the matter frona the colonel demanded bluntly  i hope you did not come under protest  i am sorry not for you because lack of frankness deserves nothing but for lucile  it is not fair to her  there has been a lack of frankness throughout  her voice trembled i tried my besti thought i could do betterbut i cannot feign what i do not feel  i am sorry but i    i am disappointed  no i cannot explain and to you least of all  lets be aboveboard frona  st vincents concerned  she nodded  and i can put my hand right on the spot  first place he looked to the side and saw lucile stealing an anxious glance to himfirst place only the other day she gave you a song about st vincent second place and therefore you think her hearts not in this present proposition that she doesnt care a rap for me in short that shes marrying me for reinstatement and spoils  isnt that it  and isnt it enough  oh i am disappointed colonel trethaway grievously in her in you in myself  dont be a fool  i like you too well to see you make yourself one the plays been too quick that is all  your eye lost it  listen weve kept it quiet but shes in with the elect on french hill  her claims prospected the richest of the outfit  present indication half a million at least  in her own name no strings attached  couldnt she take that and go anywhere in the world and reinstate herself  and for that matter you might presume that i am marrying her for spoils frona she cares for me and in your ear shes too good for me  my hope is that the future will make up  but never mind thathavent got the time now  you consider her affection sudden eh  let me tell you weve been growing into each other from the time i came into the country and with our eyes open  st vincent  pshaw  i knew it all the time  she got it into her head that the whole of him wasnt worth a little finger of you and she tried to break things up  youll never know how she worked with him  i told her she didnt know the welse and she said so too after  so there it is take it or leave it  but what do you think about st vincent  what i think is neither here nor there but ill tell you honestly that i back her judgment  but thats not the point  what are you going to do about it about her now  she did not answer but went back to the waiting group  lucile saw her coming and watched her face  hes been telling you  that i am a fool frona answered  and i think i am  and with a smile i take it on faith that i am anyway  ii cant reason it out just now but    captain alexander discovered a prenuptial joke just about then and led the way over to the stove to crack it upon the colonel and vance went along to see fair play  its the first time lucile was saying and it means more to me so much more than to    most women  i am afraid  it is a terrible thing for me to do  but i do love him i do  and when the joke had been duly digested and they came back she was sobbing dear dear frona  it was just the moment better than he could have chosen and capped and mittened without knocking jacob welse came in  the uninvited guest was his greeting  is it all over  so  and he swallowed lucile up in his huge bearskin  colonel your hand and your pardon for my intruding and your regrets for not giving me the word  come out with them  hello corliss  captain alexander a good day  what have i done frona wailed received the bearhug and managed to press his hand till it almost hurt  had to back the game he whispered and this time his hand did hurt  now colonel i dont know what your plans are and i dont care call them off  ive got a little spread down to the house and the only honest case of champagne this side of circle  of course youre coming corliss and  his eye roved past captain alexander with hardly a pause  of course came the answer like a flash though the chief magistrate of the northwest had had time to canvass the possible results of such unofficial action  got a hack  jacob welse laughed and held up a moccasined foot  walking bechucked  the captain started impulsively towards the door  ill have the sleds up before youre ready  three of them and bells galore  so trethaways forecast was correct and dawson vindicated its agglutinativeness by rubbing its eyes when three sleds with three scarlettuniced policemen swinging the whips tore down its main street and it rubbed its eyes again when it saw the occupants thereof   we shall live quietly lucile told frona  the klondike is not all the world and the best is yet to come  but jacob welse said otherwise  weve got to make this thing go he said to captain alexander and captain alexander said that he was unaccustomed to backing out  mrs schoville emitted preliminary thunders marshalled the other women and became chronically seismic and unsafe  lucile went nowhere save to fronas  but jacob welse who rarely went anywhere was often to be found by colonel trethaways fireside and not only was he to be found there but he usually brought somebody along  anything on hand this evening he was wont to say on casual meeting  no  then come along with me  sometimes he said it with lamblike innocence sometimes with a challenge brooding under his bushy brows and rarely did he fail to get his man  these men had wives and thus were the germs of dissolution sown in the ranks of the opposition  then again at colonel trethaways there was something to be found besides weak tea and small talk and the correspondents engineers and gentlemen rovers kept the trail well packed in that direction though it was the kings to a man who first broke the way  so the trethaway cabin became the centre of things and backed commercially financially and officially it could not fail to succeed socially  the only bad effect of all this was to make the lives of mrs schoville and divers others of her sex more monotonous and to cause them to lose faith in certain hoary and inconsequent maxims  furthermore captain alexander as highest official was a power in the land and jacob welse was the company and there was a superstition extant concerning the unwisdom of being on indifferent terms with the company  and the time was not long till probably a bare halfdozen remained in outer cold and they were considered a warped lot anyway     chapter xxii  quite an exodus took place in dawson in the spring  men because they had made stakes and other men because they had made none bought up the available dogs and rushed out for dyea over the last ice incidentally it was discovered that dave harney possessed most of these dogs  going out jacob welse asked him on a day when the meridian sun for the first time felt faintly warm to the naked skin  well i calkilate not  im clearin three dollars a pair on the moccasins i cornered to say nothing but saw wood on the boots  say welse not that my nose is out of joint but you jest cinched me everlastin on sugar didnt you  jacob welse smiled  and by the jimcracky im squared  got any rubber boots  no went out of stock early in the winter  dave snickered slowly and im the pertickler party that hocuspocused em  not you  i gave special orders to the clerks  they werent sold in lots  no more they want  one man to the pair and one pair to the man and a couple of hundred of them but it was my dust they chucked into the scales an nobody elses  drink  dont mind  easy  put up your sack call it rebate for i kin afford it    goin out  not this year i guess  washups comin  a strike on henderson the middle of april which promised to be sensational drew st vincent to stewart river  and a little later jacob welse interested on gallagher gulch and with an eye riveted on the copper mines of white river went up into the same district and with him went frona for it was more vacation than business  in the mean time corliss and bishop who had been on trail for a month or more running over the mayo and mcquestion country rounded up on the left fork of henderson where a block of claims waited to be surveyed  but by may spring was so far advanced that travel on the creeks became perilous and on the last of the thawing ice the miners travelled down to the bunch of islands below the mouth of the stewart where they went into temporary quarters or crowded the hospitality of those who possessed cabins  corliss and bishop located on splitup island so called through the habit parties from the outside had of dividing there and going several ways where tommy mcpherson was comfortably situated  a couple of days later jacob welse and frona arrived from a hazardous trip out of white river and pitched tent on the high ground at the upper end of splitup  a few chechaquos the first of the spring rush strung in exhausted and went into camp against the breaking of the river  also there were still men going out who barred by the rotten ice came ashore to build polingboats and await the breakup or to negotiate with the residents for canoes  notably among these was the baron courbertin  ah  excruciating  magnificent  is it not  so frona first ran across him on the following day  what she asked giving him her hand  you  you doffing his cap  it is a delight  i am sure she began  no  no  he shook his curly mop warmly  it is not you  see  he turned to a peterborough for which mcpherson had just mulcted him of thrice its value  the canoe  is it notnotwhat you yankees calla bute  oh the canoe she repeated with a falling inflection of chagrin  no  no  pardon  he stamped angrily upon the ground  it is not so  it is not you  it is not the canoe  it isah  i have it now it is your promise  one day do you not remember at madame schovilles we talked of the canoe and of my ignorance which was sad and you promised you said  i would give you your first lesson  and is it not delightful  listen  do you not hear  the ripplingah the ripplingdeep down at the heart of things  soon will the water run free  here is the canoe  here we meet  the first lesson  delightful  delightful  the next island below splitup was known as roubeaus island and was separated from the former by a narrow backchannel  here when the bottom had about dropped out of the trail and with the dogs swimming as often as not arrived st vincentthe last man to travel the winter trail  he went into the cabin of john borg a taciturn gloomy individual prone to segregate himself from his kind  it was the mischance of st vincents life that of all cabins he chose borgs for an abidingplace against the breakup  all right the man said when questioned by him  throw your blankets into the corner  bellall clear the litter out of the spare bunk  not till evening did he speak again and then youre big enough to do your own cooking  when the womans done with the stove you can fire away  the woman or bella was a comely indian girl young and the prettiest st vincent had run across  instead of the customary greased swarthiness of the race her skin was clear and of a lightbronze tone and her features less harsh more felicitously curved than those common to the blood  after supper borg both elbows on table and huge misshapen hands supporting chin and jaws sat puffing stinking siwash tobacco and staring straight before him  it would have seemed ruminative the stare had his eyes been softer or had he blinked as it was his face was set and trancelike  have you been in the country long st vincent asked endeavoring to make conversation  borg turned his sullenblack eyes upon him and seemed to look into him and through him and beyond him and still regarding him to have forgotten all about him  it was as though he pondered some great and weighty matterprobably his sins the correspondent mused nervously rolling himself a cigarette  when the yellow cube had dissipated itself in curling fragrance and he was deliberating about rolling a second borg suddenly spoke  fifteen years he said and returned to his tremendous cogitation  thereat and for half an hour thereafter st vincent fascinated studied his inscrutable countenance  to begin with it was a massive head abnormal and topheavy and its only excuse for being was the huge bullthroat which supported it  it had been cast in a mould of elemental generousness and everything about it partook of the asymmetrical crudeness of the elemental  the hair rank of growth thick and unkempt matted itself here and there into curious splotches of gray and again grinning at age twisted itself into curling locks of lustreless blacklocks of unusual thickness like crooked fingers heavy and solid  the shaggy whiskers almost bare in places and in others massing into bunchgrasslike clumps were plentifully splashed with gray  they rioted monstrously over his face and fell raggedly to his chest but failed to hide the great hollowed cheeks or the twisted mouth  the latter was thinlipped and cruel but cruel only in a passionless sort of way  but the forehead was the anomalythe anomaly required to complete the irregularity of the face  for it was a perfect forehead full and broad and rising superbly strong to its high dome  it was as the seat and bulwark of some vast intelligence omniscience might have brooded there  bella washing the dishes and placing them away on the shelf behind borgs back dropped a heavy tin cup  the cabin was very still and the sharp rattle came without warning  on the instant with a brute roar the chair was overturned and borg was on his feet eyes blazing and face convulsed  bella gave an inarticulate animallike cry of fear and cowered at his feet  st vincent felt his hair bristling and an uncanny chill like a jet of cold air played up and down his spine then borg righted the chair and sank back into his old position chin on hands and brooding ponderously  not a word was spoken and bella went on unconcernedly with the dishes while st vincent rolled a shaky cigarette and wondered if it had been a dream  jacob welse laughed when the correspondent told him  just his way he said for his ways are like his looksunusual  hes an unsociable beast  been in the country more years than he can number acquaintances  truth to say i dont think he has a friend in all alaska not even among the indians and hes chummed thick with them off and on  johnny sorehead they call him but it might as well be johnny breakumhead for hes got a quick temper and a rough hand temper  some little misunderstanding popped up between him and the agent at arctic city  he was in the right tooagents mistakebut he tabooed the company on the spot and lived on straight meat for a year  then i happened to run across him at tanana station and after due explanations he consented to buy from us again  got the girl from up the headwaters of the white bill brown told st vincent  welse thinks hes pioneering in that direction but borg could give him cards and spades on it and then win out  hes been over the ground years ago  yes strange sort of a chap  wouldnt hanker to be bunkmates with him  but st vincent did not mind the eccentricities of the man for he spent most of his time on splitup island with frona and the baron one day however and innocently he ran foul of him  two swedes hunting treesquirrels from the other end of roubeau island had stopped to ask for matches and to yarn a while in the warm sunshine of the clearing  st vincent and borg were accommodating them the latter for the most part in meditative monosyllables  just to the rear by the cabindoor bella was washing clothes  the tub was a cumbersome homemade affair and halffull of water was more than a fair match for an ordinary woman  the correspondent noticed her struggling with it and stepped back quickly to her aid  with the tub between them they proceeded to carry it to one side in order to dump it where the ground drained from the cabin  st vincent slipped in the thawing snow and the soapy water splashed up  then bella slipped and then they both slipped  bella giggled and laughed and st vincent laughed back  the spring was in the air and in their blood and it was very good to be alive  only a wintry heart could deny a smile on such a day  bella slipped again tried to recover slipped with the other foot and sat down abruptly  laughing gleefully both of them the correspondent caught her hands to pull her to her feet  with a bound and a bellow borg was upon them  their hands were torn apart and st vincent thrust heavily backward  he staggered for a couple of yards and almost fell  then the scene of the cabin was repeated  bella cowered and grovelled in the muck and her lord towered wrathfully over her  look you he said in stifled gutturals turning to st vincent  you sleep in my cabin and you cook  that is enough  let my woman alone  things went on after that as though nothing had happened st vincent gave bella a wide berth and seemed to have forgotten her existence but the swedes went back to their end of the island laughing at the trivial happening which was destined to be significant     chapter xxiii  spring smiting with soft warm hands had come like a miracle and now lingered for a dreamy spell before bursting into fullblown summer the snow had left the bottoms and valleys and nestled only on the north slopes of the icescarred ridges  the glacial drip was already in evidence and every creek in roaring spate  each day the sun rose earlier and stayed later  it was now chill day by three oclock and mellow twilight at nine  soon a golden circle would be drawn around the sky and deep midnight become bright as high noon  the willows and aspens had long since budded and were now decking themselves in liveries of fresh young green and the sap was rising in the pines  mother nature had heaved her waking sigh and gone about her brief business  crickets sang of nights in the stilly cabins and in the sunshine mosquitoes crept from out hollow logs and snug crevices among the rocksbig noisy harmless fellows that had procreated the year gone lain frozen through the winter and were now rejuvenated to buzz through swift senility to second death  all sorts of creeping crawling fluttering life came forth from the warming earth and hastened to mature reproduce and cease  just a breath of balmy air and then the long cold frost againah they knew it well and lost no time  sand martins were driving their ancient tunnels into the soft clay banks and robins singing on the sprucegarbed islands  overhead the woodpecker knocked insistently and in the forest depths the partridge boomboomed and strutted in virile glory  but in all this nervous haste the yukon took no part  for many a thousand miles it lay cold unsmiling dead  wild fowl driving up from the south in windjamming wedges halted looked vainly for open water and quested dauntlessly on into the north  from bank to bank stretched the savage ice  here and there the water burst through and flooded over but in the chill nights froze solidly as ever  tradition has it that of old time the yukon lay unbroken through three long summers and on the face of it there be traditions less easy of belief  so summer waited for open water and the tardy yukon took to stretching of days and cracking its stiff joints  now an airhole ate into the ice and ate and ate or a fissure formed and grew and failed to freeze again  then the ice ripped from the shore and uprose bodily a yard  but still the river was loth to loose its grip  it was a slow travail and man used to nursing nature with pigmy skill able to burst waterspouts and harness waterfalls could avail nothing against the billions of frigid tons which refused to run down the hill to bering sea  on splitup island all were ready for the breakup  waterways have ever been first highways and the yukon was the sole highway in all the land  so those bound upriver pitched their polingboats and shod their poles with iron and those bound down caulked their scows and barges and shaped spare sweeps with axe and drawingknife  jacob welse loafed and joyed in the utter cessation from work and frona joyed with him in that it was good  but baron courbertin was in a fever at the delay  his hot blood grew riotous after the long hibernation and the warm sunshine dazzled him with warmer fancies  oh  oh  it will never break  never  and he stood gazing at the surly ice and raining politely phrased anathema upon it  it is a conspiracy poor la bijou a conspiracy  he caressed la bijou like it were a horse for so he had christened the glistening peterborough canoe  frona and st vincent laughed and preached him the gospel of patience which he proceeded to tuck away into the deepest abysses of perdition till interrupted by jacob welse  look courbertin  over there south of the bluff  do you make out anything  moving  yes a dog  it moves too slowly for a dog  frona get the glasses  courbertin and st vincent sprang after them but the latter knew their abidingplace and returned triumphant  jacob welse put the binoculars to his eyes and gazed steadily across the river  it was a sheer mile from the island to the farther bank and the sunglare on the ice was a sore task to the vision  it is a man  he passed the glasses to the baron and strained absently with his naked eyes  and something is up  he creeps the baron exclaimed  the man creeps he crawls on hand and knee  look  see  he thrust the glasses tremblingly into fronas hands  looking across the void of shimmering white it was difficult to discern a dark object of such size when dimly outlined against an equally dark background of brush and earth  but frona could make the man out with fair distinctness and as she grew accustomed to the strain she could distinguish each movement and especially so when he came to a windthrown pine  sue watched painfully  twice after tortuous effort squirming and twisting he failed in breasting the big trunk and on the third attempt after infinite exertion he cleared it only to topple helplessly forward and fall on his face in the tangled undergrowth  it is a man  she turned the glasses over to st vincent  and he is crawling feebly  he fell just then this side of the log  does he move jacob welse asked and on a shake of st vincents head brought his rifle from the tent  he fired six shots skyward in rapid succession  he moves  the correspondent followed him closely  he is crawling to the bank  ah     no one moment    yes  he lies on the ground and raises his hat or something on a stick  he is waving it jacob welse fired six more shots  he waves again  now he has dropped it and lies quite still  all three looked inquiringly to jacob welse  he shrugged his shoulders  how should i know  a white man or an indian starvation most likely or else he is injured  but he may be dying frona pleaded as though her father who had done most things could do all things  we can do nothing  ah  terrible terrible  the baron wrung his hands  before our very eyes and we can do nothing  no he exclaimed with swift resolution it shall not be  i will cross the ice  he would have started precipitately down the bank had not jacob welse caught his arm  not such a rush baron  keep your head  but  but nothing  does the man want food or medicine or what  wait a moment  we will try it together  count me in st vincent volunteered promptly and fronas eyes sparkled  while she made up a bundle of food in the tent the men provided and rigged themselves with sixty or seventy feet of light rope  jacob welse and st vincent made themselves fast to it at either end and the baron in the middle  he claimed the food as his portion and strapped it to his broad shoulders  frona watched their progress from the bank the first hundred yards were easy going but she noticed at once the change when they had passed the limit of the fairly solid shoreice her father led sturdily feeling ahead and to the side with his staff and changing direction continually  st vincent at the rear of the extended line was the first to go through but he fell with the pole thrust deftly across the opening and resting on the ice  his head did not go under though the current sucked powerfully and the two men dragged him out after a sharp pull frona saw them consult together for a minute with much pointing and gesticulating on the part of the baron and then st vincent detach himself and turn shoreward  brrrr he shivered coming up the bank to her  its impossible  but why didnt they come in she asked a slight note of displeasure manifest in her voice  said they were going to make one more try first  that courbertin is hotheaded you know  and my father just as bullheaded she smiled  but hadnt you better change  there are spare things in the tent  oh no  he threw himself down beside her  its warm in the sun  for an hour they watched the two men who had become mere specks of black in the distance for they had managed to gain the middle of the river and at the same time had worked nearly a mile upstream  frona followed them closely with the glasses though often they were lost to sight behind the iceridges  it was unfair of them she heard st vincent complain to say they were only going to have one more try  otherwise i should not have turned back  yet they cant make itabsolutely impossible  yes     no     yes  theyre turning back she announced  but listen  what is that  a hoarse rumble like distant thunder rose from the midst of the ice she sprang to her feet  gregory the river cant be breaking  no no surely not  see it is gone  the noise which had come from above had died away downstream  but there  there  another rumble hoarser and more ominous than before lifted itself and hushed the robins and the squirrels  when abreast of them it sounded like a railroad train on a distant trestle  a third rumble which approached a roar and was of greater duration began from above and passed by  oh why dont they hurry  the two specks had stopped evidently in conversation  she ran the glasses hastily up and down the river  though another roar had risen she could make out no commotion  the ice lay still and motionless the robins resumed their singing and the squirrels were chattering with spiteful glee  dont fear frona  st vincent put his arm about her protectingly if there is any danger they know it better than we and they are taking their time  i never saw a big river break up she confessed and resigned herself to the waiting  the roars rose and fell sporadically but there were no other signs of disruption and gradually the two men with frequent duckings worked inshore  the water was streaming from them and they were shivering severely as they came up the bank  at last frona had both her fathers hands in hers  i thought you would never come back  there there  run and get dinner jacob welse laughed  there was no danger  but what was it  stewart rivers broken and sending its ice down under the yukon ice we could hear the grinding plainly out there  ah  and it was terrible terrible cried the baron  and that poor poor man we cannot save him  yes we can  well have a try with the dogs after dinner  hurry frona  but the dogs were a failure  jacob welse picked out the leaders as the more intelligent and with grubpacks on them drove them out from the bank  they could not grasp what was demanded of them  whenever they tried to return they were driven back with sticks and clods and imprecations  this only bewildered them and they retreated out of range whence they raised their wet cold paws and whined pitifully to the shore  if they could only make it once they would understand and then it would go like clockwork  ah  would you  go on  chook miriam chook  the thing is to get the first one across  jacob welse finally succeeded in getting miriam leaddog to fronas team to take the trail left by him and the baron  the dog went on bravely scrambling over floundering through and sometimes swimming but when she had gained the farthest point reached by them she sat down helplessly  later on she cut back to the shore at a tangent landing on the deserted island above and an hour afterwards trotted into camp minus the grubpack  then the two dogs hovering just out of range compromised matters by devouring each others burdens after which the attempt was given over and they were called in  during the afternoon the noise increased in frequency and by nightfall was continuous but by morning it had ceased utterly  the river had risen eight feet and in many places was running over its crust  much crackling and splitting were going on and fissures leaping into life and multiplying in all directions  the undertow ice has jammed below among the islands jacob welse explained  thats what caused the rise  then again it has jammed at the mouth of the stewart and is backing up  when that breaks through it will go down underneath and stick on the lower jam  and then and then  the baron exulted  la bijou will swim again  as the light grew stronger they searched for the man across the river he had not moved but in response to their rifleshots waved feebly  nothing for it till the river breaks baron and then a dash with la bijou  st vincent you had better bring your blankets up and sleep here tonight  well need three paddles and i think we can get mcpherson  no need the correspondent hastened to reply  the backchannel is like adamant and ill be up by daybreak  but i  why not  baron courbertin demanded  frona laughed remember we havent given you your first lessons yet  and therell hardly be time tomorrow jacob welse added  when she goes she goes with a rush  st vincent mcpherson and i will have to make the crew im afraid  sorry baron  stay with us another year and youll be fit  but baron courbertin was inconsolable and sulked for a full halfhour     chapter xxiv  awake  you dreamers wake  frona was out of her sleepingfurs at del bishops first call but ere she had slipped a skirt on and bare feet into moccasins her father beyond the blanketcurtain had thrown back the flaps of the tent and stumbled out  the river was up  in the chill gray light she could see the ice rubbing softly against the very crest of the bank it even topped it in places and the huge cakes worked inshore many feet  a hundred yards out the white field merged into the dim dawn and the gray sky  subdued splits and splutters whispered from out the obscureness and a gentle grinding could be heard  when will it go she asked of del  not a bit too lively for us  see there  he pointed with his toe to the water lapping out from under the ice and creeping greedily towards them  a foot rise every ten minutes  danger he scoffed  not on your life  its got to go  them islandswaving his hand indefinitely down rivercant hold up under more pressure  if they dont let go the ice the icell scour them clean out of the bed of the yukon  sure  but ive got to be chasin back  lower ground down our way  fifteen inches on the cabin floor and mcpherson and corliss hustlin perishables into the bunks  tell mcpherson to be ready for a call jacob welse shouted after him and then to frona nows the time for st vincent to cross the backchannel  the baron shivering barefooted pulled out his watch  ten minutes to three he chattered  hadnt you better go back and get your moccasins frona asked there will be time  and miss the magnificence  hark  from nowhere in particular a brisk crackling arose then died away the ice was in motion  slowly very slowly it proceeded down stream there was no commotion no earsplitting thunder no splendid display of force simply a silent flood of white an orderly procession of tightpacked icepacked so closely that not a drop of water was in evidence  it was there somewhere down underneath but it had to be taken on faith  there was a dull hum or muffled grating but so low in pitch that the ear strained to catch it  ah  where is the magnificence  it is a fake  the baron shook his fists angrily at the river and jacob welses thick brows seemed to draw down in order to hide the grim smile in his eyes  ha ha  i laugh  i snap my fingers  see  i defy  as the challenge left his lips  baron courbertin stepped upon a cake which rubbed lightly past at his feet  so unexpected was it that when jacob welse reached after him he was gone  the ice was picking up in momentum and the hum growing louder and more threatening  balancing gracefully like a circusrider the frenchman whirled away along the rim of the bank  fifty precarious feet he rode his mount becoming more unstable every instant and he leaped neatly to the shore  he came back laughing and received for his pains two or three of the choicest phrases jacob welse could select from the essentially masculine portion of his vocabulary  and for why courbertin demanded stung to the quick  for why jacob welse mimicked wrathfully pointing into the sleek stream sliding by  a great cake had driven its nose into the bed of the river thirty feet below and was struggling to upend  all the frigid flood behind crinkled and bent back like so much paper  then the stalled cake turned completely over and thrust its muddy nose skyward  but the squeeze caught it while cake mounted cake at its back and its fifty feet of muck and gouge were hurled into the air  it crashed upon the moving mass beneath and flying fragments landed at the feet of those that watched  caught broadside in a chaos of pressures it crumbled into scattered pieces and disappeared  god  the baron spoke the word reverently and with awe  frona caught his hand on the one side and her fathers on the other the ice was now leaping past in feverish haste  somewhere below a heavy cake butted into the bank and the ground swayed under their feet  another followed it nearer the surface and as they sprang back upreared mightily and with a ton or so of soil on its broad back bowled insolently onward  and yet another reaching inshore like a huge hand ripped three careless pines out by the roots and bore them away  day had broken and the driving white gorged the yukon from shore to shore  what of the pressure of pent water behind the speed of the flood had become dizzying  down all its length the bank was being gashed and gouged and the island was jarring and shaking to its foundations  oh great  great  frona sprang up and down between the men  where is your fake baron  ah he shook his head  ah  i was wrong  i am miserable  but the magnificence  look  he pointed down to the bunch of islands which obstructed the bend there the milewide stream divided and subdivided againwhich was well for water but not so well for packed ice  the islands drove their wedged heads into the frozen flood and tossed the cakes high into the air  but cake pressed upon cake and shelved out of the water out and up sliding and grinding and climbing and still more cakes from behind till hillocks and mountains of ice upreared and crashed among the trees  a likely place for a jam jacob welse said  get the glasses frona  he gazed through them long and steadily  its growing spreading out  a cake at the right time and the right place     but the river is falling frona cried  the ice had dropped six feet below the top of the bank and the baron courbertin marked it with a stick  our mans still there but he doesnt move  it was clear day and the sun was breaking forth in the northeast they took turn about with the glasses in gazing across the river  look  is it not marvellous  courbertin pointed to the mark he had made  the water had dropped another foot  ah  too bad too bad the jam there will be none  jacob welse regarded him gravely  ah  there will be he asked picking up hope  frona looked inquiringly at her father  jams are not always nice he said with a short laugh  it all depends where they take place and where you happen to be  but the river  look  it falls i can see it before my eyes  it is not too late  he swept the islandstudded bend and saw the icemountains larger and reaching out one to the other  go into the tent courbertin and put on the pair of moccasins youll find by the stove  go on  you wont miss anything  and you frona start the fire and get the coffee under way  half an hour after though the river had fallen twenty feet they found the ice still pounding along  now the fun begins  here take a squint you hotheaded gaul  the lefthand channel man  now she takes it  courbertin saw the lefthand channel close and then a great white barrier heave up and travel from island to island  the ice before them slowed down and came to rest  then followed the instant rise of the river  up it came in a swift rush as though nothing short of the sky could stop it  as when they were first awakened the cakes rubbed and slid inshore over the crest of the bank the muddy water creeping in advance and marking the way  mon dieu  but this is not nice  but magnificent baron frona teased  in the meanwhile you are getting your feet wet  he retreated out of the water and in time for a small avalanche of cakes rattled down upon the place he had just left  the rising water had forced the ice up till it stood breasthigh above the island like a wall  but it will go down soon when the jam breaks  see even now it comes up not so swift   it has broken  frona was watching the barrier  no it hasnt she denied  but the water no longer rises like a racehorse  nor does it stop rising  he was puzzled for the nonce  then his face brightened  ah  i have it  above somewhere there is another jam  most excellent is it not  she caught his excited hand in hers and detained him  but listen suppose the upper jam breaks and the lower jam holds  he looked at her steadily till he grasped the full import  his face flushed and with a quick intake of the breath he straightened up and threw back his head  he made a sweeping gesture as though to include the island  then you and i the tent the boats cabins trees everything and la bijou  pouf and all are gone to the devil  frona shook her head  it is too bad  bad  pardon  magnificent  no no baron not that  but that you are not an anglosaxon  the race could well be proud of you  and you frona would you not glorify the french  at it again eh  throwing bouquets at yourselves  del bishop grinned at them and made to depart as quickly as he had come  but twist yourselves  some sick men in a cabin down here  got to get em out  youre needed  and dont be all day about it he shouted over his shoulder as he disappeared among the trees  the river was still rising though more slowly and as soon as they left the high ground they were splashing along ankledeep in the water winding in and out among the trees they came upon a boat which had been hauled out the previous fall  and three chechaquos who had managed to get into the country thus far over the ice had piled themselves into it also their tent sleds and dogs  but the boat was perilously near the icegorge which growled and wrestled and overtopped it a bare dozen feet away  come  get out of this you fools jacob welse shouted as he went past  del bishop had told them to get the hell out of there when he ran by and they could not understand  one of them turned up an unheeding terrified face  another lay prone and listless across the thwarts as though bereft of strength while the third with the face of a clerk rocked back and forth and moaned monotonously my god  my god  the baron stopped long enough to shake him  damn he cried  your legs mannot god but your legs  ah ahhump yourself  yes hump  get a move on  twist  get back from the bank  the woods the trees anywhere  he tried to drag him out but the man struck at him savagely and held back  how one collects the vernacular he confided proudly to frona as they hurried on  twist  it is a strong word and suitable  you should travel with del she laughed  hed increase your stock in no time  you dont say so  yes but i do  ah  your idioms  i shall never learn  and he shook his head despairingly with both his hands  they came out in a clearing where a cabin stood close to the river on its flat earthroof two sick men swathed in blankets were lying while bishop corliss and jacob welse were splashing about inside the cabin after the clothesbags and general outfit  the mean depth of the flood was a couple of feet but the floor of the cabin had been dug out for purposes of warmth and there the water was to the waist  keep the tobacco dry one of the sick men said feebly from the roof  tobacco hell his companion advised  look out for the flour  and the sugar he added as an afterthought  thats cause bill he dont smoke miss the first man explained but keep an eye on it wont you he pleaded  here  now shut up del tossed the canister beside him and the man clutched it as though it were a sack of nuggets  can i be of any use she asked looking up at them  nope  scurvy  nothingll do em any good but gods country and raw potatoes  the pocketminer regarded her for a moment  what are you doing here anyway  go on back to high ground  but with a groan and a crash the icewall bulged in  a fiftyton cake ended over splashing them with muddy water and settled down before the door  a smaller cake drove against the outjutting cornerlogs and the cabin reeled  courbertin and jacob welse were inside  after you frona heard the baron and then her fathers short amused laugh and the gallant frenchman came out last squeezing his way between the cake and the logs  say bill if that there lower jam holds were goners the man with the canister called to his partner  ay that it will came the answer  below nulato i saw bixbie island swept clean as my old mothers kitchen floor  the men came hastily together about frona  this wont do  weve got to carry them over to your shack corliss as he spoke jacob welse clambered nimbly up the cabin and gazed down at the big barrier  wheres mcpherson he asked  petrified astride the ridgepole this last hour  jacob welse waved his arm  its breaking  there she goes  no kitchen floor this time  bill with my respects to your old woman called he of the tobacco  ay answered the imperturbable bill  the whole river seemed to pick itself up and start down the stream with the increasing motion the icewall broke in a hundred places and from up and down the shore came the rending and crashing of uprooted trees  corliss and bishop laid hold of bill and started off to mcphersons and jacob welse and the baron were just sliding his mate over the eaves when a huge block of ice rammed in and smote the cabin squarely frona saw it and cried a warning but the tiered logs were overthrown like a house of cards  she saw courbertin and the sick man hurled clear of the wreckage and her father go down with it  she sprang to the spot but he did not rise  she pulled at him to get his mouth above water but at full stretch his head barely showed  then she let go and felt about with her hands till she found his right arm jammed between the logs  these she could not move but she thrust between them one of the roofpoles which had underlaid the dirt and moss  it was a rude handspike and hardly equal to the work for when she threw her weight upon the free end it bent and crackled  heedful of the warning she came in a couple of feet and swung upon it tentatively and carefully till something gave and jacob welse shoved his muddy face into the air  he drew half a dozen great breaths and burst out but that tastes good  and then throwing a quick glance about him  frona del bishop is a most veracious man  why she asked perplexedly  because he said youd do you know  he kissed her and they both spat the mud from their lips laughing courbertin floundered round a corner of the wreckage  never was there such a man he cried gleefully  he is mad crazy there is no appeasement  his skull is cracked by the fall and his tobacco is gone  it is chiefly the tobacco which is lamentable  but his skull was not cracked for it was merely a slit of the scalp of five inches or so  youll have to wait till the others come back  i cant carry jacob welse pointed to his right arm which hung dead  only wrenched he explained  no bones broken  the baron struck an extravagant attitude and pointed down at fronas foot  ah  the water it is gone and there a jewel of the flood a pearl of price  her wellworn moccasins had gone rotten from the soaking and a little white toe peeped out at the world of slime  then i am indeed wealthy baron for i have nine others  and who shall deny who shall deny he cried fervently  what a ridiculous foolish lovable fellow it is  i kiss your hand  and he knelt gallantly in the muck  she jerked her hand away and burying it with its mate in his curly mop shook his head back and forth  what shall i do with him father  jacob welse shrugged his shoulders and laughed and she turned courbertins face up and kissed him on the lips  and jacob welse knew that his was the larger share in that manifest joy   the river fallen to its winter level was pounding its iceglut steadily along  but in falling it had rimmed the shore with a twentyfoot wall of stranded floes  the great blocks were spilled inland among the thrown and standing trees and the slimecoated flowers and grasses like the titanic vomit of some northland monster  the sun was not idle and the steaming thaw washed the mud and foulness from the bergs till they blazed like heaped diamonds in the brightness or shimmered opalescentblue  yet they were reared hazardously one on another and ever and anon flashing towers and rainbow minarets crumbled thunderously into the flood  by one of the gaps so made lay la bijou and about it saving chechaquos and sick men were grouped the denizens of splitup  na na lad twa menll be a plenty  tommy mcpherson sought about him with his eyes for corroboration  gin ye gat three i the canoe twill be ower comfortable  it must be a dash or nothing corliss spoke up  we need three men tommy and you know it  na na twas a plenty im tellin ye  but im afraid well have to do

ill not be inqueesitive but yon son of anaks a likely mon  he maun pit oop a guid stroke  while the scot did not lose much love for the truculent pocketminer he was well aware of his grit and seized the chance to save himself by shoving the other into the breach  del bishop stepped into the centre of the little circle paused and looked every man in the eyes before he spoke  is there a man herell say im a coward he demanded without preface again he looked each one in the eyes  or is there a man wholl even hint that i ever did a curlike act  and yet again he searched the circle  well and good  i hate the water but ive never been afraid of it  i dont know how to swim yet ive been over the side more times than its good to remember  i cant pull an oar without batting my back on the bottom of the boat  as for steeringwell authorities say theres thirtytwo points to the compass but theres at least thirty more when i get started  and as sure as god made little apples i dont know my elbow from my knee about a paddle  ive capsized damn near every canoe i ever set foot in  ive gone right through the bottom of two  ive turned turtle in the canyon and been pulled out below the white horse  i can only keep stroke with one man and that mans yours truly  but gentlemen if the call comes ill take my place in la bijou and take her to hell if she dont turn over on the way  baron courbertin threw his arms about him crying as sure as god made little apples thou art a man  tommys face was white and he sought refuge in speech from the silence which settled down  ill deny i lift a guid paddle nor that my wind is fair but gin ye gang a tithe the way the next jamll be on us  for my pairt i conseeder it ay rash  bide a wee till the rivers clear say i  its no go tommy jacob welse admonished  you cant cash excuses here  but mon  it doesna need discreemeenation  thatll do from corliss  youre coming  ill naething o the sort  ill  shut up  del had come into the world with lungs of leather and larynx of brass and when he thus jerked out the stops the scotsman quailed and shrank down  oyez  oyez  in contrast to dels siren tones fronas were purest silver as they rippled downisland through the trees  oyez  oyez open water  open water  and wait a minute  ill be with you  three miles upstream where the yukon curved grandly in from the west a bit of water appeared  it seemed too marvellous for belief after the granite winter but mcpherson untouched of imagination began a crafty retreat  bide a wee bide a wee he protested when collared by the pocketminer  ave forgot my pipe  then youll bide with us tommy del sneered  and id let you have a draw of mine if your own wasnt sticking out of your pocket  twas the baccy id in mind  then dig into this  he shoved his pouch into mcphersons shaking hands  youd better shed your coat  here  ill help you  and private tommy if you dont act the man i wont do a thing to you sure  corliss had stripped his heavy flannel shirt for freedom and it was plain when frona joined them that she also had been shedding  jacket and skirt were gone and her underskirt of dark cloth ceased midway below the knee  youll do del commended  jacob welse looked at her anxiously and went over to where she was testing the grips of the several paddles  youre not he began  she nodded  youre a guid girl mcpherson broke in  now ave a wumman to home to say naething o three bairns  all ready  corliss lifted the bow of la bijou and looked back  the turbid water lashed by on the heels of the icerun  courbertin took the stern in the steep descent and del marshalled tommys reluctant rear  a flat floe dipping into the water at a slight incline served as the embarkingstage  into the bow with you tommy  the scotsman groaned felt bishop breathe heavily at his back and obeyed frona meeting his weight by slipping into the stern  i can steer she assured corliss who for the first time was aware that she was coming  he glanced up to jacob welse as though for consent and received it  hit er up  hit er up del urged impatiently  youre burnin daylight     chapter xxv  la bijou was a perfect expression of all that was dainty and delicate in the boatbuilders soul  light as an eggshell and as fragile her threeeighthsinch skin offered no protection from a driving chunk of ice as small as a mans head  nor though the water was open did she find a clear way for the river was full of scattered floes which had crumbled down from the rimice  and here at once through skilful handling corliss took to himself confidence in frona  it was a great picture the river rushing blackly between its crystalline walls beyond the green woods stretching upward to touch the cloudflecked summer sky and over all like a furnace blast the hot sun beating down  a great picture but somehow corlisss mind turned to his mother and her perennial tea the soft carpets the prim new england maidservants the canaries singing in the wide windows and he wondered if she could understand  and when he thought of the woman behind him and felt the dip and lift dip and lift of her paddle his mothers women came back to him one by one and passed in long reviewpale glimmering ghosts he thought caricatures of the stock which had replenished the earth and which would continue to replenish the earth  la bijou skirted a pivoting floe darted into a nipping channel and shot out into the open with the walls grinding together behind  tommy groaned  well done corliss encouraged  the fule wumman came the backward snarl  why couldna she bide a bit  frona caught his words and flung a laugh defiantly  vance darted a glance over his shoulder to her and her smile was witchery  her cap perched precariously was sliding off while her flying hair aglint in the sunshine framed her face as he had seen it framed on the dyea trail  how i should like to sing if it werent for saving ones breath  say the song of the sword or the anchor chanty  or the first chanty corliss answered  mine was the woman darkling i found her he hummed significantly  she flashed her paddle into the water on the opposite side in order to go wide of a jagged cake and seemed not to hear  i could go on this way forever  and i corliss affirmed warmly  but she refused to take notice saying instead vance do you know im glad were friends  no fault of mine were not more  youre losing your stroke sir she reprimanded and he bent silently to the work  la bijou was driving against the current at an angle of fortyfive degrees and her resultant course was a line at right angles to the river  thus she would tap the western bank directly opposite the startingpoint where she could work upstream in the slacker flood but a mile of indented shore and then a hundred yards of bluffs rising precipitously from out a stiff current would still lie between them and the man to be rescued  now let us ease up corliss advised as they slipped into an eddy and drifted with the backtide under the great wall of rimice  who would think it midmay  she glanced up at the carelessly poised cakes  does it seem real to you vance  he shook his head  nor to me  i know that i frona in the flesh am here in a peterborough paddling for dear life with two men year of our lord eighteen hundred and ninetyeight alaska yukon river this is water that is ice my arms are tired my heart up a few beats and i am sweatingand yet it seems all a dream  just think  a year ago i was in paris  she drew a deep breath and looked out over the water to the further shore where jacob welses tent like a snowy handkerchief sprawled against the deep green of the forest  i do not believe there is such a place she added  there is no paris  and i was in london a twelvemonth past corliss meditated  but i have undergone a new incarnation  london  there is no london now  it is impossible  how could there be so many people in the world  this is the world and we know of fact that there are very few people in it else there could not be so much ice and sea and sky  tommy here i know thinks fondly of a place he calls toronto  he mistakes  it exists only in his minda memory of a former life he knew  of course he does not think so  that is but natural for he is no philosopher nor does he bother  wheest will ye tommy fiercely whispered  your gabblell bring it doon aboot oor heads  life is brief in the northland and fulfilment ever clutters the heels of prophecy  a premonitory tremor sighed down the air and the rainbow wall swayed above them  the three paddles gripped the water with common accord  la bijou leaped out from under  broadside after broadside flared and crashed and a thousand frigid tons thundered down behind them  the displaced water surged outward in a foamy upstanding circle and la bijou striving wildly to rise ducked through the stiff overhang of the crest and wallowed halffull in the trough  dinna i tell ye ye gabbling fules  sit still and bail corliss checked him sharply  or youll not have the comfort of telling us anything  he shook his head at frona and she winked back then they both chuckled much like children over an escapade which looks disastrous but turns out well  creeping timidly under the shadow of the impending avalanches la bijou slipped noiselessly up the last eddy  a corner of the bluff rose savagely from the rivera monstrous mass of naked rock scarred and battered of the centuries hating the river that gnawed it ever hating the rain that graved its grim face with unsightly seams hating the sun that refused to mate with it whereof green life might come forth and hide its hideousness  the whole force of the river hurled in against it waged furious war along its battlements and caromed off into midstream again  down all its length the stiff waves stood in serried rows and its crevices and waterworn caverns were abellow with unseen strife  now  bend to it  your best  it was the last order corliss could give for in the din they were about to enter a mans voice were like a crickets chirp amid the growling of an earthquake  la bijou sprang forward cleared the eddy with a bound and plunged into the thick  dip and lift dip and lift the paddles worked with rhythmic strength  the water rippled and tore and pulled all ways at once and the fragile shell unable to go all ways at once shook and quivered with the shock of resistance it veered nervously to the right and left but frona held it with a hand of steel  a yard away a fissure in the rock grinned at them  la bijou leaped and shot ahead and the water slipping away underneath kept her always in one place  now they surged out from the fissure now in ahead for half a yard then back again and the fissure mocked their toil  five minutes each of which sounded a separate eternity and the fissure was past  ten minutes and it was a hundred feet astern  dip and lift dip and lift till sky and earth and river were blotted out and consciousness dwindled to a thin linea streak of foam fringed on the one hand with sneering rock on the other with snarling water that thin line summed up all  somewhere below was the beginning of things somewhere above beyond the roar and traffic was the end of things and for that end they strove  and still frona held the eggshell with a hand of steel  what they gained they held and fought for more inch by inch dip and lift and all would have been well but for the flutter of tommys soul  a cake of ice sucked beneath by the current rose under his paddle with a flurry of foam turned over its toothed edge and was dragged back into the depths  and in that sight he saw himself hair streaming upward and drowned hands clutching emptiness going feet first down and down  he stared wideeyed at the portent and his poised paddle refused to strike  on the instant the fissure grinned in their faces and the next they were below the bluffs drifting gently in the eddy  frona lay head thrown back sobbing at the sun amidships corliss sprawled panting and forward choking and gasping and nerveless the scotsman drooped his head upon his knees  la bijou rubbed softly against the rimice and came to rest  the rainbowwall hung above like a fairy pile the sun flung backward from innumerable facets clothed it in jewelled splendor  silvery streams tinkled down its crystal slopes and in its clear depths seemed to unfold veil on veil the secrets of life and death and mortal strivingvistas of paleshimmering azure opening like dreamvisions and promising down there in the great cool heart infinite rest infinite cessation and rest  the topmost tower delicately massive a score of feet above them swayed to and fro gently like the ripple of wheat in light summer airs  but corliss gazed at it unheeding  just to lie there on the marge of the mystery just to lie there and drink the air in great gulps and do nothinghe asked no more  a dervish whirling on heel till all things blur may grasp the essence of the universe and prove the godhead indivisible and so a man plying a paddle and plying and plying may shake off his limitations and rise above time and space and so corliss  but gradually his blood ceased its mad pounding and the air was no longer nectarsweet and a sense of things real and pressing came back to him  weve got to get out of this he said  his voice sounded like a mans whose throat has been scorched by many and long potations  it frightened him but he limply lifted a shaking paddle and shoved off  yes let us start by all means frona said in a dim voice which seemed to come to him from a far distance  tommy lifted his head and gazed about  a doot well juist hae to gie it oop  bend to it  yell no try it anither  bend to it corliss repeated  till your heart bursts tommy frona added  once again they fought up the thin line and all the world vanished save the streak of foam and the snarling water and the grinning fissure  but they passed it inch by inch and the broad bend welcomed them from above and only a rocky buttress of implacable hate around whose base howled the tides of an equal hate stood between  then la bijou leaped and throbbed and shook again and the current slid out from under and they remained ever in one place  dip and lift dip and lift through an infinity of time and torture and travail till even the line dimmed and faded and the struggle lost its meaning their souls became merged in the rhythm of the toil  ever lifting ever falling they seemed to have become great pendulums of time  and before and behind glimmered the eternities and between the eternities ever lifting ever falling they pulsed in vast rhythmical movement they were no longer humans but rhythms  they surged in till their paddles touched the bitter rock but they did not know surged out where chance piloted them unscathed through the lashing ice but they did not see  nor did they feel the shock of the smitten waves nor the driving spray that cooled their faces    la bijou veered out into the stream and their paddles flashing mechanically in the sunshine held her to the return angle across the river  as time and matter came back to them and splitup island dawned upon their eyes like the foreshore of a new world they settled down to the long easy stroke wherein breath and strength may be recovered  a third attempt would have been useless corliss said in a dry cracked whisper  and frona answered yes our hearts would have surely broken  life and the pleasant campfire and the quiet rest in the noonday shade came back to tommy as the shore drew near and more than all blessed toronto its houses that never moved and its jostling streets each time his head sank forward and he reached out and clutched the water with his paddle the streets enlarged as though gazing through a telescope and adjusting to a nearer focus  and each time the paddle drove clear and his head was raised the island bounded forward  his head sank and the streets were of the size of life it raised and jacob welse and the two men stood on the bank three lengths away  dinna i tell ye he shouted to them triumphantly  but frona jerked the canoe parallel with the bank and he found himself gazing at the long upstream stretch  he arrested a stroke midway and his paddle clattered in the bottom  pick it up corlisss voice was sharp and relentless  ill do naething o the kind  he turned a rebellious face on his tormentor and ground his teeth in anger and disappointment  the canoe was drifting down with the current and frona merely held it in place  corliss crawled forward on his knees  i dont want to hurt you tommy he said in a low tense voice so     well just pick it up thats a good fellow  ill no  then i shall kill you corliss went on in the same calm passionless way at the same time drawing his huntingknife from its sheath  and if i dinna the scotsman queried stoutly though cowering away  corliss pressed gently with the knife  the point of the steel entered tommys back just where the heart should be passed slowly through the shirt and bit into the skin  nor did it stop there neither did it quicken but just as slowly held on its way  he shrank back quivering  there there man  pit it oop he shrieked  i maun gie in  fronas face was quite pale but her eyes were hard brilliantly hard and she nodded approval  were going to try this side and shoot across from above she called to her father  what  i cant hear  tommy  oh his hearts weak nothing serious  she saluted with her paddle  well be back in no time father mine  in no time  stewart river was wide open and they ascended it a quarter of a mile before they shot its mouth and continued up the yukon  but when they were well abreast of the man on the opposite bank a new obstacle faced them  a mile above a wreck of an island clung desperately to the river bed  its tail dwindled to a sandspit which bisected the river as far down as the impassable bluffs  further a few hundred thousand tons of ice had grounded upon the spit and upreared a glittering ridge  well have to portage corliss said as frona turned the canoe from the bank  la bijou darted across the narrower channel to the sandspit and slipped up a little ice ravine where the walls were less precipitous they landed on an outjutting cake which without support overhung the water for sheer thirty feet  how far its other end could be buried in the mass was matter for conjecture  they climbed to the summit dragging the canoe after them and looked out over the dazzle  floe was piled on floe in titanic confusion  huge blocks topped and overtopped one another only to serve as pedestals for great white masses which blazed and scintillated in the sun like monstrous jewels  a bonny place for a bit walk tommy sneered wi the next jam fair to come ony time  he sat down resolutely  no thank ye kindly ill no try it  frona and corliss clambered on the canoe between them  the persians lashed their slaves into battle she remarked looking back  i never understood before  hadnt you better go back after him  corliss kicked him up whimpering and forced him to go on in advance the canoe was an affair of little weight but its bulk on the steep rises and sharp turns taxed their strength  the sun burned down upon them  its white glare hurt their eyes the sweat oozed out from every pore and they panted for breath  oh vance do you know     what  he swept the perspiration from his forehead and flung it from him with a quick flirt of the hand  i wish i had eaten more breakfast  he grunted sympathetically  they had reached the midmost ridge and could see the open river and beyond quite clearly the man and his signal of distress  below pastoral in its green quiet lay splitup island  they looked up to the broad bend of the yukon smiling lazily as though it were not capable at any moment of spewing forth a flood of death  at their feet the ice sloped down into a miniature gorge across which the sun cast a broad shadow  go on tommy frona bade  were halfway over and theres water down there  its water yed be thinkin on is it he snarled and you aleadin a buddie to his death  i fear you have done some great sin tommy she said with a reproving shake of the head or else you would not be so afraid of death  she sighed and picked up her end of the canoe  well i suppose it is natural  you do not know how to die  no more do i want to die he broke in fiercely  but there come times for all men to dietimes when to die is the only thing to do  perhaps this is such a time  tommy slid carefully over a glistening ledge and dropped his height to a broad foothold  its a vera guid he grinned up but dinna ye think ave suffeecient discreemeenation to judge for mysel  why should i no sing my ain sang  because you do not know how  the strong have ever pitched the key for such as you  it is they that have taught your kind when and how to die and led you to die and lashed you to die  ye pit it fair he rejoined  and ye do it weel  it doesna behoove me to complain sic a michty fine job yere makin on it  you are doing well corliss chuckled as tommy dropped out of sight and landed into the bed of the gorge  the cantankerous brute hed argue on the trail to judgment  where did you learn to paddle she asked  collegeexercise he answered shortly  but isnt that fine look  the melting ice had formed a pool in the bottom of the gorge  frona stretched out full length and dipped her hot mouth in its coolness and lying as she did the soles of her dilapidated moccasins or rather the soles of her feet for moccasins and stockings had gone in shreds were turned upward  they were very white and from contact with the ice were bruised and cut  here and there the blood oozed out and from one of the toes it streamed steadily  so wee and pretty and saltlike tommy gibed  one wouldna think they could lead a strong man to hell  by the way you grumble theyre leading you fast enough corliss answered angrily  forty mile an hour tommy retorted as he walked away gloating over having the last word  one moment  youve two shirts  lend me one  the scotsmans face lighted inquisitively till he comprehended  then he shook his head and started on again  frona scrambled to her feet  whats the matter  nothing  sit down  but what is the matter  corliss put his hands on her shoulders and pressed her back  your feet  you cant go on in such shape  theyre in ribbons  see  he brushed the sole of one of them and held up a blooddripping palm why didnt you tell me  oh they didnt bothermuch  give me one of your skirts he demanded  i     she faltered  i only have one  he looked about him  tommy had disappeared among the icefloes  we must be getting on frona said attempting to rise  but he held her back  not another step till i fix you  here goes so shut your eyes  she obeyed and when she opened them he was naked to the waist and his undershirt torn in strips was being bound about her feet  you were in the rear and i did not know  dont apologize pray she interrupted  i could have spoken  im not im reproaching you  now the other one  put it up  the nearness to her bred a madness and he touched his lips lightly to the same white little toe that had won the baron courbertin a kiss  though she did not draw back her face flushed and she thrilled as she had thrilled once before in her life  you take advantage of your own goodness she rebuked him  then i will doubly advantage myself  please dont she begged  and why not  it is a custom of the sea to broach the spirits as the ship prepares to sink  and since this is a sort of a forlorn hope you know why not  but     but what miss prim  oh  of all things you know i do not deserve that  if there were nobody else to be considered why under the circumstances     he drew the last knot tight and dropped her foot  damn st vincent anyway  come on  so would i were i you she laughed taking up her end of the canoe but how you have changed vance  you are not the same man i met on the dyea trail  you hadnt learned to swear then among other things  no im not the same for which i thank god and you  only i think i am honester than you  i always live up to my philosophy  now confess thats unfair  you ask too much under the circumstances  only a little toe  or else i suppose you just care for me in a kind bigbrotherly way in which case if you really wish it you may  do keep quiet he broke in roughly or ill be making a gorgeous fool of myself  kiss all my toes she finished  he grunted but did not deign a reply  the work quickly took their breath and they went on in silence till they descended the last steep to where mcpherson waited by the open river  del hates st vincent she said boldly  why  yes it seems that way  he glanced back at her curiously  and wherever he goes del lugs an old russian book which he cant read but which he nevertheless regards in some sort of way as st vincents nemesis  and do you know frona he has such faith in it that i cant help catching a little myself  i dont know whether youll come to me or whether ill go to you but  she dropped her end of the canoe and broke out in laughter  he was annoyed and a hurt spread of blood ruddied his face  if i have he began  stupid she laughed  dont be silly  and above all dont be dignified  it doesnt exactly become you at the present momentyour hair all tangled a murderous knife in your belt and naked to the waist like a pirate stripped for battle  be fierce frown swear anything but please dont be dignified  i do wish i had my camera in after years i could say this my friends is corliss the great arctic explorer just as he looked at the conclusion of his worldfamous trip through darkest alaska  he pointed an ominous finger at her and said sternly where is your skirt  she involuntarily looked down  but its tatterdemalion presence relieved her and her face jerked up scarlet  you should be ashamed  please please do not be dignified he laughed  very true it doesnt exactly become you at the present moment  now if i had my camera  do be quiet and go on she said  tommy is waiting  i hope the sun takes the skin all off your back she panted vindictively as they slid the canoe down the last shelf and dropped it into the water  ten minutes later they climbed the icewall and on and up the bank which was partly a hillside to where the signal of distress still fluttered  beneath it on the ground lay stretched the man  he lay very quietly and the fear that they were too late was upon them when he moved his head slightly and moaned  his rough clothes were in rags and the black bruised flesh of his feet showed through the remnants of his moccasins  his body was thin and gaunt without fleshpads or muscles while the bones seemed ready to break through the tightstretched skin  as corliss felt his pulse his eyes fluttered open and stared glassily  frona shuddered  man its fair gruesome mcpherson muttered running his hand up a shrunken arm  you go on to the canoe frona corliss said  tommy and i will carry him down  but her lips set firmly  though the descent was made easier by her aid the man was well shaken by the time they laid him in the bottom of the canoeso well shaken that some last shreds of consciousness were aroused  he opened his eyes and whispered hoarsely jacob welse    despatches     from the outside  he plucked feebly at his open shirt and across his emaciated chest they saw the leather strap to which doubtless the despatchpouch was slung  at either end of the canoe there was room to spare but amidships corliss was forced to paddle with the man between his knees  la bijou swung out blithely from the bank  it was downstream at last and there was little need for exertion  vances arms and shoulders and back a bright scarlet caught fronas attention  my hopes are realized she exulted reaching out and softly stroking a burning arm  we shall have to put cold cream on it when we get back  go ahead he encouraged  that feels awfully good  she splashed his hot back with a handful of the icecold water from overside  he caught his breath with a gasp and shivered  tommy turned about to look at them  its a guid deed well a doon this day he remarked pleasantly to gie a hand in distress is guid i the sight of god  whos afeared  frona laughed  weel he deliberated i was a bit fashed no doot but  his utterance ceased and he seemed suddenly to petrify  his eyes fixed themselves in a terrible stare over fronas shoulder  and then slowly and dreamily with the solemnity fitting an invocation of deity murmured guid gawd almichty  they whirled their heads about  a wall of ice was sweeping round the bend and even as they looked the righthand flank unable to compass the curve struck the further shore and flung up a ridge of heaving mountains  guid gawd  guid gawd  like rats i the trap tommy jabbed his paddle futilely in the water  get the stroke corliss hissed in his ear and la bijou sprang away  frona steered straight across the current at almost right angles for splitup but when the sandspit over which they had portaged crashed at the impact of a million tons corliss glanced at her anxiously  she smiled and shook her head at the same time slacking off the course  we cant make it she whispered looking back at the ice a couple of hundred feet away  our only chance is to run before it and work in slowly  she cherished every inward inch jealously holding the canoe up as sharply as she dared and at the same time maintaining a constant distance ahead of the icerim  i canna stand the pace tommy whimpered once but the silence of corliss and frona seemed ominous and he kept his paddle going  at the very fore of the ice was a floe five or six feet thick and a couple of acres in extent  reaching out in advance of the pack it clove through the water till on either side there formed a bore like that of a quick floodtide in an inland passage  tommy caught sight of it and would have collapsed had not corliss prodded him between strokes with the point of his paddle  we can keep ahead frona panted but we must get time to make the landing  when the chance comes drive her in bow on corliss counselled and when she strikes jump and run for it  climb rather  im glad my skirt is short  repulsed by the bluffs of the left bank the ice was forced towards the right  the big floe in advance drove in upon the precise point of splitup island  if you look back ill brain you with the paddle corliss threatened  ay tommy groaned  but corliss looked back and so did frona  the great berg struck the land with an earthquake shock  for fifty feet the soft island was demolished  a score of pines swayed frantically and went down and where they went down rose up a mountain of ice which rose and fell and rose again  below and but a few feet away del bishop ran out to the bank and above the roar they could hear faintly his hit er up hit er up then the icerim wrinkled up and he sprang back to escape it  the first opening corliss gasped  fronas lips spread apart she tried to speak but failed then nodded her head that she had heard  they swung along in rapid rhythm under the rainbowwall looking for a place where it might be quickly cleared  and down all the length of splitup island they raced vainly the shore crashing behind them as they fled  as they darted across the mouth of the backchannel to roubeau island they found themselves heading directly for an opening in the rimice la bijou drove into it full tilt and went half her length out of water on a shelving cake  the three leaped together but while the two of them gripped the canoe to run it up tommy in the lead strove only to save himself  and he would have succeeded had he not slipped and fallen midway in the climb  he half arose slipped and fell again corliss hauling on the bow of the canoe trampled over him  he reached up and clutched the gunwale  they did not have the strength and this clog brought them at once to a standstill  corliss looked back and yelled for him to leave go but he only turned upward a piteous face like that of a drowning man and clutched more tightly behind them the ice was thundering  the first flurry of coming destruction was upon them  they endeavored desperately to drag up the canoe but the added burden was too much and they fell on their knees the sick man sat up suddenly and laughed wildly  blood of my soul he ejaculated and laughed again  roubeau island swayed to the first shock and the ice was rocking under their feet  frona seized a paddle and smashed the scotsmans knuckles and the instant he loosed his grip corliss carried the canoe up in a mad rush frona clinging on and helping from behind  the rainbowwall curled up like a scroll and in the convolutions of the scroll like a bee in the many folds of a magnificent orchid tommy disappeared  they fell breathless on the earth  but a monstrous cake shoved up from the jam and balanced above them  frona tried to struggle to her feet but sank on her knees and it remained for corliss to snatch her and the canoe out from underneath  again they fell this time under the trees the sun sifting down upon them through the green pine needles the robins singing overhead and a colony of crickets chirping in the warmth     chapter xxvi  frona woke slowly as though from a long dream  she was lying where she had fallen across corlisss legs while he on his back faced the hot sun without concern  she crawled up to him  he was breathing regularly with closed eyes which opened to meet hers  he smiled and she sank down again  then he rolled over on his side and they looked at each other  vance  yes  she reached out her hand his closed upon it and their eyelids fluttered and drooped down  the river still rumbled en somewhere in the infinite distance but it came to them like the murmur of a world forgotten  a soft languor encompassed them  the golden sunshine dripped down upon them through the living green and all the life of the warm earth seemed singing  and quiet was very good  fifteen long minutes they drowsed and woke again  frona sat up  ii was afraid she said  not you  afraid that i might be afraid she amended fumbling with her hair  leave it down  the day merits it  she complied with a toss of the head which circled it with a nimbus of rippling yellow  tommys gone corliss mused the race with the ice coming slowly back  yes she answered  i rapped him on the knuckles  it was terrible but the chance is weve a better man in the canoe and we must care for him at once  hello  look there  through the trees not a score of feet away she saw the wall of a large cabin  nobody in sight  it must be deserted or else theyre visiting whoever they are  you look to our man vanceim more presentableand ill go and see  she skirted the cabin which was a large one for the yukon country and came around to where it fronted on the river  the door stood open and as she paused to knock the whole interior flashed upon her in an astounding picturea cumulative picture or series of pictures as it were  for first she was aware of a crowd of men and of some great common purpose upon which all were seriously bent  at her knock they instinctively divided so that a lane opened up flanked by their pressed bodies to the far end of the room  and there in the long bunks on either side sat two grave rows of men  and midway between against the wall was a table  this table seemed the centre of interest  fresh from the sundazzle the light within was dim and murky but she managed to make out a bearded american sitting by the table and hammering it with a heavy caulkingmallet  and on the opposite side sat st vincent  she had time to note his worn and haggard face before a man of scandinavian appearance slouched up to the table  the man with the mallet raised his right hand and said glibly you do most solemnly swear that what you are about to give before the court  he abruptly stopped and glowered at the man before him take off your hat he roared and a snicker went up from the crowd as the man obeyed  then he of the mallet began again  you do most solemnly swear that what you are about to give before the court shall be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god  the scandinavian nodded and dropped his hand  one moment gentlemen  frona advanced up the lane which closed behind her  st vincent sprang to his feet and stretched out his arms to her frona he cried oh frona i am innocent  it struck her like a blow the unexpectedness of it and for the instant in the sickly light she was conscious only of the ring of white faces each face set with eyes that burned  innocent of what she thought and as she looked at st vincent arms still extended she was aware in a vague troubled way of something distasteful innocent of what  he might have had more reserve  he might have waited till he was charged  she did not know that he was charged with anything  friend of the prisoner the man with the mallet said authoritatively bring a stool forard some of you  one moment     she staggered against the table and rested a hand on it  i do not understand  this is all new     but her eyes happened to come to rest on her feet wrapped in dirty rags and she knew that she was clad in a short and tattered skirt that her arm peeped forth through a rent in her sleeve and that her hair was down and flying  her cheek and neck on one side seemed coated with some curious substance  she brushed it with her hand and caked mud rattled to the floor  that will do the man said not unkindly  sit down  were in the same box  we do not understand  but take my word for it were here to find out  so sit down  she raised her hand  one moment  sit down he thundered  the court cannot be disturbed  a hum went up from the crowd words of dissent and the man pounded the table for silence  but frona resolutely kept her feet  when the noise had subsided she addressed the man in the chair  mr chairman i take it that this is a miners meeting  the man nodded then having an equal voice in the managing of this communitys affairs i demand to be heard  it is important that i should be heard  but you are out of order  misser  welse half a dozen voices prompted  miss welse he went on an added respect marking his demeanor it grieves me to inform you that you are out of order  you had best sit down  i will not she answered  i rise to a question of privilege and if i am not heard i shall appeal to the meeting  she swept the crowd with her eyes and cries went up that she be given a fair show  the chairman yielded and motioned her to go on  mr chairman and men i do not know the business you have at present before you but i do know that i have more important business to place before you  just outside this cabin is a man probably dying from starvation  we have brought him from across the river  we should not have bothered you but we were unable to make our own island  this man i speak of needs immediate attention  a couple of you nearest the door go out and look after him the chairman ordered  and you doc holiday go along and see what you can do  ask for a recess st vincent whispered  frona nodded her head  and mr chairman i make a motion for a recess until the man is cared for  cries of no recess and go on with the business greeted the putting of it and the motion was lost  now gregory with a smile and salutation as she took the stool beside him what is it  he gripped her hand tightly  dont believe them frona  they are trying towith a gulping swallowto kill me  why  do be calm  tell me  why last night he began hurriedly but broke off to listen to the scandinavian previously sworn who was speaking with ponderous slowness  i wake wide open quick he was saying  i coom to the door  i there hear one shot more  he was interrupted by a warmcomplexioned man clad in faded mackinaws what did you think he asked  eh the witness queried his face dark and troubled with perplexity  when you came to the door what was your first thought  aww the man sighed his face clearing and infinite comprehension sounding in his voice  i have no moccasins  i tink pretty damn cold  his satisfied expression changed to naive surprise when an outburst of laughter greeted his statement but he went on stolidly one more shot i hear and i run down the trail  then corliss pressed in through the crowd to frona and she lost what the man was saying  whats up the engineer was asking  anything serious  can i be of any use  yes yes  she caught his hand gratefully  get over the backchannel somehow and tell my father to come  tell him that gregory st vincent is in trouble that he is charged with  what are you charged with gregory she asked turning to him  murder  murder from corliss  yes yes  say that he is charged with murder that i am here and that i need him  and tell him to bring me some clothes  and vancewith a pressure of the hand and swift upward lookdont take any    any big chances but do try to make it  oh ill make it all right  he tossed his head confidently and proceeded to elbow his way towards the door  who is helping you in your defence she asked st vincent  he shook his head  no  they wanted to appoint some onea renegade lawyer from the states bill brownbut i declined him  hes taken the other side now  its lynch law you know and their minds are made up  theyre bound to get me  i wish there were time to hear your side  but frona i am innocent  i  ssh  she laid her hand on his arm to hush him and turned her attention to the witness  so the noospaper feller he fight like anything but pierre and me we pull him into the shack  he cry and stand in one place  who cried interrupted the prosecuting lawyer  him   that feller there  the scandinavian pointed directly at st vincent  and i make a light  the slushlamp i find spilt over most everything but i have a candle in my pocket  it is good practice to carry a candle in the pocket he affirmed gravely  and borg he lay on the floor dead  and the squaw say he did it and then she die too  said who did it  again his accusing finger singled out st vincent  him  that feller there  did she frona whispered  yes st vincent whispered back she did  but i cannot imagine what prompted her  she must have been out of her head  the warmfaced man in the faded mackinaws then put the witness through a searching examination which frona followed closely but which elicited little new  you have the right to crossexamine the witness the chairman informed st vincent  any questions you want to ask  the correspondent shook his head  go on frona urged  whats the use he asked hopelessly  im foredoomed  the verdict was reached before the trial began  one moment please  fronas sharp command arrested the retiring witness  you do not know of your own knowledge who committed this murder  the scandinavian gazed at her with a bovine expression on his leaden features as though waiting for her question to percolate to his understanding  you did not see who did it she asked again  aw yes  that feller there accusative finger to the fore  she say he did  there was a general smile at this  but you did not see it  i hear some shooting  but you did not see who did the shooting  aw no but she said  that will do thank you she said sweetly and the man retired  the prosecution consulted its notes  pierre la flitche was called out  a slender swartskinned man lithe of figure and graceful stepped forward to the open space before the table  he was darkly handsome with a quick eloquent eye which roved frankly everywhere  it rested for a moment on frona open and honest in its admiration and she smiled and halfnodded for she liked him at first glance and it seemed as though they had met of old time  he smiled pleasantly back the smooth upper lip curling brightly and showing beautiful teeth immaculately white  in answer to the stereotyped preliminaries he stated that his name was that of his fathers a descendant of the coureurs du bois  his motherwith a shrug of the shoulders and flash of teethwas a breed  he was born somewhere in the barrens on a hunting trip he did not know where  ah oui men called him an oldtimer  he had come into the country in the days of jack mcquestion across the rockies from the great slave  on being told to go ahead with what he knew of the matter in hand he deliberated a moment as though casting about for the best departure  in the spring it is good to sleep with the open door he began his words sounding clear and flutelike and marked by haunting memories of the accents his forbears put into the tongue  and so i sleep last night  but i sleep like the cat  the fall of the leaf the breath of the wind and my ears whisper to me whisper whisper all the night long  so the first shot with a quick snap of the fingers and i am awake just like that and i am at the door  st vincent leaned forward to frona  it was not the first shot  she nodded with her eyes still bent on la flitche who gallantly waited  then two more shot he went on quick together boomboom just like that  borgs shack i say to myself and run down the trail  i think borg kill bella which was bad  bella very fine girl he confided with one of his irresistible smiles  i like bella  so i run  and john he run from his cabin like a fat cow with great noise what the matter he say and i say i dont know  and then something come wheugh out of the dark just like that and knock john down and knock me down  we grab everywhere all at once  it is a man he is in undress  he fight  he cry oh  oh  oh just like that we hold him tight and bimeby pretty quick he stop  then we get up and i say come along back  who was the man  la flitche turned partly and rested his eyes on st vincent  go on  so  the man he will not go back but john and i say yes and he go  did he say anything  i ask him what the matter but he cry he     he sob huhtsch huhtsch just like that  did you see anything peculiar about him  la flitches brows drew up interrogatively  anything uncommon out of the ordinary  ah oui blood on the hands  disregarding the murmur in the room he went on his facile play of feature and gesture giving dramatic value to the recital  john make a light and bella groan like the hairseal when you shoot him in the body just like that when you shoot him in the body under the flipper  and borg lay over in the corner  i look  he no breathe tall  then bella open her eyes and i look in her eyes and i know she know me la flitche  who did it bella i ask  and she roll her head on the floor and whisper so low so slow him dead  i know she mean borg and i say yes  then she lift up on one elbow and look about quick in big hurry and when she see vincent she look no more only she look at vincent all the time  then she point at him just like that  suiting the action to the word la flitche turned and thrust a wavering finger at the prisoner  and she say him him him  and i say bella who did it  and she say him him him  st vincha him do it  and thenla flitches head felt limply forward on his chest and came back naturally erect as he finished with a flash of teeth dead  the warmfaced man bill brown put the quarterbreed through the customary direct examination which served to strengthen his testimony and to bring out the fact that a terrible struggle must have taken place in the killing of borg  the heavy table was smashed the stool and the bunkboard splintered and the stove overthrown  never did i see anything like it la flitche concluded his description of the wreck  no never  brown turned him over to frona with a bow which a smile of hers paid for in full  she did not deem it unwise to cultivate cordiality with the lawyer  what she was working for was timetime for her father to come time to be closeted with st vincent and learn all the details of what really had occurred  so she put questions questions interminable questions to la flitche  twice only did anything of moment crop up  you spoke of the first shot mr la flitche  now the walls of a log cabin are quite thick  had your door been closed do you think you could have heard that first shot  he shook his head though his dark eyes told her he divined the point she was endeavoring to establish  and had the door of borgs cabin been closed would you have heard  again he shook his head  then mr la flitche when you say the first shot you do not mean necessarily the first shot fired but rather the first shot you heard fired  he nodded and though she had scored her point she could not see that it had any material bearing after all  again she worked up craftily to another and stronger climax though she felt all the time that la flitche fathomed her  you say it was very dark mr la flitche  ah oui quite dark  how dark  how did you know it was john you met  john make much noise when he run  i know that kind of noise  could you see him so as to know that it was he  ah no  then mr la flitche she demanded triumphantly will you please state how you knew there was blood on the hands of mr st vincent  his lip lifted in a dazzling smile and he paused a moment  how  i feel it warm on his hands  and my noseah the smoke of the hunter camp long way off the hole where the rabbit hide the track of the moose which has gone before does not my nose tell me  he flung his head back and with tense face eyes closed nostrils quivering and dilated he simulated the quiescence of all the senses save one and the concentration of his whole being upon that one  then his eyes fluttered partly open and he regarded her dreamily  i smell the blood on his hands the warm blood the hot blood on his hands  and by gad he can do it some man exclaimed  and so convinced was frona that she glanced involuntarily at st vincents hands and saw there the rustybrown stains on the cuffs of his flannel shirt  as la flitche left the stand bill brown came over to her and shook hands  no more than proper i should know the lawyer for the defence he said goodnaturedly running over his notes for the next witness  but dont you think it is rather unfair to me she asked brightly i have not had time to prepare my case  i know nothing about it except what i have gleaned from your two witnesses  dont you think mr brown her voice rippling along in persuasive little notes dont you think it would be advisable to adjourn the meeting until tomorrow  hum he deliberated looking at his watch  wouldnt be a bad idea  its five oclock anyway and the men ought to be cooking their suppers  she thanked him as some women can without speech yet as he looked down into her face and eyes he experienced a subtler and greater satisfaction than if she had spoken  he stepped to his old position and addressed the room  on consultation of the defence and the prosecution and upon consideration of the lateness of the hour and the impossibility of finishing the trial within a reasonable limit ihumi take the liberty of moving an adjournment until eight oclock tomorrow morning  the ayes have it the chairman proclaimed coming down from his place and proceeding to build the fire for he was a partowner of the cabin and cook for his crowd     chapter xxvii  frona turned to st vincent as the last of the crowd filed out  he clutched her hands spasmodically like a drowning man  do believe me frona  promise me  her face flushed  you are excited she said or you would not say such things  not that i blame you she relented  i hardly imagine the situation can be anything else but exciting  yes and well i know it he answered bitterly  i am acting like a fool and i cant help it  the strain has been terrible  and as though the horror of borgs end were not enough to be considered the murderer and haled up for mob justice  forgive me frona  i am beside myself  of course i know that you will believe me  then tell me gregory  in the first place the woman bella lied  she must have been crazed to make that dying statement when i fought as i did for her and borg that is the only explanation  begin at the beginning she interrupted  remember i know nothing  he settled himself more comfortably on the stool and rolled a cigarette as he took up the history of the previous night  it must have been about one in the morning when i was awakened by the lighting of the slushlamp  i thought it was borg wondered what he was prowling about for and was on the verge of dropping off to sleep when though i do not know what prompted me i opened my eyes  two strange men were in the cabin  both wore masks and fur caps with the flaps pulled down so that i could see nothing of their faces save the glistening of the eyes through the eyeslits  i had no first thought unless it was that danger threatened  i lay quietly for a second and deliberated  borg had borrowed my pistol and i was actually unarmed  my rifle was by the door  i decided to make a rush for it  but no sooner had i struck the floor than one of the men turned on me at the same time firing his revolver  that was the first shot and the one la flitche did not hear  it was in the struggle afterwards that the door was burst open which enabled him to hear the last three  well i was so close to the man and my leap out of the bunk was so unexpected that he missed me  the next moment we grappled and rolled on the floor  of course borg was aroused and the second man turned his attention to him and bella  it was this second man who did the killing for my man naturally had his hands full  you heard the testimony  from the way the cabin was wrecked you can picture the struggle  we rolled and tossed about and fought till stools table shelveseverything was smashed  oh frona it was terrible  borg fighting for life bella helping him though wounded and groaning and i unable to aid  but finally in a very short while i began to conquer the man with whom i was struggling  i had got him down on his back pinioned his arms with my knees and was slowly throttling him when the other man finished his work and turned on me also  what could i do  two to one and winded so i was thrown into the corner and they made their escape  i confess that i must have been badly rattled by that time for as soon as i caught my breath i took out after them and without a weapon  then i collided with la flitche and john andand you know the rest  only he knit his brows in puzzlement only i cannot understand why bella should accuse me  he looked at her appealingly and though she pressed his hand sympathetically she remained silent weighing pro and con what she had heard  she shook her head slowly  its a bad case and the thing is to convince them  but my god frona i am innocent  i have not been a saint perhaps but my hands are clean from blood  but remember gregory she said gently i am not to judge you unhappily it rests with the men of this miners meeting and the problem is how are they to be convinced of your innocence  the two main points are against youbellas dying words and the blood on your sleeve  the place was areek with blood st vincent cried passionately springing to his feet  i tell you it was areek  how could i avoid floundering in it fighting as i was for life  can you not take my word  there there gregory  sit down  you are truly beside yourself  if your case rested with me you know you would go free and clean  but these menyou know what mob rule ishow are we to persuade them to let you go  dont you see  you have no witnesses  a dying womans words are more sacred than a living mans  can you show cause for the woman to die with a lie on her lips  had she any reason to hate you had you done her or her husband an injury  he shook his head  certainly to us the thing is inexplicable but the miners need no explanation  to them it is obvious  it rests with us to disprove the obvious  can we do it  the correspondent sank down despondently with a collapsing of the chest and a drooping forward of the shoulders  then am i indeed lost  no its not so bad as that  you shall not be hanged  trust me for that  but what can you do he asked despairingly  they have usurped the law have made themselves the law  in the first place the river has broken  that means everything  the governor and the territorial judges may be expected in at any moment with a detachment of police at their backs  and theyre certain to stop here  and furthermore we may be able to do something ourselves the river is open and if it comes to the worst escape would be another way out and escape is the last thing they would dream of  no no impossible  what are you and i against the many  but theres my father and baron courbertin  four determined people acting together may perform miracles gregory dear  trust me it shall come out well  she kissed him and ran her hand through his hair but the worried look did not depart  jacob welse crossed over the backchannel long before dark and with him came del the baron and corliss  while frona retired to change her clothes in one of the smaller cabins which the masculine owners readily turned over to her her father saw to the welfare of the mailcarrier  the despatches were of serious import so serious that long after jacob welse had read and reread them his face was dark and clouded but he put the anxiety from him when he returned to frona st vincent who was confined in an adjoining cabin was permitted to see them  it looks bad jacob welse said on parting for the night  but rest assured st vincent bad or not youll not be stretched up so long as ive a hand to play in the rumpus  i am certain you did not kill borg and theres my fist on it  a long day corliss remarked as he walked back with frona to her cabin  and a longer tomorrow she answered wearily  and im so sleepy  youre a brave little woman and im proud of you  it was ten oclock and he looked out through the dim twilight to the ghostly ice drifting steadily by  and in this trouble he went on depend upon me in any way  in any way she queried with a catch in her voice  if i were a hero of the melodrama id say to the death but as im not ill just repeat in any way  you are good to me vance  i can never repay  tut tut  i do not put myself on sale  love is service i believe  she looked at him for a long time but while her face betrayed soft wonder at heart she was troubled she knew not why and the events of the day and of all the days since she had known him came fluttering through her mind  do you believe in a white friendship she asked at last  for i do hope that such a bond may hold us always  a bright white friendship a comradeship as it were  and as she asked she was aware that the phrase did not quite express what she felt and would desire  and when he shook his head she experienced a glad little inexplicable thrill  a comradeship he questioned  when you know i love you  yes she affirmed in a low voice  i am afraid after all that your knowledge of man is very limited believe me we are not made of such clay  a comradeship  a coming in out of the cold to sit by your fire  good  but a coming in when another man sits with you by your fire  no  comradeship would demand that i delight in your delights and yet do you think for a moment that i could see you with another mans child in your arms a child which might have been mine with that other man looking out at me through the childs eyes laughing at me through its mouth  i say do you think i could delight in your delights  no no love cannot shackle itself with white friendships  she put her hand on his arm  do you think i am wrong he asked bewildered by the strange look in her face  she was sobbing quietly  you are tired and overwrought  so there goodnight  you must get to bed  no dont go not yet  and she arrested him  no no i am foolish as you say i am tired  but listen vance  there is much to be done we must plan tomorrows work  come inside  father and baron courbertin are together and if the worst comes we four must do big things  spectacular jacob welse commented when frona had briefly outlined the course of action and assigned them their parts  but its very unexpectedness ought to carry it through  a coup detat was the barons verdict  magnificent  ah  i feel warm all over at the thought  hands up i cry thus and very fierce  and if they do not hold up their hands he appealed to jacob welse  then shoot  never bluff when youre behind a gun courbertin  its held by good authorities to be unhealthy  and you are to take charge of la bijou vance frona said  father thinks there will be little ice tomorrow if it doesnt jam tonight all youve to do is to have the canoe by the bank just before the door of course you wont know what is happening until st vincent comes running  then in with him and away you godawson  so ill say goodnight and goodby now for i may not have the opportunity in the morning  and keep the lefthand channel till youre past the bend jacob welse counselled him then take the cutoffs to the right and follow the swiftest water  now off with you and into your blankets  its seventy miles to dawson and youll have to make it at one clip     chapter xxviii  jacob welse was given due respect when he arose at the convening of the miners meeting and denounced the proceedings  while such meetings had performed a legitimate function in the past he contended when there was no law in the land that time was now beyond recall for law was now established and it was just law  the queens government had shown itself fit to cope with the situation and for them to usurp its powers was to step backward into the night out of which they had come further no lighter word than criminal could characterize such conduct  and yet further he promised them in set sober terms if anything serious were the outcome to take an active part in the prosecution of every one of them  at the conclusion of his speech he made a motion to hold the prisoner for the territorial court and to adjourn but was voted down without discussion  dont you see st vincent said to frona there is no hope  but there is  listen  and she swiftly outlined the plot of the night before  he followed her in a halfhearted way too crushed to partake of her enthusiasm  its madness to attempt it he objected when she had done  and it looks very much like hanging not to attempt it she answered a little spiritedly  surely you will make a fight  surely he replied hollowly  the first witnesses were two swedes who told of the washtub incident when borg had given way to one of his fits of anger   trivial as the incident was in the light of subsequent events it at once became serious  it opened the way for the imagination into a vast familiar field  it was not so much what was said as what was left unsaid  men born of women the rudest of them knew life well enough to be aware of its significancea vulgar common happening capable of but one interpretation  heads were wagged knowingly in the course of the testimony and whispered comments went the rounds  half a dozen witnesses followed in rapid succession all of whom had closely examined the scene of the crime and gone over the island carefully and all of whom were agreed that there was not the slightest trace to be found of the two men mentioned by the prisoner in his preliminary statement  to fronas surprise del bishop went upon the stand  she knew he disliked st vincent but could not imagine any evidence he could possess which would bear upon the case  being sworn and age and nationality ascertained bill brown asked him his business  pocketminer he challenged back sweeping the assemblage with an aggressive glance  now it happens that a very small class of men follow pocketing and that a very large class of men miners too disbelieve utterly in any such method or obtaining gold  pocketminer sneered a redshirted patriarchallooking man a man who had washed his first pan in the californian diggings in the early fifties  yep del affirmed  now look here young feller his interlocutor continued dye mean to tell me you ever struck it in suchfangled way  yep  dont believe it with a contemptuous shrug  del swallowed fast and raised his head with a jerk  mr chairman i rise to make a statement  i wont interfere with the dignity of the court but i just wish to simply and distinctly state that after the meetings over im going to punch the head of every man that gets gay understand  youre out of order the chairman replied rapping the table with the caulkingmallet  and your head too del cried turning upon him  damn poor order you preserve  pocketings got nothing to do with this here trial and why dont you shut such fool questions out  ill take care of you afterwards you potwolloper  you will will you the chairman grew red in the face dropped the mallet and sprang to his feet  del stepped forward to meet him but bill brown sprang in between and held them apart  order gentlemen order he begged  this is no time for unseemly exhibitions  and remember there are ladies present  the two men grunted and subsided and bill brown asked mr bishop we understand that you are well acquainted with the prisoner  will you please tell the court what you know of his general character  del broadened into a smile  well in the first place hes an extremely quarrelsome disposition  hold  i wont have it  the prisoner was on his feet trembling with anger  you shall not swear my life away in such fashion  to bring a madman whom i have only met once in my life to testify as to my character  the pocketminer turned to him  so you dont know me eh gregory st vincent  no st  vincent replied coldly i do not know you my man  dont you man me del shouted hotly  but st vincent ignored him turning to the crowd  i never saw the fellow but once before and then for a few brief moments in dawson  youll remember before im done del sneered so hold your hush and let me say my little say  i come into the country with him way back in 84  st vincent regarded him with sudden interest  yep mr gregory st vincent  i see you begin to recollect  i sported whiskers and my name was brown joe brown in them days  he grinned vindictively and the correspondent seemed to lose all interest  is it true gregory frona whispered  i begin to recognize he muttered slowly  i dont know    no folly  the man must have died  you say in 84 mr bishop bill brown prompted  yep in 84  he was a newspaperman bound round the world by way of alaska and siberia  id run away from a whaler at sitkathat squares it with brownand i engaged with him for forty a month and found well he quarrelled with me  a snicker beginning from nowhere in particular but passing on from man to man and swelling in volume greeted this statement  even frona and del himself were forced to smile and the only sober face was the prisoners  but he quarrelled with old andy at dyea and with chief george of the chilcoots and the factor at pelly and so on down the line  he got us into no end of trouble and specially womantrouble  he was always monkeying around  mr  chairman i object  frona stood up her face quite calm and blood under control  there is no necessity for bringing in the amours of mr st vincent  they have no bearing whatsoever upon the case and further none of the men of this meeting are clean enough to be prompted by the right motive in conducting such an inquiry  so i demand that the prosecution at least confine itself to relevant testimony  bill brown came up smugly complacent and smiling  mr chairman we willingly accede to the request made by the defence  whatever we have brought out has been relevant and material  whatever we intend to bring out shall be relevant and material  mr bishop is our star witness and his testimony is to the point  it must be taken into consideration that we nave no direct evidence as to the murder of john borg  we can bring no eyewitnesses into court  whatever we have is circumstantial  it is incumbent upon us to show cause  to show cause it is necessary to go into the character of the accused  this we intend to do  we intend to show his adulterous and lustful nature which has culminated in a dastardly deed and jeopardized his neck  we intend to show that the truth is not in him that he is a liar beyond price that no word he may speak upon the stand need be accepted by a jury of his peers  we intend to show all this and to weave it together thread by thread till we have a rope long enough and strong enough to hang him with before the day is done  so i respectfully submit mr chairman that the witness be allowed to proceed  the chairman decided against frona and her appeal to the meeting was voted down  bill brown nodded to del to resume  as i was saying he got us into no end of trouble  now ive been mixed up with water all my lifenever can get away from it it seemsand the more im mixed the less i know about it  st vincent knew this too and him a clever hand at the paddle yet he left me to run the box canyon alone while he walked around  result i was turned over lost half the outfit and all the tobacco and then he put the blame on me besides  right after that he got tangled up with the lake le barge sticks and both of us came near croaking  and why was that bill brown interjected  all along of a pretty squaw that looked too kindly at him  after we got clear i lectured him on women in general and squaws in particular and he promised to behave  then we had a hot time with the little salmons  he was cuter this time and i didnt know for keeps but i guessed  he said it was the medicine man who got horstile but nothingll stir up a medicine man quickern women and the facts pointed that way  when i talked it over with him in a fatherly way he got wrathy and i had to take him out on the bank and give him a threshing  then he got sulky and didnt brighten up till we ran into the mouth of the reindeer river where a camp of siwashes were fishing salmon  but he had it in for me all the time only i didnt know itwas ready any time to give me the double cross  now theres no denying hes got a taking way with women  all he has to do is to whistle em up like dogs  most remarkable faculty that there was the wickedest prettiest squaw among the reindeers  never saw her beat excepting bella  well i guess he whistled her up for he delayed in the camp longer than was necessary  being partial to women  that will do mr bishop interrupted the chairman who from profitless watching of fronas immobile face had turned to her hand the nervous twitching and clinching of which revealed what her face had hidden  that will do mr bishop  i think we have had enough of squaws  pray do not temper the testimony frona chirruped sweetly  it seems very important  do you know what i am going to say next del demanded hotly of the chairman  you dont eh  then shut up  im running this particular sideshow  bill brown sprang in to avert hostilities but the chairman restrained himself and bishop went on  id been done with the whole shootingmatch squaws and all if you hadnt broke me off  well as i said he had it in for me and the first thing i didnt know hed hit me on the head with a riflestock bundled the squaw into the canoe and pulled out  you all know what the yukon country was in 84  and there i was without an outfit left alone a thousand miles from anywhere  i got out all right though theres no need of telling how and so did he  youve all heard of his adventures in siberia  well with an impressive pause i happen to know a thing or two myself  he shoved a hand into the big pocket of his mackinaw jacket and pulled out a dingy leatherbound volume of venerable appearance  i got this from pete whipples old womanwhipple of eldorado  it concerns her granduncle or greatgranduncle i dont know which and if theres anybody here can read russian why itll go into the details of that siberian trip  but as theres no one here that can  courbertin  he can read it some one called in the crowd  a way was made for the frenchman forthwith and he was pushed and shoved protestingly to the front  savve the lingo del demanded  yes but so poorly so miserable courbertin demurred  it is a long time  i forget  go ahead  we wont criticise  no but  go ahead the chairman commanded  del thrust the book into his hands opened at the yellow titlepage ive been itching to get my paws on some buck like you for months and months he assured him gleefully  and now ive got you you cant shake me charley  so fire away  courbertin began hesitatingly the journal of father yakontsk comprising an account in brief of his life in the benedictine monastery at obidorsky and in full of his marvellous adventures in east siberia among the deer men  the baron looked up for instructions  tell us when it was printed del ordered him  in warsaw 1807  the pocketminer turned triumphantly to the room  did you hear that just keep track of it  1807 remember  the baron took up the opening paragraph  it was because of tamerlane he commenced unconsciously putting his translation into a construction with which he was already familiar  at his first words frona turned white and she remained white throughout the reading  once she stole a glance at her father and was glad that he was looking straight before him for she did not feel able to meet his gaze just them  on the other hand though she knew st vincent was eying her narrowly she took no notice of him and all he could see was a white face devoid of expression  when tamerlane swept with fire and sword over eastern asia courbertin read slowly states were disrupted cities overthrown and tribes scattered likelike stardust  a vast people was hurled broadcast over the land  fleeing before the conquerorsno nobefore the mad lust of the conquerors these refugees swung far into siberia circling circling to the north and east and fringing the rim of the polar basin with a spray of mongol tribes  skip a few pages bill brown advised and read here and there  we havent got all night  courbertin complied  the coast people are eskimo stock merry of nature and not offensive  they call themselves the oukilion or the sea men  from them i bought dogs and food  but they are subject to the chow chuen who live in the interior and are known as the deer men the chow chuen are a fierce and savage race  when i left the coast they fell upon me took from me my goods and made me a slave  he ran over a few pages  i worked my way to a seat among the head men but i was no nearer my freedom  my wisdom was of too great value to them for me to depart    old piune was a great chief and it was decreed that i should marry his daughter ilswunga  ilswunga was a filthy creature  she would not bathe and her ways were not good    i did marry ilswunga but she was a wife to me only in name  then did she complain to her father the old piune and he was very wroth  and dissension was sown among the tribes but in the end i became mightier than ever what of my cunning and resource and ilswunga made no more complaint for i taught her games with cards which she might play by herself and other things  is that enough courbertin asked  yes that will do bill brown answered  but one moment  please state again the date of publication  1807 in warsaw  hold on baron del bishop spoke up  now that youre on the stand ive got a question or so to slap into you  he turned to the courtroom  gentlemen youve all heard somewhat of the prisoners experiences in siberia  youve caught on to the remarkable sameness between them and those published by father yakontsk nearly a hundred years ago  and you have concluded that theres been some wholesale cribbing somewhere  i propose to show you that its more than cribbing  the prisoner gave me the shake on the reindeer river in 88 fall of 88 he was at st michaels on his way to siberia  89 and 90 he was by his talk cutting up antics in siberia  91 he come back to the world working the conqueringhero graft in frisco  now lets see if the frenchman can make us wise  you were in japan he asked  courbertin who had followed the dates made a quick calculation and could but illy conceal his surprise  he looked appealingly to frona but she did not help him  yes he said finally  and you met the prisoner there  yes  what year was it  there was a general craning forward to catch the answer  1889 and it came unwillingly  now how can that be baron del asked in a wheedling tone  the prisoner was in siberia at that time  courbertin shrugged his shoulders that it was no concern of his and came off the stand  an impromptu recess was taken by the courtroom for several minutes wherein there was much whispering and shaking of heads  it is all a lie  st vincent leaned close to fronas ear but she did not hear  appearances are against me but i can explain it all  but she did not move a muscle and he was called to the stand by the chairman  she turned to her father and the tears rushed up into her eyes when he rested his hand on hers  do you care to pull out he asked after a momentary hesitation  she shook her head and st vincent began to speak  it was the same story he had told her though told now a little more fully and in nowise did it conflict with the evidence of la flitche and john  he acknowledged the washtub incident caused he explained by an act of simple courtesy on his part and by john borgs unreasoning anger  he acknowledged that bella had been killed by his own pistol but stated that the pistol had been borrowed by borg several days previously and not returned  concerning bellas accusation he could say nothing  he could not see why she should die with a lie on her lips  he had never in the slightest way incurred her displeasure so even revenge could not be advanced  it was inexplicable  as for the testimony of bishop he did not care to discuss it  it was a tissue of falsehood cunningly interwoven with truth  it was true the man had gone into alaska with him in 1888 but his version of the things which happened there was maliciously untrue  regarding the baron there was a slight mistake in the dates that was all  in questioning him  bill brown brought out one little surprise  from the prisoners story he had made a hard fight against the two mysterious men  if brown asked such were the case how can you explain away the fact that you came out of the struggle unmarked  on examination of the body of john borg many bruises and contusions were noticeable  how is it if you put up such a stiff fight that you escaped being battered  st vincent did not know though he confessed to feeling stiff and sore all over  and it did not matter anyway  he had killed neither borg nor his wife that much he did know  frona prefaced her argument to the meeting with a pithy discourse on the sacredness of human life the weaknesses and dangers of circumstantial evidence and the rights of the accused wherever doubt arose  then she plunged into the evidence stripping off the superfluous and striving to confine herself to facts  in the first place she denied that a motive for the deed had been shown  as it was the introduction of such evidence was an insult to their intelligence and she had sufficient faith in their manhood and perspicacity to know that such puerility would not sway them in the verdict they were to give  and on the other hand in dealing with the particular points at issue she denied that any intimacy had been shown to have existed between bella and st vincent and she denied further that it had been shown that any intimacy had been attempted on the part of st vincent viewed honestly the washtub incidentthe only evidence brought forwardwas a laughable little affair portraying how the simple courtesy of a gentleman might be misunderstood by a mad boor of a husband  she left it to their common sense they were not fools  they had striven to prove the prisoner badtempered  she did not need to prove anything of the sort concerning john borg  they all knew his terrible fits of anger they all knew that his temper was proverbial in the community that it had prevented him having friends and had made him many enemies  was it not very probable therefore that the masked men were two such enemies  as to what particular motive actuated these two men she could not say but it rested with them the judges to know whether in all alaska there were or were not two men whom john borg could have given cause sufficient for them to take his life  witness had testified that no traces had been found of these two men but the witness had not testified that no traces had been found of st vincent pierre la flitche or john the swede  and there was no need for them so to testify  everybody knew that no footmarks were left when st vincent ran up the trail and when he came back with la flitche and the other man  everybody knew the condition of the trail that it was a hardpacked groove in the ground on which a soft moccasin could leave no impression and that had the ice not gone down the river no traces would have been left by the murderers in passing from and to the mainland  at this juncture la flitche nodded his head in approbation and she went on  capital had been made out of the blood on st vincents hands  if they chose to examine the moccasins at that moment on the feet of mr la flitche they would also find blood  that did not argue that mr la flitche had been a party to the shedding of the blood  mr brown had drawn attention to the fact that the prisoner had not been bruised or marked in the savage encounter which had taken place she thanked him for having done so  john borgs body showed that it had been roughly used  he was a larger stronger heavier man than st vincent  if as charged st vincent had committed the murder and necessarily therefore engaged in a struggle severe enough to bruise john borg how was it that he had come out unharmed  that was a point worthy of consideration  another one was why did he run down the trail  it was inconceivable if he had committed the murder that he should without dressing or preparation for escape run towards the other cabins  it was however easily conceivable that he should take up the pursuit of the real murderers and in the darknessexhausted breathless and certainly somewhat excitedrun blindly down the trail  her summing up was a strong piece of synthesis and when she had done the meeting applauded her roundly  but she was angry and hurt for she knew the demonstration was for her sex rather than for her cause and the work she had done  bill brown somewhat of a shyster and his ear ever cocked to the crowd was not above taking advantage when opportunity offered and when it did not offer to dogmatize artfully  in this his native humor was a strong factor and when he had finished with the mysterious masked men they were as exploded sunmythswhich phrase he promptly applied to them  they could not have got off the island  the condition of the ice for the three or four hours preceding the breakup would not have permitted it  the prisoner had implicated none of the residents of the island while every one of them with the exception of the prisoner had been accounted for elsewhere  possibly the prisoner was excited when he ran down the trail into the arms of la flitche and john the swede  one should have thought however that he had grown used to such things in siberia  but that was immaterial the facts were that he was undoubtedly in an abnormal state of excitement that he was hysterically excited and that a murderer under such circumstances would take little account of where he ran  such things had happened before  many a man had butted into his own retribution  in the matter of the relations of borg bella and st vincent he made a strong appeal to the instinctive prejudices of his listeners and for the time being abandoned matteroffact reasoning for allpotent sentimental platitudes  he granted that circumstantial evidence never proved anything absolutely  it was not necessary it should  beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt was all that was required  that this had been done he went on to review the testimony  and finally he said you cant get around bellas last words  we know nothing of our own direct knowledge  weve been feeling around in the dark clutching at little things and trying to figure it all out but gentlemen he paused to search the faces of his listeners bella knew the truth  hers is no circumstantial evidence  with quick anguished breath and lifeblood ebbing from her and eyeballs glazing she spoke the truth  with dark night coming on and the deathrattle in her throat she raised herself weakly and pointed a shaking finger at the accused thus and she said him him him  st vincha him do it  with bill browns finger still boring into him st vincent struggled to his feet  his face looked old and gray and he looked about him speechlessly  funk  funk was whispered back and forth and not so softly but what he heard  he moistened his lips repeatedly and his tongue fought for articulation  it is as i have said he succeeded finally  i did not do it  before god i did not do it  he stared fixedly at john the swede waiting the while on his laggard thought i     i did not do it     i did not     i     i did not  he seemed to have become lost in some supreme meditation wherein john the swede figured largely and as frona caught him by the hand and pulled him gently down some man cried out secret ballot  but bill brown was on his feet at once  no  i say no  an open ballot  we are men and as men are not afraid to put ourselves on record  a chorus of approval greeted him and the open ballot began  man after man called upon by name spoke the one word guilty  baron courbertin came forward and whispered to frona  she nodded her head and smiled and he edged his way back taking up a position by the door  he voted not guilty when his turn came as did frona and jacob welse  pierre la flitche wavered a moment looking keenly at frona and st vincent then spoke up clear and flutelike guilty  as the chairman arose jacob welse casually walked over to the opposite side of the table and stood with his back to the stove  courbertin who had missed nothing pulled a picklekeg out from the wall and stepped upon it  the chairman cleared his throat and rapped for order  gentlemen he announced the prisoner  hands up jacob welse commanded peremptorily and a fraction of a second after him came the shrill hands up gentlemen of courbertin  front and rear they commanded the crowd with their revolvers  every hand was in the air the chairmans having gone up still grasping the mallet  there was no disturbance  each stood or sat in the same posture as when the command went forth  their eyes playing here and there among the central figures always returned to jacob welse  st vincent sat as one dumfounded  frona thrust a revolver into his hand but his limp fingers refused to close on it  come gregory she entreated  quick  corliss is waiting with the canoe  come  she shook him and he managed to grip the weapon  then she pulled and tugged as when awakening a heavy sleeper till he was on his feet but his face was livid his eyes like a somnambulists and he was afflicted as with a palsy  still holding him she took a step backward for him to come on  he ventured it with a shaking knee  there was no sound save the heavy breathing of many men  a man coughed slightly and cleared his throat  it was disquieting and all eyes centred upon him rebukingly  the man became embarrassed and shifted his weight uneasily to the other leg  then the heavy breathing settled down again  st vincent took another step but his fingers relaxed and the revolver fell with a loud noise to the floor  he made no effort to recover it frona stooped hurriedly but pierre la flitche had set his foot upon it  she looked up and saw his hands above his head and his eyes fixed absently on jacob welse  she pushed at his leg and the muscles were tense and hard giving the lie to the indifference on his face  st vincent looked down helplessly as though he could not understand  but this delay drew the attention of jacob welse and as he tried to make out the cause the chairman found his chance  without crooking his right arm swept out and down the heavy caulkingmallet leaping from his hand  it spanned the short distance and smote jacob welse below the ear  his revolver went off as he fell and john the swede grunted and clapped a hand to his thigh  simultaneous with this the baron was overcome  del bishop with hands still above his head and eyes fixed innocently before him had simply kicked the picklekeg out from under the frenchman and brought him to the floor  his bullet however sped harmlessly through the roof  la flitche seized frona in his arms  st vincent suddenly awakening sprang for the door but was tripped up by the breeds ready foot  the chairman pounded the table with his fist and concluded his broken sentence gentlemen the prisoner is found guilty as charged     chapter xxix  frona had gone at once to her fathers side but he was already recovering  courbertin was brought forward with a scratched face sprained wrist and an insubordinate tongue  to prevent discussion and to save time bill brown claimed the floor  mr chairman while we condemn the attempt on the part of jacob welse frona welse and baron courbertin to rescue the prisoner and thwart justice we cannot under the circumstances but sympathize with them there is no need that i should go further into this matter  you all know and doubtless under a like situation would have done the same and so in order that we may expeditiously finish the business i make a motion to disarm the three prisoners and let them go  the motion was carried and the two men searched for weapons  frona was saved this by giving her word that she was no longer armed  the meeting then resolved itself into a hanging committee and began to file out of the cabin  sorry i had to do it the chairman said halfapologetically halfdefiantly  jacob welse smiled  you took your chance he answered and i cant blame you  i only wish id got you though  excited voices arose from across the cabin  here you  leggo step on his fingers tim  break that grip  ouch  ow  pry his mouth open  frona saw a knot of struggling men about st vincent and ran over  he had thrown himself down on the floor and tooth and nail was fighting like a madman  tim dugan a stalwart celt had come to close quarters with him and st vincents teeth were sunk in the mans arm  smash m tim  smash m  how can i ye fule  get a pry on his mouth will ye  one moment please  the men made way for her drawing back and leaving st vincent and tim  frona knelt down by him  leave go gregory  do leave go  he looked up at her and his eyes did not seem human  he breathed stertorously and in his throat were the queer little gasping noises of one overwrought  it is i gregory  she brushed her hand soothingly across his brow dont you understand  it is i frona  do leave go  his whole body slowly relaxed and a peaceful expression grew upon his face  his jaw dropped and the mans arm was withdrawn  now listen gregory  though you are to die  but i cannot  i cannot he groaned  you said that i could trust to you that all would come well  she thought of the chance which had been given but said nothing  oh frona  frona he sobbed and buried his face in her lap  at least you can be a man  it is all that remains  come on tim dugan commanded  sorry to bother ye miss but weve got to fetch m along  drag m out you fellys  catch m by the legs blackey and you too johnson  st vincents body stiffened at the words the rational gleam went out of his eyes and his fingers closed spasmodically on fronas  she looked entreaty at the men and they hesitated  give me a minute with him she begged just a minute  he aint worth it dugan sneered after they had drawn apart  look at m  its a damned shame corroborated blackey squinting sidewise at frona whispering in st vincents ear the while her hand wandered caressingly through his hair  what she said they did not hear but she got him on his feet and led him forward  he walked as a dead man might walk and when he entered the open air gazed forth wonderingly upon the muddy sweep of the yukon the crowd had formed by the bank about a pine tree  a boy engaged in running a rope over one of the branches finished his task and slid down the trunk to the ground  he looked quickly at the palms of his hands and blew upon them and a laugh went up  a couple of wolfdogs on the outskirts bristled up to each other and bared their fangs  men encouraged them  they closed in and rolled over but were kicked aside to make room for st vincent  corliss came up the bank to frona  whats up he whispered  is it off  she tried to speak but swallowed and nodded her head  this way gregory  she touched his arm and guided him to the box beneath the rope  corliss keeping step with them looked over the crowd speculatively and felt into his jacketpocket  can i do anything he asked gnawing his under lip impatiently  whatever you say goes frona  i can stand them off  she looked at him aware of pleasure in the sight  she knew he would dare it but she knew also that it would be unfair  st vincent had had his chance and it was not right that further sacrifice should be made  no vance  it is too late  nothing can be done  at least let me try he persisted  no it is not our fault that our plan failed and    and    her eyes filled  please do not ask it of me  then let me take you away  you cannot remain here  i must she answered simply and turned to st vincent who seemed dreaming  blackey was tying the hangmans knot in the ropes end preparatory to slipping the noose over st vincents head  kiss me gregory she said her hand on his arm  he started at the touch and saw all eager eyes centred upon him and the yellow noose just shaped in the hands of the hangman  he threw up his arms as though to ward it off and cried loudly no no  let me confess  let me tell the truth then youll believe me  bill brown and the chairman shoved blackey back and the crowd gathered in  cries and protestations rose from its midst  no you dont a boys shrill voice made itself heard  im not going to go  i climbed the tree and made the rope fast and ive got a right to stay youre only a kid replied a mans voice and it aint good for you  i dont care and im not a kid  imim used to such things and anyway i climbed the tree  look at my hands  of course he can stay other voices took up the trouble  leave him alone curley you aint the whole thing  a laugh greeted this and things quieted down  silence the chairman called and then to st vincent go ahead you and dont take all day about it  give us a chance to hear the crowd broke out again  put m on the box  put m on the box  st vincent was helped up and began with eager volubility  i didnt do it but i saw it done  there werent two menonly one he did it and bella helped him  a wave of laughter drowned him out  not so fast bill brown cautioned him  kindly explain how bella helped this man kill herself  begin at the beginning  that night before he turned in borg set his burglar alarm  burglar alarm  thats what i called ita tin breadpan attached to the latch so the door couldnt open without tumbling it down  he set it every night as though he were afraid of what might happenthe very thing which did happen for that matter  on the night of the murder i awoke with the feeling that some one was moving around  the slushlamp was burning low and i saw bella at the door  borg was snoring i could hear him plainly  bella was taking down the breadpan and she exercised great care about it  then she opened the door and an indian came in softly he had no mask and i should know him if ever i see him again for a scar ran along the forehead and down over one eye  i suppose you sprang out of bed and gave the alarm  no i didnt st vincent answered with a defiant toss of the head as though he might as well get the worst over with  i just lay there and waited  what did you think  that bella was in collusion with the indian and that borg was to be murdered  it came to me at once  and you did nothing  nothing  his voice sank and his eyes dropped to frona leaning against the box beneath him and steadying it  she did not seem to be affected  bella came over to me but i closed my eyes and breathed regularly  she held the slushlamp to me but i played sleep naturally enough to fool her  then i heard a snort of sudden awakening and alarm and a cry and i looked out  the indian was hacking at borg with a knife and borg was warding off with his arms and trying to grapple him  when they did grapple bella crept up from behind and threw her arm in a stranglehold about her husbands neck  she put her knee into the small of his back and bent him backward and with the indian helping threw him to the floor  and what did you do  i watched  had you a revolver  yes  the one you previously said john borg had borrowed  yes but i watched  did john borg call for help  yes  can you give his words  he called st vincent  oh st vincent  oh my god  oh st vincent help me  he shuddered at the recollection and added it was terrible  i should say so brown grunted  and you  i watched was the dogged reply while a groan went up from the crowd  borg shook clear of them however and got on his legs  he hurled bella across the cabin with a backsweep of the arm and turned upon the indian  then they fought  the indian had dropped the knife and the sound of borgs blows was sickening  i thought he would surely beat the indian to death  that was when the furniture was smashed they rolled and snarled and struggled like wild beasts  i wondered the indians chest did not cave in under some of borgs blows  but bella got the knife and stabbed her husband repeatedly about the body  the indian had clinched with him and his arms were not free so he kicked out at her sideways  he must have broken her legs for she cried out and fell down and though she tried she never stood up again  then he went down with the indian under him across the stove  did he call any more for help  he begged me to come to him  and  i watched  he managed to get clear of the indian and staggered over to me  he was streaming blood and i could see he was very weak give me your gun he said quick give me it  he felt around blindly  then his mind seemed to clear a bit and he reached across me to the holster hanging on the wall and took the pistol  the indian came at him with the knife again but he did not try to defend himself instead he went on towards bella with the indian still hanging to him and hacking at him  the indian seemed to bother and irritate him and he shoved him away  he knelt down and turned bellas face up to the light but his own face was covered with blood and he could not see so he stopped long enough to brush the blood from his eyes  he appeared to look in order to make sure  then he put the revolver to her breast and fired  the indian went wild at this and rushed at him with the knife at the same time knocking the pistol out of his hand  it was then the shelf with the slushlamp was knocked down  they continued to fight in the darkness and there were more shots fired though i do not know by whom  i crawled out of the bunk but they struck against me in their struggles and i fell over bella  thats when the blood got on my hands  as i ran out the door more shots were fired  then i met la flitche and john and    and you know the rest  this is the truth i have told you i swear it  he looked down at frona  she was steadying the box and her face was composed  he looked out over the crowd and saw unbelief  many were laughing  why did you not tell this story at first bill brown demanded  because    because     well  because i might have helped  there was more laughter at this and bill brown turned away from him gentlemen you have heard this pipe dream  it is a wilder fairy story than his first  at the beginning of the trial we promised to show that the truth was not in him  that we succeeded your verdict is ample testimony  but that he should likewise succeed and more brilliantly we did not expect  that he has you cannot doubt  what do you think of him  lie upon lie he has given us he has been proven a chronic liar are you to believe this last and fearfully impossible lie gentlemen i can only ask that you reaffirm your judgment  and to those who may doubt his mendacitysurely there are but fewlet me state that if his story is true if he broke salt with this man john borg and lay in his blankets while murder was done if he did hear unmoved the voice of the man calling to him for help if he did lie there and watch that carnival of butchery without his manhood prompting himlet me state gentlemen i say let me state that he is none the less deserveful of hanging  we cannot make a mistake  what shall it be  death  string him up  stretch m were the cries  but the crowd suddenly turned its attention to the river and even blackey refrained from his official task  a large raft worked by a sweep at either end was slipping past the tail of splitup island close to the shore  when it was at their feet its nose was slewed into the bank and while its free end swung into the stream to make the consequent circle a snubbingrope was flung ashore and several turns taken about the tree under which st vincent stood  a cargo of moosemeat red and raw cut into quarters peeped from beneath a cool covering of spruce boughs  and because of this the two men on the raft looked up to those on the bank with pride in their eyes  tryin to make dawson with it one of them explained and the suns allfired hot  nope said his comrade in reply to a query dont care to stop and trade  its worth a dollar and a half a pound down below and were hustlin to get there  but weve got some pieces of a man we want to leave with you  he turned and pointed to a loose heap of blankets which slightly disclosed the form of a man beneath  we gathered him in this mornin bout thirty mile up the stewart i should judge  stands in need of doctorin the other man spoke up and the meats spoilin and we aint got time for nothin  beggar dont have anythin to say  dont savve the burro  looks as he might have been mixin things with a grizzly or somethinall battered and gouged injured internally from the looks of it  wherell you have him  frona standing by st vincent saw the injured man borne over the crest of the bank and through the crowd  a bronzed hand drooped down and a bronzed face showed from out the blankets  the bearers halted near them while a decision could be reached as to where he should be carried  frona felt a sudden fierce grip on her arm  look look  st vincent was leaning forward and pointing wildly at the injured man  look  that scar  the indian opened his eyes and a grin of recognition distorted his face  it is he  it is he  st vincent trembling with eagerness turned upon the crowd  i call you all to witness  that is the man who killed john borg  no laughter greeted this for there was a terrible earnestness in his manner  bill brown and the chairman tried to make the indian talk but could not  a miner from british columbia was pressed into service but his chinook made no impression  then la flitche was called  the handsome breed bent over the man and talked in gutturals which only his mothers heredity made possible  it sounded all one yet it was apparent that he was trying many tongues  but no response did he draw and he paused disheartened  as though with sudden recollection he made another attempt  at once a gleam of intelligence shot across the indians face and his larynx vibrated to similar sounds  it is the stick talk of the upper white la flitche stopped long enough to explain  then with knit brows and stumbling moments when he sought dimremembered words he plied the man with questions  to the rest it was like a pantomimethe meaningless grunts and waving arms and facial expressions of puzzlement surprise and understanding  at times a passion wrote itself on the face of the indian and a sympathy on the face of la flitche  again by look and gesture st vincent was referred to and once a sober mirthless laugh shaped the mouths of them  so  it is good la flitche said when the indians head dropped back  this man make true talk  he come from white river way up  he cannot understand  he surprised very much so many white men  he never think so many white men in the world  he die soon  his name gow  long time ago three year this man john borg go to this man gows country  he hunt he bring plenty meat to the camp wherefore white river sticks like him  gow have one squaw piskku  bimeby john borg make preparation to go way  he go to gow and he say give me your squaw  we trade  for her i give you many things  but gow say no piskku good squaw  no woman sew moccasin like she  she tan mooseskin the best and make the softest leather  he like piskku then john borg say he dont care he want piskku  then they have a skookum big fight and piskku go way with john borg  she no want to go way but she go anyway  borg call her bella and give her plenty good things but she like gow all the time  la flitche pointed to the scar which ran down the forehead and past the eye of the indian john borg he do that  long time gow pretty near die  then he get well but his head sick he dont know nobody  dont know his father his mother or anything just like a little baby  just like that  then one day quick click something snap and his head get well all at once  he know his father and mother he remember piskku he remember everything  his father say john borg go down river  then gow go down river  springtime ice very bad  he very much afraid so many white men and when he come to this place he travel by night  nobody see him tall but he see everybody  he like a cat see in the dark  somehow he come straight to john borgs cabin  he do not know how this was except that the work he had to do was good work  st vincent pressed fronas hand but she shook her fingers clear and withdrew a step  he see piskku feed the dogs and he have talk with her  that night he come and she open the door  then you know that which was done  st vincent do nothing borg kill bella  gow kill borg  borg kill gow for gow die pretty quick  borg have strong arm  gow sick inside all smashed up  gow no care piskku dead  after that he go cross ice to the land  i tell him all you

cannot walk he crawl  long time he come to stewart river  can go no more so he lay down to die  two white men find him and bring him to this place  he dont care  he die anyway  la flitche finished abruptly but nobody spoke  then he added i think gow damn good man  frona came up to jacob welse  take me away father she said  i am so tired     chapter xxx  next morning jacob welse for all of the company and his millions in mines chopped up the days supply of firewood lighted a cigar and went down the island in search of baron courbertin  frona finished the breakfast dishes hung out the robes to air and fed the dogs  then she took a worn wordsworth from her clothesbag and out by the bank settled herself comfortably in a seat formed by two uprooted pines but she did no more than open the book for her eyes strayed out and over the yukon to the eddy below the bluffs and the bend above and the tail of the spit which lay in the midst of the river  the rescue and the race were still fresh with her though there were strange lapses here and there of which she remembered little  the struggle by the fissure was immeasurable she knew not how long it lasted and the race down splitup to roubeau island was a thing of which her reason convinced her but of which she recollected nothing  the whim seized her and she followed corliss through the three days events but she tacitly avoided the figure of another man whom she would not name  something terrible was connected therewith she knew which must be faced sooner or later but she preferred to put that moment away from her  she was stiff and sore of mind as well as of body and will and action were for the time being distasteful  it was more pleasant even to dwell on tommy on tommy of the bitter tongue and craven heart and she made a note that the wife and children in toronto should not be forgotten when the northland paid its dividends to the welse  the crackle of a foot on a dead willowtwig roused her and her eyes met st vincents  you have not congratulated me upon my escape he began breezily but you must have been deadtired last night  i know i was  and you had that hard pull on the river besides  he watched her furtively trying to catch some cue as to her attitude and mood  youre a heroine thats what you are frona he began again with exuberance  and not only did you save the mailman but by the delay you wrought in the trial you saved me  if one more witness had gone on the stand that first day i should have been duly hanged before gow put in an appearance  fine chap gow  too bad hes going to die  i am glad that i could be of help she replied wondering the while what she could say  and of course i am to be congratulated  your trial is hardly a thing for congratulation she spoke up quickly looking him straight in the eyes for the moment  i am glad that it came out as it did but surely you cannot expect me to congratulate you  ooo with longdrawn inflection  so thats where it pinches  he smiled goodhumoredly and moved as though to sit down but she made no room for him and he remained standing  i can certainly explain  if there have been women  frona had been clinching her hand nervously but at the word burst out in laughter  women she queried  women she repeated  do not be ridiculous gregory  after the way you stood by me through the trial he began reproachfully i thought  oh you do not understand she said hopelessly  you do not understand  look at me gregory and see if i can make you understand your presence is painful to me  your kisses hurt me  the memory of them still burns my cheek and my lips feel unclean  and why  because of women which you may explain away  how little do you understand but shall i tell you  voices of men came to her from down the riverbank and the splashing of water  she glanced quickly and saw del bishop guiding a polingboat against the current and corliss on the bank bending to the towrope  shall i tell you why gregory st vincent she said again  tell you why your kisses have cheapened me  because you broke the faith of food and blanket  because you broke salt with a man and then watched that man fight unequally for life without lifting your hand  why i had rather you had died in defending him the memory of you would have been good  yes i had rather you had killed him yourself  at least it would have shown there was blood in your body  so this is what you would call love he began scornfully his fretting fuming devil beginning to rouse  a fairweather love truly  but lord how we men learn  i had thought you were well lessoned she retorted what of the other women  but what do you intend to do he demanded taking no notice  i am not an easy man to cross  you cannot throw me over with impunity  i shall not stand for it i warn you  you have dared do things in this country which would blacken you were they known  i have ears  i have not been asleep  you will find it no childs play to explain away things which you may declare most innocent  she looked at him with a smile which carried pity in its cold mirth and it goaded him  i am down a thing to make a jest upon a thing to pity but i promise you that i can drag you with me  my kisses have cheapened you eh then how must you have felt at happy camp on the dyea trail  as though in answer corliss swung down upon them with the towrope  frona beckoned a greeting to him  vance she said the mailcarrier has brought important news to father so important that he must go outside  he starts this afternoon with baron courbertin in la bijou will you take me down to dawson  i should like to go at once today  he    he suggested you she added shyly indicating st vincent
