160659	the doliver romance and other pieces                           tales and sketches                         by nathaniel hawthorne                           a book of autographs    we have before us a volume of autograph letters chiefly of soldiers and statesmen of the revolution and addressed to a good and brave man general palmer who himself drew his sword in the cause they are profitable reading in a quiet afternoon and in a mood withdrawn from too intimate relation with the present time so that we can glide backward some three quarters of a century and surround ourselves with the ominous sublimity of circumstances that then frowned upon the writers  to give them their full effect we should imagine that these letters have this moment been brought to town by the splashed and wayworn postrider or perhaps by an orderly dragoon who has ridden in a perilous hurry to deliver his despatches  they are magic scrolls if read in the right spirit  the roll of the drum and the fanfare of the trumpet is latent in some of them and in others an echo of the oratory that resounded in the old halls of the continental congress at philadelphia or the words may come to us as with the living utterance of one of those illustrious men speaking face to face in friendly communion  strange that the mere identity of paper and ink should be so powerful  the same thoughts might look cold and ineffectual in a printed book  human nature craves a certain materialism and clings pertinaciously to what is tangible as if that were of more importance than the spirit accidentally involved in it  and in truth the original manuscript has always something which print itself must inevitably lose  an erasure even a blot a casual irregularity of hand and all such little imperfections of mechanical execution bring us close to the writer and perhaps convey some of those subtle intimations for which language has no shape  there are several letters from john adams written in a small hasty ungraceful hand but earnest and with no unnecessary flourish  the earliest is dated at philadelphia september 26 1774 about twenty days after the first opening of the continental congress  we look at this old yellow document scribbled on half a sheet of foolscap and ask of it many questions for which words have no response  we would fain know what were their mutual impressions when all those venerable faces that have since been traced on steel or chiselled out of marble and thus made familiar to posterity first met one anothers gaze  did one spirit harmonize them in spite of the dissimilitude of manners between the north and the south which were now for the first time brought into political relations  could the virginian descendant of the cavaliers and the newenglander with his hereditary puritanismthe aristocratic southern planter and the selfmade man from massachusetts or connecticutat once feel that they were countrymen and brothers  what did john adams think of jeffersonand samuel adams of patrick henry did not north and south combine in their deference for the sage franklin so long the defender of the colonies in england and whose scientific renown was already worldwide  and was there yet any whispered prophecy any vague conjecture circulating among the delegates as to the destiny which might be in reserve for one stately man who sat for the most part silent among themwhat station he was to assume in the worlds historyand how many statues would repeat his form and countenance and successively crumble beneath his immortality  the letter before us does not answer these inquiries  its main feature is the strong expression of the uncertainty and awe that pervaded even the firm hearts of the old congress while anticipating the struggle which was to ensue  the commencement of hostilities it says is exceedingly dreaded here  it is thought that an attack upon the troops even should it prove successful would certainly involve the whole continent in a war  it is generally thought that the ministry would rejoice at a rupture in boston because it would furnish an excuse to the people at home this was the last time we suspect that john adams spoke of england thus affectionately and unite them in an opinion of the necessity of pushing hostilities against us  his next letter bears on the superscription favored by general washington  the date is june 20 1775 three days after the battle of bunker hill the news of which could not yet have arrived at philadelphia  but the war so much dreaded had begun on the quiet banks of concord river an army of twenty thousand men was beleaguering boston and here was washington journeying northward to take the command  it seems to place us in a nearer relation with the hero to find him performing the little courtesy of leaving a letter between friend and friend and to hold in our hands the very document intrusted to such a messenger  john adams says simply we send you generals washington and lee for your comfort but adds nothing in regard to the character of the commanderinchief  this letter displays much of the writers ardent temperament if he had been anywhere but in the hall of congress it would have been in the intrenchment before boston  i hope he writes a good account will be given of gage haldiman burgoyne clinton and howe before winter  such a wretch as howe with a statue in honor of his family in westminster abbey erected by the massachusetts to come over with the design to cut the throats of the massachusetts people is too much  i most sincerely coolly and devoutly wish that a lucky ball or bayonet may make a signal example of him in warning to all such unprincipled unsentimental miscreants for the future  he goes on in a strain that smacks somewhat of aristocratic feeling our camp will be an illustrious school of military virtue and will be resorted to and frequented as such by gentlemen in great numbers from the other colonies  the term gentleman has seldom been used in this sense subsequently to the revolution  another letter introduces us to two of these gentlemen messrs acquilla hall and josias carvill volunteers who are recommended as of the first families in maryland and possessing independent fortunes  after the british had been driven out of boston adams cries out fortify fortify and never let them get in again it is agreeable enough to perceive the filial affection with which john adams and the other delegates from the north regard new england and especially the good old capital of the puritans  their love of country was hardly yet so diluted as to extend over the whole thirteen colonies which were rather looked upon as allies than as composing one nation  in truth the patriotism of a citizen of the united states is a sentiment by itself of a peculiar nature and requiring a lifetime or at least the custom of many years to naturalize it among the other possessions of the heart  the collection is enriched by a letter dated cambridge august 26 1775 from washington himself  he wrote it in that housenow so venerable with his memoryin that very room where his bust now stands upon a poets table from this sheet of paper passed the hand that held the leadingstaff  nothing can be more perfectly in keeping with all other manifestations of washington than the whole visible aspect and embodiment of this letter  the manuscript is as clear as daylight the punctuation exact to a comma  there is a calm accuracy throughout which seems the production of a species of intelligence that cannot err and which if we may so speak would affect us with a more human warmth if we could conceive it capable of some slight human error  the chirography is characterized by a plain and easy grace which in the signature is somewhat elaborated and becomes a type of the personal manner of a gentleman of the old school but without detriment to the truth and clearness that distinguish the rest of the manuscript  the lines are as straight and equidistant as if ruled and from beginning to end there is no physical symptomas how should there beof a varying mood of jets of emotion or any of those fluctuating feelings that pass from the hearts into the fingers of common men  the paper itself like most of those revolutionary letters which are written on fabrics fit to endure the burden of ponderous and earnest thought is stout and of excellent quality and bears the watermark of britannia surmounted by the crown  the subject of the letter is a statement of reasons for not taking possession of point alderton a position commanding the entrance of boston harbor  after explaining the difficulties of the case arising from his want of men and munitions for the adequate defence of the lines which he already occupies washington proceeds to you sir who are a wellwisher to the cause and can reason upon the effects of such conduct i may open myself with freedom because no improper disclosures will be made of our situation  but i cannot expose my weakness to the enemy though i believe they are pretty well informed of everything that passes by telling this and that man who are daily pointing out this and that and t other place of all the motives that govern my actions notwithstanding i know what will be the consequence of not doing itnamely that i shall be accused of inattention to the public service and perhaps of want of spirit to prosecute it  but this shall have no effect upon my conduct  i will steadily as far as my judgment will assist me pursue such measures as i think conducive to the interest of the cause and rest satisfied under any obloquy that shall be thrown conscious of having discharged my duty to the best of my abilities  the above passage like every other passage that could be quoted from his pen is characteristic of washington and entirely in keeping with the calm elevation of his soul  yet how imperfect a glimpse do we obtain of him through the medium of this or any of his letters  we imagine him writing calmly with a hand that never falters his majestic face neither darkens nor gleams with any momentary ebullition of feeling or irregularity of thought and thus flows forth an expression precisely to the extent of his purpose no more no less  thus much we may conceive  but still we have not grasped the man we have caught no glimpse of his interior we have not detected his personality  it is the same with all the recorded traits of his daily life  the collection of them by different observers seems sufficiently abundant and strictly harmonizes with itself yet never brings us into intimate relationship with the hero nor makes us feel the warmth and the human throb of his heart  what can be the reason  is it that his great nature was adapted to stand in relation to his country as man stands towards man but could not individualize itself in brotherhood to an individual  there are two from franklin the earliest dated london august 8 1767 and addressed to mrs franklin at philadelphia  he was then in england as agent for the colonies in their resistance to the oppressive policy of mr grenvilles administration  the letter however makes no reference to political or other business  it contains only ten or twelve lines beginning my dear child and conveying an impression of long and venerable matrimony which has lost all its romance but retained a familiar and quiet tenderness  he speaks of making a little excursion into the country for his health mentions a larger letter despatched by another vessel alludes with homely affability to mrs stevenson sally and our dear polly desires to be remembered to all inquiring friends and signs himself your ever loving husband  in this conjugal epistle brief and unimportant as it is there are the elements that summon up the past and enable us to create anew the man his connections and circumstances  we can see the sage in his london lodgingswith his wig cast aside and replaced by a velvet cappenning this very letter and then can step across the atlantic and behold its reception by the elderly but still comely madam franklin who breaks the seal and begins to read first remembering to put on her spectacles  the seal by the way is a pompous one of armorial bearings rather symbolical of the dignity of the colonial agent and postmaster general of america than of the humble origin of the newburyport printer  the writing is in the free quick style of a man with great practice of the pen and is particularly agreeable to the reader  another letter from the same famous hand is addressed to general palmer and dated passy october 27 1779  by an indorsement on the outside it appears to have been transmitted to the united states through the medium of lafayette  franklin was now the ambassador of his country at the court of versailles enjoying an immense celebrity caressed by the french ladies and idolized alike by the fashionable and the learned who saw something sublime and philosophic even in his blue yarn stockings  still as before he writes with the homeliness and simplicity that cause a human face to look forth from the old yellow sheet of paper and in words that make our ears reecho as with the sound of his longextinct utterance  yet this brief epistle like the former has so little of tangible matter that we are ashamed to copy it  next we come to the fragment of a letter by samuel adams an autograph more utterly devoid of ornament or flourish than any other in the collection  it would not have been characteristic had his pen traced so much as a hairline in tribute to grace beauty or the elaborateness of manner for this earnesthearted man had been produced out of the past elements of his native land a real puritan with the religion of his forefathers and likewise with their principles of government taking the aspect of revolutionary politics  at heart samuel adams was never so much a citizen of the united states as he was a newenglander and a son of the old bay province  the following passage has much of the man in it i heartily congratulate you he writes from philadelphia after the british have left boston upon the sudden and important change in our affairs in the removal of the barbarians from the capital  we owe our grateful acknowledgments to him who is as he is frequently styled in sacred writ the lord of hosts we have not yet been informed with certainty what course the enemy have steered  i hope we shall be on our guard against future attempts  will not care be taken to fortify the harbor and thereby prevent the entrance of shipsofwar hereafter  from hancock we have only the envelope of a document on public service directed to the hon the assembly or council of safety of new hampshire and with the autograph affixed that stands out so prominently in the declaration of independence  as seen in the engraving of that instrument the signature looks precisely what we should expect and desire in the handwriting of a princely merchant whose penmanship had been practised in the ledger which he is represented as holding in copleys brilliant picture but to whom his native ability and the circumstances and customs of his country had given a place among its rulers  but on the coarse and dingy paper before us the effect is very much inferior the direction all except the signature is a scrawl large and heavy but not forcible and even the name itself while almost identical in its strokes with that of the declaration has a strangely different and more vulgar aspect  perhaps it is all right and typical of the truth  if we may trust tradition and unpublished letters and a few witnesses in print there was quite as much difference between the actual man and his historical aspect as between the manuscript signature and the engraved one  one of his associates both in political life and permanent renown is said to have characterized him as a man without a head or heart  we of an after generation should hardly be entitled on whatever evidence to assume such ungracious liberty with a name that has occupied a lofty position until it has grown almost sacred and which is associated with memories more sacred than itself and has thus become a valuable reality to our countrymen by the aged reverence that clusters round about it nevertheless it may be no impiety to regard hancock not precisely as a real personage but as a majestic figure useful and necessary in its way but producing its effect far more by an ornamental outside than by any intrinsic force or virtue  the page of all history would be half unpeopled if all such characters were banished from it  from general warren we have a letter dated january 14 1775 only a few months before he attested the sincerity of his patriotism in his own blood on bunker hill  his handwriting has many ungraceful flourishes all the small ds spout upward in parabolic curves and descend at a considerable distance  his pen seems to have had nothing but hairlines in it and the whole letter though perfectly legible has a look of thin and unpleasant irregularity  the subject is a plan for securing to the colonial party the services of colonel gridley the engineer by an appeal to his private interests  though writing to general palmer an intimate friend warren signs himself most ceremoniously your obedient servant  indeed these stately formulas in winding up a letter were scarcely laid aside whatever might be the familiarity of intercourse husband and wife were occasionally on paper at least the obedient servants of one another and not improbably among wellbred people there was a corresponding ceremonial of bows and courtesies even in the deepest interior of domestic life  with all the reality that filled mens hearts and which has stamped its impress on so many of these letters it was a far more formal age than the present  it may be remarked that warren was almost the only man eminently distinguished in the intellectual phase of the revolution previous to the breaking out of the war who actually uplifted his arm to do battle the legislative patriots were a distinct class from the patriots of the camp and never laid aside the gown for the sword  it was very different in the great civil war of england where the leading minds of the age when argument had done its office or left it undone put on their steel breastplates and appeared as leaders in the field  educated young men members of the old colonial familiesgentlemen as john adams terms themseem not to have sought employment in the revolutionary army in such numbers as night have been expected respectable as the officers generally were and great as were the abilities sometimes elicited the intellect and cultivation of the country was inadequately represented in them as a body  turning another page we find the frank of a letter from henry laurens president of congresshim whose destiny it was like so many noblemen of old to pass beneath the traitors gate of the tower of londonhim whose chivalrous son sacrificed as brilliant a future as any young american could have looked forward to in an obscure skirmish likewise we have the address of a letter to messrs leroy and bayard in the handwriting of jefferson too slender a material to serve as a talisman for summoning up the writer a most unsatisfactory fragment affecting us like a glimpse of the retreating form of the sage of monticello turning the distant corner of a street  there is a scrap from robert morris the financier a letter or two from judge jay and one from general lincoln written apparently on the gallop but without any of those characteristic sparks that sometimes fly out in a hurry when all the leisure in the world would fail to elicit them lincoln was the type of a new england soldier a man of fair abilities not especially of a warlike cast without much chivalry but faithful and bold and carrying a kind of decency and restraint into the wild and ruthless business of arms  from good old baron steuben we find not a manuscript essay on the method of arranging a battle but a commercial draft in a small neat hand as plain as print elegant without flourish except a very complicated one on the signature  on the whole the specimen is sufficiently characteristic as well of the barons soldierlike and german simplicity as of the polish of the great fredericks aidedecamp a man of courts and of the world  how singular and picturesque an effect is produced in the array of our revolutionary army by the intermingling of these titled personages from the continent of europe with feudal associations clinging about themsteuben de kalb pulaski lafayettethe german veteran who had written from one famous battlefield to another for thirty years and the young french noble who had come hither though yet unconscious of his high office to light the torch that should set fire to the antiquated trumpery of his native institutions  among these autographs there is one from lafayette written long after our revolution but while that of his own country was in full progress  the note is merely as follows enclosed you will find my dear sir two tickets for the sittings of this day one part of the debate will be on the honors of the pantheon agreeably to what has been decreed by the constitutional assembly  it is a pleasant and comfortable thought that we have no such classic folly as is here indicated to lay to the charge of our revolutionary fathers  both in their acts and in the drapery of those acts they were true to their several and simple selves and thus left nothing behind them for a fastidious taste to sneer at  but it must be considered that our revolution did not like that of france go so deep as to disturb the commonsense of the country  general schuyler writes a letter under date of february 22 1780 relating not to military affairs from which the prejudices of his countrymen had almost disconnected him but to the salt springs of onondaga  the expression is peculiarly direct and the hand that of a man of business free and flowing  the uncertainty the vague hearsay evidence respecting these springs then gushing into dim daylight beneath the shadow of a remote wilderness is such as might now be quoted in reference to the quality of the water that supplies the fountains of the nile  the following sentence shows us an indian woman and her son practising their simple process in the manufacture of salt at a fire of windstrewn boughs the flame of which gleams duskily through the arches of the forest from a variety of information i find the smallest quantity made by a squaw with the assistance of one boy with a kettle of about ten gallons capacity is half a bushel per day the greatest with the same kettle about two bushels  it is particularly interesting to find out anything as to the embryo yet stationary arts of life among the red people their manufactures their agriculture their domestic labors  it is partly the lack of this knowledgethe possession of which would establish a ground of sympathy on the part of civilized menthat makes the indian race so shadowlike and unreal to our conception  we could not select a greater contrast to the upright and unselfish patriot whom we have just spoken of than the traitor arnold from whom there is a brief note dated crown point january 19 1775 addressed to an officer under his command  the three lines of which it consists can prove bad spelling erroneous grammar and misplaced and superfluous punctuation but with all this complication of iniquity the ruffian general contrives to express his meaning as briefly and clearly as if the rules of correct composition had been ever so scrupulously observed this autograph impressed with the foulest name in our history has somewhat of the interest that would attach to a document on which a fienddevoted wretch had signed away his salvation  but there was not substance enough in the mana mere cross between the bulldog and the foxto justify much feeling of any sort about him personally  the interest such as it is attaches but little to the man and far more to the circumstances amid which he acted rendering the villainy almost sublime which exercised in petty affairs would only have been vulgar  we turn another leaf and find a memorial of hamilton  it is but a letter of introduction addressed to governor jay in favor of mr davies of kentucky but it gives an impression of high breeding and courtesy as little to be mistaken as if we could see the writers manner and hear his cultivated accents while personally making one gentleman known to another  there is likewise a rare vigor of expression and pregnancy of meaning such as only a man of habitual energy of thought could have conveyed into so commonplace a thing as an introductory letter  this autograph is a graceful one with an easy and picturesque flourish beneath the signature symbolical of a courteous bow at the conclusion of the social ceremony so admirably performed hamilton might well be the leader and idol of the federalists for he was preeminent in all the high qualities that characterized the great men of that party and which should make even a democrat feel proud that his country had produced such a noble old band of aristocrats and he shared all the distrust of the people which so inevitably and so righteously brought about their ruin  with his autograph we associate that of another federalist his friend in life a man far narrower than hamilton but endowed with a native vigor that caused many partisans to grapple to him for support upright sternly inflexible and of a simplicity of manner that might have befitted the sturdiest republican among us  in our boyhood we used to see a thin severe figure of an ancient mail timeworn but apparently indestructible moving with a step of vigorous decay along the street and knew him as old tim pickering  side by side too with the autograph of hamilton we would place one from the hand that shed his blood  it is a few lines of aaron burr written in 1823 when all his ambitious schemes whatever they once were had been so long shattered that even the fragments had crumbled away leaving him to exert his withered energies on petty law cases to one of which the present note refers  the hand is a little tremulous with age yet small and fastidiously elegant as became a man who was in the habit of writing billetdoux on scented notepaper as well as documents of war and state  this is to us a deeply interesting autograph  remembering what has been said of the power of burrs personal influence his art to tempt men his might to subdue them and the fascination that enabled him though cold at heart to win the love of woman we gaze at this production of his pen as into his own inscrutable eyes seeking for the mystery of his nature  how singular that a character imperfect ruined blasted as this mans was excites a stronger interest than if it had reached the highest earthly perfection of which its original elements would admit  it is by the diabolical part of burrs character that he produces his effect on the imagination  had he been a better man we doubt after all whether the present age would not already have suffered him to wax dusty and fade out of sight among the mere respectable mediocrities of his own epoch but certainly he was a strange wild offshoot to have sprung from the united stock of those two singular christians president burr of princeton college and jonathan edwards  omitting many we have come almost to the end of these memorials of historical men  we observe one other autograph of a distinguished soldier of the revolution henry knox but written in 1791 when he was secretary of war  in its physical aspect it is well worthy to be a soldiers letter  the hand is large round and legible at a glance the lines far apart and accurately equidistant and the whole affair looks not unlike a company of regular troops in marching order  the signature has a pointlike firmness and simplicity  it is a curious observation sustained by these autographs though we know not how generally correct that southern gentlemen are more addicted to a flourish of the pen beneath their names than those of the north  and now we come to the men of a later generation whose active life reaches almost within the verge of present affairs people of dignity no doubt but whose characters have not acquired either from time or circumstances the interest that can make their autographs valuable to any but the collector  those whom we have hitherto noticed were the men of an heroic age  they are departed and now so utterly departed as not even to touch upon the passing generation through the medium of persons still in life who can claim to have known them familiarly their letters therefore come to us like material things out of the hands of mighty shadows long historical and traditionary and fit companions for the sages and warriors of a thousand years ago  in spite of the proverb it is not in a single day or in a very few years that a man can be reckoned as dead as julius caesar  we feel little interest in scraps from the pens of old gentlemen ambassadors governors senators heads of departments even presidents though they were who lived lives of praiseworthy respectability and whose powdered heads and black kneebreeches have but just vanished out of the drawingroom  still less do we value the blotted paper of those whose reputations are dusty not with oblivious time but with present political turmoil and newspaper vogue  really great men however seem as to their effect on the imagination to take their place amongst past worthies even while walking in the very sunshine that illuminates the autumnal day in which we write  we look not without curiosity at the small neat hand of henry clay who as he remarks with his habitual deference to the wishes of the fair responds to a young ladys request for his seal and we dwell longer over the tornoff conclusion of a note from mr calhoun whose words are strangely dashed off without letters and whose name were it less illustrious would be unrecognizable in his own autograph  but of all hands that can still grasp a pen we know not the one belonging to a soldier or a statesman which could interest us more than the hand that wrote the following  sir your note of the 6th inst is received  i hasten to answer that there was no man in the station of colonel by the name of j t smith under my command at the battle of new orleans and am respectfully  yours  andrew jackson oct  19th 1833   the old general we suspect has been insnared by a pardonable little stratagem on the part of the autograph collector  the battle of new orleans would hardly have been won without better aid than this problematical colonel j t smith  intermixed with and appended to these historical autographs there are a few literary ones  timothy dwightthe old timotheus who sang the conquest of cancan instead of choosing a more popular subject in the british conquest of canadais of eldest date  colonel trumbull whose hand at various epochs of his life was familiar with sword pen and pencil contributes two letters which lack the picturesqueness of execution that should distinguish the chirography of an artist  the value of trumbulls pictures is of the same nature with that of daguerreotypes depending not upon the ideal but the actual  the beautiful signature of washington irving appears as the indorsement of a draft dated in 1814 when if we may take this document as evidence his individuality seems to have been merged into the firm of p e irving  co  never was anything less mercantile than this autograph though as legible as the writing of a bankclerk  without apparently aiming at artistic beauty it has all the sketch book in it  we find the signature and seal of pierpont the latter stamped with the poets almost living countenance  what a pleasant device for a seal is ones own face which he may thus multiply at pleasure and send letters to his friendsthe head without and the heart within  there are a few lines in the schoolgirl hand of margaret davidson at nine years old and a scrap of a letter from washington allston a gentle and delicate autograph in which we catch a glimpse of thanks to his correspondent for the loan of a volume of poetry  nothing remains save a letter from noah webster whose early toils were manifested in a spellingbook and those of his later age in a ponderous dictionary  under date of february 10 1843 he writes in a sturdy awkward hand very fit for a lexicographer an epistle of old mans reminiscences from which we extract the following anecdote of washington presenting the patriot in a festive light  when i was travelling to the south in the year 1783 i called on general washington at mount vernon  at dinner the last course of dishes was a species of pancakes which were handed round to each guest accompanied with a bowl of sugar and another of molasses for seasoning them that each guest might suit himself  when the dish came to me i pushed by me the bowl of molasses observing to the gentlemen present that i had enough of that in my own country  the general burst out with a loud laugh a thing very unusual with him  ah said he there is nothing in that story about your eating molasses in new england  there was a gentleman from maryland at the table and the general immediately told a story stating that during the revolution a hogshead of molasses was stove in in west chester by the oversetting of a wagon and a body of maryland troops being near the soldiers ran hastily and saved all they could by filling their hats or caps with molasses  there are said to be temperaments endowed with sympathies so exquisite that by merely handling an autograph they can detect the writers character with unerring accuracy and read his inmost heart as easily as a lessgifted eye would peruse the written page  our faith in this power be it a spiritual one or only a refinement of the physical nature is not unlimited in spite of evidence  god has imparted to the human soul a marvellous strength in guarding its secrets and he keeps at least the deepest and most inward record for his own perusal  but if there be such sympathies as we have alluded to in how many instances would history be put to the blush by a volume of autograph letters like this which we now close
