70337174	poems by oscar wilde     poem  helas    to drift with every passion till my soul is a stringed lute on which all winds can play is it for this that i have given away mine ancient wisdom and austere control methinks my life is a twicewritten scroll scrawled over on some boyish holiday with idle songs for pipe and virelay which do but mar the secret of the whole surely there was a time i might have trod the sunlit heights and from lifes dissonance struck one clear chord to reach the ears of god is that time dead lo with a little rod i did but touch the honey of romance and must i lose a souls inheritance    poem  sonnet to liberty    not that i love thy children whose dull eyes see nothing save their own unlovely woe whose minds know nothing nothing care to know but that the roar of thy democracies thy reigns of terror thy great anarchies mirror my wildest passions like the sea and give my rage a brother  liberty for this sake only do thy dissonant cries delight my discreet soul else might all kings by bloody knout or treacherous cannonades rob nations of their rights inviolate and i remain unmovedand yet and yet these christs that die upon the barricades god knows it i am with them in some things    poem  ave imperatrix    set in this stormy northern sea queen of these restless fields of tide england what shall men say of thee before whose feet the worlds divide  the earth a brittle globe of glass lies in the hollow of thy hand and through its heart of crystal pass like shadows through a twilight land  the spears of crimsonsuited war the long whitecrested waves of fight and all the deadly fires which are the torches of the lords of night  the yellow leopards strained and lean the treacherous russian knows so well with gaping blackened jaws are seen leap through the hail of screaming shell  the strong sealion of englands wars hath left his sapphire cave of sea to battle with the storm that mars the stars of englands chivalry  the brazenthroated clarion blows across the pathans reedy fen and the high steeps of indian snows shake to the tread of armed men  and many an afghan chief who lies beneath his cool pomegranatetrees clutches his sword in fierce surmise when on the mountainside he sees  the fleetfoot marri scout who comes to tell how he hath heard afar the measured roll of english drums beat at the gates of kandahar  for southern wind and east wind meet where girt and crowned by sword and fire england with bare and bloody feet climbs the steep road of wide empire  o lonely himalayan height grey pillar of the indian sky where sawst thou last in clanging flight our winged dogs of victory  the almondgroves of samarcand bokhara where red lilies blow and oxus by whose yellow sand the grave whiteturbaned merchants go  and on from thence to ispahan the gilded garden of the sun whence the long dusty caravan brings cedar wood and vermilion  and that dread city of cabool set at the mountains scarped feet whose marble tanks are ever full with water for the noonday heat  where through the narrow straight bazaar a little maid circassian is led a present from the czar unto some old and bearded khan  here have our wild wareagles flown and flapped wide wings in fiery fight but the sad dove that sits alone in englandshe hath no delight  in vain the laughing girl will lean to greet her love with lovelit eyes down in some treacherous black ravine clutching his flag the dead boy lies  and many a moon and sun will see the lingering wistful children wait to climb upon their fathers knee and in each house made desolate  pale women who have lost their lord will kiss the relics of the slain some tarnished epaulettesome sword poor toys to soothe such anguished pain  for not in quiet english fields are these our brothers lain to rest where we might deck their broken shields with all the flowers the dead love best  for some are by the delhi walls and many in the afghan land and many where the ganges falls through seven mouths of shifting sand  and some in russian waters lie and others in the seas which are the portals to the east or by the windswept heights of trafalgar  o wandering graves  o restless sleep o silence of the sunless day o still ravine  o stormy deep give up your prey  give up your prey  and thou whose wounds are never healed whose weary race is never won o cromwells england must thou yield for every inch of ground a son  go crown with thorns thy goldcrowned head change thy glad song to song of pain wind and wild wave have got thy dead and will not yield them back again  wave and wild wind and foreign shore possess the flower of english land lips that thy lips shall kiss no more hands that shall never clasp thy hand  what profit now that we have bound the whole round world with nets of gold if hidden in our heart is found the care that groweth never old  what profit that our galleys ride pineforestlike on every main ruin and wreck are at our side grim warders of the house of pain  where are the brave the strong the fleet where is our english chivalry wild grasses are their burialsheet and sobbing waves their threnody  o loved ones lying far away what word of love can dead lips send o wasted dust  o senseless clay is this the end is this the end  peace peace we wrong the noble dead to vex their solemn slumber so though childless and with thorncrowned head up the steep road must england go  yet when this fiery web is spun her watchmen shall descry from far the young republic like a sun rise from these crimson seas of war    poem  to milton    milton  i think thy spirit hath passed away from these white cliffs and highembattled towers this gorgeous fierycoloured world of ours seems fallen into ashes dull and grey and the age changed unto a mimic play wherein we waste our else toocrowded hours for all our pomp and pageantry and powers we are but fit to delve the common clay seeing this little isle on which we stand this england this sealion of the sea by ignorant demagogues is held in fee who love her not  dear god is this the land which bare a triple empire in her hand when cromwell spake the word democracy    poem  louis napoleon    eagle of austerlitz where were thy wings when far away upon a barbarous strand in fight unequal by an obscure hand fell the last scion of thy brood of kings  poor boy thou shalt not flaunt thy cloak of red or ride in state through paris in the van of thy returning legions but instead thy mother france free and republican  shall on thy dead and crownless forehead place the better laurels of a soldiers crown that not dishonoured should thy soul go down to tell the mighty sire of thy race  that france hath kissed the mouth of liberty and found it sweeter than his honied bees and that the giant wave democracy breaks on the shores where kings lay couched at ease    poem  on the massacre of the christians in bulgaria    christ dost thou live indeed or are thy bones still straitened in their rockhewn sepulchre and was thy rising only dreamed by her whose love of thee for all her sin atones for here the air is horrid with mens groans the priests who call upon thy name are slain dost thou not hear the bitter wail of pain from those whose children lie upon the stones come down o son of god incestuous gloom curtains the land and through the starless night over thy cross a crescent moon i see if thou in very truth didst burst the tomb come down o son of man and show thy might lest mahomet be crowned instead of thee    poem  quantum mutata    there was a time in europe long ago when no man died for freedom anywhere but englands lion leaping from its lair laid hands on the oppressor it was so while england could a great republic show witness the men of piedmont chiefest care of cromwell when with impotent despair the pontiff in his painted portico trembled before our stern ambassadors how comes it then that from such high estate we have thus fallen save that luxury with barren merchandise piles up the gate where noble thoughts and deeds should enter by else might we still be miltons heritors    poem  libertatis sacra fames    albeit nurtured in democracy and liking best that state republican where every man is kinglike and no man is crowned above his fellows yet i see spite of this modern fret for liberty better the rule of one whom all obey than to let clamorous demagogues betray our freedom with the kiss of anarchy wherefore i love them not whose hands profane plant the red flag upon the piledup street for no right cause beneath whose ignorant reign arts culture reverence honour all things fade save treason and the dagger of her trade or murder with his silent bloody feet    poem  theoretikos    this mighty empire hath but feet of clay of all its ancient chivalry and might our little island is forsaken quite some enemy hath stolen its crown of bay and from its hills that voice hath passed away which spake of freedom  o come out of it come out of it my soul thou art not fit for this vile traffichouse where day by day wisdom and reverence are sold at mart and the rude people rage with ignorant cries against an heritage of centuries it mars my calm  wherefore in dreams of art and loftiest culture i would stand apart neither for god nor for his enemies    poem  the garden of eros    it is full summer now the heart of june not yet the sunburnt reapers are astir upon the upland meadow where too soon rich autumn time the seasons usurer will lend his hoarded gold to all the trees and see his treasure scattered by the wild and spendthrift breeze  too soon indeed yet here the daffodil that lovechild of the spring has lingered on to vex the rose with jealousy and still the harebell spreads her azure pavilion and like a strayed and wandering reveller abandoned of its brothers whom long since junes messenger  the misselthrush has frighted from the glade one pale narcissus loiters fearfully close to a shadowy nook where half afraid of their own loveliness some violets lie that will not look the gold sun in the face for fear of too much splendourah methinks it is a place  which should be trodden by persephone when wearied of the flowerless fields of dis or danced on by the lads of arcady the hidden secret of eternal bliss known to the grecian here a man might find ah you and i may find it now if love and sleep be kind  there are the flowers which mourning herakles strewed on the tomb of hylas columbine its white doves all aflutter where the breeze kissed them too harshly the small celandine that yellowkirtled chorister of eve and lilac ladyssmockbut let them bloom alone and leave  yon spired hollyhock redcrocketed to sway its silent chimes else must the bee its little bellringer go seek instead some other pleasaunce the anemone that weeps at daybreak like a silly girl before her love and hardly lets the butterflies unfurl  their painted wings beside itbid it pine in pale virginity the winter snow will suit it better than those lips of thine whose fires would but scorch it rather go and pluck that amorous flower which blooms alone fed by the pander wind with dust of kisses not its own  the trumpetmouths of red convolvulus so dear to maidens creamy meadowsweet whiter than junos throat and odorous as all arabia hyacinths the feet of huntress dian would be loth to mar for any dappled fawnpluck these and those fond flowers which are  fairer than what queen venus trod upon beneath the pines of ida eucharis that morning star which does not dread the sun and budding marjoram which but to kiss would sweeten cytheraeas lips and make adonis jealousthese for thy headand for thy girdle take  yon curving spray of purple clematis whose gorgeous dye outflames the tyrian king and foxgloves with their nodding chalices but that one narciss which the startled spring let from her kirtle fall when first she heard in her own woods the wild tempestuous song of summers bird  ah leave it for a subtle memory of those sweet tremulous days of rain and sun when april laughed between her tears to see the early primrose with shy footsteps run from the gnarled oaktree roots till all the wold spite of its brown and trampled leaves grew bright with shimmering gold  nay pluck it too it is not half so sweet as thou thyself my souls idolatry and when thou art awearied at thy feet shall oxlips weave their brightest tapestry for thee the woodbine shall forget its pride and veil its tangled whorls and thou shalt walk on daisies pied  and i will cut a reed by yonder spring and make the woodgods jealous and old pan wonder what young intruder dares to sing in these still haunts where never foot of man should tread at evening lest he chance to spy the marble limbs of artemis and all her company  and i will tell thee why the jacinth wears such dread embroidery of dolorous moan and why the hapless nightingale forbears to sing her song at noon but weeps alone when the fleet swallow sleeps and rich men feast and why the laurel trembles when she sees the lightening east  and i will sing how sad proserpina unto a grave and gloomy lord was wed and lure the silverbreasted helena back from the lotus meadows of the dead so shalt thou see that awful loveliness for which two mighty hosts met fearfully in wars abyss  and then ill pipe to thee that grecian tale how cynthia loves the lad endymion and hidden in a grey and misty veil hies to the cliffs of latmos once the sun leaps from his ocean bed in fruitless chase of those pale flying feet which fade away in his embrace  and if my flute can breathe sweet melody we may behold her face who long ago dwelt among men by the aegean sea and whose sad house with pillaged portico and friezeless wall and columns toppled down looms oer the ruins of that fair and violet cinctured town  spirit of beauty tarry still awhile they are not dead thine ancient votaries some few there are to whom thy radiant smile is better than a thousand victories though all the nobly slain of waterloo rise up in wrath against them tarry still there are a few  who for thy sake would give their manlihood and consecrate their being i at least have done so made thy lips my daily food and in thy temples found a goodlier feast than this starved age can give me spite of all its newfound creeds so sceptical and so dogmatical  here not cephissos not ilissos flows the woods of white colonos are not here on our bleak hills the olive never blows no simple priest conducts his lowing steer up the steep marble way nor through the town do laughing maidens bear to thee the crocusflowered gown  yet tarry for the boy who loved thee best whose very name should be a memory to make thee linger sleeps in silent rest beneath the roman walls and melody still mourns her sweetest lyre none can play the lute of adonais  with his lips song passed away  nay when keats died the muses still had left one silver voice to sing his threnody but ah too soon of it we were bereft when on that riven night and stormy sea panthea claimed her singer as her own and slew the mouth that praised her since which time we walk alone  save for that fiery heart that morning star of rearisen england whose clear eye saw from our tottering throne and waste of war the grand greek limbs of young democracy rise mightily like hesperus and bring the great republic him at least thy love hath taught to sing  and he hath been with thee at thessaly and seen white atalanta fleet of foot in passionless and fierce virginity hunting the tusked boar his honied lute hath pierced the cavern of the hollow hill and venus laughs to know one knee will bow before her still  and he hath kissed the lips of proserpine and sung the galilaeans requiem that wounded forehead dashed with blood and wine he hath discrowned the ancient gods in him have found their last most ardent worshipper and the new sign grows grey and dim before its conqueror  spirit of beauty tarry with us still it is not quenched the torch of poesy the star that shook above the eastern hill holds unassailed its argent armoury from all the gathering gloom and fretful fight o tarry with us still for through the long and common night  morris our sweet and simple chaucers child dear heritor of spensers tuneful reed with soft and sylvan pipe has oft beguiled the weary soul of man in troublous need and from the far and flowerless fields of ice has brought fair flowers to make an earthly paradise  we know them all gudrun the strong mens bride aslaug and olafson we know them all how giant grettir fought and sigurd died and what enchantment held the king in thrall when lonely brynhild wrestled with the powers that war against all passion ah how oft through summer hours  long listless summer hours when the noon being enamoured of a damask rose forgets to journey westward till the moon the pale usurper of its tribute grows from a thin sickle to a silver shield and chides its loitering carhow oft in some cool grassy field  far from the cricketground and noisy eight at bagley where the rustling bluebells come almost before the blackbird finds a mate and overstay the swallow and the hum of many murmuring bees flits through the leaves have i lain poring on the dreamy tales his fancy weaves  and through their unreal woes and mimic pain wept for myself and so was purified and in their simple mirth grew glad again for as i sailed upon that pictured tide the strength and splendour of the storm was mine without the storms red ruin for the singer is divine  the little laugh of water falling down is not so musical the clammy gold close hoarded in the tiny waxen town has less of sweetness in it and the old halfwithered reeds that waved in arcady touched by his lips break forth again to fresher harmony  spirit of beauty tarry yet awhile although the cheating merchants of the mart with iron roads profane our lovely isle and break on whirling wheels the limbs of art ay though the crowded factories beget the blindworm ignorance that slays the soul o tarry yet  for one at least there ishe bears his name from dante and the seraph gabriel whose double laurels burn with deathless flame to light thine altar he too loves thee well who saw old merlin lured in viviens snare and the white feet of angels coming down the golden stair  loves thee so well that all the world for him a gorgeouscoloured vestiture must wear and sorrow take a purple diadem or else be no more sorrow and despair gild its own thorns and pain like adon be even in anguish beautifulsuch is the empery  which painters hold and such the heritage this gentle solemn spirit doth possess being a better mirror of his age in all his pity love and weariness than those who can but copy common things and leave the soul unpainted with its mighty questionings  but they are few and all romance has flown and men can prophesy about the sun and lecture on his arrowshow alone through a waste void the soulless atoms run how from each tree its weeping nymph has fled and that no more mid english reeds a naiad shows her head  methinks these new actaeons boast too soon that they have spied on beauty what if we have analysed the rainbow robbed the moon of her most ancient chastest mystery shall i the last endymion lose all hope because rude eyes peer at my mistress through a telescope  what profit if this scientific age burst through our gates with all its retinue of modern miracles  can it assuage one lovers breaking heart what can it do to make one life more beautiful one day more godlike in its period but now the age of clay  returns in horrid cycle and the earth hath borne again a noisy progeny of ignorant titans whose ungodly birth hurls them against the august hierarchy which sat upon olympus to the dust they have appealed and to that barren arbiter they must  repair for judgment let them if they can from natural warfare and insensate chance create the new ideal rule for man methinks that was not my inheritance for i was nurtured otherwise my soul passes from higher heights of life to a more supreme goal  lo while we spake the earth did turn away her visage from the god and hecates boat rose silverladen till the jealous day blew all its torches out  i did not note the waning hours to young endymions times palsied fingers count in vain his rosary of suns  mark how the yellow iris wearily leans back its throat as though it would be kissed by its false chamberer the dragonfly who like a blue vein on a girls white wrist sleeps on that snowy primrose of the night which gins to flush with crimson shame and die beneath the light  come let us go against the pallid shield of the wan sky the almond blossoms gleam the corncrake nested in the unmown field answers its mate across the misty stream on fitful wing the startled curlews fly and in his sedgy bed the lark for joy that day is nigh  scatters the pearled dew from off the grass in tremulous ecstasy to greet the sun who soon in gilded panoply will pass forth from yon orangecurtained pavilion hung in the burning east  see the red rim oertops the expectant hills it is the god for love of him  already the shrill lark is out of sight flooding with waves of song this silent dell ah there is something more in that birds flight than could be tested in a crucible but the air freshens let us go why soon the woodmen will be here how we have lived this night of june    poem  requiescat    tread lightly she is near under the snow speak gently she can hear the daisies grow  all her bright golden hair tarnished with rust she that was young and fair fallen to dust  lilylike white as snow she hardly knew she was a woman so sweetly she grew  coffinboard heavy stone lie on her breast i vex my heart alone she is at rest  peace peace she cannot hear lyre or sonnet all my lifes buried here heap earth upon it  avignon    poem  sonnet on approaching italy    i reached the alps  the soul within me burned italia my italia at thy name and when from out the mountains heart i came and saw the land for which my life had yearned i laughed as one who some great prize had earned and musing on the marvel of thy fame i watched the day till marked with wounds of flame the turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned the pinetrees waved as waves a womans hair and in the orchards every twining spray was breaking into flakes of blossoming foam but when i knew that far away at rome in evil bonds a second peter lay i wept to see the land so very fair  turin    poem  san miniato    see i have climbed the mountain side up to this holy house of god where once that angelpainter trod who saw the heavens opened wide  and throned upon the crescent moon the virginal white queen of grace mary could i but see thy face death could not come at all too soon  o crowned by god with thorns and pain mother of christ  o mystic wife my heart is weary of this life and oversad to sing again  o crowned by god with love and flame o crowned by christ the holy one o listen ere the searching sun show to the world my sin and shame    poem  ave maria gratia plena    was this his coming  i had hoped to see a scene of wondrous glory as was told of some great god who in a rain of gold broke open bars and fell on danae or a dread vision as when semele sickening for love and unappeased desire prayed to see gods clear body and the fire caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly with such glad dreams i sought this holy place and now with wondering eyes and heart i stand before this supreme mystery of love some kneeling girl with passionless pale face an angel with a lily in his hand and over both the white wings of a dove  florence    poem  italia    italia thou art fallen though with sheen of battlespears thy clamorous armies stride from the north alps to the sicilian tide ay fallen though the nations hail thee queen because rich gold in every town is seen and on thy sapphirelake in tossing pride of windfilled vans thy myriad galleys ride beneath one flag of red and white and green o fair and strong  o strong and fair in vain look southward where romes desecrated town lies mourning for her godanointed king look heavenward shall god allow this thing nay but some flamegirt raphael shall come down and smite the spoiler with the sword of pain  venice    poem  holy week at genoa    i wandered through scogliettos far retreat the oranges on each oerhanging spray burned as bright lamps of gold to shame the day some startled bird with fluttering wings and fleet made snow of all the blossoms at my feet like silver moons the pale narcissi lay and the curved waves that streaked the great green bay laughed i the sun and life seemed very sweet outside the young boypriest passed singing clear jesus the son of mary has been slain o come and fill his sepulchre with flowers ah god  ah god those dear hellenic hours had drowned all memory of thy bitter pain the cross the crown the soldiers and the spear    poem  rome unvisited    i   the corn has turned from grey to red since first my spirit wandered forth from the drear cities of the north and to italias mountains fled  and here i set my face towards home for all my pilgrimage is done although methinks yon bloodred sun marshals the way to holy rome  o blessed lady who dost hold upon the seven hills thy reign o mother without blot or stain crowned with bright crowns of triple gold  o roma roma at thy feet i lay this barren gift of song for ah the way is steep and long that leads unto thy sacred street   ii   and yet what joy it were for me to turn my feet unto the south and journeying towards the tiber mouth to kneel again at fiesole  and wandering through the tangled pines that break the gold of arnos stream to see the purple mist and gleam of morning on the apennines  by many a vineyardhidden home orchard and olivegarden grey till from the drear campagnas way the seven hills bear up the dome   iii   a pilgrim from the northern seas what joy for me to seek alone the wondrous temple and the throne of him who holds the awful keys  when bright with purple and with gold come priest and holy cardinal and borne above the heads of all the gentle shepherd of the fold  o joy to see before i die the only godanointed king and hear the silver trumpets ring a triumph as he passes by  or at the brazenpillared shrine holds high the mystic sacrifice and shows his god to human eyes beneath the veil of bread and wine   iv   for lo what changes time can bring the cycles of revolving years may free my heart from all its fears and teach my lips a song to sing  before yon field of trembling gold is garnered into dusty sheaves or ere the autumns scarlet leaves flutter as birds adown the wold  i may have run the glorious race and caught the torch while yet aflame and called upon the holy name of him who now doth hide his face  arona    poem  urbs sacra aeterna    rome what a scroll of history thine has been in the first days thy sword republican ruled the whole world for many an ages span then of the peoples wert thou royal queen till in thy streets the bearded goth was seen and now upon thy walls the breezes fan ah city crowned by god discrowned by man the hated flag of red and white and green when was thy glory when in search for power thine eagles flew to greet the double sun and the wild nations shuddered at thy rod nay but thy glory tarried for this hour when pilgrims kneel before the holy one the prisoned shepherd of the church of god  montre mario    poem  sonnet on hearing the dies irae sung in the sistine chapel    nay lord not thus white lilies in the spring sad olivegroves or silverbreasted dove teach me more clearly of thy life and love than terrors of red flame and thundering the hillside vines dear memories of thee bring a bird at evening flying to its nest tells me of one who had no place of rest i think it is of thee the sparrows sing come rather on some autumn afternoon when red and brown are burnished on the leaves and the fields echo to the gleaners song come when the splendid fulness of the moon looks down upon the rows of golden sheaves and reap thy harvest  we have waited long    poem  easter day    the silver trumpets rang across the dome the people knelt upon the ground with awe and borne upon the necks of men i saw like some great god the holy lord of rome priestlike he wore a robe more white than foam and kinglike swathed himself in royal red three crowns of gold rose high upon his head in splendour and in light the pope passed home my heart stole back across wide wastes of years to one who wandered by a lonely sea and sought in vain for any place of rest foxes have holes and every bird its nest i only i must wander wearily and bruise my feet and drink wine salt with tears    poem  e tenebris    come down o christ and help me reach thy hand for i am drowning in a stormier sea than simon on thy lake of galilee the wine of life is spilt upon the sand my heart is as some faminemurdered land whence all good things have perished utterly and well i know my soul in hell must lie if i this night before gods throne should stand he sleeps perchance or rideth to the chase like baal when his prophets howled that name from morn to noon on carmels smitten height nay peace i shall behold before the night the feet of brass the robe more white than flame the wounded hands the weary human face    poem  vita nuova    i stood by the unvintageable sea till the wet waves drenched face and hair with spray the long red fires of the dying day burned in the west the wind piped drearily and to the land the clamorous gulls did flee alas i cried my life is full of pain and who can garner fruit or golden grain from these waste fields which travail ceaselessly my nets gaped wide with many a break and flaw nathless i threw them as my final cast into the sea and waited for the end when lo a sudden glory and i saw from the black waters of my tortured past the argent splendour of white limbs ascend    poem  madonna mia    a lilygirl not made for this worlds pain with brown soft hair close braided by her ears and longing eyes half veiled by slumberous tears like bluest water seen through mists of rain pale cheeks whereon no love hath left its stain red underlip drawn in for fear of love and white throat whiter than the silvered dove through whose wan marble creeps one purple vein yet though my lips shall praise her without cease even to kiss her feet i am not bold being oershadowed by the wings of awe like dante when he stood with beatrice beneath the flaming lions breast and saw the seventh crystal and the stair of gold    poem  the new helen    where hast thou been since round the walls of troy the sons of god fought in that great emprise why dost thou walk our common earth again hast thou forgotten that impassioned boy his purple galley and his tyrian men and treacherous aphrodites mocking eyes for surely it was thou who like a star hung in the silver silence of the night didst lure the old worlds chivalry and might into the clamorous crimson waves of war  or didst thou rule the fireladen moon in amorous sidon was thy temple built over the light and laughter of the sea where behind lattice scarletwrought and gilt some brownlimbed girl did weave thee tapestry all through the waste and wearied hours of noon till her wan cheek with flame of passion burned and she rose up the seawashed lips to kiss of some glad cyprian sailor safe returned from calpe and the cliffs of herakles  no thou art helen and none other one it was for thee that young sarpedon died and memnons manhood was untimely spent it was for thee goldcrested hector tried with thetis child that evil race to run in the last year of thy beleaguerment ay even now the glory of thy fame burns in those fields of trampled asphodel where the high lords whom ilion knew so well clash ghostly shields and call upon thy name  where hast thou been in that enchanted land whose slumbering vales forlorn calypso knew where never mower rose at break of day but all unswathed the trammelling grasses grew and the sad shepherd saw the tall corn stand till summers red had changed to withered grey didst thou lie there by some lethaean stream deep brooding on thine ancient memory the crash of broken spears the fiery gleam from shivered helm the grecian battlecry  nay thou wert hidden in that hollow hill with one who is forgotten utterly that discrowned queen men call the erycine hidden away that never mightst thou see the face of her before whose mouldering shrine today at rome the silent nations kneel who gat from love no joyous gladdening but only loves intolerable pain only a sword to pierce her heart in twain only the bitterness of childbearing  the lotusleaves which heal the wounds of death lie in thy hand o be thou kind to me while yet i know the summer of my days for hardly can my tremulous lips draw breath to fill the silver trumpet with thy praise so bowed am i before thy mystery so bowed and broken on loves terrible wheel that i have lost all hope and heart to sing yet care i not what ruin time may bring if in thy temple thou wilt let me kneel  alas alas thou wilt not tarry here but like that bird the servant of the sun who flies before the north wind and the night so wilt thou fly our evil land and drear back to the tower of thine old delight and the red lips of young euphorion nor shall i ever see thy face again but in this poisonous gardenclose must stay crowning my brows with the thorncrown of pain till all my loveless life shall pass away  o helen  helen helen yet a while yet for a little while o tarry here till the dawn cometh and the shadows flee for in the gladsome sunlight of thy smile of heaven or hell i have no thought or fear seeing i know no other god but thee no other god save him before whose feet in nets of gold the tired planets move the incarnate spirit of spiritual love who in thy body holds his joyous seat  thou wert not born as common women are but girt with silver splendour of the foam didst from the depths of sapphire seas arise and at thy coming some immortal star bearded with flame blazed in the eastern skies and waked the shepherds on thine islandhome thou shalt not die  no asps of egypt creep close at thy heels to taint the delicate air no sullenblooming poppies stain thy hair those scarlet heralds of eternal sleep  lily of love pure and inviolate tower of ivory red rose of fire thou hast come down our darkness to illume for we closecaught in the wide nets of fate wearied with waiting for the worlds desire aimlessly wandered in the house of gloom aimlessly sought some slumberous anodyne for wasted lives for lingering wretchedness till we beheld thy rearisen shrine and the white glory of thy loveliness    poem  the burden of itys    this english thames is holier far than rome those harebells like a sudden flush of sea breaking across the woodland with the foam of meadowsweet and white anemone to fleck their blue wavesgod is likelier there than hidden in that crystalhearted star the pale monks bear  those violetgleaming butterflies that take yon creamy lily for their pavilion are monsignores and where the rushes shake a lazy pike lies basking in the sun his eyes half shuthe is some mitred old bishop in partibus look at those gaudy scales all green and gold  the wind the restless prisoner of the trees does well for palaestrina one would say the mighty masters hands were on the keys of the maria organ which they play when early on some sapphire easter morn in a high litter red as blood or sin the pope is borne  from his dark house out to the balcony above the bronze gates and the crowded square whose very fountains seem for ecstasy to toss their silver lances in the air and stretching out weak hands to east and west in vain sends peace to peaceless lands to restless nations rest  is not yon lingering orange afterglow that stays to vex the moon more fair than all romes lordliest pageants strange a year ago i knelt before some crimson cardinal who bare the host across the esquiline and nowthose common poppies in the wheat seem twice as fine  the bluegreen beanfields yonder tremulous with the last shower sweeter perfume bring through this cool evening than the odorous flamejewelled censers the young deacons swing when the grey priest unlocks the curtained shrine and makes gods body from the common fruit of corn and vine  poor fra giovanni bawling at the mass were out of tune now for a small brown bird sings overhead and through the long cool grass i see that throbbing throat which once i heard on starlit hills of flowerstarred arcady once where the white and crescent sand of salamis meets sea  sweet is the swallow twittering on the eaves at daybreak when the mower whets his scythe and stockdoves murmur and the milkmaid leaves her little lonely bed and carols blithe to see the heavylowing cattle wait stretching their huge and dripping mouths across the farmyard gate  and sweet the hops upon the kentish leas and sweet the wind that lifts the newmown hay and sweet the fretful swarms of grumbling bees that round and round the linden blossoms play and sweet the heifer breathing in the stall and the green bursting figs that hang upon the redbrick wall  and sweet to hear the cuckoo mock the spring while the last violet loiters by the well and sweet to hear the shepherd daphnis sing the song of linus through a sunny dell of warm arcadia where the corn is gold and the slight lithelimbed reapers dance about the wattled fold  and sweet with young lycoris to recline in some illyrian valley far away where canopied on herbs amaracine we too might waste the summertranced day matching our reeds in sportive rivalry while far beneath us frets the troubled purple of the sea  but sweeter far if silversandalled foot of some longhidden god should ever tread the nuneham meadows if with reeded flute pressed to his lips some faun might raise his head by the green waterflags ah sweet indeed to see the heavenly herdsman call his whitefleeced flock to feed  then sing to me thou tuneful chorister though what thou singst be thine own requiem tell me thy tale thou hapless chronicler of thine own tragedies do not contemn these unfamiliar haunts this english field for many a lovely coronal our northern isle can yield  which grecian meadows know not many a rose which all day long in vales aeolian a lad might seek in vain for overgrows our hedges like a wanton courtesan unthrifty of its beauty lilies too ilissos never mirrored star our streams and cockles blue  dot the green wheat which though they are the signs for swallows going south would never spread their azure tents between the attic vines even that little weed of ragged red which bids the robin pipe in arcady would be a trespasser and many an unsung elegy  sleeps in the reeds that fringe our winding thames which to awake were sweeter ravishment than ever syrinx wept for diadems of brown beestudded orchids which were meant for cytheraeas brows are hidden here unknown to cytheraea and by yonder pasturing steer  there is a tiny yellow daffodil the butterfly can see it from afar although one summer evenings dew could fill its little cup twice over ere the star had called the lazy shepherd to his fold and be no

the sepulchre of one i sometime worshipped but to me it seems to bring diviner memories of faunloved heliconian glades and blue nymphhaunted seas  of an untrodden vale at tempe where on the clear rivers marge narcissus lies the tangle of the forest in his hair the silence of the woodland in his eyes wooing that drifting imagery which is no sooner kissed than broken memories of salmacis  who is not boy nor girl and yet is both fed by two fires and unsatisfied through their excess each passion being loth for loves own sake to leave the others side yet killing love by staying memories of oreads peeping through the leaves of silent moonlit trees  of lonely ariadne on the wharf at naxos when she saw the treacherous crew far out at sea and waved her crimson scarf and called false theseus back again nor knew that dionysos on an amber pard was close behind her memories of what maeonias bard  with sightless eyes beheld the wall of troy queen helen lying in the ivory room and at her side an amorous redlipped boy trimming with dainty hand his helmets plume and far away the moil the shout the groan as hector shielded off the spear and ajax hurled the stone  of winged perseus with his

dews at eve that she dreams of the fields of enna by the far sicilian sea  where oft the goldengirdled bee she chased from lily to lily on the level mead ere yet her sombre lord had bid her taste the deadly fruit of that pomegranate seed ere the black steeds had harried her away down to the faint and flowerless land the sick and sunless day  o for one midnight and as paramour the venus of the

tremulous laurels lonely salmacis had bared his barren beauty to the moon and through the vale with sad voluptuous smile antinous had wandered the red lotus of the nile  down leaning from his black

doth not haunt these fields pandion is not here  here is no cruel lord with murderous blade no woven web of bloody heraldries but mossy dells for roving comrades made warm valleys where the tired student lies with halfshut book and many a winding walk where rustic lovers stray at eve in happy simple talk  the harmless rabbit gambols with its young across the trampled towingpath where late a troop of laughing boys in jostling throng cheered with their noisy cries the racing eight the gossamer with ravelled silver threads works at its little loom and from the dusky redeaved sheds  of the lone farm a flickering light shines out where the swinked shepherd drives his bleating flock back to their wattled sheepcotes a faint shout comes from some oxford boat at sandford lock and starts the moorhen from the sedgy rill and the dim lengthening shadows flit like swallows up the hill  the heron passes homeward to the mere the blue mist creeps among the shivering trees gold world by world the silent stars appear and like a blossom blown before the breeze a white moon drifts across the shimmering sky mute arbitress of all thy sad thy rapturous threnody  she does not heed thee wherefore

matin    the thames nocturne of blue and gold changed to a harmony in grey a barge with ochrecoloured hay dropt from the wharf  and chill and cold  the yellow fog came creeping down the bridges till the houses walls seemed changed to shadows and st pauls loomed like a bubble oer the town  then suddenly arose the clang of waking life the streets were stirred with country waggons  and a bird flew to the glistening roofs and sang  but one pale woman all alone the daylight kissing her wan hair loitered beneath the gas lamps flare with lips of flame and heart of stone    poem  magdalen walks    the little white clouds are racing over the sky and the fields are strewn with the gold of the flower of march the daffodil breaks under foot and the tasselled larch sways and swings as the thrush goes hurrying by  a delicate odour is borne on the wings of the morning breeze the odour of deep wet grass and of brown newfurrowed earth the birds are singing for joy of the springs glad birth hopping from branch to branch on the rocking trees  and all the woods are alive with the murmur and sound of spring and the rosebud breaks into pink on the climbing briar and the crocusbed is a quivering moon of fire girdled round with the belt of an amethyst ring  and the plane to the pinetree is whispering some tale of love till it rustles with laughter and tosses its mantle of green and the gloom of the wychelms hollow is lit with the iris sheen of the burnished rainbow throat and the silver breast of a dove  see the lark starts up from his bed in the meadow there breaking the gossamer threads and the nets of dew and flashing adown the river a flame of blue the kingfisher flies like an arrow and wounds the air    poem  athanasia    to that gaunt house of art which lacks for naught of all the great things men have saved from time the withered body of a girl was brought dead ere the worlds glad youth had touched its prime and seen by lonely arabs lying hid in the dim womb of some black pyramid  but when they had unloosed the linen band which swathed the egyptians bodylo was found closed in the wasted hollow of her hand a little seed which sown in english ground did wondrous snow of starry blossoms bear and spread rich odours through our springtide air  with such strange arts this flower did allure that all forgotten was the asphodel and the brown bee the lilys paramour forsook the cup where he was wont to dwell for not a thing of earth it seemed to be but stolen from some heavenly arcady  in vain the sad narcissus wan and white at its own beauty hung across the stream the purple dragonfly had no delight with its gold dust to make his wings agleam ah no delight the jasminebloom to kiss or brush the rainpearls from the eucharis  for love of it the passionate nightingale forgot the hills of thrace the cruel king and the pale dove no longer cared to sail through the wet woods at time of blossoming but round this flower of egypt sought to float with silvered wing and amethystine throat  while the hot sun blazed in his tower of blue a cooling wind crept from the land of snows and the warm south with tender tears of dew drenched its white leaves when hesperos uprose amid those seagreen meadows of the sky on which the scarlet bars of sunset lie  but when oer wastes of lilyhaunted field the tired birds had stayed their amorous tune and broad and glittering like an argent shield high in the sapphire heavens hung the moon did no strange dream or evil memory make each tremulous petal of its blossoms shake  ah no to this bright flower a thousand years seemed but the lingering of a summers day it never knew the tide of cankering fears which turn a boys gold hair to withered grey the dread desire of death it never knew or how all folk that they were born must rue  for we to death with pipe and dancing go nor would we pass the ivory gate again as some sad river wearied of its flow through the dull plains the haunts of common men leaps loverlike into the terrible sea and counts it gain to die so gloriously  we mar our lordly strength in barren strife with the worlds legions led by clamorous care it never feels decay but gathers life from the pure sunlight and the supreme air we live beneath times wasting sovereignty it is the child of all eternity    poem  serenade for music    the western wind is blowing fair across

love he told i know he will come back to me o rising moon  o lady moon be you my lovers sentinel you cannot choose but know him well for he is shod with purple shoon you cannot choose but know my love for he a shepherds crook doth bear and he is soft as any dove and brown and curly is his hair  the turtle now has ceased to call upon her crimsonfooted groom the grey wolf prowls about the stall the lilys singing seneschal sleeps in the lilybell and all the violet hills are lost in gloom o risen moon  o holy moon stand on the top of helice and if my own true love you see ah if you see the purple shoon the hazel crook the lads brown hair the goatskin wrapped about his arm tell him that i am waiting where the rushlight glimmers in the farm  the falling dew is cold and chill and no bird sings in

gone where are the lips vermilion the shepherds crook the purple shoon why spread that silver pavilion why wear that veil of drifting mist ah thou hast young endymion thou hast the lips that should be kissed    poem  la bella donna della mia mente    my limbs are wasted with a flame my feet are sore with travelling for calling on my ladys name my lips have now forgot to sing  o linnet in the wildrose brake strain for my love thy melody o lark sing louder for loves sake my gentle lady passeth by  she is too fair for any man to see or hold his hearts delight fairer than queen or courtesan or moonlit water in the night  her hair is bound with myrtle leaves green leaves upon her golden hair green grasses through the yellow sheaves of autumn corn are not more fair  her little lips more made to kiss than to cry bitterly for pain are tremulous as brookwater is or roses after evening rain  her neck is like white melilote flushing for pleasure of the sun the throbbing of the linnets throat is not so sweet to look upon  as a pomegranate cut in twain whiteseeded is her crimson mouth her cheeks are as the fading stain where the peach reddens to the south  o twining hands  o delicate white body made for love and pain o house of love  o desolate pale flower beaten by the rain    poem  chanson    a ring of gold and a milkwhite dove are goodly gifts for thee and a hempen rope for

is fair to see for me the cypress and the rue finest of all is rosemary  for you three lovers of your hand green grass where a man lies dead for me three paces on the sand plant lilies at my head    poem  charmides    i   he was a grecian lad who coming home with pulpy figs and wine from sicily stood at his galleys prow and let the foam blow through his crisp brown curls unconsciously and holding wave and wind in boys despite peered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy night  till with the dawn he saw a burnished spear like a thin thread of gold against the sky and hoisted sail and strained the creaking gear and bade the pilot head her lustily against the norwest gale and all day long held on his way and marked the rowers time with measured song  and when the faint corinthian hills were red dropped anchor in a little sandy bay and with fresh boughs of olive crowned his head and brushed from cheek and throat the hoary spray and washed his limbs with oil and from the hold brought out his linen tunic and his sandals brazensoled  and a rich robe stained with the fishers juice which of some swarthy trader he had bought upon the sunny quay at syracuse and was with tyrian broideries inwrought and by the questioning merchants made his way up through the soft and silver woods and when the labouring day  had spun its tangled web of crimson cloud clomb the high hill and with swift silent feet crept to the fane unnoticed by the crowd of busy priests and from some dark retreat watched the young swains his frolic playmates bring the firstling of their little flock and the shy shepherd fling  the crackling salt upon the flame or hang his studded crook against the temple wall to her who keeps away the ravenous fang of the base wolf from homestead and from stall and then the clearvoiced maidens gan to sing and to the altar each man brought some goodly offering  a beechen cup brimming with milky foam a fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery of hounds in chase a waxen honeycomb dripping with oozy gold which scarce the bee had ceased from building a black skin of oil meet for the wrestlers a great boar the fierce and whitetusked spoil  stolen from artemis that jealous maid to please athena and the dappled hide of a tall stag who in some mountain glade had met the shaft and then the herald cried and from the pillared precinct one by one went the glad greeks well pleased that they their simple vows had done  and the old priest put out the waning fires save that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed for ever in the cell and the shrill lyres came fainter on the wind as down the road in joyous dance these country folk did pass and with stout hands the warder closed the gates of polished brass  long time he lay and hardly dared to breathe and heard the cadenced drip of spiltout wine and the rosepetals falling from the wreath as the night breezes wandered through the shrine and seemed to be in some entranced swoon till through the open roof above the full and brimming moon  flooded with sheeny waves the marble floor when from his nook up leapt the venturous lad and flinging wide the cedarcarven door beheld an awful image saffronclad and armed for battle the gaunt griffin glared from the huge helm and the long lance of wreck and ruin flared  like a red rod of flame stony and steeled the gorgons head its leaden eyeballs rolled and writhed its snaky horrors through the shield and gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold in passion impotent while with blind gaze the blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze  the lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp far out at sea off sunium or cast the net for tunnies heard a brazen tramp of horses smite the waves and a wild blast divide the folded curtains of the night and knelt upon the little poop and prayed in holy fright  and guilty lovers in their venery forgat a little while their stolen sweets deeming they heard dread dians bitter cry and the grim watchmen on their lofty seats ran to their shields in haste precipitate or strained blackbearded throats across the dusky parapet  for round the temple rolled the clang of arms and the twelve gods leapt up in marble fear and the air quaked with dissonant alarums till huge poseidon shook his mighty spear and on the frieze the prancing horses neighed and the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade  ready for death with parted lips he stood and well content at such a price to see that calm wide brow that terrible maidenhood the marvel of that pitiless chastity ah well content indeed for never wight since troys young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a sight  ready for death he stood but lo the air grew silent and the horses ceased to neigh and off his brow he tossed the clustering hair and from his limbs he throw the cloak away for whom would not such love make desperate and nigher came and touched her throat and with hands violate  undid the cuirass and the crocus gown and bared the breasts of polished ivory till from the waist the peplos falling down left visible the secret mystery which to no lover will athena show the grand cool flanks the crescent thighs the bossy hills of snow  those who have never known a lovers sin let them not read my ditty it will be to their dull ears so musicless and thin that they will have no joy of it but ye to whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile ye who have learned who eros iso listen yet awhile  a little space he let his greedy eyes rest on the burnished image till mere sight half swooned for surfeit of such luxuries and then his lips in hungering delight fed on her lips and round the towered neck he flung his arms nor cared at all his passions will to check  never i ween did lover hold such tryst for all night long he murmured honeyed word and saw her sweet unravished limbs and kissed her pale and argent body undisturbed and paddled with the polished throat and pressed his hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast  it was as if numidian javelins pierced through and through his wild and whirling brain and his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins in exquisite pulsation and the pain was such sweet anguish that he never drew his lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew  they who have never seen the daylight peer into a darkened room and drawn the curtain and with dull eyes and wearied from some dear and worshipped body risen they for certain will never know of what i try to sing how long the last kiss was how fond and late his lingering  the moon was girdled with a crystal rim the sign which shipmen say is ominous of wrath in heaven the wan stars were dim and the low lightening east was tremulous with the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn ere from the silent sombre shrine his lover had withdrawn  down the steep rock with hurried feet and fast clomb the brave lad and reached the cave of pan and heard the goatfoot snoring as he passed and leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran like a young fawn unto an olive wood which in a shady valley by the wellbuilt city stood  and sought a little stream which well he knew for oftentimes with boyish careless shout the green and crested grebe he would pursue or snare in woven net the silver trout and down amid the startled reeds he lay panting in breathless sweet affright and waited for the day  on the green bank he lay and let one hand dip in the cool dark eddies listlessly and soon the breath of morning came and fanned his hot flushed cheeks or lifted wantonly the tangled curls from off his forehead while he on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile  and soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak with his long crook undid the wattled cotes and from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke curled through the air across the ripening oats and on the hill the yellow housedog bayed as through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed  and when the lightfoot mower went afield across the meadows laced with threaded dew and the sheep bleated on the misty weald and from its nest the waking corncrake flew some woodmen saw him lying by the stream and marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem  nor deemed him born of mortals and one said it is young hylas that false runaway who with a naiad now would make his bed forgetting herakles but others nay it is narcissus his own paramour those are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure  and when they nearer came a third one cried it is young dionysos who has hid his spear and fawnskin by the river side weary of hunting with the bassarid and wise indeed were we away to fly they live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy  so turned they back and feared to look behind and told the timid swain how they had seen amid the reeds some woodland god reclined and no man dared to cross the open green and on that day no olivetree was slain nor rushes cut but all deserted was the fair domain  save when the neatherds lad his empty pail well slung upon his back with leap and bound raced on the other side and stopped to hail hoping that he some comrade new had found and gat no answer and then half afraid passed on his simple way or down the still and silent glade  a little girl ran laughing from the farm not thinking of loves secret mysteries and when she saw the white and gleaming arm and all his manlihood with longing eyes whose passion mocked her sweet virginity watched him awhile and then stole back sadly and wearily  far off he heard the citys hum and noise and now and then the shriller laughter where the passionate purity of brownlimbed boys wrestled or raced in the clear healthful air and now and then a little tinkling bell as the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well  through the grey willows danced the fretful gnat the grasshopper chirped idly from the tree in sleek and oily coat the waterrat breasting the little ripples manfully made for the wildducks nest from bough to bough hopped the shy finch and the huge tortoise crept across the slough  on the faint wind floated the silky seeds as the bright scythe swept through the waving grass the ouzelcock splashed circles in the reeds and flecked with silver whorls the forests glass which scarce had caught again its imagery ere from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragonfly  but little care had he for any thing though up and down the beech the squirrel played and from the copse the linnet gan to sing to its brown mate its sweetest serenade ah little care indeed for he had seen the breasts of pallas and the naked wonder of the queen  but when the herdsman called his straggling goats with whistling pipe across the rocky road and the shardbeetle with its trumpetnotes boomed through the darkening woods and seemed to bode of coming storm and the belated crane passed homeward like a shadow and the dull big drops of rain  fell on the pattering figleaves up he rose and from the gloomy forest went his way past sombre homestead and wet orchardclose and came at last unto a little quay and called his mates aboard and took his seat on the high poop and pushed from land and loosed the dripping sheet  and steered across the bay and when nine suns passed down the long and laddered way of gold and nine pale moons had breathed their orisons to the chaste stars their confessors or told their dearest secret to the downy moth that will not fly at noonday through the foam and surging froth  came a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes and lit upon the ship whose timbers creaked as though the lading of three argosies were in the hold and flapped its wings and shrieked and darkness straightway stole across the deep sheathed was orions sword dread mars himself fled down the steep  and the moon hid behind a tawny mask of drifting cloud and from the oceans marge rose the red plume the huge and horned casque the sevencubit spear the brazen targe and clad in bright and burnished panoply athena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea  to the dull sailors sight her loosened looks seemed like the jagged stormrack and her feet only the spume that floats on hidden rocks and marking how the rising waters beat against the rolling ship the pilot cried to the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side  but he the overbold adulterer a dear profaner of great mysteries an ardent amorous idolater when he beheld those grand relentless eyes laughed loud for joy and crying out i come leapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam  then fell from the high heaven one bright star one dancer left the circling galaxy and back to athens on her clattering car in all the pride of venged divinity pale pallas swept with shrill and steely clank and a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank  and the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew with mocking hoots after the wrathful queen and the old pilot bade the trembling crew hoist the big sail and told how he had seen close to the stern a dim and giant form and like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm  and no man dared to speak of charmides deeming that he some evil thing had wrought and when they reached the strait symplegades they beached their galley on the shore and sought the tollgate of the city hastily and in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery   ii   but some good tritongod had ruth and bare the boys drowned body back to grecian land and mermaids combed his dank and dripping hair and smoothed his brow and loosed his clenching hand some brought sweet spices from far araby and others bade the halcyon sing her softest lullaby  and when he neared his old athenian home a mighty billow rose up suddenly upon whose oily back the clotted foam lay diapered in some strange fantasy and clasping him unto its glassy breast swept landward like a whitemaned steed upon a venturous quest  now where colonos leans unto the sea there lies a long and level stretch of lawn the rabbit knows it and the mountain bee for it deserts hymettus and the faun is not afraid for never through the day comes a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lads at play  but often from the thorny labyrinth and tangled branches of the circling wood the stealthy hunter sees young hyacinth hurling the polished disk and draws his hood over his guilty gaze and creeps away nor dares to wind his horn orelse at the first break of day  the dryads come and throw the leathern ball along the reedy shore and circumvent some goateared pan to be their seneschal for fear of bold poseidons ravishment and loose their girdles with shy timorous eyes lest from the surf his azure arms and purple beard should rise  on this side and on that a rocky cave hung with the yellowbelled laburnum stands smooth is the beach save where some ebbing wave leaves its faint outline etched upon the sands as though it feared to be too soon forgot by the green rush its playfellowand yet it is a spot  so small that the inconstant butterfly could steal the hoarded money from each flower ere it was noon and still not satisfy its overgreedy lovewithin an hour a sailor boy were he but rude enow to land and pluck a garland for his galleys painted prow  would almost leave the little meadow bare for it knows nothing of great pageantry only a few narcissi here and there stand separate in sweet austerity dotting the unmown grass with silver stars and here and there a daffodil waves tiny scimitars  hither the billow brought him and was glad of such dear servitude and where the land was virgin of all waters laid the lad upon the golden margent of the strand and like a lingering lover oft returned to kiss those pallid limbs which once with intense fire burned  ere the wet seas had quenched that holocaust that selffed flame that passionate lustihead ere grisly death with chill and nipping frost had withered up those lilies white and red which while the boy would through the forest range answered each other in a sweet antiphonal counterchange  and when at dawn the woodnymphs handinhand threaded the bosky dell their satyr spied the boys pale body stretched upon the sand and feared poseidons treachery and cried and like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade each startled dryad sought some safe and leafy ambuscade  save one white girl who deemed it would not be so dread a thing to feel a seagods arms crushing her breasts in amorous tyranny and longed to listen to those subtle charms insidious lovers weave when they would win some fenced fortress and stole back again nor thought it sin  to yield her treasure unto one so fair and lay beside him thirsty with loves drouth called him soft names played with his tangled hair and with hot lips made havoc of his mouth afraid he might not wake and then afraid lest he might wake too soon fled back and then fond renegade  returned to fresh assault and all day long sat at his side and laughed at her new toy and held his hand and sang her sweetest song then frowned to see how froward was the boy who would not with her maidenhood entwine nor knew that three days since his eyes had looked on proserpine  nor knew what sacrilege his lips had done but said he will awake i know him well he will awake at evening when the sun hangs his red shield on corinths citadel this sleep is but a cruel treachery to make me love him more and in some cavern of the sea  deeper than ever falls the fishers line already a huge triton blows his horn and weaves a garland from the crystalline and drifting oceantendrils to adorn the emerald pillars of our bridal bed for sphered in foaming silver and with coral crowned head  we two will sit upon a throne of pearl and a blue wave will be our canopy and at our feet the watersnakes will curl in all their amethystine panoply of diamonded mail and we will mark the mullets swimming by the mast of some stormfoundered bark  vermilionfinned with eyes of bossy gold like flakes of crimson light and the great deep his glassyportaled chamber will unfold and we will see the painted dolphins sleep cradled by murmuring halcyons on the rocks where proteus in quaint suit of green pastures his monstrous flocks  and tremulous opalhued anemones will wave their purple fringes where we tread upon the mirrored floor and argosies of fishes flecked with tawny scales will thread the drifting cordage of the shattered wreck and honeycoloured amber beads our twining limbs will deck  but when that baffled lord of war the sun with gaudy pennon flying passed away into his brazen house and one by one the little yellow stars began to stray across the field of heaven ah then indeed she feared his lips upon her lips would never care to feed  and cried awake already the pale moon washes the trees with silver and the wave creeps grey and chilly up this sandy dune the croaking frogs are out and from the cave the nightjar shrieks the fluttering bats repass and the brown stoat with hollow flanks creeps through the dusky grass  nay though thou art a god be not so coy for in yon stream there is a little reed that often whispers how a lovely boy lay with her once upon a grassy mead who when his cruel pleasure he had done spread wings of rustling gold and soared aloft into the sun  be not so coy the laurel trembles still with great apollos kisses and the fir whose clustering sisters fringe the seaward hill hath many a tale of that bold ravisher whom men call boreas and i have seen the mocking eyes of hermes through the poplars silvery sheen  even the jealous naiads call me fair and every morn a young and ruddy swain woos me with apples and with locks of hair and seeks to soothe my virginal disdain by all the gifts the gentle woodnymphs love but yesterday he brought to me an irisplumaged dove  with little crimson feet which with its store of seven spotted eggs the cruel lad had stolen from the lofty sycamore at daybreak when her amorous comrade had flown off in search of berried juniper which most they love the fretful wasp that earliest vintager  of the blue grapes hath not persistency so constant as this simple shepherdboy for my poor lips his joyous purity and laughing sunny eyes might well decoy a dryad from her oath to artemis for very beautiful is he his mouth was made to kiss  his argent forehead like a rising moon over the dusky hills of meeting brows is crescent shaped the hot and tyrian noon leads from the myrtlegrove no goodlier spouse for cytheraea the first silky down fringes his blushing cheeks and his young limbs are strong and brown  and he is rich and fat and fleecy herds of bleating sheep upon his meadows lie and many an earthen bowl of yellow curds is in his homestead for the thievish fly to swim and drown in the pink clover mead keeps its sweet store for him and he can pipe on oaten reed  and yet i love him not it was for thee i kept my love i knew that thou wouldst come to rid me of this pallid chastity thou fairest flower of the flowerless foam of all the wide aegean brightest star of oceans azure heavens where the mirrored planets are  i knew that thou wouldst come for when at first the dry wood burgeoned and the sap of spring swelled in my green and tender bark or burst to myriad multitudinous blossoming which mocked the midnight with its mimic moons that did not dread the dawn and first the thrushes rapturous tunes  startled the squirrel from its granary and cuckoo flowers fringed the narrow lane through my young leaves a sensuous ecstasy crept like new wine and every mossy vein throbbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood and the wild winds of passion shook my slim stems maidenhood  the trooping fawns at evening came and laid their cool black noses on my lowest boughs and on my topmost branch the blackbird made a little nest of grasses for his spouse and now and then a twittering wren would light on a thin twig which hardly bare the weight of such delight  i was the attic shepherds trysting place beneath my shadow amaryllis lay and round my trunk would laughing daphnis chase the timorous girl till tired out with play she felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair and turned and looked and fled no more from such delightful snare  then come away unto my ambuscade where clustering woodbine weaves a canopy for amorous pleasaunce and the rustling shade of paphian myrtles seems to sanctify the dearest rites of love there in the cool and green recesses of its farthest depth there is pool  the ouzels haunt the wild bees pasturage for round its rim great creamy lilies float through their flat leaves in verdant anchorage each cup a whitesailed goldenladen boat steered by a dragonflybe not afraid to leave this wan and wavekissed shore surely the place was made  for lovers such as we the cyprian queen one arm around her boyish paramour strays often there at eve and i have seen the moon strip off her misty vestiture for young endymions eyes be not afraid the panther feet of dian never tread that secret glade  nay if thou willst back to the beating brine back to the boisterous billow let us go and walk all day beneath the hyaline huge vault of neptunes watery portico and watch the purple monsters of the deep sport in ungainly play and from his lair keen xiphias leap  for if my mistress find me lying here she will not ruth or gentle pity show but lay her boarspear down and with austere relentless fingers string the cornel bow and draw the feathered notch against her breast and loose the arched cord aye even now upon the quest  i hear her hurrying feetawake awake thou laggard in loves battle once at least let me drink deep of passions wine and slake my parched being with the nectarous feast which even gods affect  o come love come still we have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home  scarce had she spoken when the shuddering trees shook and the leaves divided and the air grew conscious of a god and the grey seas crawled backward and a long and dismal blare blew from some tasselled horn a sleuthhound bayed and like a flame a barbed reed flew whizzing down the glade  and where the little flowers of her breast just brake into their milky blossoming this murderous paramour this unbidden guest pierced and struck deep in horrid chambering and ploughed a bloody furrow with its dart and dug a long red road and cleft with winged death her heart  sobbing her life out with a bitter cry on the boys body fell the dryad maid sobbing for incomplete virginity and raptures unenjoyed and pleasures dead and all the pain of things unsatisfied and the bright drops of crimson youth crept down her throbbing side  ah pitiful it was to hear her moan and very pitiful to see her die ere she had yielded up her sweets or known the joy of passion that dread mystery which not to know is not to live at all and yet to know is to be held in deaths most deadly thrall  but as it hapt the queen of cythere who with adonis all night long had lain within some shepherds hut in arcady on team of silver doves and gilded wain was journeying paphosward high up afar from mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star  and when low down she spied the hapless pair and heard the oreads faint despairing cry whose cadence seemed to play upon the air as though it were a viol hastily she bade her pigeons fold each straining plume and dropt to earth and reached the strand and saw their dolorous doom  for as a gardener turning back his head to catch the last notes of the linnet mows with careless scythe too near some flower bed and cuts the thorny pillar of the rose and with the flowers loosened loneliness strews the brown mould or as some shepherd lad in wantonness  driving his little flock along the mead treads down two daffodils which side by aide have lured the ladybird with yellow brede and made the gaudy moth forget its pride treads down their brimming golden chalices under light feet which were not made for such rude ravages  or as a schoolboy tired of his book flings himself down upon the reedy grass and plucks two waterlilies from the brook and for a time forgets the hour glass then wearies of their sweets and goes his way and lets the hot sun kill them even go these lovers lay  and venus cried it is dread artemis whose bitter hand hath wrought this cruelty or else that mightier maid whose care it is to guard her strong and stainless majesty upon the hill athenianalas that they who loved so well unloved into deaths house should pass  so with soft hands she laid the boy and girl in the great golden waggon tenderly her white throat whiter than a moony pearl just threaded with a blue veins tapestry had not yet ceased to throb and still her breast swayed like a windstirred lily in ambiguous unrest  and then each pigeon spread its milky van the bright car soared into the dawning sky and like a cloud the aerial caravan passed over the aegean silently till the faint air was troubled with the song from the wan mouths that call on bleeding thammuz all night long  but when the doves had reached their wonted goal where the wide stair of orbed marble dips its snows into the sea her fluttering soul just shook the trembling petals of her lips and passed into the void and venus knew that one fair maid the less would walk amid her retinue  and bade her servants carve a cedar chest with all the wonder of this history within whose scented womb their limbs should rest where olivetrees make tender the blue sky on the low hills of paphos and the faun pipes in the noonday and the nightingale sings on till dawn  nor failed they to obey her hest and ere the morning bee had stung the daffodil with tiny fretful spear or from its lair the waking stag had leapt across the rill and roused the ouzel or the lizard crept athwart the sunny rock beneath the grass their bodies slept  and when day brake within that silver shrine fed by the flames of cressets tremulous queen venus knelt and prayed to proserpine that she whose beauty made death amorous should beg a guerdon from her pallid lord and let desire pass across dread charons icy ford   iii   in melancholy moonless acheron farm for the

linnets mate no more  there by a dim and dark lethaean well young charmides was lying wearily he plucked the blossoms from the asphodel and with its little rifled treasury strewed the dull waters of the dusky stream and watched the white stars founder and the land was like a dream  when as he gazed into the watery glass and through his brown hairs curly tangles scanned his own wan face a shadow seemed to pass across the mirror and a little hand stole into his and warm lips timidly brushed his pale cheeks and breathed their secret forth into a sigh  then turned he round his weary eyes and saw and ever nigher still their faces came and nigher ever did their young mouths draw until they seemed one perfect rose of flame and longing arms around her neck he cast and felt her throbbing bosom and his breath came hot and fast  and all his hoarded sweets were hers to kiss and all her maidenhood was his to slay and limb to limb in long and rapturous bliss their passion waxed and wanedo why essay

fiery pulse of sin a splendid shame could in the loveless land of hades glean one scorching harvest from those fields of flame where passion walks with naked unshod feet and is not woundedah enough that once their lips could meet  in that wild throb when all existences seemed narrowed to one single ecstasy which dies through its own sweetness and the stress of too much pleasure ere persephone

and like a withered leaf the moon is blown across the stormy bay  etched clear upon the pallid sand lies the black boat  a sailor boy clambers aboard in careless joy with laughing face and gleaming

peace a dreamy peace on either hand deep silence in the shadowy land deep silence where the shadows cease  save for a cry that echoes shrill from some lone bird disconsolate a corncrake calling to its

harmony    her ivory hands on the ivory keys strayed in a fitful fantasy like the silver gleam when the poplar trees rustle their paleleaves listlessly or the drifting foam of a restless sea when the waves show their teeth in the flying breeze  her gold hair fell on the wall of gold like the delicate gossamer tangles spun on the burnished disk of the marigold or the sunflower turning to meet the sun when the gloom of the dark blue night is done and the spear of the lily is aureoled  and her sweet red lips on these lips of mine burned like the ruby fire set in the swinging lamp of a crimson

from fire unto fire from passionate pain to deadlier delight i am too young to live without desire too young art thou to waste this summer night asking those idle questions which of old man sought of seer and oracle and no reply was told  for sweet to feel is better than to know and wisdom is a childless heritage one pulse of passionyouths first fiery glow are worth the hoarded proverbs of the sage vex not thy soul with dead philosophy have we not lips to kiss with hearts to love and eyes to see  dost thou not hear the murmuring nightingale like water bubbling from a silver jar so soft she sings the envious moon is pale that high in heaven she is hung so far she cannot hear that loveenraptured tune mark how she wreathes each horn with mist yon late and labouring moon  white lilies in whose cups the gold bees dream the fallen snow of petals where the breeze scatters the chestnut blossom or the gleam of boyish limbs in waterare not these enough for thee dost thou desire more alas the gods will give nought else from their eternal store  for our high gods have sick and wearied grown of all our endless sins our vain endeavour for wasted days of youth to make atone by pain or prayer or priest and never never hearken they now to either good or ill but send their rain upon the just and the unjust at will  they sit at ease our gods they sit at ease strewing with leaves of rose their scented wine they sleep they sleep beneath the rocking trees where asphodel and yellow lotus twine mourning the old glad days before they knew what evil things the heart of man could dream and dreaming do  and far beneath the brazen floor they see like swarming flies the crowd of little men the bustle of small lives then wearily back to their lotushaunts they turn again kissing each others mouths and mix more deep the poppyseeded draught which brings soft purplelidded sleep  there all day long the goldenvestured sun their torchbearer stands with his torch ablaze and when the gaudy web of noon is spun by its twelve maidens through the crimson haze fresh from endymions arms comes forth the moon and the immortal gods in toils of mortal passions swoon  there walks queen juno through some dewy mead her grand white feet flecked with the saffron dust of windstirred lilies while young ganymede leaps in the hot and amberfoaming must his curls all tossed as when the eagle bare the frightened boy from ida through the blue ionian air  there in the green heart of some garden close queen venus with the shepherd at her side her warm soft body like the briar rose which would be white yet blushes at its pride laughs low for love till jealous salmacis peers through the myrtleleaves and sighs for pain of lonely bliss  there never does that dreary northwind blow which leaves our english forests bleak and bare nor ever falls the swift whitefeathered snow nor ever doth the redtoothed lightning dare to wake them in the silverfretted night when we lie weeping for some sweet sad sin some dead delight  alas they know the far lethaean spring the violethidden waters well they know where one whose feet with tired wandering are faint and broken may take heart and go and from those dark depths cool and crystalline drink and draw balm and sleep for sleepless souls and anodyne  but we oppress our natures god or fate is our enemy we starve and feed on vain repentanceo we are born too late what balm for us in bruised poppy seed who crowd into one finite pulse of time the joy of infinite love and the fierce pain of infinite crime  o we are wearied of this sense of guilt wearied of pleasures paramour despair wearied of every temple we have built wearied of every right unanswered prayer for man is weak god sleeps  and heaven is high one fierycoloured moment  one great love and lo we die  ah but no ferryman with labouring pole nears his black shallop to the flowerless strand no little coin of bronze can bring the soul over deaths river to the sunless land victim and wine and vow are all in vain the tomb is sealed the soldiers watch the dead rise not again  we are resolved into the supreme air we are made one with what we touch and see with our hearts blood each crimson sun is fair with our young lives each springimpassioned tree flames into green the wildest beasts that range the moor our kinsmen are all life is one and all is change  with beat of systole and of diastole one grand great life throbs through earths giant heart and mighty waves of single being roll from nerveless germ to man for we are part of every rock and bird and beast and hill one with the things that prey on us and one with what we kill  from lower cells of waking life we pass to full perfection thus the world grows old we who are godlike now were once a mass of quivering purple flecked with bars of gold unsentient or of joy or misery and tossed in terrible tangles of some wild and windswept sea  this hot hard flame with which our bodies burn will make some meadow blaze with daffodil ay and those argent breasts of thine will turn to waterlilies the brown fields men till will be more fruitful for our love tonight nothing is lost in nature all things live in deaths despite  the boys first kiss the hyacinths first bell the mans last passion and the last red spear that from the lily leaps the asphodel which will not let its blossoms blow for fear of too much beauty and the timid shame of the young bridegroom at his lovers eyesthese with the same  one sacrament are consecrate the earth not we alone hath passions hymeneal the yellow buttercups that shake for mirth at daybreak know a pleasure not less real than we do when in some freshblossoming wood we draw the spring into our hearts and feel that life is good  so when men bury us beneath the yew thy crimsonstained mouth a rose will be and thy soft eyes lush bluebells dimmed with dew and when the white narcissus wantonly kisses the wind its playmate some faint joy will thrill our dust and we will be again fond maid and boy  and thus without lifes conscious torturing pain in some sweet flower we will feel the sun and from the linnets throat will sing again and as two gorgeousmailed snakes will run over our graves or as two tigers creep through the hot jungle where the yelloweyed huge lions sleep  and give them battle  how my heart leaps up to think of that grand living after death in beast and bird and flower when this cup being filled too full of spirit bursts for breath and with the pale leaves of some autumn day the soul earths earliest conqueror becomes earths last great prey  o think of it  we shall inform ourselves into all sensuous life the goatfoot faun the centaur or the merry brighteyed elves that leave their dancing rings to spite the dawn upon the meadows shall not be more near than you and i to natures mysteries for we shall hear  the thrushs heart beat and the daisies grow and the wan snowdrop sighing for the sun on sunless days in winter we shall know by whom the silver gossamer is spun who paints the diapered fritillaries on what wide wings from shivering pine to pine the eagle flies  ay had we never loved at all who knows if yonder daffodil had lured the bee into its gilded womb or any rose had hung with crimson lamps its little tree methinks no leaf would ever bud in spring but for the lovers lips that kiss the poets lips that sing  is the light vanished from our golden sun or is this daedalfashioned earth less fair that we are natures heritors and one with every pulse of life that beats the air rather new suns across the sky shall pass new splendour come unto the flower new glory to the grass  and we two lovers shall not sit afar critics of nature but the joyous sea shall be our raiment and the bearded star shoot arrows at our pleasure  we shall be part of the mighty universal whole and through all aeons mix and mingle with the kosmic soul  we shall be notes in that great symphony whose cadence circles through the rhythmic spheres and all the live worlds throbbing heart shall be one with our heart the stealthy creeping years have lost their terrors now we shall not die the universe itself shall be our immortality    poem  impressionle reveillon    the sky is laced with fitful red the circling mists and shadows flee the dawn is rising from the sea like a white lady from her bed  and jagged brazen arrows fall athwart the feathers of the night and a long wave of yellow light breaks silently on tower and hall  and spreading wide across the wold wakes into flight some fluttering bird and all the chestnut tops are stirred and all the branches streaked with gold    poem  at verona    how steep the stairs within kings houses are for exilewearied feet as mine to tread and o how salt and bitter is the bread which falls from this hounds tablebetter far that i had died in the red ways of war or that the gate of florence bare my head than to live thus by all things comraded which seek the essence of my soul to mar  curse god and die  what better hope than this he hath forgotten thee in all the bliss of his gold city and eternal day nay peace  behind my prisons blinded bars i do possess what none can take away my love and all the glory of the stars    poem  apologia    is it thy will that i should wax and wane barter my cloth of gold for hodden grey and at thy pleasure weave that web of pain whose brightest threads are each a wasted day  is it thy willlove that i love so well that my souls house should be a tortured spot wherein like evil paramours must dwell the quenchless flame the worm that dieth not  nay if it be thy will i shall endure and sell ambition at the common mart and let dull failure be my vestiture and sorrow dig its grave within my heart  perchance it may be better soat least i have not made my heart a heart of stone nor starved my boyhood of its goodly feast nor walked where beauty is a thing unknown  many a man hath done so sought to fence in straitened bonds the soul that should be free trodden the dusty road of common sense while all the forest sang of liberty  not marking how the spotted hawk in flight passed on wide pinion through the lofty air to where some steep untrodden mountain height caught the last tresses of the sun gods hair  or how the little flower he trod upon the daisy that whitefeathered shield of gold followed with wistful eyes the wandering sun content if once its leaves were aureoled  but surely it is something to have been the best beloved for a little while to have walked hand in hand with love and seen his purple wings flit once across thy smile  ay though the gorged asp of passion feed on my boys heart yet have i burst the bars stood face to face with beauty known indeed the love which moves the sun and all the stars    poem  quia multum amavi    dear heart i think the young impassioned priest when first he takes from out the hidden shrine his god imprisoned in the eucharist and eats the bread and drinks the dreadful wine  feels not such awful wonder as i felt when first my smitten eyes beat full on thee and all night long before thy feet i knelt till thou wert wearied of idolatry  ah hadst thou liked me less and loved me more through all those summer days of joy and rain i had not now been sorrows heritor or stood a lackey in the house of pain  yet though remorse youths whitefaced seneschal tread on my heels with all his retinue i am most glad i loved theethink of all the suns that go to make one speedwell blue    poem  silentium amoris    as oftentimes the too resplendent sun hurries the pallid and reluctant moon back to her sombre cave ere she hath won a single ballad from the nightingale so doth thy beauty make my lips to fail and all my sweetest singing out of tune  and as at dawn across the level mead on wings impetuous some wind will come and with its too harsh kisses break the reed which was its only instrument of song so my too stormy passions work me wrong and for excess of love my love is dumb  but surely unto thee mine eyes did show why i am silent and my lute unstrung else it were better we should part and go thou to some lips of sweeter melody and i to nurse the barren memory of unkissed kisses and songs never sung    poem  her voice    the wild bee reels from bough to bough with his furry coat and his gauzy wing now in a lilycup and now setting a jacinth bell aswing in his wandering sit closer love  it was here i trow i made that vow  swore that two lives should be like one as long as the seagull loved the sea as long as the sunflower sought the sun it shall be i said for eternity twixt you and me dear friend those times are over and done loves web is spun  look upward where the poplar trees sway and sway in the summer air here in the valley never a breeze scatters the thistledown but there great winds blow fair from the mighty murmuring mystical seas and the wavelashed leas  look upward where the white gull screams what does it see that we do not see is that a star or the lamp that gleams on some outward voyaging argosy ah can it be we have lived our lives in a land of dreams how sad it seems  sweet there is nothing left to say but this that love is never lost keen winter stabs the breasts of may whose crimson roses burst his frost ships tempesttossed will find a harbour in some bay and so we may  and there is nothing left to do but to kiss once again and part nay there is nothing we should rue i have my beautyyou your art nay do not start one world was not enough for two like me and you    poem  my voice    within this restless hurried modern world we took our hearts full pleasureyou and i and now the white sails of our ship are furled and spent the lading of our argosy  wherefore my cheeks before their time are wan for very weeping is my gladness fled sorrow has paled my young mouths vermilion and ruin draws the curtains of my bed  but all this crowded life has been to thee no more than lyre or lute or subtle spell of viols or the music of the sea that sleeps a mimic echo in the shell    poem  taedium vitae    to stab my youth with desperate knives to wear this paltry ages gaudy livery to let each base hand filch my treasury to mesh my soul within a womans hair and be mere fortunes lackeyed groomi swear i love it not these things are less to me than the thin foam that frets upon the sea less than the thistledown of summer air which hath no seed  better to stand aloof far from these slanderous fools who mock my life knowing me not better the lowliest roof fit for the meanest hind to sojourn in than to go back to that hoarse cave of strife where my white soul first kissed the mouth of sin    poem  humanitad    it is full winter now  the trees are bare save where the cattle huddle from the cold beneath the pine for it doth never wear the autumns gaudy livery whose gold her jealous brother pilfers but is true to the green doublet bitter is the wind as though it blew  from saturns cave a few thin wisps of hay lie on the sharp black hedges where the wain dragged the sweet pillage of a summers day from the low meadows up the narrow lane upon the halfthawed snow the bleating sheep press close against the hurdles and the shivering housedogs creep  from the shut stable to the frozen stream and back again disconsolate and miss the bawling shepherds and the noisy team and overhead in circling listlessness the cawing rooks whirl round the frosted stack or crowd the dripping boughs and in the fen the icepools crack  where the gaunt bittern stalks among the reeds and flaps his wings and stretches back his neck and hoots to see the moon across the meads limps the poor frightened hare a little speck and a stray seamew with its fretful cry flits like a sudden drift of snow against the dull grey sky  full winter  and the lusty goodman brings his load of faggots from the chilly byre and stamps his feet upon the hearth and flings the sappy billets on the waning fire and laughs to see the sudden lightening scare his children at their play and yetthe spring is in the air  already the slim crocus stirs the snow and soon yon blanched fields will bloom again with nodding cowslips for some lad to mow for with the first warm kisses of the rain the winters icy sorrow breaks to tears and the brown thrushes mate and with bright eyes the rabbit peers  from the dark warren where the fircones lie and treads one snowdrop under foot and runs over the mossy knoll and blackbirds fly across our path at evening and the suns stay longer with us ah how good to see grassgirdled spring in all her joy of laughing greenery  dance through the hedges till the early rose that sweet repentance of the thorny briar burst from its sheathed emerald and disclose the little quivering disk of golden fire which the bees know so well for with it come pale boyslove sopsinwine and daffadillies all in bloom  then up and down the field the sower goes while close behind the laughing younker scares with shrilly whoop the black and thievish crows and then the chestnuttree its glory wears and on the grass the creamy blossom falls in odorous excess and faint halfwhispered madrigals  steal from the bluebells nodding carillons each breezy morn and then white jessamine that star of its own heaven snapdragons with lolling crimson tongues and eglantine in dusty velvets clad usurp the bed and woodland empery and when the lingering rose hath shed  red leaf by leaf its folded panoply and pansies closed their purplelidded eyes chrysanthemums from gilded argosy unload their gaudy scentless merchandise and violets getting overbold withdraw from their shy nooks and scarlet berries dot the leafless haw  o happy field and o thrice happy tree soon will your queen in daisyflowered smock and crown of flowerdeluce trip down the lea soon will the lazy shepherds drive their flock back to the pasture by the pool and soon through the green leaves will float the hum of murmuring bees at noon  soon will the glade be bright with bellamour the flower which wantons love and those sweet nuns valelilies in their snowy vestiture will tell their beaded pearls and carnations with mitred dusky leaves will scent the wind and straggling travellersjoy each hedge with yellow stars will bind  dear bride of nature and most bounteous spring that canst give increase to the sweetbreathd kine and to the kid its little horns and bring the soft and silky blossoms to the vine where is that old nepenthe which of yore man got from poppy root and glossyberried mandragore  there was a time when any common bird could make me sing in unison a time when all the strings of boyish life were stirred to quick response or more melodious rhyme by every forest idylldo i change or rather doth some evil thing through thy fair pleasaunce range  nay nay thou art the same  tis i who seek to vex with sighs thy simple solitude and because fruitless tears bedew my cheek would have thee weep with me in brotherhood fool shall each wronged and restless spirit dare to taint such wine with the salt poison of own despair  thou art the same  tis i whose wretched soul takes discontent to be its paramour and gives its kingdom to the rude control of what should be its servitorfor sure wisdom is somewhere though the stormy sea contain it not and the huge deep answer tis not in me  to burn with one clear flame to stand erect in natural honour not to bend the knee in profitless prostrations whose effect is by itself condemned what alchemy can teach me this what herb medea brewed will bring the unexultant peace of essence not subdued  the minor chord which ends the harmony and for its answering brother waits in vain sobbing for incompleted melody dies a swans death but i the heir of pain a silent memnon with blank lidless eyes wait for the light and music of those suns which never rise  the quenchedout torch the lonely cypressgloom the little dust stored in the narrow urn the gentle xaipe of the attic tomb were not these better far than to return to my old fitful restless malady or spend my days within the voiceless cave of misery  nay for perchance that poppycrowned god is like the watcher by a sick mans bed who talks of sleep but gives it not his rod hath lost its virtue and when all is said death is too rude too obvious a key to solve one single secret in a lifes philosophy  and love that noble madness whose august and inextinguishable might can slay the soul with honeyed drugsalas i must from such sweet ruin play the runaway although too constant memory never can forget the arched splendour of those brows olympian  which for a little season made my youth so soft a swoon of exquisite indolence that all the chiding of more prudent truth seemed the thin voice of jealousyo hence thou huntress deadlier than artemis go seek some other quarry for of thy too perilous bliss  my lips have drunk enoughno more no more though love himself should turn his gilded prow back to the troubled waters of this shore where i am wrecked and stranded even now the chariot wheels of passion sweep too near hence  hence  i pass unto a life more barren more austere  more barrenay those arms will never lean down through the trellised vines and draw my soul in sweet reluctance through the tangled green some other head must wear that aureole for i am hers who loves not any man whose white and stainless bosom bears the sign gorgonian  let venus go and chuck her dainty page and kiss his mouth and toss his curly hair with net and spear and hunting equipage let young adonis to his tryst repair but me her fond and subtlefashioned spell delights no more though i could win her dearest citadel  ay though i were that laughing shepherd boy who from mount ida saw the little cloud pass over tenedos and lofty troy and knew the coming of the queen and bowed in wonder at her feet not for the sake of a new helen would i bid her hand the apple take  then rise supreme athena argentlimbed and if my lips be musicless inspire at least my life  was not thy glory hymned by one who gave to thee his sword and lyre like aeschylos at wellfought marathon and died to show that miltons england still could bear a son  and yet i cannot tread the portico and live without desire fear and pain or nurture that wise calm which long ago the grave athenian master taught to men selfpoised selfcentred and selfcomforted to watch the worlds vain phantasies go by with unbowed head  alas that serene brow those eloquent lips those eyes that mirrored all eternity rest in their own colonos an eclipse hath come on wisdom and mnemosyne is childless in the night which she had made for lofty secure flight athenas owl itself hath strayed  nor much with science do i care to climb although by strange and subtle witchery she drew the moon from heaven  the muse time unrolls her gorgeouscoloured tapestry to no less eager eyes often indeed in the great epic of polymnias scroll i love to read  how asia sent her myriad hosts to war against a little town and panoplied in gilded mail with jewelled scimitar whiteshielded purplecrested rode the mede between the waving poplars and the sea which men call artemisium till he saw thermopylae  its steep ravine spanned by a narrow wall and on the nearer side a little brood of careless lions holding festival and stood amazed at such hardihood and pitched his tent upon the reedy shore and stayed two days to wonder and then crept at midnight oer  some unfrequented height and coming down the autumn forests treacherously slew what sparta held most dear and was the crown of far eurotas and passed on nor knew how god had staked an evil net for him in the small bay at salamisand yet the page grows dim  its cadenced greek delights me not i feel with such a goodly time too out of tune to love it much  for like the dials wheel that from its blinded darkness strikes the noon yet never sees the sun so do my eyes restlessly follow that which from my cheated vision flies  o for one grand unselfish simple life to teach us what is wisdom speak ye hills of lone helvellyn for this note of strife shunned your untroubled crags and crystal rills where is that spirit which living blamelessly yet dared to kiss the smitten mouth of his own century  speak ye rydalian laurels where is he whose gentle head ye sheltered that pure soul whose gracious days of uncrowned majesty through lowliest conduct touched the lofty goal where love and duty mingle  him at least the most high laws were glad of he had sat at wisdoms feast  but we are learnings changelings know by rote the clarion watchword of each grecian school and follow none the flawless sword which smote the pagan hydra is an effete tool which we ourselves have blunted what man now shall scale the august ancient heights and to old reverence bow  one such indeed i saw but ichabod gone is that last dear son of italy who being man died for the sake of god and whose unrisen bones sleep peacefully o guard him guard him well my giottos tower thou marble lily of the lily town let not the lour  of the rude tempest vex his slumber or the arno with its tawny troubled gold oerleap its marge no mightier conqueror clomb the high capitol in the days of old when rome was indeed rome for liberty walked like a bride beside him at which sight pale mystery  fled shrieking to her farthest sombrest cell with an old man who grabbled rusty keys fled shuddering for that immemorial knell with which oblivion buries dynasties swept like a wounded eagle on the blast as to the holy heart of rome the great triumvir passed  he knew the holiest heart and heights of rome he drave the base wolf from the lions lair and now lies dead by that empyreal dome which overtops valdarno hung in air by brunelleschio melpomene breathe through thy melancholy pipe thy sweetest threnody  breathe through the tragic stops such melodies that joys self may grow jealous and the nine forget awhile their discreet emperies mourning for him who on romes lordliest shrine lit for mens lives the light of marathon and bare to sunforgotten fields the fire of the sun  o guard him guard him well my giottos tower let some young florentine each eventide bring coronals of that enchanted flower which the dim woods of vallombrosa hide and deck the marble tomb wherein he lies whose soul is as some mighty orb unseen of mortal eyes  some mighty orb whose cycled wanderings being tempestdriven to the farthest rim where chaos meets creation and the wings of the eternal chanting cherubim are pavilioned on nothing passed away into a moonless voidand yet though he is dust and clay  he is not dead the immemorial fates forbid it and the closing shears refrain lift up your heads ye everlasting gates ye argent clarions sound a loftier strain for the vile thing he hated lurks within its sombre house alone with god and memories of sin  still what avails it that she sought her cave that murderous mother of red harlotries at munich on the marble architrave the grecian boys die smiling but the seas which wash aegina fret in loneliness not mirroring their beauty so our lives grow colourless  for lack of our ideals if one star flame torchlike in the heavens the unjust swift daylight kills it and no trump of war can wake to passionate voice the silent dust which was mazzini once rich niobe for all her stony sorrows hath her sons but italy  what easter day shall make her children rise who were not gods yet suffered what sure feet shall find their graveclothes folded what clear eyes shall see them bodily  o it were meet to roll the stone from off the sepulchre and kiss the bleeding roses of their wounds in love of her  our italy our mother visible most blessed among nations and most sad for whose dear sake the young calabrian fell that day at aspromonte and was glad that in an age when god was bought and sold one man could die for liberty but we burnt out and cold  see honour smitten on the cheek and gyves bind the sweet feet of mercy  poverty creeps through our sunless lanes and with sharp knives cuts the warm throats of children stealthily and no word said o we are wretched men unworthy of our great inheritance where is the pen  of austere milton where the mighty sword which slew its master righteously the years have lost their ancient leader and no word breaks from the voiceless tripod on our ears while as a ruined mother in some spasm bears a base child and loathes it so our best enthusiasm  genders unlawful children anarchy freedoms own judas the vile prodigal licence who steals the gold of liberty and yet has nothing ignorance the real one fraticide since cain envy the asp that stings itself to anguish avarice whose palsied grasp  is in its extent stiffened moneyed greed for whose dull appetite men waste away amid the whirr of wheels and are the seed of things which slay their sower these each day sees rife in england and the gentle feet of beauty tread no more the stones of each unlovely street  what even cromwell spared is desecrated by weed and worm left to the stormy play of wind and beating snow or renovated by more destructful hands  times worst decay will wreathe its ruins with some loveliness but these new vandals can but make a rainproof barrenness  where is that art which bade the angels sing through lincolns lofty choir till the air seems from such marble harmonies to ring with sweeter song than common lips can dare to draw from actual reed ah where is now the cunning hand which made the flowering hawthorn branches bow  for southwells arch and carved the house of one who loved the lilies of the field with all our dearest english flowers the same sun rises for us  the seasons natural weave the same tapestry of green and grey the unchanged hills are with us  but that spirit hath passed away  and yet perchance it may be better so for tyranny is an incestuous queen murder her brother is her bedfellow and the plague chambers with her  in obscene and bloody paths her treacherous feet are set better the empty desert and a soul inviolate  for gentle brotherhood the harmony of living in the healthful air the swift clean beauty of strong limbs when men are free and women chaste these are the things which lift our souls up more than even agnolos gaunt blinded sibyl poring oer the scroll of human woes  or titians little maiden on the stair white as her own sweet lily and as tall or mona lisa smiling through her hair ah somehow life is bigger after all than any painted angel could we see the god that is within us  the old greek serenity  which curbs the passion of that level line of marble youths who with untroubled eyes and chastened limbs ride round athenas shrine and mirror her divine economies and balanced symmetry of what in man would else wage ceaseless warfarethis at least within the span  between our mothers kisses and the grave might so inform our lives that we could win such mighty empires that from her cave temptation would grow hoarse and pallid sin would walk ashamed of his adulteries and passion creep from out the house of lust with startled eyes  to make the body and the spirit one with all right things till no thing live in vain from morn to noon but in sweet unison with every pulse of flesh and throb of brain the soul in flawless essence high enthroned against all outer vain attack invincibly bastioned  mark with serene impartiality the strife of things and yet be comforted knowing that by the chain causality all separate existences are wed into one supreme whole whose utterance is joy or holier praise ah surely this were governance  of life in most august omnipresence through which the rational intellect would find in passion its expression and mere sense ignoble else lend fire to the mind and being joined with it in harmony more mystical than that which binds the stars planetary  strike from their several tones one octave chord whose cadence being measureless would fly through all the circling spheres then to its lord return refreshed with its new empery and more exultant powerthis indeed could we but reach it were to find the last the perfect creed  ah it was easy when the world was young to keep ones life free and inviolate from our sad lips another song is rung by our own hands our heads are desecrate wanderers in drear exile and dispossessed of what should be our own we can but feed on wild unrest  somehow the grace the bloom of things has flown and of all men we are most wretched who must live each others lives and not our own for very pitys sake and then undo all that we lived forit was otherwise when soul and body seemed to blend in mystic symphonies  but we have left those gentle haunts to pass with weary feet to the new calvary where we behold as one who in a glass sees his own face selfslain humanity and in the dumb reproach of that sad gaze learn what an awful phantom the red hand of man can raise  o smitten mouth  o forehead crowned with thorn o chalice of all common miseries thou for our sakes that loved thee not hast borne an agony of endless centuries and we were vain and ignorant nor knew that when we stabbed thy heart it was our own real hearts we slew  being ourselves the sowers and the seeds the night that covers and the lights that fade the spear that pierces and the side that bleeds the lips betraying and the life betrayed the deep hath calm  the moon hath rest  but we lords of the natural world are yet our own dread enemy  is this the end of all that primal force which in its changes being still the same from eyeless chaos cleft its upward course through ravenous seas and whirling rocks and flame till the suns met in heaven and began their cycles and the morning stars sang and the word was man  nay nay we are but crucified and though the bloody sweat falls from our brows like rain loosen the nailswe shall come down i know staunch the red woundswe shall be whole again no need have we of hyssopladen rod that which is purely human that is godlike that is god    poem  greek title    sweet i blame you not for mine the fault was had i not been made of common clay i had climbed the higher heights unclimbed yet seen the fuller air the larger day  from the wildness of my wasted passion i had struck a better clearer song lit some lighter light of freer freedom battled with some hydraheaded wrong  had my lips been smitten into music by the kisses that but made them bleed you had walked with bice and the angels on that verdant and enamelled mead  i had trod the road which dante treading saw the suns of seven circles shine ay perchance had seen the heavens opening as they opened to the florentine  and the mighty nations would have crowned me who am crownless now and without name and some orient dawn had found me kneeling on the threshold of the house of fame  i had sat within that marble circle where the oldest bard is as the young and the pipe is ever dropping honey and the lyres strings are ever strung  keats had lifted up his hymeneal curls from out the poppyseeded wine with ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead clasped the hand of noble love in mine  and at springtide when the appleblossoms brush the burnished bosom of the dove two young lovers lying in an orchard would have read the story of our love  would have read the legend of my passion known the bitter secret of my heart kissed as we have kissed but never parted as we two are fated now to part  for the crimson flower of our life is eaten by the cankerworm of truth and no hand can gather up the fallen withered petals of the rose of youth  yet i am not sorry that i loved youah what else had i a boy to do for the hungry teeth of time devour and the silentfooted years pursue  rudderless we drift athwart a tempest and when once the storm of youth is past without lyre without lute or chorus death the silent pilot comes at last  and within the grave there is no pleasure for the blindworm battens on the root and desire shudders into ashes and the tree of passion bears no fruit  ah what else had i to do but love you gods own mother was less dear to me and less dear the cytheraean rising like an argent lily from the sea  i have made my choice have lived my poems and though youth is gone in wasted days i have found the lovers crown of myrtle better than the poets crown of bays    poem  from spring days to winter for music    in the glad springtime when leaves were green o merrily the throstle sings i sought amid the tangled sheen love whom mine eyes had never seen o the glad dove has golden wings  between the blossoms red and white o merrily the throstle sings my love first came into my sight o perfect vision of delight o the glad dove has golden wings  the yellow apples glowed like fire o merrily the throstle sings o love too great for lip or lyre blown rose of love and of desire o the glad dove has golden wings  but now with snow the tree is grey ah sadly now the throstle sings my love is dead  ah welladay see at her silent feet i lay a dove with broken wings ah love ah love that thou wert slain fond dove fond dove return again    poem  tristitiae    greek text which cannot be reproduced  o well for him who lives at ease with garnered gold in wide domain nor heeds the splashing of the rain the crashing down of forest trees  o well for him who neer hath known the travail of the hungry years a father grey with grief and tears a mother weeping all alone  but well for him whose foot hath trod the weary road of toil and strife yet from the sorrows of his life builds ladders to be nearer god    poem  the true knowledge    greek text which cannot be reproduced  thou knowest all i seek in vain what lands to till or sow with seed the land is black with briar and weed nor cares for falling tears or rain  thou knowest all i sit and wait with blinded eyes and hands that fail till the last lifting of the veil and the first opening of the gate  thou knowest all i cannot see i trust i shall not live in vain i know that we shall meet again in some divine eternity    poem  le jardin    the lilys withered chalice falls around its rod of dusty gold and from the beechtrees on the wold the last woodpigeon coos and calls  the gaudy leonine sunflower hangs black and barren on its stalk and down the windy garden walk the dead leaves scatterhour by hour  pale privetpetals white as milk are blown into a snowy mass the roses lie upon the grass like little shreds of crimson silk    poem  la mer    a white mist drifts across the shrouds a wild moon in this wintry sky gleams like an angry lions eye out of a mane of tawny clouds  the muffled steersman at the wheel is but a shadow in the gloom and in the throbbing engineroom leap the long rods of polished steel  the shattered storm has left its trace upon this huge and heaving dome for the thin threads of yellow foam float on the waves like ravelled lace    poem  under the balcony    o beautiful star with the crimson mouth o moon with the brows of gold rise up rise up from the odorous south and light for my love her way lest her little feet should stray on the windy hill and the wold o beautiful star with the crimson mouth o moon with the brows of gold  o ship that shakes on the desolate sea o ship with the wet white sail put in put in to the port to me for my love and i would go to the land where the daffodils blow in the heart of a violet dale o ship that shakes on the desolate sea o ship with the wet white sail  o rapturous bird with the low sweet note o bird that sits on the spray sing on sing on from your soft brown throat and my love in her little bed will listen and lift her head from the pillow and come my way o rapturous bird with the low sweet note o bird that sits on the spray  o blossom that hangs in the tremulous air o blossom with lips of snow come down come down for my love to wear you will die on her head in a crown you will die in a fold of her gown to her little light heart you will go o blossom that hangs in the tremulous air o blossom with lips of snow    poem  the harlots house    we caught the tread of dancing feet we loitered down the moonlit street and stopped beneath the harlots house  inside above the din and fray we heard the loud musicians play the treues liebes herz of strauss  like strange mechanical grotesques making fantastic arabesques the shadows raced across the blind  we watched the ghostly dancers spin to sound of horn and violin like black leaves wheeling in the wind  like wirepulled automatons slim silhouetted skeletons went sidling through the slow quadrille  then took each other by the hand and danced a stately saraband their laughter echoed thin and shrill  sometimes a clockwork puppet pressed a phantom lover to her breast sometimes they seemed to try to sing  sometimes a horrible marionette came out and smoked its cigarette upon the steps like a live thing  then turning to my love i said the dead are dancing with the dead the dust is whirling with the dust  but sheshe heard the violin and left my side and entered in love passed into the house of lust  then suddenly the tune went false the dancers wearied of the waltz the shadows ceased to wheel and whirl  and down the long and silent street the dawn with silversandalled feet crept like a frightened girl    poem  le jardin des tuileries    this winter air is keen and cold and keen and cold this winter sun but round my chair the children run like little things of dancing gold  sometimes about the painted kiosk the mimic soldiers strut and stride sometimes the blueeyed brigands hide in the bleak tangles of the bosk  and sometimes while the old nurse cons her book they steal across the square and launch their paper navies where huge triton writhes in greenish bronze  and now in mimic flight they flee and now they rush a boisterous band and tiny hand on tiny hand climb up the black and leafless tree  ah cruel tree if i were you and children climbed me for their sake though it be winter i would break into spring blossoms white and blue    poem  on the sale by auction of keats love letters    these are the letters which endymion wrote to one he loved in secret and apart and now the brawlers of the auction mart bargain and bid for each poor blotted note ay for each separate pulse of passion quote the merchants price  i think they love not art who break the crystal of a poets heart that small and sickly eyes may glare and gloat  is it not said that many years ago in a far eastern town some soldiers ran with torches through the midnight and began to wrangle for mean raiment and to throw dice for the garments of a wretched man not knowing the gods wonder or his woe    poem  the new remorse    the sin was mine i did not understand so now is music prisoned in her cave save where some ebbing desultory wave frets with its restless whirls this meagre strand and in the withered hollow of this land hath summer dug herself so deep a grave that hardly can the leaden willow crave one silver blossom from keen winters hand  but who is this who cometh by the shore nay love look up and wonder  who is this who cometh in dyed garments from the south it is thy newfound lord and he shall kiss the yet unravished roses of thy mouth and i shall weep and worship as before    poem  le panneau    under the rosetrees dancing shade there stands a little ivory girl pulling the leaves of pink and pearl with pale green nails of polished jade  the red leaves fall upon the mould the white leaves flutter one by one down to a blue bowl where the sun like a great dragon writhes in gold  the white leaves float upon the air the red leaves flutter idly down some fall upon her yellow gown and some upon her raven hair  she takes an amber lute and sings and as she sings a silver crane begins his scarlet neck to strain and flap his burnished metal wings  she takes a lute of amber bright and from the thicket where he lies her lover with his almond eyes watches her movements in delight  and now she gives a cry of fear and tiny tears begin to start a thorn has wounded with its dart the pinkveined seashell of her ear  and now she laughs a merry note there has fallen a petal of the rose just where the yellow satin shows the blueveined flower of her throat  with pale green nails of polished jade pulling the leaves of pink and pearl there stands a little ivory girl under the rosetrees dancing shade    poem  les ballons    against these turbid turquoise skies the light and luminous balloons dip and drift like satin moons drift like silken butterflies  reel with every windy gust rise and reel like dancing girls float like strange transparent pearls fall and float like silver dust  now to the low leaves they cling each with coy fantastic pose each a petal of a rose straining at a gossamer string  then to the tall trees they climb like thin globes of amethyst wandering opals keeping tryst with the rubies of the lime    poem  canzonet    i have no

not come again no horned faun treads down the yellow leas no god at dawn steals through the olive trees  hylas is dead nor will he eer divine those little red rosepetalled lips of thine on the high hill no ivory dryads play silver and still sinks the sad autumn day    poem  symphony in yellow    an omnibus across the bridge crawls like a yellow butterfly and here and there a passerby shows like a little restless midge  big barges full of yellow hay are moored against the shadowy wharf and like a yellow silken scarf the thick fog hangs along the quay  the yellow leaves begin to fade and flutter from the temple elms and at my feet the pale green thames lies like a rod of rippled jade    poem  in the forest    out of the midwoods twilight into the meadows dawn ivory limbed and

parted too long  could the passionate past that is fled call back its dead could we live it all over again were it worth the pain  i remember we used to meet by an ivied seat and you warbled each pretty word with the air of a bird  and your voice had a quaver in it just like a linnet and shook as the blackbirds throat with its last big note  and your eyes they were green and grey like an april day but lit into amethyst when i stooped and kissed  and your mouth it would never smile for a long long while then it rippled all over with laughter five minutes after  you were always afraid of a shower just like a flower i remember you started and ran when the rain began  i remember i never could catch you for no one could match you you had wonderful luminous fleet little wings to your feet  i remember your hairdid i tie it for it always ran riot like a tangled sunbeam of gold these things are old  i remember so well the room and the lilac bloom that beat at the dripping pane in the warm june rain  and the colour of your gown it was amberbrown and two yellow satin bows from your shoulders rose  and the handkerchief of french lace which you held to your face had a small tear left a stain or was it the rain  on your hand as it waved adieu there were veins of blue in your voice as it said goodbye was a petulant cry  you have only wasted your life ah that was the knife when i rushed through the garden gate it was all too late  could we live it over again were it worth the pain could the passionate past that is fled call back its dead  well if my heart must break dear love for your sake it will break in music i know poets hearts break so  but strange that i was not told that the brain can hold in a tiny ivory cell gods heaven and hell    poem  desespoir    the seasons send their ruin as they go for in the spring the narciss shows its head nor withers till the rose has flamed to red and in the autumn purple violets blow and the slim crocus stirs the winter snow wherefore yon leafless trees will bloom again and this grey land grow green with summer rain and send up cowslips for some boy to mow  but what of life whose bitter hungry sea flows at our heels and gloom of sunless night covers the days which never more return ambition love and all the thoughts that burn we lose too soon and only find delight in withered husks of some dead memory    poem  pandouble villanelle    i  o goatfoot god of arcady this modern world is grey and old and what remains to us of thee  no more the shepherd lads in glee throw apples at thy wattled fold o goatfoot god of arcady  nor through the laurels can one see thy soft brown limbs thy beard of gold and what remains to us of thee  and dull and dead our thames would be for here the winds are chill and cold o goatfoot god of arcady  then keep the tomb of helice thine olivewoods thy vineclad wold and what remains to us of thee  though many an unsung elegy sleeps in the reeds our rivers hold o goatfoot god of arcady ah what remains to us of thee  ii  ah leave the hills of arcady thy satyrs and their wanton play this modern world hath need of thee  no nymph or faun indeed have we for faun and nymph are old and grey ah leave the hills of arcady  this is the land where liberty lit gravebrowed milton on his way this modern world hath need of thee  a land of ancient chivalry where gentle sidney saw the day ah leave the hills of arcady  this fierce sealion of the sea this england lacks some stronger lay this modern world hath need of thee  then blow some trumpet loud and free and give thine oaten pipe away ah leave the hills of arcady this modern world hath need of thee    poem  the sphinx    to marcel schwob in friendship and in admiration  in a dim corner of my room for longer than my fancy thinks a beautiful and silent sphinx has watched me through the shifting gloom  inviolate and immobile she does not rise she does not stir for silver moons are naught to her and naught to her the suns that reel  red follows grey across the air the waves of moonlight ebb and flow but with the dawn she does not go and in the nighttime she is there  dawn follows dawn and nights grow old and all the while this curious cat lies couching on the chinese mat with eyes of satin rimmed with gold  upon the mat she lies and leers and on the tawny throat of her flutters the soft and silky fur or ripples to her pointed ears  come forth my lovely seneschal so somnolent so statuesque come forth you exquisite grotesque half woman and half animal  come forth my lovely languorous sphinx and put your head upon my knee and let me stroke your throat and see your body spotted like the lynx  and let me touch those curving claws of yellow ivory and grasp the tail that like a monstrous asp coils round your heavy velvet paws   a thousand weary centuries are thine while i have hardly seen some twenty summers cast their green for autumns gaudy liveries  but you can read the hieroglyphs on the great sandstone obelisks and you have talked with basilisks and you have looked on hippogriffs  o tell me were you standing by when isis to osiris knelt and did you watch the egyptian melt her union for antony  and drink the jeweldrunken wine and bend her head in mimic awe to see the huge proconsul draw the salted tunny from the brine  and did you mark the cyprian kiss white adon on his catafalque and did you follow amenalk the god of heliopolis  and did you talk with thoth and did you hear the moonhorned io weep and know the painted kings who sleep beneath the wedgeshaped pyramid   lift up your large black satin eyes which are like cushions where one sinks fawn at my feet fantastic sphinx and sing me all your memories  sing to me of the jewish maid who wandered with the holy child and how you led them through the wild and how they slept beneath your shade  sing to me of that odorous green eve when crouching by the marge you heard from adrians gilded barge the laughter of antinous  and lapped the stream and fed your drouth and watched with hot and hungry stare the ivory body of that rare young slave with his pomegranate mouth  sing to me of the labyrinth in which the twi formed bull was stalled sing to me of the night you crawled across the temples granite plinth  when through the purple corridors the screaming scarlet ibis flew in terror and a horrid dew dripped from the moaning mandragores  and the great torpid crocodile within the tank shed slimy tears and tare the jewels from his ears and staggered back into the nile  and the priests cursed you with shrill psalms as in your claws you seized their snake and crept away with it to slake your passion by the shuddering palms   who were your lovers who were they who wrestled for you in the dust which was the vessel of your lust  what leman had you every day  did giant lizards come and crouch before you on the reedy banks did gryphons with great metal flanks leap on you in your trampled couch  did monstrous hippopotami come sidling toward you in the mist did giltscaled dragons writhe and twist with passion as you passed them by  and from the brickbuilt lycian tomb what horrible chimera came with fearful heads and fearful flame to breed new wonders from your womb   or had you shameful secret quests and did you harry to your home some nereid coiled in amber foam with curious rock crystal breasts  or did you treading through the froth call to the brown sidonian for tidings of leviathan leviathan or behemoth  or did you when the sun was set climb up the cactuscovered slope to meet your swarthy ethiop whose body was of polished jet  or did you while the earthen skiffs dropped down the grey nilotic flats at twilight and the flickering bats flew round the temples triple glyphs  steal to the border of the bar and swim across the silent lake and slink into the vault and make the pyramid your lupanar  till from each black sarcophagus rose up the painted swathed dead or did you lure unto your bed the ivoryhorned tragelaphos  or did you love the god of flies who plagued the hebrews and was splashed with wine unto the waist or pasht who had green beryls for her eyes  or that young god the tyrian who was more amorous than the dove of ashtaroth or did you love the god of the assyrian  whose wings like strange transparent talc rose high above his hawkfaced head painted with silver and with red and ribbed with rods of oreichalch  or did huge apis from his car leap down and lay before your feet big blossoms of the honeysweet and honey coloured nenuphar   how subtlesecret is your smile  did you love none then  nay i know great ammon was your bedfellow  he lay with you beside the nile  the riverhorses in the slime trumpeted when they saw him come odorous with syrian galbanum and smeared with spikenard and with thyme  he came along the river bank like some tall galley argentsailed he strode across the waters mailed in beauty and the waters sank  he strode across the desert sand  he reached the valley where you lay he waited till the dawn of day  then touched your black breasts with his hand  you kissed his mouth with mouths of flame you made the horned god your own you stood behind him on his throne  you called him by his secret name  you whispered monstrous oracles into the caverns of his ears with blood of goats and blood of steers you taught him monstrous miracles  white ammon was your bedfellow  your chamber was the steaming nile and with your curved archaic smile you watched his passion come and go   with syrian oils his brows were bright and widespread as a tent at noon his marble limbs made pale the moon and lent the day a larger light  his long hair was nine cubits span and coloured like that yellow gem which hidden in their garments hem the merchants bring from kurdistan  his face was as the must that lies upon a vat of newmade wine the seas could not insapphirine the perfect azure of his eyes  his thick soft throat was white as milk and threaded with thin veins of blue and curious pearls like frozen dew were broidered on his flowing silk   on pearl and porphyry pedestalled he was too bright to look upon for on his ivory breast there shone the wondrous oceanemerald  that mystic moonlit jewel which some diver of the colchian caves had found beneath the blackening waves and carried to the colchian witch  before his gilded galiot ran naked vinewreathed corybants and lines of swaying elephants knelt down to draw his chariot  and lines of swarthy nubians bare up his litter as he rode down the great granitepaven road between the nodding peacockfans  the merchants brought him steatite from sidon in their painted ships the meanest cup that touched his lips was fashioned from a chrysolite  the merchants brought him cedar chests of rich apparel bound with cords his train was borne by memphian lords  young kings were glad to be his guests  ten hundred shaven priests did bow to ammons altar day and night ten hundred lamps did wave their light through ammons carven houseand now  foul snake and speckled adder with their young ones crawl from stone to stone for ruined is the house and prone the great rosemarble monolith  wild ass or trotting jackal comes and couches in the mouldering gates wild satyrs call unto their mates across the fallen fluted drums  and on the summit of the pile the bluefaced ape of horus sits and gibbers while the figtree splits the pillars of the peristyle   the god is scattered here and there  deep hidden in the windy sand i saw his giant granite hand still clenched in impotent despair  and many a wandering caravan of stately negroes silkenshawled crossing the desert halts appalled before the neck that none can span  and many a bearded bedouin draws back his yellowstriped burnous to gaze upon the titan thews of him who was thy paladin   go seek his fragments on the moor and wash them in the evening dew and from their pieces make anew thy mutilated paramour  go seek them where they lie alone and from their broken pieces make thy bruised bedfellow  and wake mad passions in the senseless stone  charm his dull ear with syrian hymns he loved your body oh be kind pour spikenard on his hair and wind soft rolls of linen round his limbs  wind round his head the figured coins stain with red fruits those pallid lips weave purple for his shrunken hips and purple for his barren loins   away to egypt  have no fear  only one god has ever died only one god has let his side be wounded by a soldiers spear  but these thy lovers are not dead  still by the hundredcubit gate dogfaced anubis sits in state with lotuslilies for thy head  still from his chair of porphyry gaunt memnon strains his lidless eyes across the empty land and cries each yellow morning unto thee  and nilus with his broken horn lies in his black and oozy bed and till thy coming will not spread his waters on the withering corn  your lovers are not dead i know  they will rise up and hear your voice and clash their cymbals and rejoice and run to kiss your mouth  and so  set wings upon your argosies  set horses to your ebon car back to your nile  or if you are grown sick of dead divinities  follow some roving lions spoor across the copper coloured plain reach out and hale him by the mane and bid him be your paramour  couch by his side upon the grass and set your white teeth in his throat and when you hear his dying note lash your long flanks of polished brass  and take a tiger for your mate whose amber sides are flecked with black and ride upon his gilded back in triumph through the theban gate  and toy with him in amorous jests and when he turns and snarls and gnaws o smite him with your jasper claws and bruise him with your agate breasts   why are you tarrying  get hence  i weary of your sullen ways i weary of your steadfast gaze your somnolent magnificence  your horrible and heavy breath makes the light flicker in the lamp and on my brow i feel the damp and dreadful dews of night and death  your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver in some stagnant lake your tongue is like a scarlet snake that dances to fantastic tunes  your pulse makes poisonous melodies and your black throat is like the hole left by some torch or burning coal on saracenic tapestries  away  the sulphurcoloured stars are hurrying through the western gate away  or it may be too late to climb their silent silver cars  see the dawn shivers round the grey giltdialled towers and the rain streams down each diamonded pane and blurs with tears the wannish day  what snaketressed fury fresh from hell with uncouth gestures and unclean stole from the poppydrowsy queen and led you to a students cell   what songless tongueless ghost of sin crept through the curtains of the night and saw my taper burning bright and knocked and bade you enter in  are there not others more accursed whiter with leprosies than i are abana and pharphar dry that you come here to slake your thirst  get hence you loathsome mystery  hideous animal get hence you wake in me each bestial sense you make me what i would not be  you make my creed a barren sham you wake foul dreams of sensual life and atys with his bloodstained knife were better than the thing i am  false sphinx  false sphinx  by reedy styx old charon leaning on his oar waits for my coin  go thou before and leave me to my crucifix  whose pallid burden sick with pain watches the world with wearied eyes and weeps for every soul that dies and weeps for every soul in vain    poem  the ballad of reading gaol    in memoriam c t w sometime trooper of the royal horse guards obiit hm prison reading berkshire july 7 1896  i  he did not wear his scarlet coat for blood and wine are red and blood and wine were on his hands when they found him with the dead the poor dead woman whom he loved and murdered in her bed  he walked amongst the trial men in a suit of shabby grey a cricket cap was on his head and his step seemed light and gay but i never saw a man who looked so wistfully at the day  i never saw a man who looked with such a wistful eye upon that little tent of blue which prisoners call the sky and at every drifting cloud that went with sails of silver by  i walked with other souls in pain within another ring and was wondering if the man had done a great or little thing when a voice behind me whispered low that fellows got to swing  dear christ the very prison walls suddenly seemed to reel and the sky above my head became like a casque of scorching steel and though i was a soul in pain my pain i could not feel  i only knew what hunted thought quickened his step and why he looked upon the garish day with such a wistful eye the man had killed the thing he loved and so he had to die   yet each man kills the thing he loves by each let this be heard some do it with a bitter look some with a flattering word the coward does it with a kiss the brave man with a sword  some kill their love when they are young and some when they are old some strangle with the hands of lust some with the hands of gold the kindest use a knife because the dead so soon grow cold  some love too little some too long some sell and others buy some do the deed with many tears and some without a sigh for each man kills the thing he loves yet each man does not die  he does not die a death of shame on a day of dark disgrace nor have a noose about his neck nor a cloth upon his face nor drop feet foremost through the floor into an empty space   he does not sit with silent men who watch him night and day who watch him when he tries to weep and when he tries to pray who watch him lest himself should rob the prison of its prey  he does not wake at dawn to see dread figures throng his room the shivering chaplain robed in white the sheriff stern with gloom and the governor all in shiny black with the yellow face of doom  he does not rise in piteous haste to put on convictclothes while some coarsemouthed doctor gloats and notes each new and nervetwitched pose fingering a watch whose little ticks are like horrible hammerblows  he does not know that sickening thirst that sands ones throat before the hangman with his gardeners gloves slips through the padded door and binds one with three leathern thongs that the throat may thirst no more  he does not bend his head to hear the burial office read nor while the terror of his soul tells him he is not dead cross his own coffin as he moves into the hideous shed  he does not stare upon the air through a little roof of glass he does not pray with lips of clay for his agony to pass nor feel upon his shuddering cheek the kiss of caiaphas   ii   six weeks our guardsman walked the yard in the suit of shabby grey his cricket cap was on his head and his step seemed light and gay but i never saw a man who looked so wistfully at the day  i never saw a man who looked with such a wistful eye upon that little tent of blue which prisoners call the sky and at every wandering cloud that trailed its ravelled fleeces by  he did not wring his hands as do those witless men who dare to try to rear the changeling hope in the cave of black despair he only looked upon the sun and drank the morning air  he did not wring his hands nor weep nor did he peek or pine but he drank the air as though it held some healthful anodyne with open mouth he drank the sun as though it had been wine  and i and all the souls in pain who tramped the other ring forgot if we ourselves had done a great or little thing and watched with gaze of dull amaze the man who had to swing  and strange it was to see him pass with a step so light and gay and strange it was to see him look so wistfully at the day and strange it was to think that he had such a debt to pay   for oak and elm have pleasant leaves that in the springtime shoot but grim to see is the gallowstree with its adderbitten root and green or dry a man must die before it bears its fruit  the loftiest place is that seat of grace for which all worldlings try but who would stand in hempen band upon a scaffold high and through a murderers collar take his last look at the sky  it is sweet to dance to violins when love and life are fair to dance to flutes to dance to lutes is delicate and rare but it is not sweet with nimble feet to dance upon the air  so with curious eyes and sick surmise we watched him day by day and wondered if each one of us would end the selfsame way for none can tell to what red hell his sightless soul may stray  at last the dead man walked no more amongst the trial men and i knew that he was standing up in the black docks dreadful pen and that never would i see his face in gods sweet world again  like two doomed ships that pass in storm we had crossed each others way but we made no sign we said no word we had no word to say for we did not meet in the holy night but in the shameful day  a prison wall was round us both two outcast men we were the world had thrust us from its heart and god from out his care and the iron gin that waits for sin had caught us in its snare   iii   in debtors yard the stones are hard and the dripping wall is high so it was there he took the air beneath the leaden sky and by each side a warder walked for fear the man might die  or else he sat with those who watched his anguish night and day who watched him when he rose to weep and when he crouched to pray who watched him lest himself should rob their scaffold of its prey  the governor was strong upon the regulations act the doctor said that death was but a scientific fact and twice a day the chaplain called and left a little tract  and twice a day he smoked his pipe and drank his quart of beer his soul was resolute and held no hidingplace for fear he often said that he was glad the hangmans hands were near  but why he said so strange a thing no warder dared to ask for he to whom a watchers doom is given as his task must set a lock upon his lips and make his face a mask  or else he might be moved and try to comfort or console and what should human pity do pent up in murderers hole what word of grace in such a place could help a brothers soul   with slouch and swing around the ring we trod the fools parade we did not care  we knew we were the devils own brigade and shaven head and feet of lead make a merry masquerade  we tore the tarry rope to shreds with blunt and bleeding nails we rubbed the doors and scrubbed the floors and cleaned the shining rails and rank by rank we soaped the plank and clattered with the pails  we sewed the sacks we broke the stones we turned the dusty drill we banged the tins and bawled the hymns and sweated on the mill but in the heart of every man terror was lying still  so still it lay that every day crawled like a weedclogged wave and we forgot the bitter lot that waits for fool and knave till once as we tramped in from work we passed an open grave  with yawning mouth the yellow hole gaped for a living thing the very mud cried out for blood to the thirsty asphalte ring and we knew that ere one dawn grew fair some prisoner had to swing  right in we went with soul intent on death and dread and doom the hangman with his little bag went shuffling through the gloom and each man trembled as he crept into his numbered tomb   that night the empty corridors were full of forms of fear and up and down the iron town stole feet we could not hear and through the bars that hide the stars white faces seemed to peer  he lay as one who lies and dreams in a pleasant meadowland the watchers watched him as he slept and could not understand how one could sleep so sweet a sleep with a hangman close at hand  but there is no sleep when men must weep who never yet have wept so wethe fool the fraud the knave that endless vigil kept and through each brain on hands of pain anothers terror crept  alas it is a fearful thing to feel anothers guilt for right within the sword of sin pierced to its poisoned hilt and as molten lead were the tears we shed for the blood we had not spilt  the warders with their shoes of felt crept by each padlocked door and peeped and saw with eyes of awe grey figures on the floor and wondered why men knelt to pray who never prayed before  all through the night we knelt and prayed mad mourners of a corse the troubled plumes of midnight were the plumes upon a hearse and bitter wine upon a sponge was the savour of remorse   the grey cock crew the red cock crew but never came the day and crooked shapes of terror crouched in the corners where we lay and each evil sprite that walks by night before us seemed to play  they glided past they glided fast like travellers through a mist they mocked the moon in a rigadoon of delicate turn and twist and with formal pace and loathsome grace the phantoms kept their tryst  with mop and mow we saw them go slim shadows hand in hand about about in ghostly rout they trod a saraband and the damned grotesques made arabesques like the wind upon the sand  with the pirouettes of marionettes they tripped on pointed tread but with flutes of fear they filled the ear as their grisly masque they led and loud they sang and long they sang for they sang to wake the dead  oho they cried the world is wide but fettered limbs go lame and once or twice to throw the dice is a gentlemanly game but he does not win who plays with sin in the secret house of shame  no things of air these antics were that frolicked with such glee to men whose lives were held in gyves and whose feet might not go free ah wounds of christ they were living things most terrible to see  around around they waltzed and wound some wheeled in smirking pairs with the mincing step of a demirep some sidled up the stairs and with subtle sneer and fawning leer each helped us at our prayers  the morning wind began to moan but still the night went on through its giant loom the web of gloom crept till each thread was spun and as we prayed we grew afraid of the justice of the sun  the moaning wind went wandering round the weeping prisonwall till like a wheel of turning steel we felt the minutes crawl o moaning wind what had we done to have such a seneschal  at last i saw the shadowed bars like a lattice wrought in lead move right across the whitewashed wall that faced my threeplank bed and i knew that somewhere in the world gods dreadful dawn was red  at six oclock we cleaned our cells at seven all was still but the sough and swing of a mighty wing the prison seemed to fill for the lord of death with icy breath had entered in to kill  he did not pass in purple pomp nor ride a moonwhite steed three yards of cord and a sliding board are all the gallows need so with rope of shame the herald came to do the secret deed  we were as men who through a fen of filthy darkness grope we did not dare to breathe a prayer or to give our anguish scope something was dead in each of us and what was dead was hope  for mans grim justice goes its way and will not swerve aside it slays the weak it slays the strong it has a deadly stride with iron heel it slays the strong the monstrous parricide  we waited for the stroke of eight each tongue was thick with thirst for the stroke of eight is the stroke of fate that makes a man accursed and fate will use a running noose for the best man and the worst  we had no other thing to do save to wait for the sign to come so like things of stone in a valley lone quiet we sat and dumb but each mans heart beat thick and quick like a madman on a drum  with sudden shock the prisonclock smote on the shivering air and from all the gaol rose up a wail of impotent despair like the sound that frightened marshes hear from some leper in his lair  and as one sees most fearful things in the crystal of a dream we saw the greasy hempen rope hooked to the blackened beam and heard the prayer the hangmans snare strangled into a scream  and all the woe that moved him so that he gave that bitter cry and the wild regrets and the bloody sweats none knew so well as i for he who lives more lives than one more deaths than one must die   iv   there is no chapel on the day on which they hang a man the chaplains heart is far too sick or his face is far too wan or there is that written in his eyes which none should look upon  so they kept us close till nigh on noon and then they rang the bell and the warders with their jingling keys opened each listening cell and down the iron stair we tramped each from his separate hell  out into gods sweet air we went but not in wonted way for this mans face was white with fear and that mans face was grey and i never saw sad men who looked so wistfully at the day  i never saw sad men who looked with such a wistful eye upon that little tent of blue we prisoners called the sky and at every careless cloud that passed in happy freedom by  but there were those amongst us all who walked with downcast head and knew that had each got his due they should have died instead he had but killed a thing that lived whilst they had killed the dead  for he who sins a second time wakes a dead soul to pain and draws it from its spotted shroud and makes it bleed again and makes it bleed great gouts of blood and makes it bleed in vain   like ape or clown in monstrous garb with crooked arrows starred silently we went round and round the slippery asphalte yard silently we went round and round and no man spoke a word  silently we went round and round and through each hollow mind the memory of dreadful things rushed like a dreadful wind and horror stalked before each man and terror crept behind   the warders strutted up and down and kept their herd of brutes their uniforms were spick and span and they wore their sunday suits but we knew the work they had been at by the quicklime on their boots  for where a grave had opened wide there was no grave at all only a stretch of mud and sand by the hideous prisonwall and a little heap of burning lime that the man should have his pall  for he has a pall this wretched man such as few men can claim deep down below a prisonyard naked for greater shame he lies with fetters on each foot wrapt in a sheet of flame  and all the while the burning lime eats flesh and bone away it eats the brittle bone by night and the soft flesh by day it eats the flesh and bone by turns but it eats the heart alway   for three long years they will not sow or root or seedling there for three long years the unblessed spot will sterile be and bare and look upon the wondering sky with unreproachful stare  they think a murderers heart would taint each simple seed they sow it is not true  gods kindly earth is kindlier than men know and the red rose would but blow more red the white rose whiter blow  out of his mouth a red red rose out of his heart a white for who can say by what strange way christ brings his will to light since the barren staff the pilgrim bore bloomed in the great popes sight  but neither milkwhite rose nor red may bloom in prisonair the shard the pebble and the flint are what they give us there for flowers have been known to heal a common mans despair  so never will winered rose or white petal by petal fall on that stretch of mud and sand that lies by the hideous prisonwall to tell the men who tramp the yard that gods son died for all   yet though the hideous prisonwall still hems him round and round and a spirit may not walk by night that is with fetters bound and a spirit may but weep that lies in such unholy ground  he is at peacethis wretched man at peace or will be soon there is no thing to make him mad nor does terror walk at noon for the lampless earth in which he lies has neither sun nor moon  they hanged him as a beast is hanged they did not even toll a requiem that might have brought rest to his startled soul but hurriedly they took him out and hid him in a hole  they stripped him of his canvas clothes and gave him to the flies they mocked the swollen purple throat and the stark and staring eyes and with laughter loud they heaped the shroud in which their convict lies  the chaplain would not kneel to pray by his dishonoured grave nor mark it with that blessed cross that christ for sinners gave because the man was one of those whom christ came down to save  yet all is well he has but passed to lifes appointed bourne and alien tears will fill for him pitys longbroken urn for his mourners will be outcast men and outcasts always mourn   v   i know not whether laws be right or whether laws be wrong all that we know who lie in gaol is that the wall is strong and that each day is like a year a year whose days are long  but this i know that every law that men have made for man since first man took his brothers life and the sad world began but straws the wheat and saves the chaff with a most evil fan  this too i knowand wise it were if each could know the same that every prison that men build is built with bricks of shame and bound with bars lest christ should see how men their brothers maim  with bars they blur the gracious moon and blind the goodly sun and they do well to hide their hell for in it things are done that son of god nor son of man ever should look upon   the vilest deeds like poison weeds bloom well in prisonair it is only what is good in man that wastes and withers there pale anguish keeps the heavy gate and the warder is despair  for they starve the little frightened child till it weeps both night and day and they scourge the weak and flog the fool and gibe the old and grey and some grow mad and all grow bad and none a word may say  each narrow cell in which we dwell is a foul and dark latrine and the fetid breath of living death chokes up each grated screen and all but lust is turned to dust in humanitys machine  the brackish water that we drink creeps with a loathsome slime and the bitter bread they weigh in scales is full of chalk and lime and sleep will not lie down but walks wildeyed and cries to time   but though lean hunger and green thirst like asp with adder fight we have little care of prison fare for what chills and kills outright is that every stone one lifts by day becomes ones heart by night  with midnight always in ones heart and twilight in ones cell we turn the crank or tear the rope each in his separate hell and the silence is more awful far than the sound of a brazen bell  and never a human voice comes near to speak a gentle word and the eye that watches through the door is pitiless and hard and by all forgot we rot and rot with soul and body marred  and thus we rust lifes iron chain degraded and alone and some men curse and some men weep and some men make no moan but gods eternal laws are kind and break the heart of stone   and every human heart that breaks in prisoncell or yard is as that broken box that gave its treasure to the lord and filled the unclean lepers house with the scent of costliest nard  ah happy they whose hearts can break and peace of pardon win how else may man make straight his plan and cleanse his soul from sin how else but through a broken heart may lord christ enter in   and he of the swollen purple throat and the stark and staring eyes waits for the holy hands that took the thief to paradise and a broken and a contrite heart the lord will not despise  the man in red who reads the law gave him three weeks of life three little weeks in which to heal his soul of his souls strife and cleanse from every blot of blood the hand that held the knife  and with tears of blood he cleansed the hand the hand that held the steel for only blood can wipe out blood and only tears can heal and the crimson stain that was of cain became christs snowwhite seal   vi   in reading gaol by reading town there is a pit of shame and in it lies a wretched man eaten by teeth of flame in a burning windingsheet he lies and his grave has got no name  and there till christ call forth the dead in silence let him lie no need to waste the foolish tear or heave the windy sigh the man had killed the thing he loved and so he had to die  and all men kill the thing they love by all let this be heard some do it with a bitter look some with a flattering word the coward does it with a kiss the brave man with a sword    poem  ravenna    newdigate prize poem recited in the sheldonian theatre oxford june 26th 1878  to my friend george fleming author of the nile novel and mirage   i   a year ago i breathed the italian air and yet methinks this northern spring is fair these fields made golden with the flower of march the throstle singing on the feathered larch the cawing rooks the wooddoves fluttering by the little clouds that race across the sky and fair the violets gentle drooping head the primrose pale for love uncomforted the rose that burgeons on the climbing briar the crocusbed that seems a moon of fire roundgirdled with a purple marriagering and all the flowers of our english spring fond snowdrops and the brightstarred daffodil up starts the lark beside the murmuring mill and breaks the gossamerthreads of early dew and down the river like a flame of blue keen as an arrow flies the waterking while the brown linnets in the greenwood sing a year agoit seems a little time since last i saw that lordly southern clime where flower and fruit to purple radiance blow and like bright lamps the fabled apples glow full spring it wasand by rich flowering vines dark olivegroves and noble forestpines i rode at will the moist glad air was sweet the white road rang beneath my horses feet and musing on ravennas ancient name i watched the day till marked with wounds of flame the turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned  o how my heart with boyish passion burned when far away across the sedge and mere i saw that holy city rising clear crowned with her crown of towerson and on i galloped racing with the setting sun and ere the crimson afterglow was passed i stood within ravennas walls at last   ii   how strangely still no sound of life or joy startles the air no laughing shepherdboy pipes on his reed nor ever through the day comes the glad sound of children at their play o sad and sweet and silent surely here a man might dwell apart from troublous fear watching the tide of seasons as they flow from amorous spring to winters rain and snow and have no thought of sorrowhere indeed are lethes waters and that fatal weed which makes a man forget his fatherland  ay amid lotusmeadows dost thou stand like proserpine with poppyladen head guarding the holy ashes of the dead for though thy brood of warrior sons hath ceased thy noble dead are with theethey at least are faithful to thine honour guard them well o childless city for a mighty spell to wake mens hearts to dreams of things sublime are the lone tombs where rest the great of time   iii   yon lonely pillar rising on the plain marks where the bravest knight of france was slain the prince of chivalry the lord of war gaston de foix  for some untimely star led him against thy city and he fell as falls some forestlion fighting well taken from life while life and love were new he lies beneath gods seamless veil of blue tall lancelike reeds wave sadly oer his head and oleanders bloom to deeper red where his bright youth flowed crimson on the ground  look farther north unto that broken mound there prisoned now within a lordly tomb raised by a daughters hand in lonely gloom hugelimbed theodoric the gothic king sleeps after all his weary conquering time hath not spared his ruinwind and rain have broken down his stronghold and again we see that death is mighty lord of all and king and clown to ashen dust must fall  mighty indeed their glory yet to me barbaric king or knight of chivalry or the great queen herself were poor and vain beside the grave where dante rests from pain his gilded shrine lies open to the air and cunning sculptors hands have carven there the calm white brow as calm as earliest morn the eyes that flashed with passionate love and scorn the lips that sang of heaven and of hell the almondface which giotto drew so well the weary face of danteto this day here in his place of resting far away from arnos yellow waters rushing down through the wide bridges of that fairy town where the tall tower of giotto seems to rise a marble lily under sapphire skies  alas my dante thou hast known the pain of meaner livesthe exiles galling chain how steep the stairs within kings houses are and all the petty miseries which mar mans nobler nature with the sense of wrong yet this dull world is grateful for thy song our nations do thee homageeven she that cruel queen of vineclad tuscany who bound with crown of thorns thy living brow hath decked thine empty tomb with laurels now and begs in vain the ashes of her son  o mightiest exile all thy grief is done thy soul walks now beside thy beatrice ravenna guards thine ashes  sleep in peace   iv   how lone this palace is how grey the walls no minstrel now wakes echoes in these halls the broken chain lies rusting on the door and noisome weeds have split the marble floor here lurks the snake and here the lizards run by the stone lions blinking in the sun byron dwelt here in love and revelry for two long yearsa second anthony who of the world another actium made yet suffered not his royal soul to fade or lyre to break or lance to grow less keen neath any wiles of an egyptian queen for from the east there came a mighty cry and greece stood up to fight for liberty and called him from ravenna  never knight rode forth more nobly to wild scenes of fight none fell more bravely on ensanguined field borne like a spartan back upon his shield o hellas  hellas in thine hour of pride thy day of might remember him who died to wrest from off thy limbs the trammelling chain o salamis  o lone plataean plain o tossing waves of wild euboean sea o windswept heights of lone thermopylae he loved you wellay not alone in word who freely gave to thee his lyre and sword like aeschylos at wellfought marathon  and england too shall glory in her son her warriorpoet first in song and fight no longer now shall slanders venomed spite crawl like a snake across his perfect name or mar the lordly scutcheon of his fame  for as the olivegarland of the race which lights with joy each eager runners face as the red cross which saveth men in war as a flamebearded beacon seen from far by mariners upon a stormtossed sea such was his love for greece and liberty  byron thy crowns are ever fresh and green red leaves of rose from sapphic mitylene shall bind thy brows the myrtle blooms for thee in hidden glades by lonely castaly the laurels wait thy coming  all are thine and round thy head one perfect wreath will twine   v   the pinetops rocked before the evening breeze with the hoarse murmur of the wintry seas and the tall stems were streaked with amber bright i wandered through the wood in wild delight some startled bird with fluttering wings and fleet made snow of all the blossoms at my feet like silver crowns the pale narcissi lay and small birds sang on every twining spray o waving trees o forest liberty within your haunts at least a man is free and half forgets the weary world of strife the blood flows hotter and a sense of life wakes i the quickening veins while once again the woods are filled with gods we fancied slain long time i watched and surely hoped to see some goatfoot pan make merry minstrelsy amid the reeds some startled dryadmaid in girlish flight or lurking in the glade the soft brown limbs the wanton treacherous face of woodland god queen dian in the chase whitelimbed and terrible with look of pride and leash of boarhounds leaping at her side or hylas mirrored in the perfect stream  o idle heart  o fond hellenic dream ere long with melancholy rise and swell the evening chimes the convents vesper bell struck on mine ears amid the amorous flowers alas alas these sweet and honied hours had whelmed my heart like some encroaching sea and drowned all thoughts of black gethsemane   vi   o lone ravenna many a tale is told of thy great glories in the days of old two thousand years have passed since thou didst see caesar ride forth to royal victory mighty thy name when romes lean eagles flew from britains isles to far euphrates blue and of the peoples thou wast noble queen till in thy streets the goth and hun were seen discrowned by man deserted by the sea thou sleepest rocked in lonely misery no longer now upon thy swelling tide pineforestlike thy myriad galleys ride for where the brassbeaked ships were wont to float the weary shepherd pipes his mournful note and the white sheep are free to come and go where adrias purple waters used to flow  o fair  o sad  o queen uncomforted in ruined loveliness thou liest dead alone of all thy sisters for at last italias royal warrior hath passed romes lordliest entrance and hath worn his crown in the high temples of the eternal town the palatine hath welcomed back her king and with his name the seven mountains ring  and naples hath outlived her dream of pain and mocks her tyrant  venice lives again new risen from the waters and the cry of light and truth of love and liberty is heard in lordly genoa and where the marble spires of milan wound the air rings from the alps to the sicilian shore and dantes dream is now a dream no more  but thou ravenna better loved than all thy ruined palaces are but a pall that hides thy fallen greatness and thy name burns like a grey and flickering candleflame beneath the noonday splendour of the sun of new italia for the night is done the night of dark oppression and the day hath dawned in passionate splendour  far away the austrian hounds are hunted from the land beyond those icecrowned citadels which stand girdling the plain of royal lombardy from the far west unto the eastern sea  i know indeed that sons of thine have died in lissas waters by the mountainside of aspromonte on novaras plain nor have thy children died for thee in vain and yet methinks thou hast not drunk this wine from grapes newcrushed of liberty divine thou hast not followed that immortal star which leads the people forth to deeds of war weary of life thou liest in silent sleep as one who marks the lengthening shadows creep careless of all the hurrying hours that run mourning some day of glory for the sun of freedom hath not shewn to thee his face and thou hast caught no flambeau in the race  yet wake not from thy slumbersrest thee well amidst thy fields of amber asphodel thy lilysprinkled meadowsrest thee there to mock all human greatness  who would dare to vent the paltry sorrows of his life before thy ruins or to praise the strife of kings ambition and the barren pride of warring nations wert not thou the bride of the wild lord of adrias stormy sea the queen of double empires and to thee were not the nations given as thy prey and nowthy gates lie open night and day the grass grows green on every tower and hall the ghastly fig hath cleft thy bastioned wall and where thy mailed warriors stood at rest the midnight owl hath made her secret nest o fallen fallen from thy high estate o city trammelled in the toils of fate doth nought remain of all thy glorious days but a dull shield a crown of withered bays  yet who beneath this night of wars and fears from tranquil tower can watch the coming years who can foretell what joys the day shall bring or why before the dawn the linnets sing thou even thou mayst wake as wakes the rose to crimson splendour from its grave of snows as the rich cornfields rise to red and gold from these brown lands now stiff with winters cold as from the stormrack comes a perfect star  o muchloved city  i have wandered far from the wavecircled islands of my home have seen the gloomy mystery of the dome rise slowly from the drear campagnas way clothed in the royal purple of the day i from the city of the violet crown have watched the sun by corinths hill go down and marked the myriad laughter of the sea from starlit hills of flowerstarred arcady yet back to thee returns my perfect love as to its forestnest the evening dove  o poets city one who scarce has seen some twenty summers cast their doublets green for autumns livery would seek in vain to wake his lyre to sing a louder strain or tell thy days of glorypoor indeed is the low murmur of the shepherds reed where the loud clarions blast should shake the sky and flame across the heavens and to try such lofty themes were folly  yet i know that never felt my heart a nobler glow than when i woke the silence of thy street with clamorous trampling of my horses feet and saw the city which now i try to sing after long days of weary travelling   vii   adieu ravenna but a year ago i stood and watched the crimson sunset glow from the lone chapel on thy marshy plain the sky was as a shield that caught the stain of blood and battle from the dying sun and in the west the circling clouds had spun a royal robe which some great god might wear while into oceanseas of purple air sank the gold galley of the lord of light  yet here the gentle stillness of the night brings back the swelling tide of memory and wakes again my passionate love for thee now is the spring of love yet soon will come on meadow and tree the summers lordly bloom and soon the grass with brighter flowers will blow and send up lilies for some boy to mow then before long the summers conqueror rich autumntime the seasons usurer will lend his hoarded gold to all the trees and see it scattered by the spendthrift breeze and after that the winter cold and drear so runs the perfect cycle of the year and so from youth to manhood do we go and fall to weary days and locks of snow love only knows no winter never dies nor cares for frowning storms or leaden skies and mine for thee shall never pass away though my weak lips may falter in my lay  adieu  adieu yon silent evening star the nights ambassador doth gleam afar and bid the shepherd bring his flocks to fold perchance before our inland seas of gold are garnered by the reapers into sheaves perchance before i see the autumn leaves i may behold thy city and lay down low at thy feet the poets laurel crown  adieu  adieu yon silver lamp the moon which turns our midnight into perfect noon doth surely light thy towers guarding well where dante sleeps where byron loved to dwell
