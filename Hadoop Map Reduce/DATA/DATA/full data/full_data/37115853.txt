37115853	dickens in camp  by bret harte  with a foreword by  frederick s myrtle  illustration  san francisco  john howell 1922    illustration     foreword                                       dickens in camp is held by many admirers of bret harte to be his masterpiece of verse the poem is so held for the evident sincerity and depth of feeling it displays as well as for the unusual quality of its poetic expression  bret hart has been generally accepted as the one american writer who possessed above all others the faculty of what may be called heart appeal the power to give to his work that quality of human interest which enables the writer and his writings to live in the memory of the reading public for all time by reason of that gift of his bret harte has been popularly compared with his great contemporary beyond the seas greatest of all sentimentalists among writers of fiction charles dickens  just how far the younger author selected the elder for his ideal built upon him so to speak  held his example constantly before his mental vision may be always a matter of debate amongst students of literature there can be no question of the genuineness of the californian writers admiration of him who made the whole world laugh or weep with him at will it is recorded harte that at seven years of age he had read dombey  son and so as one of his biographers henry childs merwin observes began his acquaintance with that author who was to influence him far more than any other merwin further declares that the reading of dickens stimulated his boyish imagination and quickened that sympathy with the weak and suffering with the downtrodden with the waifs and strays with the outcasts of society which is remarkable in both writers the spirit of dickens breathes through the poems and stories of bret harte just as the spirit of bret harte breathes through the poems and stories of kipling bret harte had a very pretty satirical vein which might easily have developed have made him an author of satire rather than of sentiment who can say that the influence of dickens coming at the early plastic period of his life may not have turned the scale  another of his biographers t edgar pemberton says his admiration for charles dickens never waned but on the contrary increased as the years rolled by harte himself referring in later years to his childhood days to his fathers library and the books to which he had access spoke of the irresistible dickens mr pemberton states also that bret harte always felt that he owed a deep debt of gratitude to charles dickens  small wonder then that bret harte no matter how unconsciously should have adopted here and there something of the style and some of the mannerisms of dickens this is directly traceable in his writings even to the extent of his resorting here and there to oddities of expression which were peculiarly dickensian  the english writer on his part reciprocated in no small degree the feeling of admiration which his works had aroused in the young american his biographer john forster relates that dickens called his attention to two sketches by bret harte the luck of roaring camp and the outcasts of poker flat in which writes the biographer he had found such subtle strokes of character as he had not anywhere else in later years discovered the manner resembling himself but the matter fresh to a degree that had surprised him the painting in all respects masterly and the wild rude thing painted a quite wonderful reality i have rarely known him more honestly moved  dickens gave evidence of this feeling of appreciation in a letter addressed to harte in california commending his literary efforts inviting him to write a story for all the year round and bidding him sojourn with him at gads hill upon his first visit to england this letter was written shortly before dickens death and unfortunately did not reach bret harte until sometime after that sad event  when word of the passing of the master as he reverently styled him reached bret harte he was in san rafael he immediately sent a dispatch across the bay to san francisco to hold back the forthcoming publication of his overland monthly for twentyfour hours and ere that time had elapsed the poetic tribute to which the title was given of dickens in camp had been composed and sent on its way to magazine headquarters in the western metropolis that was in july 1870  late in the 70s while on his way to a consulship in germany bret harte visited london for the first time there he was taken in charge by joaquin miller the poet of the sierras who in his reminiscences relates he could not rest until he stood by the grave of dickens at last one twilight i led him by the hand to where some plain letters in a broad flat stone just below the bust of thackeray read charles dickens bret harte is dead now and it will not hurt him in politics where they seem to want the hard and heartless for high places it will not hurt him in politics nor in anything anywhere to tell the plain truth how he tried to speak but choked up how tears ran down and fell on the stone as he bowed his bare head very low how his hand trembled as i led him away  many years later in may 1890 bret harte in response to a request for a facsimile of the original manuscript of dickens in camp replied in part  i hurriedly sent the first and only draft of the verses to the office at san francisco and i suppose after passing the printers and proofreaders hands it lapsed into the usual oblivion of all editorial copy  i remember that it was very hastily but very honestly written and it is fair to add that it was not until later that i knew for the first time that those gentle and wonderful eyes which i was thinking of as being closed forever had ever rested kindly upon a line of mine  the poem itself breathes reverence for the master throughout to residents of california who revel in the outdoor life of her mountains  valleys the poem has a particular attraction for its campfire spirit which to us seems part and parcel of that outdoor life it is a far cry perhaps from the campfires of 1849 to the campfires of 1922 but surely the campfire spirit is the same with us in our western wonderland today as it was with those rough old miners who sat around the logs under the pines after a day of arduous and oft disappointing toil surely the visions we see the lessons we read in the campfire glow are much the same as they were then surely we build the same castles in the air draw the same inspirations from it biographer forster pays the poem this tribute  it embodies the same kind of incident which had so affected the master himself in the papers to which i have referred it shows the gentler influences which in even those california wilds can restore outlawed roaring campers to silence and humanity and there is hardly any form of posthumous tribute which i can imagine likely to have better satisfied his desire of fame than one which should thus connect with the special favorite among all his heroines the restraints and authority exerted by his genius over the rudest and least civilized of competitors in that far fierce race for wealth  in the twining of english holly and western pine upon the great english novelists grave the poet expresses a happy thought he calls east and west together in common appreciation of one whose influence was not merely local but worldwide he invites the old world and the new to kneel together at the altar of sentiment an appeal to the emotions which never fails to touch a responsive chord in the heart of humanity  frederick s myrtle  san francisco california april 1922                                        illustration     dickens in camp                                        above the pines the moon was slowly drifting   the river sang below the dim sierras far beyond uplifting   their minarets of snow  the roaring campfire with rude humor painted   the ruddy tints of health on haggard face and form that drooped and fainted   in the fierce race for wealth  till one arose and from his packs scant treasure   a hoarded volume drew and cards were dropped from hands of listless leisure   to hear the tale anew  and then while round them shadows gathered faster   and as the firelight fell he read aloud the book wherein the master   had writ of little nell  perhaps twas boyish fancyfor the reader   was youngest of them all but as he read from clustering pine and cedar   a silence seemed to fall  the firtrees gathering closer in the shadows   listened in every spray while the whole camp with nell on english meadows   wandered and lost their way  and so in mountain solitudesoertaken   as by some spell divine their cares dropped from them like the needles shaken   from out the gusty pine  lost is that camp and wasted all its fire   and he who wrought that spell ah towering pine and stately kentish spire   ye have one tale to tell  lost is that camp but let its fragrant story   blend with the breath that thrills with hopvines incense all the pensive glory   that fills the kentish hills  and on that grave where english oak and holly   and laurel wreaths intwine deem it not all a too presumptuous folly   this spray of western pine                                          three hundred and fifty copies of this book   printed by edwin grabhorn
