mark the rhythmical swing of a seamans life and of a ships career  from land to land is the most concise definition of a ships earthly fate  a departure is not what a vain people of landsmen may think  the term landfall is more easily understood you fall in with the land and it is a matter of a quick eye and of a clear atmosphere the departure is not the ships going away from her port any more than the landfall can be looked upon as the synonym of arrival but there is this difference in the departure  that the term does not imply so much a sea event as a definite act entailing a processthe precise observation of certain landmarks by means of the compass card  your landfall be it a peculiarlyshaped mountain a rocky headland or a stretch of sanddunes you meet at first with a single glance  further recognition will follow in due course but essentially a landfall good or bad is made and done with at the first cry of land ho  the departure is distinctly a ceremony of navigation  a ship may have left her port some time before she may have been at sea in the fullest sense of the phrase for days but for all that as long as the coast she was about to leave remained in sight a southerngoing ship of yesterday had not in the sailors sense begun the enterprise of a passage  the taking of departure if not the last sight of the land is perhaps the last professional recognition of the land on the part of a sailor  it is the technical as distinguished from the sentimental goodbye  henceforth he has done with the coast astern of his ship  it is a matter personal to the man  it is not the ship that takes her departure the seaman takes his departure by means of crossbearings which fix the place of the first tiny pencilcross on the white expanse of the trackchart where the ships position at noon shall be marked by just such another tiny pencil cross for every day of her passage  and there may be sixty eighty any number of these crosses on the ships track from land to land  the greatest number in my experience was a hundred and thirty of such crosses from the pilot station at the sand heads in the bay of bengal to the scillys light  a bad passage    a departure the last professional sight of land is always good or at least good enough  for even if the weather be thick it does not matter much to a ship having all the open sea before her bows  a landfall may be good or bad  you encompass the earth with one particular spot of it in your eye  in all the devious tracings the course of a sailingship leaves upon the white paper of a chart she is always aiming for that one little spotmaybe a small island in the ocean a single headland upon the long coast of a continent a lighthouse on a bluff or simply the peaked form of a mountain like an antheap afloat upon the waters  but if you have sighted it on the expected bearing then that landfall is good  fogs snowstorms gales thick with clouds and rainthose are the enemies of good landfalls    ii    some commanders of ships take their departure from the home coast sadly in a spirit of grief and discontent  they have a wife children perhaps some affection at any rate or perhaps only some pet vice that must be left behind for a year or more  i remember only one man who walked his deck with a springy step and gave the first course of the passage in an elated voice  but he as i learned afterwards was leaving nothing behind him except a welter of debts and threats of legal proceedings  on the other hand i have known many captains who directly their ship had left the narrow waters of the channel would disappear from the sight of their ships company altogether for some three days or more  they would take a long dive as it were into their stateroom only to emerge a few days afterwards with a more or less serene brow  those were the men easy to get on with besides such a complete retirement seemed to imply a satisfactory amount of trust in their officers and to be trusted displeases no seaman worthy of the name  on my first voyage as chief mate with good captain macw i remember that i felt quite flattered and went blithely about my duties myself a commander for all practical purposes  still whatever the greatness of my illusion the fact remained that the real commander was there backing up my selfconfidence though invisible to my eyes behind a maplewood veneered cabindoor with a white china handle  that is the time after your departure is taken when the spirit of your commander communes with you in a muffled voice as if from the sanctum sanctorum of a temple because call her a temple or a hell afloatas some ships have been calledthe captains state room is surely the august place in every vessel  the good macw would not even come out to his meals and fed solitarily in his holy of holies from a tray covered with a white napkin  our steward used to bend an ironic glance at the perfectly empty plates he was bringing out from there  this grief for his home which overcomes so many married seamen did not deprive captain macw of his legitimate appetite  in fact the steward would almost invariably come up to me sitting in the captains chair at the head of the table to say in a grave murmur the captain asks for one more slice of meat and two potatoes  we his officers could hear him moving about in his berth or lightly snoring or fetching deep sighs or splashing and blowing in his bathroom and we made our reports to him through the keyhole as it were  it was the crowning achievement of his amiable character that the answers we got were given in a quite mild and friendly tone  some commanders in their periods of seclusion are constantly grumpy and seem to resent the mere sound of your voice as an injury and an insult  but a grumpy recluse cannot worry his subordinates  whereas the man in whom the sense of duty is strong or perhaps only the sense of selfimportance and who persists in airing on deck his moroseness all dayand perhaps half the nightbecomes a grievous infliction  he walks the poop darting gloomy glances as though he wished to poison the sea and snaps your head off savagely whenever you happen to blunder within earshot  and these vagaries are the harder to bear patiently as becomes a man and an officer because no sailor is really goodtempered during the first few days of a voyage  there are regrets memories the instinctive longing for the departed idleness the instinctive hate of all work  besides things have a knack of going wrong at the start especially in the matter of irritating trifles  and there is the abiding thought of a whole year of more or less hard life before one because there was hardly a southerngoing voyage in the yesterday of the sea which meant anything less than a twelvemonth  yes it needed a few days after the taking of your departure for a ships company to shake down into their places and for the soothing deepwater ship routine to establish its beneficent sway  it is a great doctor for sore hearts and sore heads too your ships routine which i have seen sootheat least for a timethe most turbulent of spirits  there is health in it and peace and satisfaction of the accomplished round for each day of the ships life seems to close a circle within the wide ring of the sea horizon  it borrows a certain dignity of sameness from the majestic monotony of the sea  he who loves the sea loves also the ships routine  nowhere else than upon the sea do the days weeks and months fall away quicker into the past  they seem to be left astern as easily as the light airbubbles in the swirls of the ships wake and vanish into a great silence in which your ship moves on with a sort of magical effect  they pass away the days the weeks the months  nothing but a gale can disturb the orderly life of the ship and the spell of unshaken monotony that seems to have fallen upon the very voices of her men is broken only by the near prospect of a landfall  then is the spirit of the ships commander stirred strongly again but it is not moved to seek seclusion and to remain hidden and inert shut up in a small cabin with the solace of a good bodily appetite  when about to make the land the spirit of the ships commander is tormented by an unconquerable restlessness  it seems unable to abide for many seconds together in the holy of holies of the captains stateroom it will out on deck and gaze ahead through straining eyes as the appointed moment comes nearer  it is kept vigorously upon the stretch of excessive vigilance meantime the body of the ships commander is being enfeebled by want of appetite at least such is my experience though enfeebled is perhaps not exactly the word  i might say rather that it is spiritualized by a disregard for food sleep and all the ordinary comforts such as they are of sea life  in one or two cases i have known that detachment from the grosser needs of existence remain regrettably incomplete in the matter of drink  but these two cases were properly speaking pathological cases and the only two in all my sea experience  in one of these two instances of a craving for stimulants developed from sheer anxiety i cannot assert that the mans seamanlike qualities were impaired in the least  it was a very anxious case too the land being made suddenly closeto on a wrong bearing in thick weather and during a fresh onshore gale  going below to speak to him soon after i was unlucky enough to catch my captain in the very act of hasty corkdrawing  the sight i may say gave me an awful scare  i was well aware of the morbidly sensitive nature of the man  fortunately i managed to draw back unseen and taking care to stamp heavily with my seaboots at the foot of the cabin stairs i made my second entry  but for this unexpected glimpse no act of his during the next twentyfour hours could have given me the slightest suspicion that all was not well with his nerve    iii    quite another case and having nothing to do with drink was that of poor captain b  he used to suffer from sick headaches in his young days every time he was approaching a coast  well over fifty years of age when i knew him short stout dignified perhaps a little pompous he was a man of a singularly wellinformed mind the least sailorlike in outward aspect but certainly one of the best seamen whom it has been my good luck to serve under  he was a plymouth man i think the son of a country doctor and both his elder boys were studying medicine  he commanded a big london ship fairly well known in her day  i thought no end of him and that is why i remember with a peculiar satisfaction the last words he spoke to me on board his ship after an eighteen months voyage  it was in the dock in dundee where we had brought a full cargo of jute from calcutta  we had been paid off that morning and i had come on board to take my seachest away and to say goodbye  in his slightly lofty but courteous way he inquired what were my plans  i replied that i intended leaving for london by the afternoon train and thought of going up for examination to get my masters certificate  i had just enough service for that  he commended me for not wasting my time with such an evident interest in my case that i was quite surprised then rising from his chair he said  have you a ship in view after you have passed  i answered that i had nothing whatever in view  he shook hands with me and pronounced the memorable words  if you happen to be in want of employment remember that as long as i have a ship you have a ship too  in the way of compliment there is nothing to beat this from a ships captain to his second mate at the end of a voyage when the work is over and the subordinate is done with  and there is a pathos in that memory for the poor fellow never went to sea again after all  he was already ailing when we passed st helena was laid up for a time when we were off the western islands but got out of bed to make his landfall  he managed to keep up on deck as far as the downs where giving his orders in an exhausted voice he anchored for a few hours to send a wire to his wife and take aboard a north sea pilot to help him sail the ship up the east coast  he had not felt equal to the task by himself for it is the sort of thing that keeps a deepwater man on his feet pretty well night and day  when we arrived in dundee mrs b was already there waiting to take him home  we travelled up to london by the same train but by the time i had managed to get through with my examination the ship had sailed on her next voyage without him and instead of joining her again i went by request to see my old commander in his home this is the only one of my captains i have ever visited in that way  he was out of bed by then quite convalescent as he declared making a few tottering steps to meet me at the sitting room door  evidently he was reluctant to take his final cross bearings of this earth for a departure on the only voyage to an unknown destination a sailor ever undertakes  and it was all very nicethe large sunny room his deep easychair in a bow window with pillows and a footstool the quiet watchful care of the elderly gentle woman who had borne him five children and had not perhaps lived with him more than five full years out of the thirty or so of their married life  there was also another woman there in a plain black dress quite grayhaired sitting very erect on her chair with some sewing from which she snatched sideglances in his direction and uttering not a single word during all the time of my call  even when in due course i carried over to her a cup of tea she only nodded at me silently with the faintest ghost of a smile on her tightset lips  i imagine she must have been a maiden sister of mrs b come to help nurse her brotherinlaw  his youngest boy a latecomer a great cricketer it seemed twelve years old or thereabouts chattered enthusiastically of the exploits of w g grace  and i remember his eldest son too a newlyfledged doctor who took me out to smoke in the garden and shaking his head with professional gravity but with genuine concern muttered  yes but he doesnt get back his appetite  i dont like thati dont like that at all  the last sight of captain b i had was as he nodded his head to me out of the bow window when i turned round to close the front gate  it was a distinct and complete impression something that i dont know whether to call a landfall or a departure  certainly he had gazed at times very fixedly before him with the landfalls vigilant look this seacaptain seated incongruously in a deepbacked chair he had not then talked to me of employment of ships of being ready to take another command but he had discoursed of his early days in the abundant but thin flow of a wilful invalids talk the women looked worried but sat still and i learned more of him in that interview than in the whole eighteen months we had sailed together  it appeared he had served his time in the copperore trade the famous copperore trade of old days between swansea and the chilian coast coal out and ore in deeploaded both ways as if in wanton defiance of the great cape horn seasa work this for staunch ships and a great school of staunchness for west country seamen  a whole fleet of copperbottomed barques as strong in rib and planking as wellfound in gear as ever was sent upon the seas manned by hardy crews and commanded by young masters was engaged in that now long defunct trade  that was the school i was trained in he said to me almost boastfully lying back amongst his pillows with a rug over his legs  and it was in that trade that he obtained his first command at a very early age it was then that he mentioned to me how as a young commander he was always ill for a few days before making land after a long passage  but this sort of sickness used to pass off with the first sight of a familiar landmark  afterwards he added as he grew older all that nervousness wore off completely and i observed his weary eyes gaze steadily ahead as if there had been nothing between him and the straight line of sea and sky where whatever a seaman is looking for is first bound to appear  but i have also seen his eyes rest fondly upon the faces in the room upon the pictures on the wall upon all the familiar objects of that home whose abiding and clear image must have flashed often on his memory in times of stress and anxiety at sea  was he looking out for a strange landfall or taking with an untroubled mind the bearings for his last departure  it is hard to say for in that voyage from which no man returns landfall and departure are instantaneous merging together into one moment of supreme and final attention  certainly i do not remember observing any sign of faltering in the set expression of his wasted face no hint of the nervous anxiety of a young commander about to make land on an uncharted shore  he had had too much experience of departures and landfalls  and had he not served his time in the famous copperore trade out of the bristol channel the work of the staunchest ships afloat and the school of staunch seamen    iv    before an anchor can ever be raised it must be let go and this perfectly obvious truism brings me at once to the subject of the degradation of the sea language in the daily press of this country  your journalist whether he takes charge of a ship or a fleet almost invariably casts his anchor  now an anchor is never cast and to take a liberty with technical language is a crime against the clearness precision and beauty of perfected speech  an anchor is a forged piece of iron admirably adapted to its end and technical language is an instrument wrought into perfection by ages of experience a flawless thing for its purpose  an anchor of yesterday because nowadays there are contrivances like mushrooms and things like claws of no particular expression or shapejust hooksan anchor of yesterday is in its way a most efficient instrument  to its perfection its size bears witness for there is no other appliance so small for the great work it has to do  look at the anchors hanging from the catheads of a big ship  how tiny they are in proportion to the great size of the hull  were they made of gold they would look like trinkets like ornamental toys no bigger in proportion than a jewelled drop in a womans ear  and yet upon them will depend more than once the very life of the ship  an anchor is forged and fashioned for faithfulness give it ground that it can bite and it will hold till the cable parts and then whatever may afterwards befall its ship that anchor is lost the honest rough piece of iron so simple in appearance has more parts than the human body has limbs  the ring the stock the crown the flukes the palms the shank  all this according to the journalist is cast when a ship arriving at an anchorage is brought up  this insistence in using the odious word arises from the fact that a particularly benighted landsman must imagine the act of anchoring as a process of throwing something overboard whereas the anchor ready for its work is already overboard and is not thrown over but simply allowed to fall  it hangs from the ships side at the end of a heavy projecting timber called the cathead in the bight of a short thick chain whose end link is suddenly released by a blow from a topmaul or the pull of a lever when the order is given  and the order is not heave over as the paragraphist seems to imagine but let go  as a matter of fact nothing is ever cast in that sense on board ship but the lead of which a cast is taken to search the depth of water on which she floats  a lashed boat a spare spar a cask or what not secured about the decks is cast adrift when it is untied  also the ship herself is cast to port or starboard when getting under way  she however never casts her anchor  to speak with severe technicality a ship or a fleet is brought upthe complementary words unpronounced and unwritten being of course to an anchor  less technically but not less correctly the word anchored with its characteristic appearance and resolute sound ought to be good enough for the newspapers of the greatest maritime country in the world  the fleet anchored at spithead  can anyone want a better sentence for brevity and seamanlike ring  but the castanchor trick with its affectation of being a seaphrasefor why not write just as well threw anchor flung anchor or shied anchoris intolerably odious to a sailors ear  i remember a coasting pilot of my early acquaintance he used to read the papers assiduously who to define the utmost degree of lubberliness in a landsman used to say hes one of them poor miserable castanchor devils    v    from first to last the seamans thoughts are very much concerned with his anchors  it is not so much that the anchor is a symbol of hope as that it is the heaviest object that he has to handle on board his ship at sea in the usual routine of his duties  the beginning and the end of every passage are marked distinctly by work about the ships anchors  a vessel in the channel has her anchors always ready her cables shackled on and the land almost always in sight  the anchor and the land are indissolubly connected in a sailors thoughts  but directly she is clear of the narrow seas heading out into the world with nothing solid to speak of between her and the south pole the anchors are got in and the cables disappear from the deck  but the anchors do not disappear technically speaking they are secured inboard and on the forecastle head lashed down to ringbolts with ropes and chains under the straining sheets of the headsails they look very idle and as if asleep  thus bound but carefully looked after inert and powerful those emblems of hope make company for the lookout man in the night watches and so the days glide by with a long rest for those characteristically shaped pieces of iron reposing forward visible from almost every part of the ships deck waiting for their work on the other side of the world somewhere while the ship carries them on with a great rush and splutter of foam underneath and the sprays of the open sea rust their heavy limbs  the first approach to the land as yet invisible to the crews eyes is announced by the brisk order of the chief mate to the boatswain  we will get the anchors over this afternoon or first thing tomorrow morning as the case may be  for the chief mate is the keeper of the ships anchors and the guardian of her cable there are good ships and bad ships comfortable ships and ships where from first day to last of the voyage there is no rest for a chief mates body and soul  and ships are what men make them this is a pronouncement of sailor wisdom and no doubt in the main it is true  however there are ships where as an old grizzled mate once told me nothing ever seems to go right  and looking from the poop where we both stood i had paid him a neighbourly call in dock he added  shes one of them  he glanced up at my face which expressed a proper professional sympathy and set me right in my natural surmise  oh no the old mans right enough  he never interferes  anything thats done in a seamanlike way is good enough for him  and yet somehow nothing ever seems to go right in this ship  i tell you what  she is naturally unhandy  the old man of course was his captain who just then came on deck in a silk hat and brown overcoat and with a civil nod to us went ashore  he was certainly not more than thirty and the elderly mate with a murmur to me of thats my old man proceeded to give instances of the natural unhandiness of the ship in a sort of deprecatory tone as if to say you mustnt think i bear a grudge against her for that  the instances do not matter  the point is that there are ships where things do go wrong but whatever the shipgood or bad lucky or unluckyit is in the forepart of her that her chief mate feels most at home  it is emphatically his end of the ship though of course he is the executive supervisor of the whole  there are his anchors his headgear his foremast his station for manoeuvring when the captain is in charge  and there too live the men the ships hands whom it is his duty to keep employed fair weather or foul for the ships welfare  it is the chief mate the only figure of the ships afterguard who comes bustling forward at the cry of all hands on deck  he is the satrap of that province in the autocratic realm of the ship and more personally responsible for anything that may happen there  there too on the approach to the land assisted by the boatswain and the carpenter he gets the anchors over with the men of his own watch whom he knows better than the others  there he sees the cable ranged the windlass disconnected the compressors opened and there after giving his own last order stand clear of the cable he waits attentive in a silent ship that forges slowly ahead towards her pickedout berth for the sharp shout from aft let go  instantly bending over he sees the trusty iron fall with a heavy plunge under his eyes which watch and note whether it has gone clear  for the anchor to go clear means to go clear of its own chain your anchor must drop from the bow of your ship with no turn of cable on any of its limbs else you would be riding to a foul anchor  unless the pull of the cable is fair on the ring no anchor can be trusted even on the best of holding ground  in time of stress it is bound to drag for implements and men must be treated fairly to give you the virtue which is in them  the anchor is an emblem of hope but a foul anchor is worse than the most fallacious of false hopes that ever lured men or nations into a sense of security  and the sense of security even the most warranted is a bad councillor  it is the sense which like that exaggerated feeling of wellbeing ominous of the coming on of madness precedes the swift fall of disaster  a seaman labouring under an undue sense of security becomes at once worth hardly half his salt  therefore of all my chief officers the one i trusted most was a man called b  he had a red moustache a lean face also red and an uneasy eye  he was worth all his salt  on examining now after many years the residue of the feeling which was the outcome of the contact of our personalities i discover without much surprise a certain flavour of dislike upon the whole i think he was one of the most uncomfortable shipmates possible for a young commander  if it is permissible to criticise the absent i should say he had a little too much of the sense of insecurity which is so invaluable in a seaman  he had an extremely disturbing air of being everlastingly ready even when seated at table at my right hand before a plate of salt beef to grapple with some impending calamity  i must hasten to add that he had also the other qualification necessary to make a trustworthy seamanthat of an absolute confidence in himself  what was really wrong with him was that he had these qualities in an unrestful degree  his eternally watchful demeanour his jerky nervous talk even his as it were determined silences seemed to implyand i believe they did implythat to his mind the ship was never safe in my hands  such was the man who looked after the anchors of a less than fivehundredton barque my first command now gone from the face of the earth but sure of a tenderly remembered existence as long as i live  no anchor could have gone down foul under mr bs piercing eye  it was good for one to be sure of that when in an open roadstead one heard in the cabin the wind pipe up but still there were moments when i detested mr b exceedingly  from the way he used to glare sometimes i fancy that more than once he paid me back with interest  it so happened that we both loved the little barque very much  and it was just the defect of mr bs inestimable qualities that he would never persuade himself to believe that the ship was safe in my hands  to begin with he was more than five years older than myself at a time of life when five years really do count i being twentynine and he thirtyfour then on our first leaving port i dont see why i should make a secret of the fact that it was bangkok a bit of manoeuvring of mine amongst the islands of the gulf of siam had given him an unforgettable scare  ever since then he had nursed in secret a bitter idea of my utter recklessness  but upon the whole and unless the grip of a mans hand at parting means nothing whatever i conclude that we did like each other at the end of two years and three months well enough  the bond between us was the ship and therein a ship though she has female attributes and is loved very unreasonably is different from a woman  that i should have been tremendously smitten with my first command is nothing to wonder at but i suppose i must admit that mr bs sentiment was of a higher order  each of us of course was extremely anxious about the good appearance of the beloved object and though i was the one to glean compliments ashore b had the more intimate pride of feeling resembling that of a devoted handmaiden  and that sort of faithful and proud devotion went so far as to make him go about flicking the dust off the varnished teakwood rail of the little craft with a silk pockethandkerchiefa present from mrs b i believe  that was the effect of his love for the barque  the effect of his admirable lack of the sense of security once went so far as to make him remark to me  well sir you are a lucky man  it was said in a tone full of significance but not exactly offensive and it was i suppose my innate tact that prevented my asking what on earth do you mean by that  later on his meaning was illustrated more fully on a dark night in a tight corner during a dead onshore gale  i had called him up on deck to help me consider our extremely unpleasant situation  there was not much time for deep thinking and his summingup was  it looks pretty bad whichever we try but then sir you always do get out of a mess somehow    vi    it is difficult to disconnect the idea of ships anchors from the idea of the ships chief matethe man who sees them go down clear and come up sometimes foul because not even the most unremitting care can always prevent a ship swinging to winds and tide from taking an awkward turn of the cable round stock or fluke  then the business of getting the anchor and securing it afterwards is unduly prolonged and made a weariness to the chief mate  he is the man who watches the growth of the cablea sailors phrase which has all the force precision and imagery of technical language that created by simple men with keen eyes for the real aspect of the things they see in their trade achieves the just expression seizing upon the essential which is the ambition of the artist in words  therefore the sailor will never say cast anchor and the shipmaster aft will hail his chief mate on the forecastle in impressionistic phrase  how does the cable grow because grow is the right word for the long drift of a cable emerging aslant under the strain taut as a bowstring above the water  and it is the voice of the keeper of the ships anchors that will answer  grows right ahead sir or broad on the bow or whatever concise and deferential shout will fit the case  there is no order more noisily given or taken up with lustier shouts on board a homewardbound merchant ship than the command man the windlass  the rush of expectant men out of the forecastle the snatching of handspikes the tramp of feet the clink of the pawls make a stirring accompaniment to a plaintive upanchor song with a roaring chorus and this burst of noisy activity from a whole ships crew seems like a voiceful awakening of the ship herself till then in the picturesque phrase of dutch seamen lying asleep upon her iron  for a ship with her sails furled on her squared yards and reflected from truck to waterline in the smooth gleaming sheet of a landlocked harbour seems indeed to a seamans eye the most perfect picture of slumbering repose  the getting of your anchor was a noisy operation on board a merchant ship of yesterdayan inspiring joyous noise as if with the emblem of hope the ships company expected to drag up out of the depths each man all his personal hopes into the reach of a securing handthe hope of home the hope of rest of liberty of dissipation of hard pleasure following the hard endurance of many days between sky and water and this noisiness this exultation at the moment of the ships departure make a tremendous contrast to the silent moments of her arrival in a foreign roadsteadthe silent moments when stripped of her sails she forges ahead to her chosen berth the loose canvas fluttering softly in the gear above the heads of the men standing still upon her decks the master gazing intently forward from the break of the poop  gradually she loses her way hardly moving with the three figures on her forecastle waiting attentively about the cathead for the last order of perhaps full ninety days at sea  let go  this is the final word of a ships ended journey the closing word of her toil and of her achievement  in a life whose worth is told out in passages from port to port the splash of the anchors fall and the thunderous rumbling of the chain are like the closing of a distinct period of which she seems conscious with a slight deep shudder of all her frame  by so much is she nearer to her appointed death for neither years nor voyages can go on for ever it is to her like the striking of a clock and in the pause which follows she seems to take count of the passing time  this is the last important order the others are mere routine directions  once more the master is heard  give her fortyfive fathom to the waters edge and then he too is done for a time for days he leaves all the harbour work to his chief mate the keeper of the ships anchor and of the ships routine  for days his voice will not be heard raised about the decks with that curt austere accent of the man in charge till again when the hatches are on and in a silent and expectant ship he shall speak up from aft in commanding tones  man the windlass    vii    the other year looking through a newspaper of sound principles but whose staff will persist in casting anchors and going to sea on a ship ough i came across an article upon the seasons yachting  and behold it was a good article  to a man who had but little to do with pleasure sailing though all sailing is a pleasure and certainly nothing whatever with racing in open waters the writers strictures upon the handicapping of yachts were just intelligible and no more  and i do not pretend to any interest in the enumeration of the great races of that year  as to the 52foot linear raters praised so much by the writer i am warmed up by his approval of their performances but as far as any clear conception goes the descriptive phrase so precise to the comprehension of a yachtsman evokes no definite image in my mind  the writer praises that class of pleasure vessels and i am willing to endorse his words as any man who loves every craft afloat would be ready to do  i am disposed to admire and respect the 52foot linear raters on the word of a man who regrets in such a sympathetic and understanding spirit the threatened decay of yachting seamanship  of course yacht racing is an organized pastime a function of social idleness ministering to the vanity of certain wealthy inhabitants of these isles nearly as much as to their inborn love of the sea  but the writer of the article in question goes on to point out with insight and justice that for a great number of people 20000 i think he says it is a means of livelihoodthat it is in his own words an industry  now the moral side of an industry productive or unproductive the redeeming and ideal aspect of this breadwinning is the attainment and preservation of the highest possible skill on the part of the craftsmen  such skill the skill of technique is more than honesty it is something wider embracing honesty and grace and rule in an elevated and clear sentiment not altogether utilitarian which may be called the honour of labour  it is made up of accumulated tradition kept alive by individual pride rendered exact by professional opinion and like the higher arts it spurred on and sustained by discriminating praise  this is why the attainment of proficiency the pushing of your skill with attention to the most delicate shades of excellence is a matter of vital concern  efficiency of a practically flawless kind may be reached naturally in the struggle for bread  but there is something beyonda higher point a subtle and unmistakable touch of love and pride beyond mere skill almost an inspiration which gives to all work that finish which is almost artwhich is art  as men of scrupulous honour set up a high standard of public conscience above the deadlevel of an honest community so men of that skill which passes into art by ceaseless striving raise the deadlevel of correct practice in the crafts of land and sea  the conditions fostering the growth of that supreme alive excellence as well in work as in play ought to be preserved with a most careful regard lest the industry or the game should perish of an insidious and inward decay  therefore i have read with profound regret in that article upon the yachting season of a certain year that the seamanship on board racing yachts is not now what it used to be only a few very few years ago  for that was the gist of that article written evidently by a man who not only knows but understandsa thing let me remark in passing much rarer than one would expect because the sort of understanding i mean is inspired by love and love though in a sense it may be admitted to be stronger than death is by no means so universal and so sure  in fact love is rarethe love of men of things of ideas the love of perfected skill  for love is the enemy of haste it takes count of passing days of men who pass away of a fine art matured slowly in the course of years and doomed in a short time to pass away too and be no more  love and regret go hand in hand in this world of changes swifter than the shifting of the clouds reflected in the mirror of the sea  to penalize a yacht in proportion to the fineness of her performance is unfair to the craft and to her men  it is unfair to the perfection of her form and to the skill of her servants  for we men are in fact the servants of our creations  we remain in everlasting bondage to the productions of our brain and to the work of our hands  a man is born to serve his time on this earth and there is something fine in the service being given on other grounds than that of utility  the bondage of art is very exacting  and as the writer of the article which started this train of thought says with lovable warmth the sailing of yachts is a fine art  his contention is that racing without time allowances for anything else but tonnagethat is for sizehas fostered the fine art of sailing to the pitch of perfection  every sort of demand is made upon the master of a sailingyacht and to be penalized in proportion to your success may be of advantage to the sport itself but it has an obviously deteriorating effect upon the seamanship the fine art is being lost    viii    the sailing and racing of yachts has developed a class of foreand aft sailors men born and bred to the sea fishing in winter and yachting in summer men to whom the handling of that particular rig presents no mystery  it is their striving for victory that has elevated the sailing of pleasure craft to the dignity of a fine art in that special sense  as i have said i know nothing of racing and but little of foreandaft rig but the advantages of such a rig are obvious especially for purposes of pleasure whether in cruising or racing  it requires less effort in handling the trimming of the sailplanes to the wind can be done with speed and accuracy the unbroken spread of the sailarea is of infinite advantage and the greatest possible amount of canvas can be displayed upon the least possible quantity of spars  lightness and concentrated power are the great qualities of foreandaft rig  a fleet of foreandafters at anchor has its own slender graciousness  the setting of their sails resembles more than anything else the unfolding of a birds wings the facility of their evolutions is a pleasure to the eye  they are birds of the sea whose swimming is like flying and resembles more a natural function than the handling of maninvented appliances  the fore andaft rig in its simplicity and the beauty of its aspect under every angle of vision is i believe unapproachable  a schooner yawl or cutter in charge of a capable man seems to handle herself as if endowed with the power of reasoning and the gift of swift execution  one laughs with sheer pleasure at a smart piece of manoeuvring as at a manifestation of a living creatures quick wit and graceful precision  of those three varieties of foreandaft rig the cutterthe racing rig par excellenceis of an appearance the most imposing from the fact that practically all her canvas is in one piece  the enormous mainsail of a cutter as she draws slowly past a point of land or the end of a jetty under your admiring gaze invests her with an air of lofty and silent majesty  at anchor a schooner looks better she has an aspect of greater efficiency and a better balance to the eye with her two masts distributed over the hull with a swaggering rake aft  the yawl rig one comes in time to love  it is i should think the easiest of all to manage  for racing a cutter for a long pleasure voyage a schooner for cruising in home waters the yawl and the handling of them all is indeed a fine art  it requires not only the knowledge of the general principles of sailing but a particular acquaintance with the character of the craft  all vessels are handled in the same way as far as theory goes just as you may deal with all men on broad and rigid principles  but if you want that success in life which comes from the affection and confidence of your fellows then with no two men however similar they may appear in their nature will you deal in the same way  there may be a rule of conduct there is no rule of human fellowship  to deal with men is as fine an art as it is to deal with ships  both men and ships live in an unstable element are subject to subtle and powerful influences and want to have their merits understood rather than their faults found out  it is not what your ship will not do that you want to know to get on terms of successful partnership with her it is rather that you ought to have a precise knowledge of what she will do for you when called upon to put forth what is in her by a sympathetic touch  at first sight the difference does not seem great in either line of dealing with the difficult problem of limitations  but the difference is great  the difference lies in the spirit in which the problem is approached  after all the art of handling ships is finer perhaps than the art of handling men  and like all fine arts it must be based upon a broad solid sincerity which like a law of nature rules an infinity of different phenomena  your endeavour must be singleminded  you would talk differently to a coalheaver and to a professor  but is this duplicity  i deny it  the truth consists in the genuineness of the feeling in the genuine recognition of the two men so similar and so different as your two partners in the hazard of life  obviously a humbug thinking only of winning his little race would stand a chance of profiting by his artifices  men professors or coalheavers are easily deceived they even have an extraordinary knack of lending themselves to deception a sort of curious and inexplicable propensity to allow themselves to be led by the nose with their eyes open  but a ship is a creature which we have brought into the world as it were on purpose to keep us up to the mark  in her handling a ship will not put up with a mere pretender as for instance the public will do with mr x the popular statesman mr y the popular scientist or mr z the popularwhat shall we sayanything from a teacher of high morality to a bagmanwho have won their little race  but i would like though not accustomed to betting to wager a large sum that not one of the few firstrate skippers of racing yachts has ever been a humbug  it would have been too difficult  the difficulty arises from the fact that one does not deal with ships in a mob but with a ship as an individual  so we may have to do with men but in each of us there lurks some particle of the mob spirit of the mob temperament  no matter how earnestly we strive against each other we remain brothers on the lowest side of our intellect and in the instability of our feelings  with ships it is not so much as they are to us they are nothing to each other  those sensitive creatures have no ears for our blandishments  it takes something more than words to cajole them to do our will to cover us with glory  luckily too or else there would have been more shoddy reputations for firstrate seamanship  ships have no ears i repeat though indeed i think i have known ships who really seemed to have had eyes or else i cannot understand on what ground a certain 1000ton barque of my acquaintance on one particular occasion refused to answer her helm thereby saving a frightful smash to two ships and to a very good mans reputation  i knew her intimately for two years and in no other instance either before or since have i known her to do that thing  the man she had served so well guessing perhaps at the depths of his affection for her i have known much longer and in bare justice to him i must say that this confidenceshattering experience though so fortunate only augmented his trust in her  yes our ships have no ears and thus they cannot be deceived  i would illustrate my idea of fidelity as between man and ship between the master and his art by a statement which though it might appear shockingly sophisticated is really very simple  i would say that a racingyacht skipper who thought of nothing else but the glory of winning the race would never attain to any eminence of reputation  the genuine masters of their crafti say this confidently from my experience of ships have thought of nothing but of doing their very best by the vessel under their charge  to forget ones self to surrender all personal feeling in the service of that fine art is the only way for a seaman to the faithful discharge of his trust  such is the service of a fine art and of ships that sail the sea and therein i think i can lay my finger upon the difference between the seamen of yesterday who are still with us and the seamen of tomorrow already entered upon the possession of their inheritance  history repeats itself but the special call of an art which has passed away is never reproduced  it is as utterly gone out of the world as the song of a destroyed wild bird nothing will awaken the same response of pleasurable emotion or conscientious endeavour  and the sailing of any vessel afloat is an art whose fine form seems already receding from us on its way to the overshadowed valley of oblivion  the taking of a modern steamship about the world though one would not minimize its responsibilities has not the same quality of intimacy with nature which after all is an indispensable condition to the building up of an art  it is less personal and a more exact calling less arduous but also less gratifying in the lack of close communion between the artist and the medium of his art  it is in short less a matter of love  its effects are measured exactly in time and space as no effect of an art can be  it is an occupation which a man not desperately subject to seasickness can be imagined to follow with content without enthusiasm with industry without affection  punctuality is its watchword  the incertitude which attends closely every artistic endeavour is absent from its regulated enterprise  it has no great moments of selfconfidence or moments not less great of doubt and heartsearching  it is an industry which like other industries has its romance its honour and its rewards its bitter anxieties and its hours of ease  but such seagoing has not the artistic quality of a singlehanded struggle with something much greater than yourself it is not the laborious absorbing practice of an art whose ultimate result remains on the knees of the gods  it is not an individual temperamental achievement but simply the skilled use of a captured force merely another step forward upon the way of universal conquest    ix    every passage of a ship of yesterday whose yards were braced round eagerly the very moment the pilot with his pockets full of letters had got over the side was like a racea race against time against an ideal standard of achievement outstripping the expectations of common men  like all true art the general conduct of a ship and her handling in particular cases had a technique which could be discussed with delight and pleasure by men who found in their work not bread alone but an outlet for the peculiarities of their temperament  to get the best and truest effect from the infinitely varying moods of sky and sea not pictorially but in the spirit of their calling was their vocation one and all and they recognised this with as much sincerity and drew as much inspiration from this reality as any man who ever put brush to canvas  the diversity of temperaments was immense amongst those masters of the fine art  some of them were like royal academicians of a certain kind  they never startled you by a touch of originality by a fresh audacity of inspiration  they were safe very safe  they went about solemnly in the assurance of their consecrated and empty reputation  names are odious but i remember one of them who might have been their very president the pra of the seacraft  his weatherbeaten and handsome face his portly presence his shirt fronts and broad cuffs and gold links his air of bluff distinction impressed the humble beholders stevedores tally clerks tidewaiters as he walked ashore over the gangway of his ship lying at the circular quay in sydney  his voice was deep hearty and authoritativethe voice of a very prince amongst sailors  he did everything with an air which put your attention on the alert and raised your expectations but the result somehow was always on stereotyped lines unsuggestive empty of any lesson that one could lay to heart  he kept his ship in applepie order which would have been seamanlike enough but for a finicking touch in its details  his officers affected a superiority over the rest of us but the boredom of their souls appeared in their manner of dreary submission to the fads of their commander  it was only his apprenticed boys whose irrepressible spirits were not affected by the solemn and respectable mediocrity of that artist  there were four of these youngsters  one the son of a doctor another of a colonel the third of a jeweller the name of the fourth was twentyman and this is all i remember of his parentage  but not one of them seemed to possess the smallest spark of gratitude in his composition  though their commander was a kind man in his way and had made a point of introducing them to the best people in the town in order that they should not fall into the bad company of boys belonging to other ships i regret to say that they made faces at him behind his back and imitated the dignified carriage of his head without any concealment whatever  this master of the fine art was a personage and nothing more but as i have said there was an infinite diversity of temperament amongst the masters of the fine art i have known  some were great impressionists  they impressed upon you the fear of god and immensityor in other words the fear of being drowned with every circumstance of terrific grandeur  one may think that the locality of your passing away by means of suffocation in water does not really matter very much  i am not so sure of that  i am perhaps unduly sensitive but i confess that the idea of being suddenly spilt into an infuriated ocean in the midst of darkness and uproar affected me always with a sensation of shrinking distaste  to be drowned in a pond though it might be called an ignominious fate by the ignorant is yet a bright and peaceful ending in comparison with some other endings to ones earthly career which i have mentally quaked at in the intervals or even in the midst of violent exertions  but let that pass  some of the masters whose influence left a trace upon my character to this very day combined a fierceness of conception with a certitude of execution upon the basis of just appreciation of means and ends which is the highest quality of the man of action  and an artist is a man of action whether he creates a personality invents an expedient or finds the issue of a complicated situation  there were masters too i have known whose very art consisted in avoiding every conceivable situation  it is needless to say that they never did great things in their craft but they were not to be despised for that  they were modest they understood their limitations  their own masters had not handed the sacred fire into the keeping of their cold and skilful hands  one of those last i remember specially now gone to his rest from that sea which his temperament must have made a scene of little more than a peaceful pursuit  once only did he attempt a stroke of audacity one early morning with a steady breeze entering a crowded roadstead  but he was not genuine in this display which might have been art  he was thinking of his own self he hankered after the meretricious glory of a showy performance  as rounding a dark wooded point bathed in fresh air and sunshine we opened to view a crowd of shipping at anchor lying half a mile ahead of us perhaps he called me aft from my station on the forecastle head and turning over and over his binoculars in his brown hands said  do you see that big heavy ship with white lower masts  i am going to take up a berth between her and the shore  now do you see to it that the men jump smartly at the first order  i answered ay ay sir and verily believed that this would be a fine performance  we dashed on through the fleet in magnificent style  there must have been many open mouths and following eyes on board those shipsdutch english with a sprinkling of americans and a german or twowho had all hoisted their flags at eight oclock as if in honour of our arrival  it would have been a fine performance if it had come off but it did not  through a touch of selfseeking that modest artist of solid merit became untrue to his temperament  it was not with him art for arts sake  it was art for his own sake and a dismal failure was the penalty he paid for that greatest of sins  it might have been even heavier but as it happened we did not run our ship ashore nor did we knock a large hole in the big ship whose lower masts were painted white  but it is a wonder that we did not carry away the cables of both our anchors for as may be imagined i did not stand upon the order to let go that came to me in a quavering quite unknown voice from his trembling lips  i let them both go with a celerity which to this day astonishes my memory  no average merchantmans anchors have ever been let go with such miraculous smartness  and they both held  i could have kissed their rough cold iron palms in gratitude if they had not been buried in slimy mud under ten fathoms of water  ultimately they brought us up with the jibboom of a dutch brig poking through our spankernothing worse  and a miss is as good as a mile  but not in art  afterwards the master said to me in a shy mumble she wouldnt luff up in time somehow  whats the matter with her  and i made no answer  yet the answer was clear  the ship had found out the momentary weakness of her man  of all the living creatures upon land and sea it is ships alone that cannot be taken in by barren pretences that will not put up with bad art from their masters    x    from the main truck of the average tall ship the horizon describes a circle of many miles in which you can see another ship right down to her waterline and these very eyes which follow this writing have counted in their time over a hundred sail becalmed as if within a magic ring not very far from the azoresships more or less tall  there were hardly two of them heading exactly the same way as if each had meditated breaking out of the enchanted circle at a different point of the compass  but the spell of the calm is a strong magic  the following day still saw them scattered within sight of each other and heading different ways but when at last the breeze came with the darkling ripple that ran very blue on a pale sea they all went in the same direction together  for this was the homewardbound fleet from the faroff ends of the earth and a falmouth fruitschooner the smallest of them all was heading the flight  one could have imagined her very fair if not divinely tall leaving a scent of lemons and oranges in her wake  the next day there were very few ships in sight from our mast headsseven at most perhaps with a few more distant specks hull down beyond the magic ring of the horizon  the spell of the fair wind has a subtle power to scatter a whitewinged company of ships looking all the same way each with its white fillet of tumbling foam under the bow  it is the calm that brings ships mysteriously together it is your wind that is the great separator  the taller the ship the further she can be seen and her white tallness breathed upon by the wind first proclaims her size  the tall masts holding aloft the white canvas spread out like a snare for catching the invisible power of the air emerge gradually from the water sail after sail yard after yard growing big till under the towering structure of her machinery you perceive the insignificant tiny speck of her hull  the tall masts are the pillars supporting the balanced planes that motionless and silent catch from the air the ships motivepower as it were a gift from heaven vouchsafed to the audacity of man and it is the ships tall spars stripped and shorn of their white glory that incline themselves before the anger of the clouded heaven  when they yield to a squall in a gaunt and naked submission their tallness is brought best home even to the mind of a seaman  the man who has looked upon his ship going over too far is made aware of the preposterous tallness of a ships spars  it seems impossible but that those gilt trucks which one had to tilt ones head back to see now falling into the lower plane of vision must perforce hit the very edge of the horizon  such an experience gives you a better impression of the loftiness of your spars than any amount of running aloft could do  and yet in my time the royal yards of an average profitable ship were a good way up above her decks  no doubt a fair amount of climbing up iron ladders can be achieved by an active man in a ships engineroom but i remember moments when even to my supple limbs and pride of nimbleness the sailing ships machinery seemed to reach up to the very stars  for machinery it is doing its work in perfect silence and with a motionless grace that seems to hide a capricious and not always governable power taking nothing away from the material stores of the earth  not for it the unerring precision of steel moved by white steam and living by red fire and fed with black coal  the other seems to draw its strength from the very soul of the world its formidable ally held to obedience by the frailest bonds like a fierce ghost captured in a snare of something even finer than spun silk  for what is the array of the strongest ropes the tallest spars and the stoutest canvas against the mighty breath of the infinite but thistle stalks cobwebs and gossamer    xi    indeed it is less than nothing and i have seen when the great soul of the world turned over with a heavy sigh a perfectly new extrastout foresail vanish like a bit of some airy stuff much lighter than gossamer  then was the time for the tall spars to stand fast in the great uproar  the machinery must do its work even if the soul of the world has gone mad  the modern steamship advances upon a still and overshadowed sea with a pulsating tremor of her frame an occasional clang in her depths as if she had an iron heart in her iron body with a thudding rhythm in her progress and the regular beat of her propeller heard afar in the night with an august and plodding sound as of the march of an inevitable future  but in a gale the silent machinery of a sailingship would catch not only the power but the wild and exulting voice of the worlds soul  whether she ran with her tall spars swinging or breasted it with her tall spars lying over there was always that wild song deep like a chant for a bass to the shrill pipe of the wind played on the sea tops with a punctuating crash now and then of a breaking wave at times the weird effects of that invisible orchestra would get upon a mans nerves till he wished himself deaf  and this recollection of a personal wish experienced upon several oceans where the soul of the world has plenty of room to turn over with a mighty sigh brings me to the remark that in order to take a proper care of a ships spars it is just as well for a seaman to have nothing the matter with his ears  such is the intimacy with which a seaman had to live with his ship of yesterday that his senses were like her senses that the stress upon his body made him judge of the strain upon the ships masts  i had been some time at sea before i became aware of the fact that hearing plays a perceptible part in gauging the force of the wind it was at night  the ship was one of those iron woolclippers that the clyde had floated out in swarms upon the world during the seventh decade of the last century  it was a fine period in ship building and also i might say a period of overmasting  the spars rigged up on the narrow hulls were indeed tall then and the ship of which i think with her colouredglass skylight ends bearing the motto let glasgow flourish was certainly one of the most heavilysparred specimens  she was built for hard driving and unquestionably she got all the driving she could stand  our captain was a man famous for the quick passages he had been used to make in the old tweed a ship famous the world over for her speed the tweed had been a wooden vessel and he brought the tradition of quick passages with him into the iron clipper  i was the junior in her a third mate keeping watch with the chief officer and it was just during one of the night watches in a strong freshening breeze that i overheard two men in a sheltered nook of the main deck exchanging these informing remarks  said one  should think twas time some of them light sails were coming off her  and the other an older man uttered grumpily  no fear not while the chief mates on deck  hes that deaf he cant tell how much wind there is  and indeed poor p quite young and a smart seaman was very hard of hearing  at the same time he had the name of being the very devil of a fellow for carrying on sail on a ship  he was wonderfully clever at concealing his deafness and as to carrying on heavily though he was a fearless man i dont think that he ever meant to take undue risks  i can never forget his naive sort of astonishment when remonstrated with for what appeared a most daredevil performance  the only person of course that could remonstrate with telling effect was our captain himself a man of daredevil tradition and really for me who knew under whom i was serving those were impressive scenes  captain s had a great name for sailorlike qualitiesthe sort of name that compelled my youthful admiration  to this day i preserve his memory for indeed it was he in a sense who completed my training  it was often a stormy process but let that pass  i am sure he meant well and i am certain that never not even at the time could i bear him malice for his extraordinary gift of incisive criticism and to hear him make a fuss about too much sail on the ship seemed one of those incredible experiences that take place only in ones dreams  it generally happened in this way  night clouds racing overhead wind howling royals set and the ship rushing on in the dark an immense white sheet of foam level with the lee rail  mr p in charge of the deck hooked on to the windward mizzen rigging in a state of perfect serenity myself the third mate also hooked on somewhere to windward of the slanting poop in a state of the utmost preparedness to jump at the very first hint of some sort of order but otherwise in a perfectly acquiescent state of mind suddenly out of the companion would appear a tall dark figure bareheaded with a short white beard of a perpendicular cut very visible in the darkcaptain s disturbed in his reading down below by the frightful bounding and lurching of the ship  leaning very much against the precipitous incline of the deck he would take a turn or two perfectly silent hang on by the compass for a while take another couple of turns and suddenly burst out  what are you trying to do with the ship  and mr p who was not good at catching what was shouted in the wind would say interrogatively  yes sir  then in the increasing gale of the sea there would be a little private ships storm going on in which you could detect strong language pronounced in a tone of passion and exculpatory protestations uttered with every possible inflection of injured innocence  by heavens mr p  i used to carry on sail in my time but  and the rest would be lost to me in a stormy gust of wind  then in a lull ps protesting innocence would become audible  she seems to stand it very well  and then another burst of an indignant voice  any fool can carry sail on a ship  and so on and so on the ship meanwhile rushing on her way with a heavier list a noisier splutter a more threatening hiss of the white almost blinding sheet of foam to leeward  for the best of it was that captain s seemed constitutionally incapable of giving his officers a definite order to shorten sail and so that extraordinarily vague row would go on till at last it dawned upon them both in some particularly alarming gust that it was time to do something  there is nothing like the fearful inclination of your tall spars overloaded with canvas to bring a deaf man and an angry one to their senses    xii    so sail did get shortened more or less in time even in that ship and her tall spars never went overboard while i served in her however all the time i was with them captain s and mr p did not get on very well together  if p carried on like the very devil because he was too deaf to know how much wind there was captain s who as i have said seemed constitutionally incapable of ordering one of his officers to shorten sail resented the necessity forced upon him by mr ps desperate goings on  it was in captain ss tradition rather to reprove his officers for not carrying on quite enoughin his phrase for not taking every ounce of advantage of a fair wind  but there was also a psychological motive that made him extremely difficult to deal with on board that iron clipper  he had just come out of the marvellous tweed a ship i have heard heavy to look at but of phenomenal speed  in the middle sixties she had beaten by a day and a half the steam mailboat from hong kong to singapore  there was something peculiarly lucky perhaps in the placing of her mastswho knows officers of menofwar used to come on board to take the exact dimensions of her sailplan  perhaps there had been a touch of genius or the finger of good fortune in the fashioning of her lines at bow and stern  it is impossible to say  she was built in the east indies somewhere of teakwood throughout except the deck she had a great sheer high bows and a clumsy stern  the men who had seen her described her to me as nothing much to look at  but in the great indian famine of the seventies that ship already old then made some wonderful dashes across the gulf of bengal with cargoes of rice from rangoon to madras  she took the secret of her speed with her and unsightly as she was her image surely has its glorious place in the mirror of the old sea  the point however is that captain s who used to say frequently she never made a decent passage after i left her seemed to think that the secret of her speed lay in her famous commander  no doubt the secret of many a ships excellence does lie with the man on board but it was hopeless for captain s to try to make his new iron clipper equal the feats which made the old tweed a name of praise upon the lips of englishspeaking seamen  there was something pathetic in it as in the endeavour of an artist in his old age to equal the masterpieces of his youthfor the tweeds famous passages were captain ss masterpieces  it was pathetic and perhaps just the least bit dangerous  at any rate i am glad that what between captain ss yearning for old triumphs and mr ps deafness i have seen some memorable carrying on to make a passage  and i have carried on myself upon the tall spars of that clyde shipbuilders masterpiece as i have never carried on in a ship before or since  the second mate falling ill during the passage i was promoted to officer of the watch alone in charge of the deck  thus the immense leverage of the ships tall masts became a matter very near my own heart  i suppose it was something of a compliment for a young fellow to be trusted apparently without any supervision by such a commander as captain s though as far as i can remember neither the tone nor the manner nor yet the drift of captain ss remarks addressed to myself did ever by the most strained interpretation imply a favourable opinion of my abilities  and he was i must say a most uncomfortable commander to get your orders from at night  if i had the watch from eight till midnight he would leave the deck about nine with the words dont take any sail off her  then on the point of disappearing down the companionway he would add curtly  dont carry anything away i am glad to say that i never did one night however i was caught not quite prepared by a sudden shift of wind  there was of course a good deal of noiserunning about the shouts of the sailors the thrashing of the sailsenough in fact to wake the dead  but s never came on deck  when i was relieved by the chief mate an hour afterwards he sent for me  i went into his stateroom he was lying on his couch wrapped up in a rug with a pillow under his head  what was the matter with you up there just now he asked  wind flew round on the lee quarter sir i said  couldnt you see the shift coming  yes sir i thought it wasnt very far off  why didnt you have your courses hauled up at once then he asked in a tone that ought to have made my blood run cold  but this was my chance and i did not let it slip  well sir i said in an apologetic tone she was going eleven knots very nicely and i thought she would do for another halfhour or so  he gazed at me darkly out of his head lying very still on the white pillow for a time  ah yes another halfhour  thats the way ships get dismasted  and that was all i got in the way of a wigging  i waited a little while and then went out shutting carefully the door of the state room after me  well i have loved lived with and left the sea without ever seeing a ships tall fabric of sticks cobwebs and gossamer go by the board  sheer good luck no doubt  but as to poor p i am sure that he would not have got off scotfree like this but for the god of gales who called him away early from this earth which is three parts ocean and therefore a fit abode for sailors  a few years afterwards i met in an indian port a man who had served in the ships of the same company  names came up in our talk names of our colleagues in the same employ and naturally enough i asked after p  had he got a command yet  and the other man answered carelessly  no but hes provided for anyhow  a heavy sea took him off the poop in the run between new zealand and the horn  thus p passed away from amongst the tall spars of ships that he had tried to their utmost in many a spell of boisterous weather he had shown me what carrying on meant but he was not a man to learn discretion from  he could not help his deafness  one can only remember his cheery temper his admiration for the jokes in punch his little odditieslike his strange passion for borrowing lookingglasses for instance  each of our cabins had its own lookingglass screwed to the bulkhead and what he wanted with more of them we never could fathom  he asked for the loan in confidential tones  why  mystery  we made various surmises  no one will ever know now  at any rate it was a harmless eccentricity and may the god of gales who took him away so abruptly between new zealand and the horn let his soul rest in some paradise of true seamen where no amount of carrying on will ever dismast a ship    xiii    there has been a time when a ships chief mate pocketbook in hand and pencil behind his ear kept one eye aloft upon his riggers and the other down the hatchway on the stevedores and watched the disposition of his ships cargo knowing that even before she started he was already doing his best to secure for her an easy and quick passage  the hurry of the times the loading and discharging organization of the docks the use of hoisting machinery which works quickly and will not wait the cry for prompt despatch the very size of his ship stand nowadays between the modern seaman and the thorough knowledge of his craft  there are profitable ships and unprofitable ships  the profitable ship will carry a large load through all the hazards of the weather and when at rest will stand up in dock and shift from berth to berth without ballast  there is a point of perfection in a ship as a worker when she is spoken of as being able to sail without ballast  i have never met that sort of paragon myself but i have seen these paragons advertised amongst ships for sale  such excess of virtue and goodnature on the part of a ship always provoked my mistrust  it is open to any man to say that his ship will sail without ballast and he will say it too with every mark of profound conviction especially if he is not going to sail in her himself  the risk of advertising her as able to sail without ballast is not great since the statement does not imply a warranty of her arriving anywhere  moreover it is strictly true that most ships will sail without ballast for some little time before they turn turtle upon the crew  a shipowner loves a profitable ship the seaman is proud of her a doubt of her good looks seldom exists in his mind but if he can boast of her more useful qualities it is an added satisfaction for his selflove  the loading of ships was once a matter of skill judgment and knowledge  thick books have been written about it  stevens on stowage is a portly volume with the renown and weight in its own world of coke on littleton  stevens is an agreeable writer and as is the case with men of talent his gifts adorn his sterling soundness  he gives you the official teaching on the whole subject is precise as to rules mentions illustrative events quotes law cases where verdicts turned upon a point of stowage  he is never pedantic and for all his close adherence to broad principles he is ready to admit that no two ships can be treated exactly alike  stevedoring which had been a skilled labour is fast becoming a labour without the skill  the modern steamship with her many holds is not loaded within the sailorlike meaning of the word  she is filled up  her cargo is not stowed in any sense it is simply dumped into her through six hatchways more or less by twelve winches or so with clatter and hurry and racket and heat in a cloud of steam and a mess of coaldust  as long as you keep her propeller under water and take care say not to fling down barrels of oil on top of bales of silk or deposit an iron bridgegirder of five ton or so upon a bed of coffeebags you have done about all in the way of duty that the cry for prompt despatch will allow you to do    xiv    the sailingship when i knew her in her days of perfection was a sensible creature  when i say her days of perfection i mean perfection of build gear seaworthy qualities and case of handling not the perfection of speed  that quality has departed with the change of building material  no iron ship of yesterday ever attained the marvels of speed which the seamanship of men famous in their time had obtained from their wooden coppersheeted predecessors  everything had been done to make the iron ship perfect but no wit of man had managed to devise an efficient coating composition to keep her bottom clean with the smooth cleanness of yellow metal sheeting  after a spell of a few weeks at sea an iron ship begins to lag as if she had grown tired too soon  it is only her bottom that is getting foul  a very little affects the speed of an iron ship which is not driven on by a merciless propeller  often it is impossible to tell what inconsiderate trifle puts her off her stride  a certain mysteriousness hangs around the quality of speed as it was displayed by the old sailingships commanded by a competent seaman in those days the speed depended upon the seaman therefore apart from the laws rules and regulations for the good preservation of his cargo he was careful of his loadingor what is technically called the trim of his ship  some ships sailed fast on an even keel others had to be trimmed quite one foot by the stern and i have heard of a ship that gave her best speed on a wind when so loaded as to float a couple of inches by the head  i call to mind a winter landscape in amsterdama flat foreground of waste land with here and there stacks of timber like the huts of a camp of some very miserable tribe the long stretch of the handelskade cold stonefaced quays with the snowsprinkled ground and the hard frozen water of the canal in which were set ships one behind another with their frosty mooringropes hanging slack and their decks idle and deserted because as the master stevedore a gentle pale person with a few golden hairs on his chin and a reddened nose informed me their cargoes were frozenin upcountry on barges and schuyts  in the distance beyond the waste ground and running parallel with the line of ships a line of brown warmtoned houses seemed bowed under snowladen roofs from afar at the end of tsar peter straat issued in the frosty air the tinkle of bells of the horse tramcars appearing and disappearing in the opening between the buildings like little toy carriages harnessed with toy horses and played with by people that appeared no bigger than children  i was as the french say biting my fists with impatience for that cargo frozen upcountry with rage at that canal set fast at the wintry and deserted aspect of all those ships that seemed to decay in grim depression for want of the open water  i was chief mate and very much alone  directly i had joined i received from my owners instructions to send all the ships apprentices away on leave together because in such weather there was nothing for anybody to do unless to keep up a fire in the cabin stove  that was attended to by a snuffy and mopheaded inconceivably dirty and weirdly toothless dutch shipkeeper who could hardly speak three words of english but who must have had some considerable knowledge of the language since he managed invariably to interpret in the contrary sense everything that was said to him  notwithstanding the little iron stove the ink froze on the swing table in the cabin and i found it more convenient to go ashore stumbling over the arctic wasteland and shivering in glazed tramcars in order to write my evening letter to my owners in a gorgeous cafe in the centre of the town  it was an immense place lofty and gilt upholstered in red plush full of electric lights and so thoroughly warmed that even the marble tables felt tepid to the touch  the waiter who brought me my cup of coffee bore by comparison with my utter isolation the dear aspect of an intimate friend  there alone in a noisy crowd i would write slowly a letter addressed to glasgow of which the gist would be  there is no cargo and no prospect of any coming till late spring apparently  and all the time i sat there the necessity of getting back to the ship bore heavily on my already halfcongealed spirits the shivering in glazed tramcars the stumbling over the snow sprinkled waste ground the vision of ships frozen in a row appearing vaguely like corpses of black vessels in a white world so silent so lifeless so soulless they seemed to be  with precaution i would go up the side of my own particular corpse and would feel her as cold as ice itself and as slippery under my feet  my cold berth would swallow up like a chilly burial niche my bodily shivers and my mental excitement  it was a cruel winter the very air seemed as hard and trenchant as steel but it would have taken much more than this to extinguish my sacred fire for the exercise of my craft  no young man of twentyfour appointed chief mate for the first time in his life would have let that dutch tenacious winter penetrate into his heart  i think that in those days i never forgot the fact of my elevation for five consecutive minutes  i fancy it kept me warm even in my slumbers better than the high pile of blankets which positively crackled with frost as i threw them off in the morning  and i would get up early for no reason whatever except that i was in sole charge  the new captain had not been appointed yet  almost each morning a letter from my owners would arrive directing me to go to the charterers and clamour for the ships cargo to threaten them with the heaviest penalties of demurrage to demand that this assortment of varied merchandise set fast in a landscape of ice and windmills somewhere upcountry should be put on rail instantly and fed up to the ship in regular quantities every day after drinking some hot coffee like an arctic explorer setting off on a sledge journey towards the north pole i would go ashore and roll shivering in a tramcar into the very heart of the town past cleanfaced houses past thousands of brass knockers upon a thousand painted doors glimmering behind rows of trees of the pavement species leafless gaunt seemingly dead for ever  that part of the expedition was easy enough though the horses were painfully glistening with icicles and the aspect of the tram conductors faces presented a repulsive blending of crimson and purple  but as to frightening or bullying or even wheedling some sort of answer out of mr hudig that was another matter altogether  he was a big swarthy netherlander with black moustaches and a bold glance  he always began by shoving me into a chair before i had time to open my mouth gave me cordially a large cigar and in excellent english would start to talk everlastingly about the phenomenal severity of the weather  it was impossible to threaten a man who though he possessed the language perfectly seemed incapable of understanding any phrase pronounced in a tone of remonstrance or discontent  as to quarrelling with him it would have been stupid  the weather was too bitter for that  his office was so warm his fire so bright his sides shook so heartily with laughter that i experienced always a great difficulty in making up my mind to reach for my hat  at last the cargo did come  at first it came dribbling in by rail in trucks till the thaw set in and then fast in a multitude of barges with a great rush of unbound waters  the gentle master stevedore had his hands very full at last and the chief mate became worried in his mind as to the proper distribution of the weight of his first cargo in a ship he did not personally know before  ships do want humouring  they want humouring in handling and if you mean to handle them well they must have been humoured in the distribution of the weight which you ask them to carry through the good and evil fortune of a passage  your ship is a tender creature whose idiosyncrasies must be attended to if you mean her to come with credit to herself and you through the roughandtumble of her life    xv    so seemed to think the new captain who arrived the day after we had finished loading on the very eve of the day of sailing  i first beheld him on the quay a complete stranger to me obviously not a hollander in a black bowler and a short drab overcoat ridiculously out of tone with the winter aspect of the wastelands bordered by the brown fronts of houses with their roofs dripping with melting snow  this stranger was walking up and down absorbed in the marked contemplation of the ships fore and aft trim but when i saw him squat on his heels in the slush at the very edge of the quay to peer at the draught of water under her counter i said to myself this is the captain  and presently i descried his luggage coming alonga real sailors chest carried by means of ropebeckets between two men with a couple of leather portmanteaus and a roll of charts sheeted in canvas piled upon the lid  the sudden spontaneous agility with which he bounded aboard right off the rail afforded me the first glimpse of his real character  without further preliminaries than a friendly nod he addressed me  you have got her pretty well in her fore and aft trim  now what about your weights  i told him i had managed to keep the weight sufficiently well up as i thought onethird of the whole being in the upper part above the beams as the technical expression has it  he whistled phew scrutinizing me from head to foot  a sort of smiling vexation was visible on his ruddy face  well we shall have a lively time of it this passage i bet he said  he knew  it turned out he had been chief mate of her for the two preceding voyages and i was already familiar with his handwriting in the old logbooks i had been perusing in my cabin with a natural curiosity looking up the records of my new ships luck of her behaviour of the good times she had had and of the troubles she had escaped  he was right in his prophecy  on our passage from amsterdam to samarang with a general cargo of which alas only onethird in weight was stowed above the beams we had a lively time of it it was lively but not joyful  there was not even a single moment of comfort in it because no seaman can feel comfortable in body or mind when he has made his ship uneasy  to travel along with a cranky ship for ninety days or so is no doubt a nervetrying experience but in this case what was wrong with our craft was this  that by my system of loading she had been made much too stable  neither before nor since have i felt a ship roll so abruptly so violently so heavily  once she began you felt that she would never stop and this hopeless sensation characterizing the motion of ships whose centre of gravity is brought down too low in loading made everyone on board weary of keeping on his feet  i remember once overhearing one of the hands say  by heavens jack  i feel as if i didnt mind how soon i let myself go and let the blamed hooker knock my brains out if she likes  the captain used to remark frequently  ah yes i dare say onethird weight above beams would have been quite enough for most ships  but then you see theres no two of them alike on the seas and shes an uncommonly ticklish jade to load  down south running before the gales of high latitudes she made our life a burden to us  there were days when nothing would keep even on the swingtables when there was no position where you could fix yourself so as not to feel a constant strain upon all the muscles of your body  she rolled and rolled with an awful dislodging jerk and that dizzily fast sweep of her masts on every swing  it was a wonder that the men sent aloft were not flung off the yards the yards not flung off the masts the masts not flung overboard  the captain in his armchair holding on grimly at the head of the table with the souptureen rolling on one side of the cabin and the steward sprawling on the other would observe looking at me  thats your onethird above the beams  the only thing that surprises me is that the sticks have stuck to her all this time  ultimately some of the minor spars did gonothing important spankerbooms and suchlikebecause at times the frightful impetus of her rolling would part a fourfold tackle of new threeinch manilla line as if it were weaker than packthread  it was only poetic justice that the chief mate who had made a mistakeperhaps a halfexcusable oneabout the distribution of his ships cargo should pay the penalty  a piece of one of the minor spars that did carry away flew against the chief mates back and sent him sliding on his face for quite a considerable distance along the main deck  thereupon followed various and unpleasant consequences of a physical orderqueer symptoms as the captain who treated them used to say inexplicable periods of powerlessness sudden accesses of mysterious pain and the patient agreed fully with the regretful mutters of his very attentive captain wishing that it had been a straightforward broken leg even the dutch doctor who took the case up in samarang offered no scientific explanation  all he said was  ah friend you are young yet it may be very serious for your whole life  you must leave your ship you must quite silent be for three monthsquite silent  of course he meant the chief mate to keep quietto lay up as a matter of fact  his manner was impressive enough if his english was childishly imperfect when compared with the fluency of mr hudig the figure at the other end of that passage and memorable enough in its way  in a great airy ward of a far eastern hospital lying on my back i had plenty of leisure to remember the dreadful cold and snow of amsterdam while looking at the fronds of the palmtrees tossing and rustling at the height of the window  i could remember the elated feeling and the soulgripping cold of those tramway journeys taken into town to put what in diplomatic language is called pressure upon the good hudig with his warm fire his armchair his big cigar and the neverfailing suggestion in his goodnatured voice  i suppose in the end it is you they will appoint captain before the ship sails  it may have been his extreme goodnature the serious unsmiling goodnature of a fat swarthy man with coalblack moustache and steady eyes but he might have been a bit of a diplomatist too  his enticing suggestions i used to repel modestly by the assurance that it was extremely unlikely as i had not enough experience  you know very well how to go about business matters he used to say with a sort of affected moodiness clouding his serene round face  i wonder whether he ever laughed to himself after i had left the office  i dare say he never did because i understand that diplomatists in and out of the career take themselves and their tricks with an exemplary seriousness  but he had nearly persuaded me that i was fit in every way to be trusted with a command  there came three months of mental worry hard rolling remorse and physical pain to drive home the lesson of insufficient experience  yes your ship wants to be humoured with knowledge  you must treat with an understanding consideration the mysteries of her feminine nature and then she will stand by you faithfully in the unceasing struggle with forces wherein defeat is no shame  it is a serious relation that in which a man stands to his ship  she has her rights as though she could breathe and speak and indeed there are ships that for the right man will do anything but speak as the saying goes  a ship is not a slave  you must make her easy in a seaway you must never forget that you owe her the fullest share of your thought of your skill of your selflove  if you remember that obligation naturally and without effort as if it were an instinctive feeling of your inner life she will sail stay run for you as long as she is able or like a seabird going to rest upon the angry waves she will lay out the heaviest gale that ever made you doubt living long enough to see another sunrise    xvi    often i turn with melancholy eagerness to the space reserved in the newspapers under the general heading of shipping intelligence  i meet there the names of ships i have known  every year some of these names disappearthe names of old friends  tempi passati  the different divisions of that kind of news are set down in their order which varies but slightly in its arrangement of concise headlines  and first comes speakingsreports of ships met and signalled at sea name port where from where bound for so many days out ending frequently with the words all well  then come wrecks and casualtiesa longish array of paragraphs unless the weather has been fair and clear and friendly to ships all over the world  on some days there appears the heading overduean ominous threat of loss and sorrow trembling yet in the balance of fate  there is something sinister to a seaman in the very grouping of the letters which form this word clear in its meaning and seldom threatening in vain  only a very few days moreappallingly few to the hearts which had set themselves bravely to hope against hopethree weeks a month later perhaps the name of ships under the blight of the overdue heading shall appear again in the column of shipping intelligence but under the final declaration of missing  the ship or barque or brig soandso bound from such a port with such and such cargo for such another port having left at such and such a date last spoken at sea on such a day and never having been heard of since was posted today as missing  such in its strictly official eloquence is the form of funeral orations on ships that perhaps wearied with a long struggle or in some unguarded moment that may come to the readiest of us had let themselves be overwhelmed by a sudden blow from the enemy  who can say  perhaps the men she carried had asked her to do too much had stretched beyond breakingpoint the enduring faithfulness which seems wrought and hammered into that assemblage of iron ribs and plating of wood and steel and canvas and wire which goes to the making of a shipa complete creation endowed with character individuality qualities and defects by men whose hands launch her upon the water and that other men shall learn to know with an intimacy surpassing the intimacy of man with man to love with a love nearly as great as that of man for woman and often as blind in its infatuated disregard of defects  there are ships which bear a bad name but i have yet to meet one whose crew for the time being failed to stand up angrily for her against every criticism  one ship which i call to mind now had the reputation of killing somebody every voyage she made  this was no calumny and yet i remember well somewhere far back in the late seventies that the crew of that ship were if anything rather proud of her evil fame as if they had been an utterly corrupt lot of desperadoes glorying in their association with an atrocious creature  we belonging to other vessels moored all about the circular quay in sydney used to shake our heads at her with a great sense of the unblemished virtue of our own wellloved ships  i shall not pronounce her name  she is missing now after a sinister but from the point of view of her owners a useful career extending over many years and i should say across every ocean of our globe  having killed a man for every voyage and perhaps rendered more misanthropic by the infirmities that come with years upon a ship she had made up her mind to kill all hands at once before leaving the scene of her exploits  a fitting end this to a life of usefulness and crimein a last outburst of an evil passion supremely satisfied on some wild night perhaps to the applauding clamour of wind and wave  how did she do it  in the word missing there is a horrible depth of doubt and speculation  did she go quickly from under the mens feet or did she resist to the end letting the sea batter her to pieces start her butts wrench her frame load her with an increasing weight of salt water and dismasted unmanageable rolling heavily her boats gone her decks swept had she wearied her men half to death with the unceasing labour at the pumps before she sank with them like a stone  however such a case must be rare  i imagine a raft of some sort could always be contrived and even if it saved no one it would float on and be picked up perhaps conveying some hint of the vanished name  then that ship would not be properly speaking missing  she would be lost with all hands and in that distinction there is a subtle differenceless horror and a less appalling darkness    xvii    the unholy fascination of dread dwells in the thought of the last moments of a ship reported as missing in the columns of the shipping gazette  nothing of her ever comes to lightno grating no lifebuoy no piece of boat or branded oarto give a hint of the place and date of her sudden end  the shipping gazette does not even call her lost with all hands  she remains simply missing she has disappeared enigmatically into a mystery of fate as big as the world where your imagination of a brothersailor of a fellow servant and lover of ships may range unchecked  and yet sometimes one gets a hint of what the last scene may be like in the life of a ship and her crew which resembles a drama in its struggle against a great force bearing it up formless ungraspable chaotic and mysterious as fate  it was on a gray afternoon in the lull of a three days gale that had left the southern ocean tumbling heavily upon our ship under a sky hung with rags of clouds that seemed to have been cut and hacked by the keen edge of a souwest gale  our craft a clydebuilt barque of 1000 tons rolled so heavily that something aloft had carried away  no matter what the damage was but it was serious enough to induce me to go aloft myself with a couple of hands and the carpenter to see the temporary repairs properly done  sometimes we had to drop everything and cling with both hands to the swaying spars holding our breath in fear of a terribly heavy roll  and wallowing as if she meant to turn over with us the barque her decks full of water her gear flying in bights ran at some ten knots an hour  we had been driven far southmuch farther that way than we had meant to go and suddenly up there in the slings of the foreyard in the midst of our work i felt my shoulder gripped with such force in the carpenters powerful paw that i positively yelled with unexpected pain  the mans eyes stared close in my face and he shouted look sir look  whats this pointing ahead with his other hand  at first i saw nothing  the sea was one empty wilderness of black and white hills  suddenly halfconcealed in the tumult of the foaming rollers i made out awash something enormous rising and fallingsomething spread out like a burst of foam but with a more bluish more solid look  it was a piece of an icefloe melted down to a fragment but still big enough to sink a ship and floating lower than any raft right in our way as if ambushed among the waves with murderous intent there was no time to get down on deck  i shouted from aloft till my head was ready to split  i was heard aft and we managed to clear the sunken floe which had come all the way from the southern icecap to have a try at our unsuspecting lives  had it been an hour later nothing could have saved the ship for no eye could have made out in the dusk that pale piece of ice swept over by the whitecrested waves  and as we stood near the taffrail side by side my captain and i looking at it hardly discernible already but still quite closeto on our quarter he remarked in a meditative tone  but for the turn of that wheel just in time there would have been another case of a missing ship  nobody ever comes back from a missing ship to tell how hard was the death of the craft and how sudden and overwhelming the last anguish of her men  nobody can say with what thoughts with what regrets with what words on their lips they died  but there is something fine in the sudden passing away of these hearts from the extremity of struggle and stress and tremendous uproarfrom the vast unrestful rage of the surface to the profound peace of the depths sleeping untroubled since the beginning of ages    xviii    but if the word missing brings all hope to an end and settles the loss of the underwriters the word overdue confirms the fears already born in many homes ashore and opens the door of speculation in the market of risks  maritime risks be it understood  there is a class of optimists ready to reinsure an overdue ship at a heavy premium  but nothing can insure the hearts on shore against the bitterness of waiting for the worst  for if a missing ship has never turned up within the memory of seamen of my generation the name of an overdue ship trembling as it were on the edge of the fatal heading has been known to appear as arrived  it must blaze up indeed with a great brilliance the dull printers ink expended on the assemblage of the few letters that form the ships name to the anxious eyes scanning the page in fear and trembling  it is like the message of reprieve from the sentence of sorrow suspended over many a home even if some of the men in her have been the most homeless mortals that you may find among the wanderers of the sea  the reinsurer the optimist of illluck and disaster slaps his pocket with satisfaction  the underwriter who had been trying to minimize the amount of impending loss regrets his premature pessimism  the ship has been stauncher the skies more merciful the seas less angry or perhaps the men on board of a finer temper than he has been willing to take for granted  the ship soandso bound to such a port and posted as overdue has been reported yesterday as having arrived safely at her destination  thus run the official words of the reprieve addressed to the hearts ashore lying under a heavy sentence  and they come swiftly from the other side of the earth over wires and cables for your electric telegraph is a great alleviator of anxiety  details of course shall follow  and they may unfold a tale of narrow escape of steady illluck of high winds and heavy weather of ice of interminable calms or endless headgales a tale of difficulties overcome of adversity defied by a small knot of men upon the great loneliness of the sea a tale of resource of courageof helplessness perhaps  of all ships disabled at sea a steamer who has lost her propeller is the most helpless  and if she drifts into an unpopulated part of the ocean she may soon become overdue  the menace of the overdue and the finality of missing come very quickly to steamers whose life fed on coals and breathing the black breath of smoke into the air goes on in disregard of wind and wave  such a one a big steamship too whose working life had been a record of faithful keeping time from land to land in disregard of wind and sea once lost her propeller down south on her passage out to new zealand  it was the wintry murky time of cold gales and heavy seas  with the snapping of her tailshaft her life seemed suddenly to depart from her big body and from a stubborn arrogant existence she passed all at once into the passive state of a drifting log  a ship sick with her own weakness has not the pathos of a ship vanquished in a battle with the elements wherein consists the inner drama of her life  no seaman can look without compassion upon a disabled ship but to look at a sailingvessel with her lofty spars gone is to look upon a defeated but indomitable warrior  there is defiance in the remaining stumps of her masts raised up like maimed limbs against the menacing scowl of a stormy sky there is high courage in the upward sweep of her lines towards the bow and as soon as on a hastilyrigged spar a strip of canvas is shown to the wind to keep her head to sea she faces the waves again with an unsubdued courage    xix    the efficiency of a steamship consists not so much in her courage as in the power she carries within herself  it beats and throbs like a pulsating heart within her iron ribs and when it stops the steamer whose life is not so much a contest as the disdainful ignoring of the sea sickens and dies upon the waves  the sailing ship with her unthrobbing body seemed to lead mysteriously a sort of unearthly existence bordering upon the magic of the invisible forces sustained by the inspiration of lifegiving and death dealing winds  so that big steamer dying by a sudden stroke drifted an unwieldy corpse away from the track of other ships  and she would have been posted really as overdue or maybe as missing had she not been sighted in a snowstorm vaguely like a strange rolling island by a whaler going north from her polar cruising ground there was plenty of food on board and i dont know whether the nerves of her passengers were at all affected by anything else than the sense of interminable boredom or the vague fear of that unusual situation  does a passenger ever feel the life of the ship in which he is being carried like a sort of honoured bale of highly sensitive goods  for a man who has never been a passenger it is impossible to say  but i know that there is no harder trial for a seaman than to feel a dead ship under his feet  there is no mistaking that sensation so dismal so tormenting and so subtle so full of unhappiness and unrest  i could imagine no worse eternal punishment for evil seamen who die unrepentant upon the earthly sea than that their souls should be condemned to man the ghosts of disabled ships drifting for ever across a ghostly and tempestuous ocean  she must have looked ghostly enough that brokendown steamer rolling in that snowstorma dark apparition in a world of white snowflakes to the staring eyes of that whalers crew  evidently they didnt believe in ghosts for on arrival into port her captain unromantically reported having sighted a disabled steamer in latitude somewhere about 50 degrees s and a longitude still more uncertain  other steamers came out to look for her and ultimately towed her away from the cold edge of the world into a harbour with docks and workshops where with many blows of hammers her pulsating heart of steel was set going again to go forth presently in the renewed pride of its strength fed on fire and water breathing black smoke into the air pulsating throbbing shouldering its arrogant way against the great rollers in blind disdain of winds and sea  the track she had made when drifting while her heart stood still within her iron ribs looked like a tangled thread on the white paper of the chart  it was shown to me by a friend her second officer  in that surprising tangle there were words in minute lettersgales thick fog icewritten by him here and there as memoranda of the weather  she had interminably turned upon her tracks she had crossed and recrossed her haphazard path till it resembled nothing so much as a puzzling maze of pencilled lines without a meaning  but in that maze there lurked all the romance of the overdue and a menacing hint of missing  we had three weeks of it said my friend just think of that  how did you feel about it i asked  he waved his hand as much as to say  its all in the days work but then abruptly as if making up his mind  ill tell you  towards the last i used to shut myself up in my berth and cry  cry  shed tears he explained briefly and rolled up the chart  i can answer for it he was a good manas good as ever stepped upon a ships deckbut he could not bear the feeling of a dead ship under his feet  the sickly disheartening feeling which the men of some overdue ships that come into harbour at last under a juryrig must have felt combated and overcome in the faithful discharge of their duty    xx    it is difficult for a seaman to believe that his stranded ship does not feel as unhappy at the unnatural predicament of having no water under her keel as he is himself at feeling her stranded  stranding is indeed the reverse of sinking  the sea does not close upon the waterlogged hull with a sunny ripple or maybe with the angry rush of a curling wave erasing her name from the roll of living ships  no  it is as if an invisible hand had been stealthily uplifted from the bottom to catch hold of her keel as it glides through the water  more than any other event does stranding bring to the sailor a sense of utter and dismal failure  there are strandings and strandings but i am safe to say that 90 per cent of them are occasions in which a sailor without dishonour may well wish himself dead and i have no doubt that of those who had the experience of their ship taking the ground 90 per cent did actually for five seconds or so wish themselves dead  taking the ground is the professional expression for a ship that is stranded in gentle circumstances  but the feeling is more as if the ground had taken hold of her  it is for those on her deck a surprising sensation  it is as if your feet had been caught in an imponderable snare you feel the balance of your body threatened and the steady poise of your mind is destroyed at once  this sensation lasts only a second for even while you stagger something seems to turn over in your head bringing uppermost the mental exclamation full of astonishment and dismay by jove shes on the ground  and that is very terrible  after all the only mission of a seamans calling is to keep ships keels off the ground  thus the moment of her stranding takes away from him every excuse for his continued existence  to keep ships afloat is his business it is his trust it is the effective formula of the bottom of all these vague impulses dreams and illusions that go to the making up of a boys vocation  the grip of the land upon the keel of your ship even if nothing worse comes of it than the wear and tear of tackle and the loss of time remains in a seamans memory an indelibly fixed taste of disaster  stranded within the meaning of this paper stands for a more or less excusable mistake  a ship may be driven ashore by stress of weather  it is a catastrophe a defeat  to be run ashore has the littleness poignancy and bitterness of human error    xxi    that is why your strandings are for the most part so unexpected in fact they are all unexpected except those heralded by some short glimpse of the danger full of agitation and excitement like an awakening from a dream of incredible folly  the land suddenly at night looms up right over your bows or perhaps the cry of broken water ahead is raised and some long mistake some complicated edifice of selfdelusion over confidence and wrong reasoning is brought down in a fatal shock and the heartsearing experience of your ships keel scraping and scrunching over say a coral reef  it is a sound for its size far more terrific to your soul than that of a world coming violently to an end  but out of that chaos your belief in your own prudence and sagacity reasserts itself  you ask yourself where on earth did i get to  how on earth did i get there with a conviction that it could not be your own act that there has been at work some mysterious conspiracy of accident that the charts are all wrong and if the charts are not wrong that land and sea have changed their places that your misfortune shall for ever remain inexplicable since you have lived always with the sense of your trust the last thing on closing your eyes the first on opening them as if your mind had kept firm hold of your responsibility during the hours of sleep  you contemplate mentally your mischance till little by little your mood changes cold doubt steals into the very marrow of your bones you see the inexplicable fact in another light  that is the time when you ask yourself how on earth could i have been fool enough to get there  and you are ready to renounce all belief in your good sense in your knowledge in your fidelity in what you thought till then was the best in you giving you the daily bread of life and the moral support of other mens confidence  the ship is lost or not lost  once stranded you have to do your best by her  she may be saved by your efforts by your resource and fortitude bearing up against the heavy weight of guilt and failure  and there are justifiable strandings in fogs on uncharted seas on dangerous shores through treacherous tides but saved or not saved there remains with her commander a distinct sense of loss a flavour in the mouth of the real abiding danger that lurks in all the forms of human existence  it is an acquisition too that feeling  a man may be the better for it but he will not be the same  damocles has seen the sword suspended by a hair over his head and though a good man need not be made less valuable by such a knowledge the feast shall not henceforth have the same flavour  years ago i was concerned as chief mate in a case of stranding which was not fatal to the ship  we went to work for ten hours on end laying out anchors in readiness to heave off at high water while i was still busy about the decks forward i heard the steward at my elbow saying  the captain asks whether you mean to come in sir and have something to eat today  i went into the cuddy  my captain sat at the head of the table like a statue  there was a strange motionlessness of everything in that pretty little cabin  the swingtable which for seventy odd days had been always on the move if ever so little hung quite still above the souptureen  nothing could have altered the rich colour of my commanders complexion laid on generously by wind and sea but between the two tufts of fair hair above his ears his skull generally suffused with the hue of blood shone dead white like a dome of ivory  and he looked strangely untidy  i perceived he had not shaved himself that day and yet the wildest motion of the ship in the most stormy latitudes we had passed through never made him miss one single morning ever since we left the channel the fact must be that a commander cannot possibly shave himself when his ship is aground  i have commanded ships myself but i dont know i have never tried to shave in my life  he did not offer to help me or himself till i had coughed markedly several times  i talked to him professionally in a cheery tone and ended with the confident assertion  we shall get her off before midnight sir  he smiled faintly without looking up and muttered as if to himself  yes yes the captain put the ship ashore and we got her off  then raising his head he attacked grumpily the steward a lanky anxious youth with a long pale face and two big front teeth  what makes this soup so bitter  i am surprised the mate can swallow the beastly stuff  im sure the cooks ladled some salt water into it by mistake  the charge was so outrageous that the steward for all answer only dropped his eyelids bashfully  there was nothing the matter with the soup  i had a second helping  my heart was warm with hours of hard work at the head of a willing crew  i was elated with having handled heavy anchors cables boats without the slightest hitch pleased with having laid out scientifically bower stream and kedge exactly where i believed they would do most good  on that occasion the bitter taste of a stranding was not for my mouth  that experience came later and it was only then that i understood the loneliness of the man in charge  its the captain who puts the ship ashore its we who get her off    xxii    it seems to me that no man born and truthful to himself could declare that he ever saw the sea looking young as the earth looks young in spring  but some of us regarding the ocean with understanding and affection have seen it looking old as if the immemorial ages had been stirred up from the undisturbed bottom of ooze  for it is a gale of wind that makes the sea look old  from a distance of years looking at the remembered aspects of the storms lived through it is that impression which disengages itself clearly from the great body of impressions left by many years of intimate contact  if you would know the age of the earth look upon the sea in a storm  the grayness of the whole immense surface the wind furrows upon the faces of the waves the great masses of foam tossed about and waving like matted white locks give to the sea in a gale an appearance of hoary age lustreless dull without gleams as though it had been created before light itself  looking back after much love and much trouble the instinct of primitive man who seeks to personify the forces of nature for his affection and for his fear is awakened again in the breast of one civilized beyond that stage even in his infancy  one seems to have known gales as enemies and even as enemies one embraces them in that affectionate regret which clings to the past  gales have their personalities and after all perhaps it is not strange for when all is said and done they are adversaries whose wiles you must defeat whose violence you must resist and yet with whom you must live in the intimacies of nights and days  here speaks the man of masts and sails to whom the sea is not a navigable element but an intimate companion  the length of passages the growing sense of solitude the close dependence upon the very forces that friendly today without changing their nature by the mere putting forth of their might become dangerous tomorrow make for that sense of fellowship which modern seamen good men as they are cannot hope to know  and besides your modern ship which is a steamship makes her passages on other principles than yielding to the weather and humouring the sea  she receives smashing blows but she advances it is a slogging fight and not a scientific campaign  the machinery the steel the fire the steam have stepped in between the man and the sea  a modern fleet of ships does not so much make use of the sea as exploit a highway  the modern ship is not the sport of the waves  let us say that each of her voyages is a triumphant progress and yet it is a question whether it is not a more subtle and more human triumph to be the sport of the waves and yet survive achieving your end  in his own time a man is always very modern  whether the seamen of three hundred years hence will have the faculty of sympathy it is impossible to say  an incorrigible mankind hardens its heart in the progress of its own perfectability  how will they feel on seeing the illustrations to the sea novels of our day or of our yesterday  it is impossible to guess  but the seaman of the last generation brought into sympathy with the caravels of ancient time by his sailingship their lineal descendant cannot look upon those lumbering forms navigating the naive seas of ancient woodcuts without a feeling of surprise of affectionate derision envy and admiration  for those things whose unmanageableness even when represented on paper makes one gasp with a sort of amused horror were manned by men who are his direct professional ancestors  no the seamen of three hundred years hence will probably be neither touched nor moved to derision affection or admiration they will glance at the photogravures of our nearly defunct sailingships with a cold inquisitive and indifferent eye  our ships of yesterday will stand to their ships as no lineal ancestors but as mere predecessors whose course will have been run and the race extinct  whatever craft he handles with skill the seaman of the future shall be not our descendant but only our successor    xxiii    and so much depends upon the craft which made by man is one with man that the sea shall wear for him another aspect  i remember once seeing the commanderofficially the master by courtesy the captainof a fine iron ship of the old wool fleet shaking his head at a very pretty brigantine  she was bound the other way  she was a taut trim neat little craft extremely well kept and on that serene evening when we passed her close she looked the embodiment of coquettish comfort on the sea  it was somewhere near the cape the cape being of course the cape of good hope the cape of storms of its portuguese discoverer  and whether it is that the word storm should not be pronounced upon the sea where the storms dwell thickly or because men are shy of confessing their good hopes it has become the nameless capethe cape tout court  the other great cape of the world strangely enough is seldom if ever called a cape  we say a voyage round the horn we rounded the horn we got a frightful battering off the horn but rarely cape horn and indeed with some reason for cape horn is as much an island as a cape  the third stormy cape of the world which is the leeuwin receives generally its full name as if to console its secondrate dignity  these are the capes that look upon the gales  the little brigantine then had doubled the cape  perhaps she was coming from port elizabeth from east londonwho knows  it was many years ago but i remember well the captain of the woolclipper nodding at her with the words fancy having to go about the sea in a thing like that  he was a man brought up in big deepwater ships and the size of the craft under his feet was a part of his conception of the sea his own ship was certainly big as ships went then  he may have thought of the size of his cabin orunconsciously perhapshave conjured up a vision of a vessel so small tossing amongst the great seas  i didnt inquire and to a young second mate the captain of the little pretty brigantine sitting astride a camp stool with his chin resting on his hands that were crossed upon the rail might have appeared a minor king amongst men  we passed her within earshot without a hail reading each others names with the naked eye  some years later the second mate the recipient of that almost involuntary mutter could have told his captain that a man brought up in big ships may yet take a peculiar delight in what we should both then have called a small craft  probably the captain of the big ship would not have understood very well  his answer would have been a gruff give me size as i heard another man reply to a remark praising the handiness of a small vessel  it was not a love of the grandiose or the prestige attached to the command of great tonnage for he continued with an air of disgust and contempt why you get flung out of your bunk as likely as not in any sort of heavy weather  i dont know  i remember a few nights in my lifetime and in a big ship too as big as they made them then when one did not get flung out of ones bed simply because one never even attempted to get in one had been made too weary too hopeless to try  the expedient of turning your bedding out on to a damp floor and lying on it there was no earthly good since you could not keep your place or get a seconds rest in that or any other position  but of the delight of seeing a small craft run bravely amongst the great seas there can be no question to him whose soul does not dwell ashore  thus i well remember a three days run got out of a little barque of 400 tons somewhere between the islands of st paul and amsterdam and cape otway on the australian coast  it was a hard long gale gray clouds and green sea heavy weather undoubtedly but still what a sailor would call manageable  under two lower topsails and a reefed foresail the barque seemed to race with a long steady sea that did not becalm her in the troughs  the solemn thundering combers caught her up from astern passed her with a fierce boiling up of foam level with the bulwarks swept on ahead with a swish and a roar  and the little vessel dipping her jibboom into the tumbling froth would go on running in a smooth glassy hollow a deep valley between two ridges of the sea hiding the horizon ahead and astern  there was such fascination in her pluck nimbleness the continual exhibition of unfailing seaworthiness in the semblance of courage and endurance that i could not give up the delight of watching her run through the three unforgettable days of that gale which my mate also delighted to extol as a famous shove  and this is one of those gales whose memory in afteryears returns welcome in dignified austerity as you would remember with pleasure the noble features of a stranger with whom you crossed swords once in knightly encounter and are never to see again  in this way gales have their physiognomy  you remember them by your own feelings and no two gales stamp themselves in the same way upon your emotions  some cling to you in woebegone misery others come back fiercely and weirdly like ghouls bent upon sucking your strength away others again have a catastrophic splendour some are unvenerated recollections as of spiteful wildcats clawing at your agonized vitals others are severe like a visitation and one or two rise up draped and mysterious with an aspect of ominous menace  in each of them there is a characteristic point at which the whole feeling seems contained in one single moment  thus there is a certain four oclock in the morning in the confused roar of a black and white world when coming on deck to take charge of my watch i received the instantaneous impression that the ship could not live for another hour in such a raging sea  i wonder what became of the men who silently you couldnt hear yourself speak must have shared that conviction with me  to be left to write about it is not perhaps the most enviable fate but the point is that this impression resumes in its intensity the whole recollection of days and days of desperately dangerous weather  we were then for reasons which it is not worth while to specify in the close neighbourhood of kerguelen land and now when i open an atlas and look at the tiny dots on the map of the southern ocean i see as if engraved upon the paper the enraged physiognomy of that gale  another strangely recalls a silent man  and yet it was not din that was wanting in fact it was terrific  that one was a gale that came upon the ship swiftly like a parnpero which last is a very sudden wind indeed  before we knew very well what was coming all the sails we had set had burst the furled ones were blowing loose ropes flying sea hissingit hissed tremendouslywind howling and the ship lying on her side so that half of the crew were swimming and the other half clawing desperately at whatever came to hand according to the side of the deck each man had been caught on by the catastrophe either to leeward or to windward the shouting i need not mentionit was the merest drop in an ocean of noiseand yet the character of the gale seems contained in the recollection of one small not particularly impressive sallow man without a cap and with a very still face  captain joneslet us call him joneshad been caught unawares  two orders he had given at the first sign of an utterly unforeseen onset after that the magnitude of his mistake seemed to have overwhelmed him  we were doing what was needed and feasible  the ship behaved well  of course it was some time before we could pause in our fierce and laborious exertions but all through the work the excitement the uproar and some dismay we were aware of this silent little man at the break of the poop perfectly motionless soundless and often hidden from us by the drift of sprays  when we officers clambered at last upon the poop he seemed to come out of that numbed composure and shouted to us down wind  try the pumps  afterwards he disappeared  as to the ship i need not say that although she was presently swallowed up in one of the blackest nights i can remember she did not disappear  in truth i dont fancy that there had ever been much danger of that but certainly the experience was noisy and particularly distracting and yet it is the memory of a very quiet silence that survives    xxiv    for after all a gale of wind the thing of mighty sound is inarticulate  it is man who in a chance phrase interprets the elemental passion of his enemy  thus there is another gale in my memory a thing of endless deep humming roar moonlight and a spoken sentence  it was off that other cape which is always deprived of its title as the cape of good hope is robbed of its name  it was off the horn for a true expression of dishevelled wildness there is nothing like a gale in the bright moonlight of a high latitude  the ship broughtto and bowing to enormous flashing seas glistened wet from deck to trucks her one set sail stood out a coalblack shape upon the gloomy blueness of the air  i was a youngster then and suffering from weariness cold and imperfect oilskins which let water in at every seam  i craved human companionship and coming off the poop took my place by the side of the boatswain a man whom i did not like in a comparatively dry spot where at worst we had water only up to our knees  above our heads the explosive booming gusts of wind passed continuously justifying the sailors saying it blows great guns  and just from that need of human companionship being very close to the man i said or rather shouted  blows very hard boatswain  his answer was  ay and if it blows only a little harder things will begin to go i dont mind as long as everything holds but when things begin to go its bad  the note of dread in the shouting voice the practical truth of these words heard years ago from a man i did not like have stamped its peculiar character on that gale  a look in the eyes of a shipmate a low murmur in the most sheltered spot where the watch on duty are huddled together a meaning moan from one to the other with a glance at the windward sky a sigh of weariness a gesture of disgust passing into the keeping of the great wind become part and parcel of the gale  the olive hue of hurricane clouds presents an aspect peculiarly appalling  the inky ragged wrack flying before a norwest wind makes you dizzy with its headlong speed that depicts the rush of the invisible air  a hard souwester startles you with its close horizon and its low gray sky as if the world were a dungeon wherein there is no rest for body or soul  and there are black squalls white squalls thunder squalls and unexpected gusts that come without a single sign in the sky and of each kind no one of them resembles another  there is infinite variety in the gales of wind at sea and except for the peculiar terrible and mysterious moaning that may be heard sometimes passing through the roar of a hurricaneexcept for that unforgettable sound as if the soul of the universe had been goaded into a mournful groanit is after all the human voice that stamps the mark of human consciousness upon the character of a gale    xxv    there is no part of the world of coasts continents oceans seas straits capes and islands which is not under the sway of a reigning wind the sovereign of its typical weather  the wind rules the aspects of the sky and the action of the sea  but no wind rules unchallenged his realm of land and water  as with the kingdoms of the earth there are regions more turbulent than others  in the middle belt of the earth the trade winds reign supreme undisputed like monarchs of longsettled kingdoms whose traditional power checking all undue ambitions is not so much an exercise of personal might as the working of longestablished institutions  the intertropical kingdoms of the trade winds are favourable to the ordinary life of a merchantman  the trumpetcall of strife is seldom borne on their wings to the watchful ears of men on the decks of ships  the regions ruled by the northeast and southeast trade winds are serene  in a southerngoing ship bound out for a long voyage the passage through their dominions is characterized by a relaxation of strain and vigilance on the part of the seamen  those citizens of the ocean feel sheltered under the aegis of an uncontested law of an undisputed dynasty  there indeed if anywhere on earth the weather may be trusted  yet not too implicitly  even in the constitutional realm of trade winds north and south of the equator ships are overtaken by strange disturbances  still the easterly winds and generally speaking the easterly weather all the world over is characterized by regularity and persistence  as a ruler the east wind has a remarkable stability as an invader of the high latitudes lying under the tumultuous sway of his great brother the wind of the west he is extremely difficult to dislodge by the reason of his cold craftiness and profound duplicity  the narrow seas around these isles where british admirals keep watch and ward upon the marches of the atlantic ocean are subject to the turbulent sway of the west wind  call it northwest or southwest it is all onea different phase of the same character a changed expression on the same face  in the orientation of the winds that rule the seas the north and south directions are of no importance  there are no north and south winds of any account upon this earth  the north and south winds are but small princes in the dynasties that make peace and war upon the sea  they never assert themselves upon a vast stage  they depend upon local causesthe configuration of coasts the shapes of straits the accidents of bold promontories round which they play their little part  in the polity of winds as amongst the tribes of the earth the real struggle lies between east and west    xxvi    the west wind reigns over the seas surrounding the coasts of these kingdoms and from the gateways of the channels from promontories as if from watchtowers from estuaries of rivers as if from postern gates from passageways inlets straits firths the garrison of the isle and the crews of the ships going and returning look to the westward to judge by the varied splendours of his sunset mantle the mood of that arbitrary ruler  the end of the day is the time to gaze at the kingly face of the westerly weather who is the arbiter of ships destinies  benignant and splendid or splendid and sinister the western sky reflects the hidden purposes of the royal mind  clothed in a mantle of dazzling gold or draped in rags of black clouds like a beggar the might of the westerly wind sits enthroned upon the western horizon with the whole north atlantic as a footstool for his feet and the first twinkling stars making a diadem for his brow  then the seamen attentive courtiers of the weather think of regulating the conduct of their ships by the mood of the master  the west wind is too great a king to be a dissembler  he is no calculator plotting deep schemes in a sombre heart he is too strong for small artifices there is passion in all his moods even in the soft mood of his serene days in the grace of his blue sky whose immense and unfathomable tenderness reflected in the mirror of the sea embraces possesses lulls to sleep the ships with white sails  he is all things to all oceans he is like a poet seated upon a thronemagnificent simple barbarous pensive generous impulsive changeable unfathomable but when you understand him always the same  some of his sunsets are like pageants devised for the delight of the multitude when all the gems of the royal treasurehouse are displayed above the sea  others are like the opening of his royal confidence tinged with thoughts of sadness and compassion in a melancholy splendour meditating upon the shortlived peace of the waters  and i have seen him put the pentup anger of his heart into the aspect of the inaccessible sun and cause it to glare fiercely like the eye of an implacable autocrat out of a pale and frightened sky  he is the warlord who sends his battalions of atlantic rollers to the assault of our seaboard  the compelling voice of the west wind musters up to his service all the might of the ocean  at the bidding of the west wind there arises a great commotion in the sky above these islands and a great rush of waters falls upon our shores  the sky of the westerly weather is full of flying clouds of great big white clouds coming thicker and thicker till they seem to stand welded into a solid canopy upon whose gray face the lower wrack of the gale thin black and angrylooking flies past with vertiginous speed  denser and denser grows this dome of vapours descending lower and lower upon the sea narrowing the horizon around the ship  and the characteristic aspect of westerly weather the thick gray smoky and sinister tone sets in circumscribing the view of the men drenching their bodies oppressing their souls taking their breath away with booming gusts deafening blinding driving rushing them onwards in a swaying ship towards our coasts lost in mists and rain  the caprice of the winds like the wilfulness of men is fraught with the disastrous consequences of selfindulgence  long anger the sense of his uncontrolled power spoils the frank and generous nature of the west wind  it is as if his heart were corrupted by a malevolent and brooding rancour  he devastates his own kingdom in the wantonness of his force  southwest is the quarter of the heavens where he presents his darkened brow  he breathes his rage in terrific squalls and overwhelms his realm with an inexhaustible welter of clouds  he strews the seeds of anxiety upon the decks of scudding ships makes the foamstripped ocean look old and sprinkles with gray hairs the heads of shipmasters in the homewardbound ships running for the channel  the westerly wind asserting his sway from the southwest quarter is often like a monarch gone mad driving forth with wild imprecations the most faithful of his courtiers to shipwreck disaster and death  the southwesterly weather is the thick weather par excellence  it is not the thickness of the fog it is rather a contraction of the horizon a mysterious veiling of the shores with clouds that seem to make a lowvaulted dungeon around the running ship  it is not blindness it is a shortening of the sight  the west wind does not say to the seaman you shall be blind it restricts merely the range of his vision and raises the dread of land within his breast it makes of him a man robbed of half his force of half his efficiency  many times in my life standing in long seaboots and streaming oilskins at the elbow of my commander on the poop of a homewardbound ship making for the channel and gazing ahead into the gray and tormented waste i have heard a weary sigh shape itself into a studiously casual comment  cant see very far in this weather  and have made answer in the same low perfunctory tone  no sir  it would be merely the instinctive voicing of an everpresent thought associated closely with the consciousness of the land somewhere ahead and of the great speed of the ship  fair wind fair wind  who would dare to grumble at a fair wind  it was a favour of the western king who rules masterfully the north atlantic from the latitude of the azores to the latitude of cape farewell  a famous shove this to end a good passage with and yet somehow one could not muster upon ones lips the smile of a courtiers gratitude  this favour was dispensed to you from under an overbearing scowl which is the true expression of the great autocrat when he has made up his mind to give a battering to some ships and to hunt certain others home in one breath of cruelty and benevolence equally distracting  no sir  cant see very far  thus would the mates voice repeat the thought of the master both gazing ahead while under their feet the ship rushes at some twelve knots in the direction of the lee shore and only a couple of miles in front of her swinging and dripping jibboom carried naked with an upward slant like a spear a gray horizon closes the view with a multitude of waves surging upwards violently as if to strike at the stooping clouds  awful and threatening scowls darken the face of the west wind in his clouded southwest mood and from the kings thronehall in the western board stronger gusts reach you like the fierce shouts of raving fury to which only the gloomy grandeur of the scene imparts a saving dignity  a shower pelts the deck and the sails of the ship as if flung with a scream by an angry hand and when the night closes in the night of a southwesterly gale it seems more hopeless than the shade of hades  the southwesterly mood of the great west wind is a lightless mood without sun moon or stars with no gleam of light but the phosphorescent flashes of the great sheets of foam that boiling up on each side of the ship fling bluish gleams upon her dark and narrow hull rolling as she runs chased by enormous seas distracted in the tumult  there are some bad nights in the kingdom of the west wind for homewardbound ships making for the channel and the days of wrath dawn upon them colourless and vague like the timid turning up of invisible lights upon the scene of a tyrannical and passionate outbreak awful in the monotony of its method and the increasing strength of its violence  it is the same wind the same clouds the same wildly racing seas the same thick horizon around the ship  only the wind is stronger the clouds seem denser and more overwhelming the waves appear to have grown bigger and more threatening during the night  the hours whose minutes are marked by the crash of the breaking seas slip by with the screaming pelting squalls overtaking the ship as she runs on and on with darkened canvas with streaming spars and dripping ropes  the downpours thicken  preceding each shower a mysterious gloom like the passage of a shadow above the firmament of gray clouds filters down upon the ship  now and then the rain pours upon your head in streams as if from spouts  it seems as if your ship were going to be drowned before she sank as if all atmosphere had turned to water  you gasp you splutter you are blinded and deafened you are submerged obliterated dissolved annihilated streaming all over as if your limbs too had turned to water  and every nerve on the alert you watch for the clearingup mood of the western king that shall come with a shift of wind as likely as not to whip all the three masts out of your ship in the twinkling of an eye    xxvii    heralded by the increasing fierceness of the squalls sometimes by a faint flash of lightning like the signal of a lighted torch waved far away behind the clouds the shift of wind comes at last the crucial moment of the change from the brooding and veiled violence of the southwest gale to the sparkling flashing cutting clear eyed anger of the kings northwesterly mood  you behold another phase of his passion a fury bejewelled with stars mayhap bearing the crescent of the moon on its brow shaking the last vestiges of its torn cloudmantle in inkyblack squalls with hail and sleet descending like showers of crystals and pearls bounding off the spars drumming on the sails pattering on the oilskin coats whitening the decks of homewardbound ships  faint ruddy flashes of lightning flicker in the starlight upon her mastheads  a chilly blast hums in the taut rigging causing the ship to tremble to her very keel and the soaked men on her decks to shiver in their wet clothes to the very marrow of their bones  before one squall has flown over to sink in the eastern board the edge of another peeps up already above the western horizon racing up swift shapeless like a black bag full of frozen water ready to burst over your devoted head  the temper of the ruler of the ocean has changed each gust of the clouded mood that seemed warmed by the heat of a heart flaming with anger has its counterpart in the chilly blasts that seem blown from a breast turned to ice with a sudden revulsion of feeling  instead of blinding your eyes and crushing your soul with a terrible apparatus of cloud and mists and seas and rain the king of the west turns his power to contemptuous pelting of your back with icicles to making your weary eyes water as if in grief and your wornout carcass quake pitifully  but each mood of the great autocrat has its own greatness and each is hard to bear only the northwest phase of that mighty display is not demoralizing to the same extent because between the hail and sleet squalls of a northwesterly gale one can see a long way ahead  to see to seethis is the craving of the sailor as of the rest of blind humanity  to have his path made clear for him is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and tempestuous existence  i have heard a reserved silent man with no nerves to speak of after three days of hard running in thick southwesterly weather burst out passionately  i wish to god we could get sight of something  we had just gone down below for a moment to commune in a battened down cabin with a large white chart lying limp and damp upon a cold and clammy table under the light of a smoky lamp  sprawling over that seamans silent and trusted adviser with one elbow upon the coast of africa and the other planted in the neighbourhood of cape hatteras it was a general trackchart of the north atlantic my skipper lifted his rugged hairy face and glared at me in a halfexasperated halfappealing way  we have seen no sun moon or stars for something like seven days  by the effect of the west winds wrath the celestial bodies had gone into hiding for a week or more and the last three days had seen the force of a southwest gale grow from fresh through strong to heavy as the entries in my logbook could testify  then we separated he to go on deck again in obedience to that mysterious call that seems to sound for ever in a shipmasters ears i to stagger into my cabin with some vague notion of putting down the words very heavy weather in a logbook not quite written uptodate  but i gave it up and crawled into my bunk instead boots and hat on all standing it did not matter everything was soaking wet a heavy sea having burst the poop skylights the night before to remain in a nightmarish state between waking and sleeping for a couple of hours of socalled rest  the southwesterly mood of the west wind is an enemy of sleep and even of a recumbent position in the responsible officers of a ship  after two hours of futile lightheaded inconsequent thinking upon all things under heaven in that dark dank wet and devastated cabin i arose suddenly and staggered up on deck  the autocrat of the north atlantic was still oppressing his kingdom and its outlying dependencies even as far as the bay of biscay in the dismal secrecy of thick very thick weather  the force of the wind though we were running before it at the rate of some ten knots an hour was so great that it drove me with a steady push to the front of the poop where my commander was holding on  what do you think of it he addressed me in an interrogative yell  what i really thought was that we both had had just about enough of it  the manner in which the great west wind chooses at times to administer his possessions does not commend itself to a person of peaceful and lawabiding disposition inclined to draw distinctions between right and wrong in the face of natural forces whose standard naturally is that of might alone  but of course i said nothing  for a man caught as it were between his skipper and the great west wind silence is the safest sort of diplomacy moreover i knew my skipper  he did not want to know what i thought  shipmasters hanging on a breath before the thrones of the winds ruling the seas have their psychology whose workings are as important to the ship and those on board of her as the changing moods of the weather  the man as a matter of fact under no circumstances ever cared a brass farthing for what i or anybody else in his ship thought  he had had just about enough of it i guessed and what he was at really was a process of fishing for a suggestion  it was the pride of his life that he had never wasted a chance no matter how boisterous threatening and dangerous of a fair wind  like men racing blindfold for a gap in a hedge we were finishing a splendidly quick passage from the antipodes with a tremendous rush for the channel in as thick a weather as any i can remember but his psychology did not permit him to bring the ship to with a fair wind blowingat least not on his own initiative  and yet he felt that very soon indeed something would have to be done  he wanted the suggestion to come from me so that later on when the trouble was over he could argue this point with his own uncompromising spirit laying the blame upon my shoulders i must render him the justice that this sort of pride was his only weakness  but he got no suggestion from me  i understood his psychology besides i had my own stock of weaknesses at the time it is a different one now and amongst them was the conceit of being remarkably well up in the psychology of the westerly weather  i believednot to mince mattersthat i had a genius for reading the mind of the great ruler of high latitudes  i fancied i could discern already the coming of a change in his royal mood  and all i said was  the weathers bound to clear up with the shift of wind  anybody knows that much he snapped at me at the highest pitch of his voice  i mean before dark i cried  this was all the opening he ever got from me  the eagerness with which he seized upon it gave me the measure of the anxiety he had been labouring under  very well he shouted with an affectation of impatience as if giving way to long entreaties  all right  if we dont get a shift by then well take that foresail off her and put her head under her wing for the night  i was struck by the picturesque character of the phrase as applied to a ship broughtto in order to ride out a gale with wave after wave passing under her breast  i could see her resting in the tumult of the elements like a seabird sleeping in wild weather upon the raging waters with its head tucked under its wing  in imaginative precision in true feeling this is one of the most expressive sentences i have ever heard on human lips  but as to taking the foresail off that ship before we put her head under her wing i had my grave doubts  they were justified  that long enduring piece of canvas was confiscated by the arbitrary decree of the west wind to whom belong the lives of men and the contrivances of their hands within the limits of his kingdom  with the sound of a faint explosion it vanished into the thick weather bodily leaving behind of its stout substance not so much as one solitary strip big enough to be picked into a handful of lint for say a wounded elephant  torn out of its boltropes it faded like a whiff of smoke in the smoky drift of clouds shattered and torn by the shift of wind  for the shift of wind had come  the unveiled low sun glared angrily from a chaotic sky upon a confused and tremendous sea dashing itself upon a coast  we recognised the headland and looked at each other in the silence of dumb wonder without knowing it in the least we had run up alongside the isle of wight and that tower tinged a faint evening red in the salt windhaze was the lighthouse on st catherines point  my skipper recovered first from his astonishment  his bulging eyes sank back gradually into their orbits  his psychology taking it all round was really very creditable for an average sailor  he had been spared the humiliation of laying his ship to with a fair wind and at once that man of an open and truthful nature spoke up in perfect good faith rubbing together his brown hairy hands the hands of a mastercraftsman upon the sea  humph thats just about where i reckoned we had got to  the transparency and ingenuousness in a way of that delusion the airy tone the hint of already growing pride were perfectly delicious  but in truth this was one of the greatest surprises ever sprung by the clearing up mood of the west wind upon one of the most accomplished of his courtiers    xxviii    the winds of north and south are as i have said but small princes amongst the powers of the sea  they have no territory of their own they are not reigning winds anywhere  yet it is from their houses that the reigning dynasties which have shared between them the waters of the earth are sprung  all the weather of the world is based upon the contest of the polar and equatorial strains of that tyrannous race  the west wind is the greatest king  the east rules between the tropics  they have shared each ocean between them  each has his genius of supreme rule  the king of the west never intrudes upon the recognised dominion of his kingly brother he is a barbarian of a northern type  violent without craftiness and furious without malice one may imagine him seated masterfully with a doubleedged sword on his knees upon the painted and gilt clouds of the sunset bowing his shock head of golden locks a flaming beard over his breast imposing colossal mightylimbed with a thundering voice distended cheeks and fierce blue eyes urging the speed of his gales  the other the east king the king of bloodred sunrises i represent to myself as a spare southerner with clearcut features blackbrowed and darkeyed grayrobed upright in sunshine resting a smoothshaven cheek in the palm of his hand impenetrable secret full of wiles finedrawn keen meditating aggressions  the west wind keeps faith with his brother the king of the easterly weather  what we have divided we have divided he seems to say in his gruff voice this ruler without guile who hurls as if in sport enormous masses of cloud across the sky and flings the great waves of the atlantic clear across from the shores of the new world upon the hoary headlands of old europe which harbours more kings and rulers upon its seamed and furrowed body than all the oceans of the world together  what we have divided we have divided and if no rest and peace in this world have fallen to my share leave me alone  let me play at quoits with cyclonic gales flinging the discs of spinning cloud and whirling air from one end of my dismal kingdom to the other  over the great banks or along the edges of packicethis one with true aim right into the bight of the bay of biscay that other upon the fiords of norway across the north sea where the fishermen of many nations look watchfully into my angry eye  this is the time of kingly sport  and the royal master of high latitudes sighs mightily with the sinking sun upon his breast and the doubleedged sword upon his knees as if wearied by the innumerable centuries of a strenuous rule and saddened by the unchangeable aspect of the ocean under his feetby the endless vista of future ages where the work of sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind shall go on and on till his realm of living waters becomes a frozen and motionless ocean  but the other crafty and unmoved nursing his shaven chin between the thumb and forefinger of his slim and treacherous hand thinks deep within his heart full of guile  aha our brother of the west has fallen into the mood of kingly melancholy  he is tired of playing with circular gales and blowing great guns and unrolling thick streamers of fog in wanton sport at the cost of his own poor miserable subjects  their fate is most pitiful  let us make a foray upon the dominions of that noisy barbarian a great raid from finisterre to hatteras catching his fishermen unawares baffling the fleets that trust to his power and shooting sly arrows into the livers of men who court his good graces  he is indeed a worthless fellow  and forthwith while the west wind meditates upon the vanity of his irresistible might the thing is done and the easterly weather sets in upon the north atlantic  the prevailing weather of the north atlantic is typical of the way in which the west wind rules his realm on which the sun never sets north atlantic is the heart of a great empire  it is the part of the west winds dominions most thickly populated with generations of fine ships and hardy men  heroic deeds and adventurous exploits have been performed there within the very stronghold of his sway the best sailors in the world have been born and bred under the shadow of his sceptre learning to manage their ships with skill and audacity before the steps of his stormy throne  reckless adventurers toiling fishermen admirals as wise and brave as the world has ever known have waited upon the signs of his westerly sky  fleets of victorious ships have hung upon his breath  he has tossed in his hand squadrons of warscarred threedeckers and shredded out in mere sport the bunting of flags hallowed in the traditions of honour and glory  he is a good friend and a dangerous enemy without mercy to unseaworthy ships and faint hearted seamen  in his kingly way he has taken but little account of lives sacrificed to his impulsive policy he is a king with a doubleedged sword bared in his right hand  the east wind an interloper in the dominions of westerly weather is an impassive faced tyrant with a sharp poniard held behind his back for a treacherous stab  in his forays into the north atlantic the east wind behaves like a subtle and cruel adventurer without a notion of honour or fair play  veiling his clearcut lean face in a thin layer of a hard high cloud i have seen him like a wizened robber sheik of the sea hold up large caravans of ships to the number of three hundred or more at the very gates of the english channel  and the worst of it was that there was no ransom that we could pay to satisfy his avidity for whatever evil is wrought by the raiding east wind it is done only to spite his kingly brother of the west  we gazed helplessly at the systematic cold grayeyed obstinacy of the easterly weather while short rations became the order of the day and the pinch of hunger under the breastbone grew familiar to every sailor in that heldup fleet  every day added to our numbers  in knots and groups and straggling parties we flung to and fro before the closed gate  and meantime the outwardbound ships passed running through our humiliated ranks under all the canvas they could show  it is my idea that the easterly wind helps the ships away from home in the wicked hope that they shall all come to an untimely end and be heard of no more  for six weeks did the robber sheik hold the trade route of the earth while our liege lord the west wind slept profoundly like a tired titan or else remained lost in a mood of idle sadness known only to frank natures  all was still to the westward we looked in vain towards his stronghold  the king slumbered on so deeply that he let his foraging brother steal the very mantle of goldlined purple clouds from his bowed shoulders  what had become of the dazzling hoard of royal jewels exhibited at every close of day  gone disappeared extinguished carried off without leaving a single gold band or the flash of a single sunbeam in the evening sky  day after day through a cold streak of heavens as bare and poor as the inside of a rifled safe a rayless and despoiled sun would slink shamefacedly without pomp or show to hide in haste under the waters  and still the king slept on or mourned the vanity of his might and his power while the thinlipped intruder put the impress of his cold and implacable spirit upon the sky and sea  with every daybreak the rising sun had to wade through a crimson stream luminous and sinister like the spilt blood of celestial bodies murdered during the night  in this particular instance the mean interloper held the road for some six weeks on end establishing his particular administrative methods over the best part of the north atlantic  it looked as if the easterly weather had come to stay for ever or at least till we had all starved to death in the heldup fleetstarved within sight as it were of plenty within touch almost of the bountiful heart of the empire  there we were dotting with our white dry sails the hard blueness of the deep sea  there we were a growing company of ships each with her burden of grain of timber of wool of hides and even of oranges for we had one or two belated fruit schooners in company  there we were in that memorable spring of a certain year in the late seventies dodging to and fro baffled on every tack and with our stores running down to sweepings of breadlockers and scrapings of sugarcasks  it was just like the east winds nature to inflict starvation upon the bodies of unoffending sailors while he corrupted their simple souls by an exasperation leading to outbursts of profanity as lurid as his bloodred sunrises  they were followed by gray days under the cover of high motionless clouds that looked as if carved in a slab of ashcoloured marble  and each mean starved sunset left us calling with imprecations upon the west wind even in its most veiled misty mood to wake up and give us our liberty if only to rush on and dash the heads of our ships against the very walls of our unapproachable home    xxix    in the atmosphere of the easterly weather as pellucid as a piece of crystal and refracting like a prism we could see the appalling numbers of our helpless company even to those who in more normal conditions would have remained invisible sails down under the horizon  it is the malicious pleasure of the east wind to augment the power of your eyesight in order perhaps that you should see better the perfect humiliation the hopeless character of your captivity  easterly weather is generally clear and that is all that can be said for italmost supernaturally clear when it likes but whatever its mood there is something uncanny in its nature its duplicity is such that it will deceive a scientific instrument no barometer will give warning of an easterly gale were it ever so wet  it would be an unjust and ungrateful thing to say that a barometer is a stupid contrivance  it is simply that the wiles of the east wind are too much for its fundamental honesty  after years and years of experience the most trusty instrument of the sort that ever went to sea screwed on to a ships cabin bulkhead will almost invariably be induced to rise by the diabolic ingenuity of the easterly weather just at the moment when the easterly weather discarding its methods of hard dry impassive cruelty contemplates drowning what is left of your spirit in torrents of a peculiarly cold and horrid rain  the sleetandhail squalls following the lightning at the end of a westerly gale are cold and benumbing and stinging and cruel enough  but the dry easterly weather when it turns to wet seems to rain poisoned showers upon your head  it is a sort of steady persistent overwhelming endlessly driving downpour which makes your heart sick and opens it to dismal forebodings  and the stormy mood of the easterly weather looms black upon the sky with a peculiar and amazing blackness  the west wind hangs heavy gray curtains of mist and spray before your gaze but the eastern interloper of the narrow seas when he has mustered his courage and cruelty to the point of a gale puts your eyes out puts them out completely makes you feel blind for life upon a leeshore  it is the wind also that brings snow  out of his black and merciless heart he flings a white blinding sheet upon the ships of the sea  he has more manners of villainy and no more conscience than an italian prince of the seventeenth century  his weapon is a dagger carried under a black cloak when he goes out on his unlawful enterprises  the mere hint of his approach fills with dread every craft that swims the sea from fishingsmacks to fourmasted ships that recognise the sway of the west wind  even in his most accommodating mood he inspires a dread of treachery  i have heard upwards of ten score of windlasses spring like one into clanking life in the dead of night filling the downs with a panicstruck sound of anchors being torn hurriedly out of the ground at the first breath of his approach fortunately his heart often fails him  he does not always blow home upon our exposed coast he has not the fearless temper of his westerly brother  the natures of those two winds that share the dominions of the great oceans are fundamentally different  it is strange that the winds which men are prone to style capricious remain true to their character in all the various regions of the earth  to us here for instance the east wind comes across a great continent sweeping over the greatest body of solid land upon this earth  for the australian east coast the east wind is the wind of the ocean coming across the greatest body of water upon the globe and yet here and there its characteristics remain the same with a strange consistency in everything that is vile and base  the members of the west winds dynasty are modified in a way by the regions they rule as a hohenzollern without ceasing to be himself becomes a roumanian by virtue of his throne or a saxecoburg learns to put the dress of bulgarian phrases upon his particular thoughts whatever they are  the autocratic sway of the west wind whether forty north or forty south of the equator is characterized by an open generous frank barbarous recklessness  for he is a great autocrat and to be a great autocrat you must be a great barbarian  i have been too much moulded to his sway to nurse now any idea of rebellion in my heart moreover what is a rebellion within the four walls of a room against the tempestuous rule of the west wind  i remain faithful to the memory of the mighty king with a doubleedged sword in one hand and in the other holding out rewards of great daily runs and famously quick passages to those of his courtiers who knew how to wait watchfully for every sign of his secret mood  as we deep water men always reckoned he made one year in three fairly lively for anybody having business upon the atlantic or down there along the forties of the southern ocean  you had to take the bitter with the sweet and it cannot be denied he played carelessly with our lives and fortunes  but then he was always a great king fit to rule over the great waters where strictly speaking a man would have no business whatever but for his audacity  the audacious should not complain  a mere trader ought not to grumble at the tolls levied by a mighty king  his mightiness was sometimes very overwhelming but even when you had to defy him openly as on the banks of the agulhas homeward bound from the east indies or on the outward passage round the horn he struck at you fairly his stinging blows full in the face too and it was your business not to get too much staggered  and after all if you showed anything of a countenance the goodnatured barbarian would let you fight your way past the very steps of his throne  it was only now and then that the sword descended and a head fell but if you fell you were sure of impressive obsequies and of a roomy generous grave  such is the king to whom viking chieftains bowed their heads and whom the modern and palatial steamship defies with impunity seven times a week  and yet it is but defiance not victory  the magnificent barbarian sits enthroned in a mantle of goldlined clouds looking from on high on great ships gliding like mechanical toys upon his sea and on men who armed with fire and iron no longer need to watch anxiously for the slightest sign of his royal mood  he is disregarded but he has kept all his strength all his splendour and a great part of his power  time itself that shakes all the thrones is on the side of that king  the sword in his hand remains as sharp as ever upon both its edges and he may well go on playing his royal game of quoits with hurricanes tossing them over from the continent of republics to the continent of kingdoms in the assurance that both the new republics and the old kingdoms the heat of fire and the strength of iron with the untold generations of audacious men shall crumble to dust at the steps of his throne and pass away and be forgotten before his own rule comes to an end    xxx    the estuaries of rivers appeal strongly to an adventurous imagination  this appeal is not always a charm for there are estuaries of a particularly dispiriting ugliness  lowlands mud flats or perhaps barren sandhills without beauty of form or amenity of aspect covered with a shabby and scanty vegetation conveying the impression of poverty and uselessness  sometimes such an ugliness is merely a repulsive mask  a river whose estuary resembles a breach in a sand rampart may flow through a most fertile country  but all the estuaries of great rivers have their fascination the attractiveness of an open portal  water is friendly to man  the ocean a part of nature furthest removed in the unchangeableness and majesty of its might from the spirit of mankind has ever been a friend to the enterprising nations of the earth  and of all the elements this is the one to which men have always been prone to trust themselves as if its immensity held a reward as vast as itself  from the offing the open estuary promises every possible fruition to adventurous hopes  that road open to enterprise and courage invites the explorer of coasts to new efforts towards the fulfilment of great expectations  the commander of the first roman galley must have looked with an intense absorption upon the estuary of the thames as he turned the beaked prow of his ship to the westward under the brow of the north foreland  the estuary of the thames is not beautiful it has no noble features no romantic grandeur of aspect no smiling geniality but it is wide open spacious inviting hospitable at the first glance with a strange air of mysteriousness which lingers about it to this very day  the navigation of his craft must have engrossed all the romans attention in the calm of a summers day he would choose his weather when the single row of long sweeps the galley would be a light one not a trireme could fall in easy cadence upon a sheet of water like plateglass reflecting faithfully the classic form of his vessel and the contour of the lonely shores close on his left hand  i assume he followed the land and passed through what is at present known as margate roads groping his careful way along the hidden sandbanks whose every tail and spit has its beacon or buoy nowadays  he must have been anxious though no doubt he had collected beforehand on the shores of the gauls a store of information from the talk of traders adventurers fishermen slavedealers piratesall sorts of unofficial men connected with the sea in a more or less reputable way  he would have heard of channels and sandbanks of natural features of the land useful for seamarks of villages and tribes and modes of barter and precautions to take  with the instructive tales about native chiefs dyed more or less blue whose character for greediness ferocity or amiability must have been expounded to him with that capacity for vivid language which seems joined naturally to the shadiness of moral character and recklessness of disposition  with that sort of spiced food provided for his anxious thought watchful for strange men strange beasts strange turns of the tide he would make the best of his way up a military seaman with a short sword on thigh and a bronze helmet on his head the pioneer post captain of an imperial fleet  was the tribe inhabiting the isle of thanet of a ferocious disposition i wonder and ready to fall with stonestudded clubs and wooden lances hardened in the fire upon the backs of unwary mariners  amongst the great commercial streams of these islands the thames is the only one i think open to romantic feeling from the fact that the sight of human labour and the sounds of human industry do not come down its shores to the very sea destroying the suggestion of mysterious vastness caused by the configuration of the shore the broad inlet of the shallow north sea passes gradually into the contracted shape of the river but for a long time the feeling of the open water remains with the ship steering to the westward through one of the lighted and buoyed passageways of the thames such as queens channel princes channel fourfathom channel or else coming down the swin from the north  the rush of the yellow floodtide hurries her up as if into the unknown between the two fading lines of the coast  there are no features to this land no conspicuous farfamed landmarks for the eye there is nothing so far down to tell you of the greatest agglomeration of mankind on earth dwelling no more than five and twenty miles away where the sun sets in a blaze of colour flaming on a gold background and the dark low shores trend towards each other  and in the great silence the deep faint booming of the big guns being tested at shoeburyness hangs about the norea historical spot in the keeping of one of englands appointed guardians    xxxi    the nore sand remains covered at lowwater and never seen by human eye but the nore is a name to conjure with visions of historical events of battles of fleets of mutinies of watch and ward kept upon the great throbbing heart of the state  this ideal point of the estuary this centre of memories is marked upon the steely gray expanse of the waters by a lightship painted red that from a couple of miles off looks like a cheap and bizarre little toy  i remember how on coming up the river for the first time i was surprised at the smallness of that vivid objecta tiny warm speck of crimson lost in an immensity of gray tones  i was startled as if of necessity the principal beacon in the waterway of the greatest town on earth should have presented imposing proportions and behold the brown spritsail of a barge hid it entirely from my view  coming in from the eastward the bright colouring of the lightship marking the part of the river committed to the charge of an admiral the commanderinchief at the nore accentuates the dreariness and the great breadth of the thames estuary  but soon the course of the ship opens the entrance of the medway with its menofwar moored in line and the long wooden jetty of port victoria with its few low buildings like the beginning of a hasty settlement upon a wild and unexplored shore  the famous thames barges sit in brown clusters upon the water with an effect of birds floating upon a pond  on the imposing expanse of the great estuary the traffic of the port where so much of the worlds work and the worlds thinking is being done becomes insignificant scattered streaming away in thin lines of ships stringing themselves out into the eastern quarter through the various navigable channels of which the nore lightship marks the divergence  the coasting traffic inclines to the north the deepwater ships steer east with a southern inclination on through the downs to the most remote ends of the world  in the widening of the shores sinking low in the gray smoky distances the greatness of the sea receives the mercantile fleet of good ships that london sends out upon the turn of every tide  they follow each other going very close by the essex shore such as the beads of a rosary told by businesslike shipowners for the greater profit of the world they slip one by one into the open while in the offing the inwardbound ships come up singly and in bunches from under the sea horizon closing the mouth of the river between orfordness and north foreland  they all converge upon the nore the warm speck of red upon the tones of drab and gray with the distant shores running together towards the west low and flat like the sides of an enormous canal  the seareach of the thames is straight and once sheerness is left behind its banks seem very uninhabited except for the cluster of houses which is southend or here and there a lonely wooden jetty where petroleum ships discharge their dangerous cargoes and the oilstorage tanks low and round with slightlydomed roofs peep over the edge of the foreshore as it were a village of central african huts imitated in iron  bordered by the black and shining mudflats the level marsh extends for miles  away in the far background the land rises closing the view with a continuous wooded slope forming in the distance an interminable rampart overgrown with bushes  then on the slight turn of the lower hope reach clusters of factory chimneys come distinctly into view tall and slender above the squat ranges of cement works in grays and greenhithe  smoking quietly at the top against the great blaze of a magnificent sunset they give an industrial character to the scene speak of work manufactures and trade as palmgroves on the coral strands of distant islands speak of the luxuriant grace beauty and vigour of tropical nature  the houses of gravesend crowd upon the shore with an effect of confusion as if they had tumbled down haphazard from the top of the hill at the back  the flatness of the kentish shore ends there  a fleet of steamtugs lies at anchor in front of the various piers  a conspicuous church spire the first seen distinctly coming from the sea has a thoughtful grace the serenity of a fine form above the chaotic disorder of mens houses but on the other side on the flat essex side a shapeless and desolate red edifice a vast pile of bricks with many windows and a slate roof more inaccessible than an alpine slope towers over the bend in monstrous ugliness the tallest heaviest building for miles around a thing like an hotel like a mansion of flats all to let exiled into these fields out of a street in west kensington  just round the corner as it were on a pier defined with stone blocks and wooden piles a white mast slender like a stalk of straw and crossed by a yard like a knittingneedle flying the signals of flag and balloon watches over a set of heavy dock gates  mastheads and funneltops of ships peep above the ranges of corrugated iron roofs  this is the entrance to tilbury dock the most recent of all london docks the nearest to the sea  between the crowded houses of gravesend and the monstrous redbrick pile on the essex shore the ship is surrendered fairly to the grasp of the river  that hint of loneliness that soul of the sea which had accompanied her as far as the lower hope reach abandons her at the turn of the first bend above  the salt acrid flavour is gone out of the air together with a sense of unlimited space opening free beyond the threshold of sandbanks below the nore  the waters of the sea rush on past gravesend tumbling the big mooring buoys laid along the face of the town but the seafreedom stops short there surrendering the salt tide to the needs the artifices the contrivances of toiling men  wharves landingplaces dockgates waterside stairs follow each other continuously right up to london bridge and the hum of mens work fills the river with a menacing muttering note as of a breathless everdriving gale  the water way so fair above and wide below flows oppressed by bricks and mortar and stone by blackened timber and grimed glass and rusty iron covered with black barges whipped up by paddles and screws overburdened with craft overhung with chains overshadowed by walls making a steep gorge for its bed filled with a haze of smoke and dust  this stretch of the thames from london bridge to the albert docks is to other watersides of river ports what a virgin forest would be to a garden  it is a thing grown up not made  it recalls a jungle by the confused varied and impenetrable aspect of the buildings that line the shore not according to a planned purpose but as if sprung up by accident from scattered seeds  like the matted growth of bushes and creepers veiling the silent depths of an unexplored wilderness they hide the depths of londons infinitely varied vigorous seething life  in other river ports it is not so  they lie open to their stream with quays like broad clearings with streets like avenues cut through thick timber for the convenience of trade  i am thinking now of river ports i have seenof antwerp for instance of nantes or bordeaux or even old rouen where the nightwatchmen of ships elbows on rail gaze at shopwindows and brilliant cafes and see the audience go in and come out of the operahouse  but london the oldest and greatest of river ports does not possess as much as a hundred yards of open quays upon its river front  dark and impenetrable at night like the face of a forest is the london waterside  it is the waterside of watersides where only one aspect of the worlds life can be seen and only one kind of men toils on the edge of the stream the lightless walls seem to spring from the very mud upon which the stranded barges lie and the narrow lanes coming down to the foreshore resemble the paths of smashed bushes and crumbled earth where big game comes to drink on the banks of tropical streams  behind the growth of the london waterside the docks of london spread out unsuspected smooth and placid lost amongst the buildings like dark lagoons hidden in a thick forest  they lie concealed in the intricate growth of houses with a few stalks of mastheads here and there overtopping the roof of some fourstory warehouse  it is a strange conjunction this of roofs and mastheads of walls and yardarms  i remember once having the incongruity of the relation brought home to me in a practical way  i was the chief officer of a fine ship just docked with a cargo of wool from sydney after a ninety days passage  in fact we had not been in more than half an hour and i was still busy making her fast to the stone posts of a very narrow quay in front of a lofty warehouse an old man with a gray whisker under the chin and brass buttons on his pilotcloth jacket hurried up along the quay hailing my ship by name  he was one of those officials called berthingmasters not the one who had berthed us but another who apparently had been busy securing a steamer at the other end of the dock  i could see from afar his hard blue eyes staring at us as if fascinated with a queer sort of absorption  i wondered what that worthy sea dog had found to criticise in my ships rigging  and i too glanced aloft anxiously  i could see nothing wrong there  but perhaps that superannuated fellowcraftsman was simply admiring the ships perfect order aloft i thought with some secret pride for the chief officer is responsible for his ships appearance and as to her outward condition he is the man open to praise or blame meantime the old salt excoasting skipper was writ large all over his person had hobbled up alongside in his bumpy shiny boots and waving an arm short and thick like the flipper of a seal terminated by a paw red as an uncooked beefsteak addressed the poop in a muffled faint roaring voice as if a sample of every northsea fog of his life had been permanently lodged in his throat  haul em round mr mate were his words  if you dont look sharp youll have your topgallant yards through the windows of that ere warehouse presently  this was the only cause of his interest in the ships beautiful spars  i own that for a time i was struck dumb by the bizarre associations of yardarms and windowpanes  to break windows is the last thing one would think of in connection with a ships topgallant yard unless indeed one were an experienced berthingmaster in one of the london docks this old chap was doing his little share of the worlds work with proper efficiency  his little blue eyes had made out the danger many hundred yards off  his rheumaticky feet tired with balancing that squat body for many years upon the decks of small coasters and made sore by miles of tramping upon the flagstones of the dock side had hurried up in time to avert a ridiculous catastrophe  i answered him pettishly i fear and as if i had known all about it before  all right all right cant do everything at once  he remained near by muttering to himself till the yards had been hauled round at my order and then raised again his foggy thick voice  none too soon he observed with a critical glance up at the towering side of the warehouse  thats a halfsovereign in your pocket mr mate  you should always look first how you are for them windows before you begin to breast in your ship to the quay  it was good advice  but one cannot think of everything or foresee contacts of things apparently as remote as stars and hoppoles    xxxii    the view of ships lying moored in some of the older docks of london has always suggested to my mind the image of a flock of swans kept in the flooded backyard of grim tenement houses  the flatness of the walls surrounding the dark pool on which they float brings out wonderfully the flowing grace of the lines on which a ships hull is built  the lightness of these forms devised to meet the winds and the seas makes by contrast with the great piles of bricks the chains and cables of their moorings appear very necessary as if nothing less could prevent them from soaring upwards and over the roofs  the least puff of wind stealing round the corners of the dock buildings stirs these captives fettered to rigid shores it is as if the soul of a ship were impatient of confinement those masted hulls relieved of their cargo become restless at the slightest hint of the winds freedom  however tightly moored they range a little at their berths swaying imperceptibly the spire like assemblages of cordage and spars  you can detect their impatience by watching the sway of the mastheads against the motionless the soulless gravity of mortar and stones  as you pass alongside each hopeless prisoner chained to the quay the slight grinding noise of the wooden fenders makes a sound of angry muttering  but after all it may be good for ships to go through a period of restraint and repose as the restraint and self communion of inactivity may be good for an unruly soulnot indeed that i mean to say that ships are unruly on the contrary they are faithful creatures as so many men can testify  and faithfulness is a great restraint the strongest bond laid upon the selfwill of men and ships on this globe of land and sea  this interval of bondage in the docks rounds each period of a ships life with the sense of accomplished duty of an effectively played part in the work of the world  the dock is the scene of what the world would think the most serious part in the light bounding swaying life of a ship  but there are docks and docks the ugliness of some docks is appalling  wild horses would not drag from me the name of a certain river in the north whose narrow estuary is inhospitable and dangerous and whose docks are like a nightmare of dreariness and misery  their dismal shores are studded thickly with scaffoldlike enormous timber structures whose lofty heads are veiled periodically by the infernal gritty night of a cloud of coaldust  the most important ingredient for getting the worlds work along is distributed there under the circumstances of the greatest cruelty meted out to helpless ships shut up in the desolate circuit of these basins you would think a free ship would droop and die like a wild bird put into a dirty cage  but a ship perhaps because of her faithfulness to men will endure an extraordinary lot of illusage  still i have seen ships issue from certain docks like halfdead prisoners from a dungeon bedraggled overcome wholly disguised in dirt and with their men rolling white eyeballs in black and worried faces raised to a heaven which in its smoky and soiled aspect seemed to reflect the sordidness of the earth below  one thing however may be said for the docks of the port of london on both sides of the river  for all the complaints of their insufficient equipment of their obsolete rules of failure they say in the matter of quick despatch no ship need ever issue from their gates in a half fainting condition  london is a general cargo port as is only proper for the greatest capital of the world to be  general cargo ports belong to the aristocracy of the earths trading places and in that aristocracy london as it is its way has a unique physiognomy  the absence of picturesqueness cannot be laid to the charge of the docks opening into the thames  for all my unkind comparisons to swans and backyards it cannot be denied that each dock or group of docks along the north side of the river has its own individual attractiveness  beginning with the cosy little st katherines dock lying overshadowed and black like a quiet pool amongst rocky crags through the venerable and sympathetic london docks with not a single line of rails in the whole of their area and the aroma of spices lingering between its warehouses with their farfamed wine cellarsdown through the interesting group of west india docks the fine docks at blackwall on past the galleons reach entrance of the victoria and albert docks right down to the vast gloom of the great basins in tilbury each of those places of restraint for ships has its own peculiar physiognomy its own expression  and what makes them unique and attractive is their common trait of being romantic in their usefulness  in their way they are as romantic as the river they serve is unlike all the other commercial streams of the world  the cosiness of the st katherines dock the oldworld air of the london docks remain impressed upon the memory  the docks down the river abreast of woolwich are imposing by their proportions and the vast scale of the ugliness that forms their surroundingsugliness so picturesque as to become a delight to the eye  when one talks of the thames docks beauty is a vain word but romance has lived too long upon this river not to have thrown a mantle of glamour upon its banks  the antiquity of the port appeals to the imagination by the long chain of adventurous enterprises that had their inception in the town and floated out into the world on the waters of the river even the newest of the docks the tilbury dock shares in the glamour conferred by historical associations  queen elizabeth has made one of her progresses down there not one of her journeys of pomp and ceremony but an anxious business progress at a crisis of national history  the menace of that time has passed away and now tilbury is known by its docks  these are very modern but their remoteness and isolation upon the essex marsh the days of failure attending their creation invested them with a romantic air nothing in those days could have been more striking than the vast empty basins surrounded by miles of bare quays and the ranges of cargosheds where two or three ships seemed lost like bewitched children in a forest of gaunt hydraulic cranes  one received a wonderful impression of utter abandonment of wasted efficiency from the first the tilbury docks were very efficient and ready for their task but they had come perhaps too soon into the field  a great future lies before tilbury docks  they shall never fill a longfelt want in the sacramental phrase that is applied to railways tunnels newspapers and new editions of books  they were too early in the field  the want shall never be felt because free of the trammels of the tide easy of access magnificent and desolate they are already there prepared to take and keep the biggest ships that float upon the sea  they are worthy of the oldest river port in the world   and truth to say for all the criticisms flung upon the heads of the dock companies the other docks of the thames are no disgrace to the town with a population greater than that of some commonwealths  the growth of london as a wellequipped port has been slow while not unworthy of a great capital of a great centre of distribution  it must not be forgotten that london has not the backing of great industrial districts or great fields of natural exploitation  in this it differs from liverpool from cardiff from newcastle from glasgow and therein the thames differs from the mersey from the tyne from the clyde  it is an historical river it is a romantic stream flowing through the centre of great affairs and for all the criticism of the rivers administration my contention is that its development has been worthy of its dignity  for a long time the stream itself could accommodate quite easily the oversea and coasting traffic  that was in the days when in the part called the pool just below london bridge the vessels moored stem and stern in the very strength of the tide formed one solid mass like an island covered with a forest of gaunt leafless trees and when the trade had grown too big for the river there came the st katherines docks and the london docks magnificent undertakings answering to the need of their time  the same may be said of the other artificial lakes full of ships that go in and out upon this high road to all parts of the world  the labour of the imperial waterway goes on from generation to generation goes on day and night  nothing ever arrests its sleepless industry but the coming of a heavy fog which clothes the teeming stream in a mantle of impenetrable stillness  after the gradual cessation of all sound and movement on the faithful river only the ringing of ships bells is heard mysterious and muffled in the white vapour from london bridge right down to the nore for miles and miles in a decrescendo tinkling to where the estuary broadens out into the north sea and the anchored ships lie scattered thinly in the shrouded channels between the sandbanks of the thames mouth  through the long and glorious tale of years of the rivers strenuous service to its people these are its only breathing times    xxxiii    a ship in dock surrounded by quays and the walls of warehouses has the appearance of a prisoner meditating upon freedom in the sadness of a free spirit put under restraint  chain cables and stout ropes keep her bound to stone posts at the edge of a paved shore and a berthingmaster with brass buttons on his coat walks about like a weatherbeaten and ruddy gaoler casting jealous watchful glances upon the moorings that fetter a ship lying passive and still and safe as if lost in deep regrets of her days of liberty and danger on the sea  the swarm of renegadesdockmasters berthingmasters gatemen and such likeappear to nurse an immense distrust of the captive ships resignation  there never seem chains and ropes enough to satisfy their minds concerned with the safe binding of free ships to the strong muddy enslaved earth  you had better put another bight of a hawser astern mr mate is the usual phrase in their mouth  i brand them for renegades because most of them have been sailors in their time  as if the infirmities of old agethe gray hair the wrinkles at the corners of the eyes and the knotted veins of the handswere the symptoms of moral poison they prowl about the quays with an underhand air of gloating over the broken spirit of noble captives  they want more fenders more breasting ropes they want more springs more shackles more fetters they want to make ships with volatile souls as motionless as square blocks of stone  they stand on the mud of pavements these degraded seadogs with long lines of railwaytrucks clanking their couplings behind their backs and run malevolent glances over your ship from headgear to taffrail only wishing to tyrannize over the poor creature under the hypocritical cloak of benevolence and care here and there cargo cranes looking like instruments of torture for ships swing cruel hooks at the end of long chains  gangs of dock labourers swarm with muddy feet over the gangways  it is a moving sight this of so many men of the earth earthy who never cared anything for a ship trampling unconcerned brutal and hobnailed upon her helpless body  fortunately nothing can deface the beauty of a ship  that sense of a dungeon that sense of a horrible and degrading misfortune overtaking a creature fair to see and safe to trust attaches only to ships moored in the docks of great european ports  you feel that they are dishonestly locked up to be hunted about from wharf to wharf on a dark greasy square pool of black water as a brutal reward at the end of a faithful voyage  a ship anchored in an open roadstead with cargolighters alongside and her own tackle swinging the burden over the rail is accomplishing in freedom a function of her life  there is no restraint there is space  clear water around her and a clear sky above her mastheads with a landscape of green hills and charming bays opening around her anchorage  she is not abandoned by her own men to the tender mercies of shore people  she still shelters and is looked after by her own little devoted band and you feel that presently she will glide between the headlands and disappear  it is only at home in dock that she lies abandoned shut off from freedom by all the artifices of men that think of quick despatch and profitable freights  it is only then that the odious rectangular shadows of walls and roofs fall upon her decks with showers of soot  to a man who has never seen the extraordinary nobility strength and grace that the devoted generations of shipbuilders have evolved from some pure nooks of their simple souls the sight that could be seen fiveandtwenty years ago of a large fleet of clippers moored along the north side of the new south dock was an inspiring spectacle  then there was a quarter of a mile of them from the iron dockyardgates guarded by policemen in a long forestlike perspective of masts moored two and two to many stout wooden jetties  their spars dwarfed with their loftiness the corrugatediron sheds their jibbooms extended far over the shore their whiteandgold figureheads almost dazzling in their purity overhung the straight long quay above the mud and dirt of the wharfside with the busy figures of groups and single men moving to and fro restless and grimy under their soaring immobility  at tidetime you would see one of the loaded ships with battened down hatches drop out of the ranks and float in the clear space of the dock held by lines dark and slender like the first threads of a spiders web extending from her bows and her quarters to the mooringposts on shore  there graceful and still like a bird ready to spread its wings she waited till at the opening of the gates a tug or two would hurry in noisily hovering round her with an air of fuss and solicitude and take her out into the river tending shepherding her through open bridges through damlike gates between the flat pierheads with a bit of green lawn surrounded by gravel and a white signalmast with yard and gaff flying a couple of dingy blue red or white flags  this new south dock it was its official name round which my earlier professional memories are centred belongs to the group of west india docks together with two smaller and much older basins called import and export respectively both with the greatness of their trade departed from them already  picturesque and clean as docks go these twin basins spread side by side the dark lustre of their glassy water sparely peopled by a few ships laid up on buoys or tucked far away from each other at the end of sheds in the corners of empty quays where they seemed to slumber quietly remote untouched by the bustle of mens affairsin retreat rather than in captivity  they were quaint and sympathetic those two homely basins unfurnished and silent with no aggressive display of cranes no apparatus of hurry and work on their narrow shores no railwaylines cumbered them  the knots of labourers trooping in clumsily round the corners of cargosheds to eat their food in peace out of red cotton handkerchiefs had the air of picnicking by the side of a lonely mountain pool  they were restful and i should say very unprofitable those basins where the chief officer of one of the ships involved in the harassing strenuous noisy activity of the new south dock only a few yards away could escape in the dinnerhour to stroll unhampered by men and affairs meditating if he chose on the vanity of all things human  at one time they must have been full of good old slow west indiamen of the squarestern type that took their captivity one imagines as stolidly as they had faced the buffeting of the waves with their blunt honest bows and disgorged sugar rum molasses coffee or logwood sedately with their own winch and tackle  but when i knew them of exports there was never a sign that one could detect and all the imports i have ever seen were some rare cargoes of tropical timber enormous baulks roughed out of iron trunks grown in the woods about the gulf of mexico  they lay piled up in stacks of mighty boles and it was hard to believe that all this mass of dead and stripped trees had come out of the flanks of a slender innocentlooking little barque with as likely as not a homely womans nameellen this or annie thatupon her fine bows  but this is generally the case with a discharged cargo  once spread at large over the quay it looks the most impossible bulk to have all come there out of that ship alongside  they were quiet serene nooks in the busy world of docks these basins where it has never been my good luck to get a berth after some more or less arduous passage  but one could see at a glance that men and ships were never hustled there  they were so quiet that remembering them well one comes to doubt that they ever existedplaces of repose for tired ships to dream in places of meditation rather than work where wicked shipsthe cranky the lazy the wet the bad sea boats the wild steerers the capricious the pigheaded the generally ungovernablewould have full leisure to take count and repent of their sins sorrowful and naked with their rent garments of sailcloth stripped off them and with the dust and ashes of the london atmosphere upon their mastheads  for that the worst of ships would repent if she were ever given time i make no doubt  i have known too many of them no ship is wholly bad and now that their bodies that had braved so many tempests have been blown off the face of the sea by a puff of steam the evil and the good together into the limbo of things that have served their time there can be no harm in affirming that in these vanished generations of willing servants there never has been one utterly unredeemable soul  in the new south dock there was certainly no time for remorse introspection repentance or any phenomena of inner life either for the captive ships or for their officers  from six in the morning till six at night the hard labour of the prisonhouse which rewards the valiance of ships that win the harbour went on steadily great slings of general cargo swinging over the rail to drop plumb into the hatchways at the sign of the gangwaytenders hand  the new south dock was especially a loading dock for the colonies in those great and last days of smart woolclippers good to look at andwellexciting to handle  some of them were more fair to see than the others many were to put it mildly somewhat overmasted all were expected to make good passages and of all that line of ships whose rigging made a thick enormous network against the sky whose brasses flashed almost as far as the eye of the policeman at the gates could reach there was hardly one that knew of any other port amongst all the ports on the wide earth but london and sydney or london and melbourne or london and adelaide perhaps with hobart town added for those of smaller tonnage  one could almost have believed as her graywhiskered second mate used to say of the old duke of s that they knew the road to the antipodes better than their own skippers who year in year out took them from londonthe place of captivityto some australian port where twentyfive years ago though moored well and tight enough to the wooden wharves they felt themselves no captives but honoured guests    xxxiv    these towns of the antipodes not so great then as they are now took an interest in the shipping the running links with home whose numbers confirmed the sense of their growing importance they made it part and parcel of their daily interests  this was especially the case in sydney where from the heart of the fair city down the vista of important streets could be seen the wool clippers lying at the circular quayno walled prisonhouse of a dock that but the integral part of one of the finest most beautiful vast and safe bays the sun ever shone upon  now great steamliners lie at these berths always reserved for the sea aristocracygrand and imposing enough ships but here today and gone next week whereas the general cargo emigrant and passenger clippers of my time rigged with heavy spars and built on fine lines used to remain for months together waiting for their load of wool  their names attained the dignity of household words  on sundays and holidays the citizens trooped down on visiting bent and the lonely officer on duty solaced himself by playing the ciceroneespecially to the citizenesses with engaging manners and a welldeveloped sense of the fun that may be got out of the inspection of a ships cabins and staterooms  the tinkle of more or less untuned cottage pianos floated out of open sternports till the gaslamps began to twinkle in the streets and the ships nightwatchman coming sleepily on duty after his unsatisfactory day slumbers hauled down the flags and fastened a lighted lantern at the break of the gangway  the night closed rapidly upon the silent ships with their crews on shore  up a short steep ascent by the kings head pub patronized by the cooks and stewards of the fleet the voice of a man crying hot saveloys at the end of george street where the cheap eatinghouses sixpence a meal were kept by chinamen sunkumons was not bad is heard at regular intervals  i have listened for hours to this most pertinacious pedlar i wonder whether he is dead or has made a fortune while sitting on the rail of the old duke of s shes dead poor thing a violent death on the coast of new zealand fascinated by the monotony the regularity the abruptness of the recurring cry and so exasperated at the absurd spell that i wished the fellow would choke himself to death with a mouthful of his own infamous wares  a stupid job and fit only for an old man my comrades used to tell me to be the nightwatchman of a captive though honoured ship and generally the oldest of the able seamen in a ships crew does get it  but sometimes neither the oldest nor any other fairly steady seaman is forthcoming  ships crews had the trick of melting away swiftly in those days  so probably on account of my youth innocence and pensive habits which made me sometimes dilatory in my work about the rigging i was suddenly nominated in our chief mate mr bs most sardonic tones to that enviable situation  i do not regret the experience  the night humours of the town descended from the street to the waterside in the still watches of the night  larrikins rushing down in bands to settle some quarrel by a standup fight away from the police in an indistinct ring half hidden by piles of cargo with the sounds of blows a groan now and then the stamping of feet and the cry of time rising suddenly above the sinister and excited murmurs nightprowlers pursued or pursuing with a stifled shriek followed by a profound silence or slinking stealthily alongside like ghosts and addressing me from the quay below in mysterious tones with incomprehensible propositions  the cabmen too who twice a week on the night when the asn companys passengerboat was due to arrive used to range a battalion of blazing lamps opposite the ship were very amusing in their way  they got down from their perches and told each other impolite stories in racy language every word of which reached me distinctly over the bulwarks as i sat smoking on the mainhatch  on one occasion i had an hour or so of a most intellectual conversation with a person whom i could not see distinctly a gentleman from england he said with a cultivated voice i on deck and he on the quay sitting on the case of a piano landed out of our hold that very afternoon and smoking a cigar which smelt very good  we touched in our discourse upon science politics natural history and operatic singers  then after remarking abruptly you seem to be rather intelligent my man he informed me pointedly that his name was mr senior and walked offto his hotel i suppose  shadows shadows  i think i saw a white whisker as he turned under the lamppost  it is a shock to think that in the natural course of nature he must be dead by now  there was nothing to object to in his intelligence but a little dogmatism maybe  and his name was senior  mr senior  the position had its drawbacks however  one wintry blustering dark night in july as i stood sleepily out of the rain under the break of the poop something resembling an ostrich dashed up the gangway  i say ostrich because the creature though it ran on two legs appeared to help its progress by working a pair of short wings it was a man however only his coat ripped up the back and flapping in two halves above his shoulders gave him that weird and fowllike appearance  at least i suppose it was his coat for it was impossible to make him out distinctly  how he managed to come so straight upon me at speed and without a stumble over a strange deck i cannot imagine  he must have been able to see in the dark better than any cat  he overwhelmed me with panting entreaties to let him take shelter till morning in our forecastle  following my strict orders i refused his request mildly at first in a sterner tone as he insisted with growing impudence  for gods sake let me matey  some of em are after meand ive got hold of a ticker here  you clear out of this i said  dont be hard on a chap old man he whined pitifully  now then get ashore at once  do you hear  silence  he appeared to cringe mute as if words had failed him through grief thenbang came a concussion and a great flash of light in which he vanished leaving me prone on my back with the most abominable black eye that anybody ever got in the faithful discharge of duty  shadows  shadows  i hope he escaped the enemies he was fleeing from to live and flourish to this day  but his fist was uncommonly hard and his aim miraculously true in the dark  there were other experiences less painful and more funny for the most part with one amongst them of a dramatic complexion but the greatest experience of them all was mr b our chief mate himself  he used to go ashore every night to foregather in some hotels parlour with his crony the mate of the barque cicero lying on the other side of the circular quay  late at night i would hear from afar their stumbling footsteps and their voices raised in endless argument  the mate of the cicero was seeing his friend on board they would continue their senseless and muddled discourse in tones of profound friendship for half an hour or so at the shore end of our gangway and then i would hear mr b insisting that he must see the other on board his ship  and away they would go their voices still conversing with excessive amity being heard moving all round the harbour  it happened more than once that they would thus perambulate three or four times the distance each seeing the other on board his ship out of pure and disinterested affection then through sheer weariness or perhaps in a moment of forgetfulness they would manage to part from each other somehow and byandby the planks of our long gangway would bend and creak under the weight of mr b coming on board for good at last  on the rail his burly form would stop and stand swaying  watchman  sir  a pause  he waited for a moment of steadiness before negotiating the three steps of the inside ladder from rail to deck and the watchman taught by experience would forbear offering help which would be received as an insult at that particular stage of the mates return  but many times i trembled for his neck  he was a heavy man  then with a rush and a thump it would be done  he never had to pick himself up but it took him a minute or so to pull himself together after the descent  watchman  sir  captain aboard  yes sir  pause  dog aboard  yes sir  pause  our dog was a gaunt and unpleasant beast more like a wolf in poor health than a dog and i never noticed mr b at any other time show the slightest interest in the doings of the animal  but that question never failed  lets have your arm to steady me along  i was always prepared for that request  he leaned on me heavily till near enough the cabindoor to catch hold of the handle  then he would let go my arm at once  thatll do  i can manage now  and he could manage  he could manage to find his way into his berth light his lamp get into his beday and get out of it when i called him at halfpast five the first man on deck lifting the cup of morning coffee to his lips with a steady hand ready for duty as though he had virtuously slept ten solid hoursa better chief officer than many a man who had never tasted grog in his life  he could manage all that but could never manage to get on in life  only once he failed to seize the cabindoor handle at the first grab  he waited a little tried again and again failed  his weight was growing heavier on my arm  he sighed slowly  dn that handle  without letting go his hold of me he turned about his face lit up bright as day by the full moon  i wish she were out at sea he growled savagely  yes sir  i felt the need to say something because he hung on to me as if lost breathing heavily  ports are no goodships rot men go to the devil  i kept still and after a while he repeated with a sigh  i wish she were at sea out of this  so do i sir i ventured  holding my shoulder he turned upon me  you  whats that to you where she is  you dontdrink  and even on that night he managed it at last  he got hold of the handle  but he did not manage to light his lamp i dont think he even tried though in the morning as usual he was the first on deck bullnecked curlyheaded watching the hands turnto with his sardonic expression and unflinching gaze  i met him ten years afterwards casually unexpectedly in the street on coming out of my consignee office  i was not likely to have forgotten him with his i can manage now  he recognised me at once remembered my name and in what ship i had served under his orders  he looked me over from head to foot  what are you doing here he asked  i am commanding a little barque i said loading here for mauritius  then thoughtlessly i added  and what are you doing mr b  i he said looking at me unflinchingly with his old sardonic grini am looking for something to do  i felt i would rather have bitten out my tongue  his jetblack curly hair had turned irongray he was scrupulously neat as ever but frightfully threadbare  his shiny boots were worn down at heel  but he forgave me and we drove off together in a hansom to dine on board my ship  he went over her conscientiously praised her heartily congratulated me on my command with absolute sincerity  at dinner as i offered him wine and beer he shook his head and as i sat looking at him interrogatively muttered in an undertone  ive given up all that  after dinner we came again on deck  it seemed as though he could not tear himself away from the ship  we were fitting some new lower rigging and he hung about approving suggesting giving me advice in his old manner  twice he addressed me as my boy and corrected himself quickly to captain  my mate was about to leave me to get married but i concealed the fact from mr b  i was afraid he would ask me to give him the berth in some ghastly jocular hint that i could not refuse to take  i was afraid  it would have been impossible  i could not have given orders to mr b and i am sure he would not have taken them from me very long he could not have managed that though he had managed to break himself from drinktoo late  he said goodbye at last  as i watched his burly bullnecked figure walk away up the street i wondered with a sinking heart whether he had much more than the price of a nights lodging in his pocket  and i understood that if that very minute i were to call out after him he would not even turn his head  he too is no more than a shadow but i seem to hear his words spoken on the moonlit deck of the old duke  ports are no goodships rot men go to the devil    xxxv    ships exclaimed an elderly seaman in clean shore togs  ships and his keen glance turning away from my face ran along the vista of magnificent figureheads that in the late seventies used to overhang in a serried rank the muddy pavement by the side of the new south dockships are all right its the men in em    fifty hulls at least moulded on lines of beauty and speedhulls of wood of iron expressing in their forms the highest achievement of modern shipbuildinglay moored all in a row stem to quay as if assembled there for an exhibition not of a great industry but of a great art  their colours were gray black dark green with a narrow strip of yellow moulding defining their sheer or with a row of painted ports decking in warlike decoration their robust flanks of cargocarriers that would know no triumph but of speed in carrying a burden no glory other than of a long service no victory but that of an endless obscure contest with the sea  the great empty hulls with swept holds just out of drydock with their paint glistening freshly sat highsided with ponderous dignity alongside the wooden jetties looking more like unmovable buildings than things meant to go afloat others half loaded far on the way to recover the true seaphysiognomy of a ship brought down to her loadline looked more accessible  their less steeply slanting gangways seemed to invite the strolling sailors in search of a berth to walk on board and try for a chance with the chief mate the guardian of a ships efficiency  as if anxious to remain unperceived amongst their overtopping sisters two or three finished ships floated low with an air of straining at the leash of their level headfasts exposing to view their cleared decks and covered hatches prepared to drop stern first out of the labouring ranks displaying the true comeliness of form which only her proper seatrim gives to a ship  and for a good quarter of a mile from the dockyard gate to the farthest corner where the old housedin hulk the president drillship then of the naval reserve used to lie with her frigate side rubbing against the stone of the quay above all these hulls ready and unready a hundred and fifty lofty masts more or less held out the web of their rigging like an immense net in whose close mesh black against the sky the heavy yards seemed to be entangled and suspended  it was a sight  the humblest craft that floats makes its appeal to a seaman by the faithfulness of her life and this was the place where one beheld the aristocracy of ships  it was a noble gathering of the fairest and the swiftest each bearing at the bow the carved emblem of her name as in a gallery of plastercasts figures of women with mural crowns women with flowing robes with gold fillets on their hair or blue scarves round their waists stretching out rounded arms as if to point the way heads of men helmeted or bare full lengths of warriors of kings of statesmen of lords and princesses all white from top to toe with here and there a dusky turbaned figure bedizened in many colours of some eastern sultan or hero all inclined forward under the slant of mighty bowsprits as if eager to begin another run of 11000 miles in their leaning attitudes  these were the fine figureheads of the finest ships afloat  but why unless for the love of the life those effigies shared with us in their wandering impassivity should one try to reproduce in words an impression of whose fidelity there can be no critic and no judge since such an exhibition of the art of shipbuilding and the art of figurehead carving as was seen from years end to years end in the openair gallery of the new south dock no mans eye shall behold again  all that patient pale company of queens and princesses of kings and warriors of allegorical women of heroines and statesmen and heathen gods crowned helmeted bareheaded has run for good off the sea stretching to the last above the tumbling foam their fair rounded arms holding out their spears swords shields tridents in the same unwearied striving forward pose  and nothing remains but lingering perhaps in the memory of a few men the sound of their names vanished a long time ago from the first page of the great london dailies from big posters in railwaystations and the doors of shipping offices from the minds of sailors dockmasters pilots and tugmen from the hail of gruff voices and the flutter of signal flags exchanged between ships closing upon each other and drawing apart in the open immensity of the sea  the elderly respectable seaman withdrawing his gaze from that multitude of spars gave me a glance to make sure of our fellowship in the craft and mystery of the sea  we had met casually and had got into contact as i had stopped near him my attention being caught by the same peculiarity he was looking at in the rigging of an obviously new ship a ship with her reputation all to make yet in the talk of the seamen who were to share their life with her her name was already on their lips  i had heard it uttered between two thick rednecked fellows of the seminautical type at the fenchurch street railwaystation where in those days the everyday male crowd was attired in jerseys and pilotcloth mostly and had the air of being more conversant with the times of high water than with the times of the trains  i had noticed that new ships name on the first page of my morning paper  i had stared at the unfamiliar grouping of its letters blue on white ground on the advertisementboards whenever the train came to a standstill alongside one of the shabby wooden wharflike platforms of the dock railwayline  she had been named with proper observances on the day she came off the stocks no doubt but she was very far yet from having a name  untried ignorant of the ways of the sea she had been thrust amongst that renowned company of ships to load for her maiden voyage  there was nothing to vouch for her soundness and the worth of her character but the reputation of the buildingyard whence she was launched headlong into the world of waters  she looked modest to me  i imagined her diffident lying very quiet with her side nestling shyly against the wharf to which she was made fast with very new lines intimidated by the company of her tried and experienced sisters already familiar with all the violences of the ocean and the exacting love of men  they had had more long voyages to make their names in than she had known weeks of carefully tended life for a new ship receives as much attention as if she were a young bride  even crabbed old dockmasters look at her with benevolent eyes  in her shyness at the threshold of a laborious and uncertain life where so much is expected of a ship she could not have been better heartened and comforted had she only been able to hear and understand than by the tone of deep conviction in which my elderly respectable seaman repeated the first part of his saying ships are all right     his civility prevented him from repeating the other the bitter part  it had occurred to him that it was perhaps indelicate to insist  he had recognised in me a ships officer very possibly looking for a berth like himself and so far a comrade but still a man belonging to that sparselypeopled afterend of a ship where a great part of her reputation as a good ship in seamans parlance is made or marred  can you say that of all ships without exception i asked being in an idle mood because if an obvious ships officer i was not as a matter of fact down at the docks to look for a berth an occupation as engrossing as gambling and as little favourable to the free exchange of ideas besides being destructive of the kindly temper needed for casual intercourse with ones fellowcreatures  you can always put up with em opined the respectable seaman judicially  he was not averse from talking either  if he had come down to the dock to look for a berth he did not seem oppressed by anxiety as to his chances  he had the serenity of a man whose estimable character is fortunately expressed by his personal appearance in an unobtrusive yet convincing manner which no chief officer in want of hands could resist  and true enough i learned presently that the mate of the hyperion had taken down his name for quarter master  we sign on friday and join next day for the morning tide he remarked in a deliberate careless tone which contrasted strongly with his evident readiness to stand there yarning for an hour or so with an utter stranger  hyperion i said  i dont remember ever seeing that ship anywhere  what sort of a name has she got  it appeared from his discursive answer that she had not much of a name one way or another  she was not very fast  it took no fool though to steer her straight he believed  some years ago he had seen her in calcutta and he remembered being told by somebody then that on her passage up the river she had carried away both her hawsepipes  but that might have been the pilots fault  just now yarning with the apprentices on board he had heard that this very voyage brought up in the downs outward bound she broke her sheer struck adrift and lost an anchor and chain  but that might have occurred through want of careful tending in a tideway  all the same this looked as though she were pretty hard on her ground tackle  didnt it  she seemed a heavy ship to handle anyway for the rest as she had a new captain and a new mate this voyage he understood one couldnt say how she would turn out     in such marine shoretalk as this is the name of a ship slowly established her fame made for her the tale of her qualities and of her defects kept her idiosyncrasies commented upon with the zest of personal gossip her achievements made much of her faults glossed over as things that being without remedy in our imperfect world should not be dwelt upon too much by men who with the help of ships wrest out a bitter living from the rough grasp of the sea  all that talk makes up her name which is handed over from one crew to another without bitterness without animosity with the indulgence of mutual dependence and with the feeling of close association in the exercise of her perfections and in the danger of her defects  this feeling explains mens pride in ships  ships are all right as my middleaged respectable quartermaster said with much conviction and some irony but they are not exactly what men make them  they have their own nature they can of themselves minister to our selfesteem by the demand their qualities make upon our skill and their shortcomings upon our hardiness and endurance which is the more flattering exaction it is hard to say but there is the fact that in listening for upwards of twenty years to the seatalk that goes on afloat and ashore i have never detected the true note of animosity  i wont deny that at sea sometimes the note of profanity was audible enough in those chiding interpellations a wet cold weary seaman addresses to his ship and in moments of exasperation is disposed to extend to all ships that ever were launchedto the whole everlastingly exacting brood that swims in deep waters  and i have heard curses launched at the unstable element itself whose fascination outlasting the accumulated experience of ages had captured him as it had captured the generations of his forebears  for all that has been said of the love that certain natures on shore have professed to feel for it for all the celebrations it had been the object of in prose and song the sea has never been friendly to man  at most it has been the accomplice of human restlessness and playing the part of dangerous abettor of world wide ambitions  faithful to no race after the manner of the kindly earth receiving no impress from valour and toil and self sacrifice recognising no finality of dominion the sea has never adopted the cause of its masters like those lands where the victorious nations of mankind have taken root rocking their cradles and setting up their gravestones  heman or peoplewho putting his trust in the friendship of the sea neglects the strength and cunning of his right hand is a fool  as if it were too great too mighty for common virtues the ocean has no compassion no faith no law no memory  its fickleness is to be held true to mens purposes only by an undaunted resolution and by a sleepless armed jealous vigilance in which perhaps there has always been more hate than love  odi et amo may well be the confession of those who consciously or blindly have surrendered their existence to the fascination of the sea  all the tempestuous passions of mankinds young days the love of loot and the love of glory the love of adventure and the love of danger with the great love of the unknown and vast dreams of dominion and power have passed like images reflected from a mirror leaving no record upon the mysterious face of the sea  impenetrable and heartless the sea has given nothing of itself to the suitors for its precarious favours  unlike the earth it cannot be subjugated at any cost of patience and toil  for all its fascination that has lured so many to a violent death its immensity has never been loved as the mountains the plains the desert itself have been loved  indeed i suspect that leaving aside the protestations and tributes of writers who one is safe in saying care for little else in the world than the rhythm of their lines and the cadence of their phrase the love of the sea to which some men and nations confess so readily is a complex sentiment wherein pride enters for much necessity for not a little and the love of shipsthe untiring servants of our hopes and our selfesteemfor the best and most genuine part  for the hundreds who have reviled the sea beginning with shakespeare in the line   more fell than hunger anguish or the sea   down to the last obscure seadog of the old model having but few words and still fewer thoughts there could not be found i believe one sailor who has ever coupled a curse with the good or bad name of a ship  if ever his profanity provoked by the hardships of the sea went so far as to touch his ship it would be lightly as a hand may without sin be laid in the way of kindness on a woman    xxxvi    the love that is given to ships is profoundly different from the love men feel for every other work of their handsthe love they bear to their houses for instancebecause it is untainted by the pride of possession  the pride of skill the pride of responsibility the pride of endurance there may be but otherwise it is a disinterested sentiment  no seaman ever cherished a ship even if she belonged to him merely because of the profit she put in his pocket  no one i think ever did for a shipowner even of the best has always been outside the pale of that sentiment embracing in a feeling of intimate equal fellowship the ship and the man backing each other against the implacable if sometimes dissembled hostility of their world of waters  the seathis truth must be confessedhas no generosity  no display of manly qualitiescourage hardihood endurance faithfulnesshas ever been known to touch its irresponsible consciousness of power  the ocean has the conscienceless temper of a savage autocrat spoiled by much adulation  he cannot brook the slightest appearance of defiance and has remained the irreconcilable enemy of ships and men ever since ships and men had the unheard of audacity to go afloat together in the face of his frown  from that day he has gone on swallowing up fleets and men without his resentment being glutted by the number of victimsby so many wrecked ships and wrecked lives  today as ever he is ready to beguile and betray to smash and to drown the incorrigible optimism of men who backed by the fidelity of ships are trying to wrest from him the fortune of their house the dominion of their world or only a dole of food for their hunger  if not always in the hot mood to smash he is always stealthily ready for a drowning  the most amazing wonder of the deep is its unfathomable cruelty  i felt its dread for the first time in midatlantic one day many years ago when we took off the crew of a danish brig homeward bound from the west indies  a thin silvery mist softened the calm and majestic splendour of light without shadowsseemed to render the sky less remote and the ocean less immense  it was one of the days when the might of the sea appears indeed lovable like the nature of a strong man in moments of quiet intimacy  at sunrise we had made out a black speck to the westward apparently suspended high up in the void behind a stirring shimmering veil of silvery blue gauze that seemed at times to stir and float in the breeze which fanned us slowly along  the peace of that enchanting forenoon was so profound so untroubled that it seemed that every word pronounced loudly on our deck would penetrate to the very heart of that infinite mystery born from the conjunction of water and sky  we did not raise our voices  a waterlogged derelict i think sir said the second officer quietly coming down from aloft with the binoculars in their case slung across his shoulders and our captain without a word signed to the helmsman to steer for the black speck  presently we made out a low jagged stump sticking up forwardall that remained of her departed masts  the captain was expatiating in a low conversational tone to the chief mate upon the danger of these derelicts and upon his dread of coming upon them at night when suddenly a man forward screamed out theres people on board of her sir  i see them in a most extraordinary voicea voice never heard before in our ship the amazing voice of a stranger  it gave the signal for a sudden tumult of shouts  the watch below ran up the forecastle head in a body the cook dashed out of the galley  everybody saw the poor fellows now  they were there  and all at once our ship which had the wellearned name of being without a rival for speed in light winds seemed to us to have lost the power of motion as if the sea becoming viscous had clung to her sides  and yet she moved immensity the inseparable companion of a ships life chose that day to breathe upon her as gently as a sleeping child  the clamour of our excitement had died out and our living ship famous for never losing steerage way as long as there was air enough to float a feather stole without a ripple silent and white as a ghost towards her mutilated and wounded sister come upon at the point of death in the sunlit haze of a calm day at sea  with the binoculars glued to his eyes the captain said in a quavering tone  they are waving to us with something aft there he put down the glasses on the skylight brusquely and began to walk about the poop  a shirt or a flag he ejaculated irritably cant make it out   some damn rag or other  he took a few more turns on the poop glancing down over the rail now and then to see how fast we were moving  his nervous footsteps rang sharply in the quiet of the ship where the other men all looking the same way had forgotten themselves in a staring immobility  this will never do he cried out suddenly  lower the boats at once  down with them  before i jumped into mine he took me aside as being an inexperienced junior for a word of warning  you look out as you come alongside that she doesnt take you down with her  you understand  he murmured this confidentially so that none of the men at the falls should overhear and i was shocked  heavens as if in such an emergency one stopped to think of danger i exclaimed to myself mentally in scorn of such coldblooded caution  it takes many lessons to make a real seaman and i got my rebuke at once  my experienced commander seemed in one searching glance to read my thoughts on my ingenuous face  what youre going for is to save life not to drown your boats crew for nothing he growled severely in my ear  but as we shoved off he leaned over and cried out  it all rests on the power of your arms men  give way for life  we made a race of it and i would never have believed that a common boats crew of a merchantman could keep up so much determined fierceness in the regular swing of their stroke  what our captain had clearly perceived before we left had become plain to all of us since  the issue of our enterprise hung on a hair above that abyss of waters which will not give up its dead till the day of judgment it was a race of two ships boats matched against death for a prize of nine mens lives and death had a long start  we saw the crew of the brig from afar working at the pumpsstill pumping on that wreck which already had settled so far down that the gentle low swell over which our boats rose and fell easily without a check to their speed welling up almost level with her headrails plucked at the ends of broken gear swinging desolately under her naked bowsprit  we could not in all conscience have picked out a better day for our regatta had we had the free choice of all the days that ever dawned upon the lonely struggles and solitary agonies of ships since the norse rovers first steered to the westward against the run of atlantic waves  it was a very good race  at the finish there was not an oars length between the first and second boat with death coming in a good third on the top of the very next smooth swell for all one knew to the contrary  the scuppers of the brig gurgled softly all together when the water rising against her sides subsided sleepily with a low wash as if playing about an immovable rock  her bulwarks were gone fore and aft and one saw her bare deck lowlying like a raft and swept clean of boats spars housesof everything except the ringbolts and the heads of the pumps  i had one dismal glimpse of it as i braced myself up to receive upon my breast the last man to leave her the captain who literally let himself fall into my arms  it had been a weirdly silent rescuea rescue without a hail without a single uttered word without a gesture or a sign without a conscious exchange of glances  up to the very last moment those on board stuck to their pumps which spouted two clear streams of water upon their bare feet  their brown skin showed through the rents of their shirts and the two small bunches of halfnaked tattered men went on bowing from the waist to each other in their backbreaking labour up and down absorbed with no time for a glance over the shoulder at the help that was coming to them  as we dashed unregarded alongside a voice let out one only one hoarse howl of command and then just as they stood without caps with the salt drying gray in the wrinkles and folds of their hairy haggard faces blinking stupidly at us their red eyelids they made a bolt away from the handles tottering and jostling against each other and positively flung themselves over upon our very heads the clatter they made tumbling into the boats had an extraordinarily destructive effect upon the illusion of tragic dignity our selfesteem had thrown over the contests of mankind with the sea  on that exquisite day of gently breathing peace and veiled sunshine perished my romantic love to what mens imagination had proclaimed the most august aspect of nature  the cynical indifference of the sea to the merits of human suffering and courage laid bare in this ridiculous panictainted performance extorted from the dire extremity of nine good and honourable seamen revolted me  i saw the duplicity of the seas most tender mood  it was so because it could not help itself but the awed respect of the early days was gone  i felt ready to smile bitterly at its enchanting charm and glare viciously at its furies  in a moment before we shoved off i had looked coolly at the life of my choice  its illusions were gone but its fascination remained  i had become a seaman at last  we pulled hard for a quarter of an hour then laid on our oars waiting for our ship  she was coming down on us with swelling sails looking delicately tall and exquisitely noble through the mist  the captain of the brig who sat in the stern sheets by my side with his face in his hands raised his head and began to speak with a sort of sombre volubility  they had lost their masts and sprung a leak in a hurricane drifted for weeks always at the pumps met more bad weather the ships they sighted failed to make them out the leak gained upon them slowly and the seas had left them nothing to make a raft of  it was very hard to see ship after ship pass by at a distance as if everybody had agreed that we must be left to drown he added  but they went on trying to keep the brig afloat as long as possible and working the pumps constantly on insufficient food mostly raw till yesterday evening he continued monotonously just as the sun went down the mens hearts broke  he made an almost imperceptible pause here and went on again with exactly the same intonation  they told me the brig could not be saved and they thought they had done enough for themselves  i said nothing to that  it was true  it was no mutiny  i had nothing to say to them  they lay about aft all night as still as so many dead men  i did not lie down  i kept a lookout  when the first light came i saw your ship at once  i waited for more light the breeze began to fail on my face  then i shouted out as loud as i was able look at that ship but only two men got up very slowly and came to me  at first only we three stood alone for a long time watching you coming down to us and feeling the breeze drop to a calm almost but afterwards others too rose one after another and byandby i had all my crew behind me  i turned round and said to them that they could see the ship was coming our way but in this small breeze she might come too late after all unless we turned to and tried to keep the brig afloat long enough to give you time to save us all  i spoke like that to them and then i gave the command to man the pumps  he gave the command and gave the example too by going himself to the handles but it seems that these men did actually hang back for a moment looking at each other dubiously before they followed him he he he  he broke out into a most unexpected imbecile pathetic nervous little giggle  their hearts were broken so they had been played with too long he explained apologetically lowering his eyes and became silent  twentyfive years is a long timea quarter of a century is a dim and distant past but to this day i remember the darkbrown feet hands and faces of two of these men whose hearts had been broken by the sea  they were lying very still on their sides on the bottom boards between the thwarts curled up like dogs  my boats crew leaning over the looms of their oars stared and listened as if at the play  the master of the brig looked up suddenly to ask me what day it was  they had lost the date  when i told him it was sunday the 22nd he frowned making some mental calculation then nodded twice sadly to himself staring at nothing  his aspect was miserably unkempt and wildly sorrowful  had it not been for the unquenchable candour of his blue eyes whose unhappy tired glance every moment sought his abandoned sinking brig as if it could find rest nowhere else he would have appeared mad  but he was too simple to go mad too simple with that manly simplicity which alone can bear men unscathed in mind and body through an encounter with the deadly playfulness of the sea or with its less abominable fury  neither angry nor playful nor smiling it enveloped our distant ship growing bigger as she neared us our boats with the rescued men and the dismantled hull of the brig we were leaving behind in the large and placid embrace of its quietness half lost in the fair haze as if in a dream of infinite and tender clemency  there was no frown no wrinkle on its face not a ripple  and the run of the slight swell was so smooth that it resembled the graceful undulation of a piece of shimmering gray silk shot with gleams of green  we pulled an easy stroke but when the master of the brig after a glance over his shoulder stood up with a low exclamation my men feathered their oars instinctively without an order and the boat lost her way  he was steadying himself on my shoulder with a strong grip while his other arm flung up rigidly pointed a denunciatory finger at the immense tranquillity of the ocean  after his first exclamation which stopped the swing of our oars he made no sound but his whole attitude seemed to cry out an indignant behold    i could not imagine what vision of evil had come to him  i was startled and the amazing energy of his immobilized gesture made my heart beat faster with the anticipation of something monstrous and unsuspected  the stillness around us became crushing  for a moment the succession of silky undulations ran on innocently i saw each of them swell up the misty line of the horizon far far away beyond the derelict brig and the next moment with a slight friendly toss of our boat it had passed under us and was gone the lulling cadence of the rise and fall the invariable gentleness of this irresistible force the great charm of the deep waters warmed my breast deliciously like the subtle poison of a love potion  but all this lasted only a few soothing seconds before i jumped up too making the boat roll like the veriest landlubber  something startling mysterious hastily confused was taking place  i watched it with incredulous and fascinated awe as one watches the confused swift movements of some deed of violence done in the dark  as if at a given signal the run of the smooth undulations seemed checked suddenly around the brig  by a strange optical delusion the whole sea appeared to rise upon her in one overwhelming heave of its silky surface where in one spot a smother of foam broke out ferociously  and then the effort subsided  it was all over and the smooth swell ran on as before from the horizon in uninterrupted cadence of motion passing under us with a slight friendly toss of our boat  far away where the brig had been an angry white stain undulating on the surface of steelygray waters shot with gleams of green diminished swiftly without a hiss like a patch of pure snow melting in the sun  and the great stillness after this initiation into the seas implacable hate seemed full of dread thoughts and shadows of disaster  gone ejaculated from the depths of his chest my bowman in a final tone  he spat in his hands and took a better grip on his oar  the captain of the brig lowered his rigid arm slowly and looked at our faces in a solemnly conscious silence which called upon us to share in his simpleminded marvelling awe  all at once he sat down by my side and leaned forward earnestly at my boats crew who swinging together in a long easy stroke kept their eyes fixed upon him faithfully  no ship could have done so well he addressed them firmly after a moment of strained silence during which he seemed with trembling lips to seek for words fit to bear such high testimony  she was small but she was good  i had no anxiety  she was strong  last voyage i had my wife and two children in her  no other ship could have stood so long the weather she had to live through for days and days before we got dismasted a fortnight ago  she was fairly worn out and thats all  you may believe me  she lasted under us for days and days but she could not last for ever  it was long enough  i am glad it is over  no better ship was ever left to sink at sea on such a day as this  he was competent to pronounce the funereal oration of a ship this son of ancient seafolk whose national existence so little stained by the excesses of manly virtues had demanded nothing but the merest foothold from the earth  by the merits of his seawise forefathers and by the artlessness of his heart he was made fit to deliver this excellent discourse  there was nothing wanting in its orderly arrangementneither piety nor faith nor the tribute of praise due to the worthy dead with the edifying recital of their achievement  she had lived he had loved her she had suffered and he was glad she was at rest  it was an excellent discourse and it was orthodox too in its fidelity to the cardinal article of a seamans faith of which it was a singleminded confession ships are all right  they are  they who live with the sea have got to hold by that creed first and last and it came to me as i glanced at him sideways that some men were not altogether unworthy in honour and conscience to pronounce the funereal eulogium of a ships constancy in life and death  after this sitting by my side with his looselyclasped hands hanging between his knees he uttered no word made no movement till the shadow of our ships sails fell on the boat when at the loud cheer greeting the return of the victors with their prize he lifted up his troubled face with a faint smile of pathetic indulgence  this smile of the worthy descendant of the most ancient seafolk whose audacity and hardihood had left no trace of greatness and glory upon the waters completed the cycle of my initiation  there was an infinite depth of hereditary wisdom in its pitying sadness  it made the hearty bursts of cheering sound like a childish noise of triumph  our crew shouted with immense confidencehonest souls  as if anybody could ever make sure of having prevailed against the sea which has betrayed so many ships of great name so many proud men so many towering ambitions of fame power wealth greatness  as i brought the boat under the falls my captain in high good humour leaned over spreading his red and freckled elbows on the rail and called down to me sarcastically out of the depths of his cynic philosophers beard  so you have brought the boat back after all have you  sarcasm was his way and the most that can be said for it is that it was natural  this did not make it lovable  but it is decorous and expedient to fall in with ones commanders way  yes  i brought the boat back all right sir i answered  and the good man believed me  it was not for him to discern upon me the marks of my recent initiation  and yet i was not exactly the same youngster who had taken the boat awayall impatience for a race against death with the prize of nine mens lives at the end  already i looked with other eyes upon the sea  i knew it capable of betraying the generous ardour of youth as implacably as indifferent to evil and good it would have betrayed the basest greed or the noblest heroism  my conception of its magnanimous greatness was gone  and i looked upon the true seathe sea that plays with men till their hearts are broken and wears stout ships to death  nothing can touch the brooding bitterness of its heart open to all and faithful to none it exercises its fascination for the undoing of the best  to love it is not well  it knows no bond of plighted troth no fidelity to misfortune to long companionship to long devotion  the promise it holds out perpetually is very great but the only secret of its possession is strength strengththe jealous sleepless strength of a man guarding a coveted treasure within his gates    xxxvii    the cradle of oversea traffic and of the art of naval combats the mediterranean apart from all the associations of adventure and glory the common heritage of all mankind makes a tender appeal to a seaman  it has sheltered the infancy of his craft  he looks upon it as a man may look at a vast nursery in an old old mansion where innumerable generations of his own people have learned to walk  i say his own people because in a sense all sailors belong to one family  all are descended from that adventurous and shaggy ancestor who bestriding a shapeless log and paddling with a crooked branch accomplished the first coastingtrip in a sheltered bay ringing with the admiring howls of his tribe  it is a matter of regret that all those brothers in craft and feeling whose generations have learned to walk a ships deck in that nursery have been also more than once fiercely engaged in cutting each others throats there  but life apparently has such exigencies without human propensity to murder and other sorts of unrighteousness there would have been no historical heroism  it is a consoling reflection  and then if one examines impartially the deeds of violence they appear of but small consequence  from salamis to actium through lepanto and the nile to the naval massacre of navarino not to mention other armed encounters of lesser interest all the blood heroically spilt into the mediterranean has not stained with a single trail of purple the deep azure of its classic waters  of course it may be argued that battles have shaped the destiny of mankind  the question whether they have shaped it well would remain open however  but it would be hardly worth discussing  it is very probable that had the battle of salamis never been fought the face of the world would have been much as we behold it now fashioned by the mediocre inspiration and the shortsighted labours of men  from a long and miserable experience of suffering injustice disgrace and aggression the nations of the earth are mostly swayed by fearfear of the sort that a little cheap oratory turns easily to rage hate and violence  innocent guileless fear has been the cause of many wars  not of course the fear of war itself which in the evolution of sentiments and ideas has come to be regarded at last as a halfmystic and glorious ceremony with certain fashionable rites and preliminary incantations wherein the conception of its true nature has been lost  to apprehend the true aspect force and morality of war as a natural function of mankind one requires a feather in the hair and a ring in the nose or better still teeth filed to a point and a tattooed breast unfortunately a return to such simple ornamentation is impossible we are bound to the chariot of progress  there is no going back and as bad luck would have it our civilization which has done so much for the comfort and adornment of our bodies and the elevation of our minds has made lawful killing frightfully and needlessly expensive  the whole question of improved armaments has been approached by the governments of the earth in a spirit of nervous and unreflecting haste whereas the right way was lying plainly before them and had only to be pursued with calm determination  the learned vigils and labours of a certain class of inventors should have been rewarded with honourable liberality as justice demanded and the bodies of the inventors should have been blown to pieces by means of their own perfected explosives and improved weapons with extreme publicity as the commonest prudence dictated  by this method the ardour of research in that direction would have been restrained without infringing the sacred privileges of science  for the lack of a little cool thinking in our guides and masters this course has not been followed and a beautiful simplicity has been sacrificed for no real advantage  a frugal mind cannot defend itself from considerable bitterness when reflecting that at the battle of actium which was fought for no less a stake than the dominion of the world the fleet of octavianus caesar and the fleet of antonius including the egyptian division and cleopatras galley with purple sails probably cost less than two modern battleships or as the modern naval bookjargon has it two capital units  but no amount of lubberly bookjargon can disguise a fact well calculated to afflict the soul of every sound economist  it is not likely that the mediterranean will ever behold a battle with a greater issue but when the time comes for another historical fight its bottom will be enriched as never before by a quantity of jagged scrapiron paid for at pretty nearly its weight of gold by the deluded populations inhabiting the isles and continents of this planet    xxxviii    happy he who like ulysses has made an adventurous voyage and there is no such sea for adventurous voyages as the mediterranean the inland sea which the ancients looked upon as so vast and so full of wonders  and indeed it was terrible and wonderful for it is we alone who swayed by the audacity of our minds and the tremors of our hearts are the sole artisans of all the wonder and romance of the world  it was for the mediterranean sailors that fairhaired sirens sang among the black rocks seething in white foam and mysterious voices spoke in the darkness above the moving wavevoices menacing seductive or prophetic like that voice heard at the beginning of the christian era by the master of an african vessel in the gulf of syrta whose calm nights are full of strange murmurs and flitting shadows  it called him by name bidding him go and tell all men that the great god pan was dead  but the great legend of the mediterranean the legend of traditional song and grave history lives fascinating and immortal in our minds  the dark and fearful sea of the subtle ulysses wanderings agitated by the wrath of olympian gods harbouring on its isles the fury of strange monsters and the wiles of strange women the highway of heroes and sages of warriors pirates and saints the workaday sea of carthaginian merchants and the pleasure lake of the roman caesars claims the veneration of every seaman as the historical home of that spirit of open defiance against the great waters of the earth which is the very soul of his calling  issuing thence to the west and south as a youth leaves the shelter of his parental house this spirit found the way to the indies discovered the coasts of a new continent and traversed at last the immensity of the great pacific rich in groups of islands remote and mysterious like the constellations of the sky  the first impulse of navigation took its visible form in that tideless basin freed from hidden shoals and treacherous currents as if in tender regard for the infancy of the art  the steep shores of the mediterranean favoured the beginners in one of humanitys most daring enterprises and the enchanting inland sea of classic adventure has led mankind gently from headland to headland from bay to bay from island to island out into the promise of worldwide oceans beyond the pillars of hercules    xxxix    the charm of the mediterranean dwells in the unforgettable flavour of my early days and to this hour this sea upon which the romans alone ruled without dispute has kept for me the fascination of youthful romance  the very first christmas night i ever spent away from land was employed in running before a gulf of lions gale which made the old ship groan in every timber as she skipped before it over the short seas until we brought her to battered and out of breath under the lee of majorca where the smooth water was torn by fierce catspaws under a very stormy sky  weor rather they for i had hardly had two glimpses of salt water in my life till thenkept her standing off and on all that day while i listened for the first time with the curiosity of my tender years to the song of the wind in a ships rigging  the monotonous and vibrating note was destined to grow into the intimacy of the heart pass into blood and bone accompany the thoughts and acts of two full decades remain to haunt like a reproach the peace of the quiet fireside and enter into the very texture of respectable dreams dreamed safely under a roof of rafters and tiles  the wind was fair but that day we ran no more  the thing i will not call her a ship twice in the same halfhour leaked  she leaked fully generously overflowingly all over like a basket  i took an enthusiastic part in the excitement caused by that last infirmity of noble ships without concerning myself much with the why or the wherefore  the surmise of my maturer years is that bored by her interminable life the venerable antiquity was simply yawning with ennui at every seam but at the time i did not know i knew generally very little and least of all what i was doing in that galere  i remember that exactly as in the comedy of moliere my uncle asked the precise question in the very wordsnot of my confidential valet however but across great distances of land in a letter whose mocking but indulgent turn ill concealed his almost paternal anxiety  i fancy i tried to convey to him my utterly unfounded impression that the west indies awaited my coming  i had to go there  it was a sort of mystic convictionsomething in the nature of a call  but it was difficult to state intelligibly the grounds of this belief to that man of rigorous logic if of infinite charity  the truth must have been that all unversed in the arts of the wily greek the deceiver of gods the lover of strange women the evoker of bloodthirsty shades i yet longed for the beginning of my own obscure odyssey which as was proper for a modern should unroll its wonders and terrors beyond the pillars of hercules  the disdainful ocean did not open wide to swallow up my audacity though the ship the ridiculous and ancient galere of my folly the old weary disenchanted sugarwaggon seemed extremely disposed to open out and swallow up as much salt water as she could hold this if less grandiose would have been as final a catastrophe  but no catastrophe occurred  i lived to watch on a strange shore a black and youthful nausicaa with a joyous train of attendant maidens carrying baskets of linen to a clear stream overhung by the heads of slender palmtrees  the vivid colours of their draped raiment and the gold of their earrings invested with a barbaric and regal magnificence their figures stepping out freely in a shower of broken sunshine  the whiteness of their teeth was still more dazzling than the splendour of jewels at their ears  the shaded side of the ravine gleamed with their smiles  they were as unabashed as so many princesses but alas not one of them was the daughter of a jetblack sovereign  such was my abominable luck in being born by the mere hairs breadth of twentyfive centuries too late into a world where kings have been growing scarce with scandalous rapidity while the few who remain have adopted the uninteresting manners and customs of simple millionaires obviously it was a vain hope in 187 to see the ladies of a royal household walk in chequered sunshine with baskets of linen on their heads to the banks of a clear stream overhung by the starry fronds of palmtrees  it was a vain hope  if i did not ask myself whether limited by such discouraging impossibilities life were still worth living it was only because i had then before me several other pressing questions some of which have remained unanswered to this day  the resonant laughing voices of these gorgeous maidens scared away the multitude of hummingbirds whose delicate wings wreathed with the mist of their vibration the tops of flowering bushes  no they were not princesses  their unrestrained laughter filling the hot fernclad ravine had a soulless limpidity as of wild inhuman dwellers in tropical woodlands  following the example of certain prudent travellers i withdrew unseenand returned not much wiser to the mediterranean the sea of classic adventures    xl    it was written that there in the nursery of our navigating ancestors i should learn to walk in the ways of my craft and grow in the love of the sea blind as young love often is but absorbing and disinterested as all true love must be  i demanded nothing from itnot even adventure  in this i showed perhaps more intuitive wisdom than high selfdenial  no adventure ever came to one for the asking  he who starts on a deliberate quest of adventure goes forth but to gather deadsea fruit unless indeed he be beloved of the gods and great amongst heroes like that most excellent cavalier don quixote de la mancha  by us ordinary mortals of a mediocre animus that is only too anxious to pass by wicked giants for so many honest windmills adventures are entertained like visiting angels  they come upon our complacency unawares  as unbidden guests are apt to do they often come at inconvenient times  and we are glad to let them go unrecognised without any acknowledgment of so high a favour  after many years on looking back from the middle turn of lifes way at the events of the past which like a friendly crowd seem to gaze sadly after us hastening towards the cimmerian shore we may see here and there in the gray throng some figure glowing with a faint radiance as though it had caught all the light of our already crepuscular sky and by this glow we may recognise the faces of our true adventures of the once unbidden guests entertained unawares in our young days  if the mediterranean the venerable and sometimes atrociously ill tempered nurse of all navigators was to rock my youth the providing of the cradle necessary for that operation was entrusted by fate to the most casual assemblage of irresponsible young men all however older than myself that as if drunk with provencal sunshine frittered life away in joyous levity on the model of balzacs histoire des treize qualified by a dash of romance de cape et depee  she who was my cradle in those years had been built on the river of savona by a famous builder of boats was rigged in corsica by another good man and was described on her papers as a tartane of sixty tons  in reality she was a true balancelle with two short masts raking forward and two curved yards each as long as her hull a true child of the latin lake with a spread of two enormous sails resembling the pointed wings on a seabirds slender body and herself like a bird indeed skimming rather than sailing the seas  her name was the tremolino  how is this to be translated  the quiverer  what a name to give the pluckiest little craft that ever dipped her sides in angry foam  i had felt her it is true trembling for nights and days together under my feet but it was with the highstrung tenseness of her faithful courage  in her short but brilliant career she has taught me nothing but she has given me everything  i owe to her the awakened love for the sea that with the quivering of her swift little body and the humming of the wind under the foot of her lateen sails stole into my heart with a sort of gentle violence and brought my imagination under its despotic sway  the tremolino  to this day i cannot utter or even write that name without a strange tightening of the breast and the gasp of mingled delight and dread of ones first passionate experience    xli    we four formed to use a term well understood nowadays in every social sphere a syndicate owning the tremolino  an international and astonishing syndicate  and we were all ardent royalists of the snowwhite legitimist complexionheaven only knows why  in all associations of men there is generally one who by the authority of age and of a more experienced wisdom imparts a collective character to the whole set  if i mention that the oldest of us was very old extremely oldnearly thirty years old and that he used to declare with gallant carelessness i live by my sword i think i have given enough information on the score of our collective wisdom  he was a north carolinian gentleman j m k b were the initials of his name and he really did live by the sword as far as i know  he died by it too later on in a balkanian squabble in the cause of some serbs or else bulgarians who were neither catholics nor gentlemenat least not in the exalted but narrow sense he attached to that last word  poor j m k b americain catholique et gentilhomme as he was disposed to describe himself in moments of lofty expansion  are there still to be found in europe gentlemen keen of face and elegantly slight of body of distinguished aspect with a fascinating drawingroom manner and with a dark fatal glance who live by their swords i wonder  his family had been ruined in the civil war i fancy and seems for a decade or so to have led a wandering life in the old world  as to henry c the next in age and wisdom of our band he had broken loose from the unyielding rigidity of his family solidly rooted if i remember rightly in a welltodo london suburb  on their respectable authority he introduced himself meekly to strangers as a black sheep  i have never seen a more guileless specimen of an outcast  never  however his people had the grace to send him a little money now and then  enamoured of the south of provence of its people its life its sunshine and its poetry narrowchested tall and short sighted he strode along the streets and the lanes his long feet projecting far in advance of his body and his white nose and gingery moustache buried in an open book  for he had the habit of reading as he walked  how he avoided falling into precipices off the quays or down staircases is a great mystery  the sides of his overcoat bulged out with pocket editions of various poets  when not engaged in reading virgil homer or mistral in parks restaurants streets and suchlike public places he indited sonnets in french to the eyes ears chin hair and other visible perfections of a nymph called therese the daughter honesty compels me to state of a certain madame leonore who kept a small cafe for sailors in one of the narrowest streets of the old town  no more charming face clearcut like an antique gem and delicate in colouring like the petal of a flower had ever been set on alas a somewhat squat body  he read his verses aloud to her in the very cafe with the innocence of a little child and the vanity of a poet  we followed him there willingly enough if only to watch the divine therese laugh under the vigilant black eyes of madame leonore her mother  she laughed very prettily not so much at the sonnets which she could not but esteem as at poor henrys french accent which was unique resembling the warbling of birds if birds ever warbled with a stuttering nasal intonation  our third partner was roger p de la s the most scandinavian looking of provencal squires fair and six feet high as became a descendant of searoving northmen authoritative incisive wittily scornful with a comedy in three acts in his pocket and in his breast a heart blighted by a hopeless passion for his beautiful cousin married to a wealthy hide and tallow merchant  he used to take us to lunch at their house without ceremony  i admired the good ladys sweet patience  the husband was a conciliatory soul with a great fund of resignation which he expended on rogers friends  i suspect he was secretly horrified at these invasions but it was a carlist salon and as such we were made welcome  the possibility of raising catalonia in the interest of the rey netto who had just then crossed the pyrenees was much discussed there  don carlos no doubt must have had many queer friends it is the common lot of all pretenders but amongst them none more extravagantly fantastic than the tremolino syndicate which used to meet in a tavern on the quays of the old port  the antique city of massilia had surely never since the days of the earliest phoenicians known an odder set of shipowners  we met to discuss and settle the plan of operations for each voyage of the tremolino in these operations a bankinghouse too was concerneda very respectable bankinghouse  but i am afraid i shall end by saying too much  ladies too were concerned i am really afraid i am saying too muchall sorts of ladies some old enough to know better than to put their trust in princes others young and full of illusions  one of these last was extremely amusing in the imitations she gave us in confidence of various highlyplaced personages she was perpetually rushing off to paris to interview in the interests of the causepor el rey  for she was a carlist and of basque blood at that with something of a lioness in the expression of her courageous face especially when she let her hair down and with the volatile little soul of a sparrow dressed in fine parisian feathers which had the trick of coming off disconcertingly at unexpected moments  but her imitations of a parisian personage very highly placed indeed as she represented him standing in the corner of a room with his face to the wall rubbing the back of his head and moaning helplessly rita you are the death of me were enough to make one if young and free from cares split ones sides laughing  she had an uncle still living a very effective carlist too the priest of a little mountain parish in guipuzcoa  as the seagoing member of the syndicate whose plans depended greatly on dona ritas information i used to be charged with humbly affectionate messages for the old man  these messages i was supposed to deliver to the arragonese muleteers who were sure to await at certain times the tremolino in the neighbourhood of the gulf of rosas for faithful transportation inland together with the various unlawful goods landed secretly from under the tremolinos hatches  well now i have really let out too much as i feared i should in the end as to the usual contents of my seacradle  but let it stand  and if anybody remarks cynically that i must have been a promising infant in those days let that stand too  i am concerned but for the good name of the tremolino and i affirm that a ship is ever guiltless of the sins transgressions and follies of her men    xlii    it was not tremolinos fault that the syndicate depended so much on the wit and wisdom and the information of dona rita  she had taken a little furnished house on the prado for the good of the cause por el rey  she was always taking little houses for somebodys good for the sick or the sorry for brokendown artists cleaned out gamblers temporarily unlucky speculatorsvieux amisold friends as she used to explain apologetically with a shrug of her fine shoulders  whether don carlos was one of the old friends too its hard to say  more unlikely things have been heard of in smokingrooms all i know is that one evening entering incautiously the salon of the little house just after the news of a considerable carlist success had reached the faithful i was seized round the neck and waist and whirled recklessly three times round the room to the crash of upsetting furniture and the humming of a valse tune in a warm contralto voice  when released from the dizzy embrace i sat down on the carpet suddenly without affectation  in this unpretentious attitude i became aware that j m k b had followed me into the room elegant fatal correct and severe in a white tie and large shirt front  in answer to his politely sinister prolonged glance of inquiry i overheard dona rita murmuring with some confusion and annoyance vous etes bete mon cher  voyons  ca na aucune consequence  well content in this case to be of no particular consequence i had already about me the elements of some worldly sense  rearranging my collar which truth to say ought to have been a round one above a short jacket but was not i observed felicitously that i had come to say goodbye being ready to go off to sea that very night with the tremolino  our hostess slightly panting yet and just a shade dishevelled turned tartly upon j m k b desiring to know when he would be ready to go off by the tremolino or in any other way in order to join the royal headquarters  did he intend she asked ironically to wait for the very eve of the entry into madrid  thus by a judicious exercise of tact and asperity we reestablished the atmospheric equilibrium of the room long before i left them a little before midnight now tenderly reconciled to walk down to the harbour and hail the tremolino by the usual soft whistle from the edge of the quay  it was our signal invariably heard by the everwatchful dominic the padrone  he would raise a lantern silently to light my steps along the narrow springy plank of our primitive gangway  and so we are going off he would murmur directly my foot touched the deck  i was the harbinger of sudden departures but there was nothing in the world sudden enough to take dominic unawares  his thick black moustaches curled every morning with hot tongs by the barber at the corner of the quay seemed to hide a perpetual smile  but nobody i believe had ever seen the true shape of his lips  from the slow imperturbable gravity of that broadchested man you would think he had never smiled in his life  in his eyes lurked a look of perfectly remorseless irony as though he had been provided with an extremely experienced soul and the slightest distension of his nostrils would give to his bronzed face a look of extraordinary boldness  this was the only play of feature of which he seemed capable being a southerner of a concentrated deliberate type his ebony hair curled slightly on the temples  he may have been forty years old and he was a great voyager on the inland sea  astute and ruthless he could have rivalled in resource the unfortunate son of laertes and anticlea  if he did not pit his craft and audacity against the very gods it is only because the olympian gods are dead  certainly no woman could frighten him  a oneeyed giant would not have had the ghost of a chance against dominic cervoni of corsica not ithaca and no king son of kings but of very respectable familyauthentic caporali he affirmed but that is as it may be  the caporali families date back to the twelfth century  for want of more exalted adversaries dominic turned his audacity fertile in impious stratagems against the powers of the earth as represented by the institution of customhouses and every mortal belonging theretoscribes officers and guardacostas afloat and ashore  he was the very man for us this modern and unlawful wanderer with his own legend of loves dangers and bloodshed  he told us bits of it sometimes in measured ironic tones  he spoke catalonian the italian of corsica and the french of provence with the same easy naturalness  dressed in shoretogs a white starched shirt black jacket and round hat as i took him once to see dona rita he was extremely presentable  he could make himself interesting by a tactful and rugged reserve set off by a grim almost imperceptible playfulness of tone and manner  he had the physical assurance of stronghearted men  after half an hours interview in the diningroom during which they got in touch with each other in an amazing way rita told us in her best grande dame manner  mais il esi parfait cet homme  he was perfect on board the tremolino wrapped up in a black caban the picturesque cloak of mediterranean seamen with those massive moustaches and his remorseless eyes set off by the shadow of the deep hood he looked piratical and monkish and darkly initiated into the most awful mysteries of the sea    xliii    anyway he was perfect as dona rita had declared  the only thing unsatisfactory and even inexplicable about our dominic was his nephew cesar  it was startling to see a desolate expression of shame veil the remorseless audacity in the eyes of that man superior to all scruples and terrors  i would never have dared to bring him on board your balancelle he once apologized to me  but what am i to do  his mother is dead and my brother has gone into the bush  in this way i learned that our dominic had a brother  as to going into the bush this only means that a man has done his duty successfully in the pursuit of a hereditary vendetta  the feud which had existed for ages between the families of cervoni and brunaschi was so old that it seemed to have smouldered out at last one evening pietro brunaschi after a laborious day amongst his olivetrees sat on a chair against the wall of his house with a bowl of broth on his knees and a piece of bread in his hand dominics brother going home with a gun on his shoulder found a sudden offence in this picture of content and rest so obviously calculated to awaken the feelings of hatred and revenge  he and pietro had never had any personal quarrel but as dominic explained all our dead cried out to him  he shouted from behind a wall of stones o pietro  behold what is coming  and as the other looked up innocently he took aim at the forehead and squared the old vendetta account so neatly that according to dominic the dead man continued to sit with the bowl of broth on his knees and the piece of bread in his hand  this is whybecause in corsica your dead will not leave you alone dominics brother had to go into the maquis into the bush on the wild mountainside to dodge the gendarmes for the insignificant remainder of his life and dominic had charge of his nephew with a mission to make a man of him  no more unpromising undertaking could be imagined  the very material for the task seemed wanting  the cervonis if not handsome men were good sturdy flesh and blood  but this extraordinarily lean and livid youth seemed to have no more blood in him than a snail  some cursed witch must have stolen my brothers child from the cradle and put that spawn of a starved devil in its place dominic would say to me  look at him  just look at him  to look at cesar was not pleasant  his parchment skin showing dead white on his cranium through the thin wisps of dirty brown hair seemed to be glued directly and tightly upon his big bones without being in any way deformed he was the nearest approach which i have ever seen or could imagine to what is commonly understood by the word monster  that the source of the effect produced was really moral i have no doubt  an utterly hopelessly depraved nature was expressed in physical terms that taken each separately had nothing positively startling  you imagined him clammily cold to the touch like a snake  the slightest reproof the most mild and justifiable remonstrance would be met by a resentful glare and an evil shrinking of his thin dry upper lip a snarl of hate to which he generally added the agreeable sound of grinding teeth  it was for this venomous performance rather than for his lies impudence and laziness that his uncle used to knock him down  it must not be imagined that it was anything in the nature of a brutal assault  dominics brawny arm would be seen describing deliberately an ample horizontal gesture a dignified sweep and cesar would go over suddenly like a ninepinwhich was funny to see  but once down he would writhe on the deck gnashing his teeth in impotent ragewhich was pretty horrible to behold  and it also happened more than once that he would disappear completely which was startling to observe  this is the exact truth  before some of these majestic cuffs cesar would go down and vanish  he would vanish heels overhead into open hatchways into scuttles behind upended casks according to the place where he happened to come into contact with his uncles mighty arm  onceit was in the old harbour just before the tremolinos last voyagehe vanished thus overboard to my infinite consternation dominic and i had been talking business together aft and cesar had sneaked up behind us to listen for amongst his other perfections he was a consummate eavesdropper and spy  at the sound of the heavy plop alongside horror held me rooted to the spot but dominic stepped quietly to the rail and leaned over waiting for his nephews miserable head to bob up for the first time  ohe cesar he yelled contemptuously to the spluttering wretch catch hold of that mooring hawsercharogne  he approached me to resume the interrupted conversation  what about cesar i asked anxiously  canallia  let him hang there was his answer  and he went on talking over the business in hand calmly while i tried vainly to dismiss from my mind the picture of cesar steeped to the chin in the water of the old harbour a decoction of centuries of marine refuse  i tried to dismiss it because the mere notion of that liquid made me feel very sick  presently dominic hailing an idle boatman directed him to go and fish his nephew out and byandby cesar appeared walking on board from the quay shivering streaming with filthy water with bits of rotten straws in his hair and a piece of dirty orangepeel stranded on his shoulder  his teeth chattered his yellow eyes squinted balefully at us as he passed forward  i thought it my duty to remonstrate  why are you always knocking him about dominic i asked  indeed i felt convinced it was no earthly gooda sheer waste of muscular force  i must try to make a man of him dominic answered hopelessly  i restrained the obvious retort that in this way he ran the risk of making in the words of the immortal mr mantalini a demnition damp unpleasant corpse of him  he wants to be a locksmith burst out cervoni  to learn how to pick locks i suppose he added with sardonic bitterness  why not let him be a locksmith i ventured  who would teach him he cried  where could i leave him he asked with a drop in his voice and i had my first glimpse of genuine despair  he steals you know alas  par ta madonne  i believe he would put poison in your food and minethe viper  he raised his face and both his clenched fists slowly to heaven however cesar never dropped poison into our cups  one cannot be sure but i fancy he went to work in another way  this voyage of which the details need not be given we had to range far afield for sufficient reasons  coming up from the south to end it with the important and really dangerous part of the scheme in hand we found it necessary to look into barcelona for certain definite information  this appears like running ones head into the very jaws of the lion but in reality it was not so  we had one or two high influential friends there and many others humble but valuable because bought for good hard cash  we were in no danger of being molested indeed the important information reached us promptly by the hands of a customhouse officer who came on board full of showy zeal to poke an iron rod into the layer of oranges which made the visible part of our cargo in the hatchway  i forgot to mention before that the tremolino was officially known as a fruit and corkwood trader  the zealous officer managed to slip a useful piece of paper into dominics hand as he went ashore and a few hours afterwards being off duty he returned on board again athirst for drinks and gratitude  he got both as a matter of course  while he sat sipping his liqueur in the tiny cabin dominic plied him with questions as to the whereabouts of the guardacostas  the preventive service afloat was really the one for us to reckon with and it was material for our success and safety to know the exact position of the patrol craft in the neighbourhood  the news could not have been more favourable  the officer mentioned a small place on the coast some twelve miles off where unsuspicious and unready she was lying at anchor with her sails unbent painting yards and scraping spars  then he left us after the usual compliments smirking reassurringly over his shoulder  i had kept below pretty close all day from excess of prudence  the stake played on that trip was big  we are ready to go at once but for cesar who has been missing ever since breakfast announced dominic to me in his slow grim way  where the fellow had gone and why we could not imagine  the usual surmises in the case of a missing seaman did not apply to cesars absence  he was too odious for love friendship gambling or even casual intercourse  but once or twice he had wandered away like this before  dominic went ashore to look for him but returned at the end of two hours alone and very angry as i could see by the token of the invisible smile under his moustache being intensified  we wondered what had become of the wretch and made a hurried investigation amongst our portable property  he had stolen nothing  he will be back before long i said confidently  ten minutes afterwards one of the men on deck called out loudly  i can see him coming  cesar had only his shirt and trousers on  he had sold his coat apparently for pocketmoney  you knave was all dominic said with a terrible softness of voice  he restrained his choler for a time  where have you been vagabond he asked menacingly  nothing would induce cesar to answer that question  it was as if he even disdained to lie  he faced us drawing back his lips and gnashing his teeth and did not shrink an inch before the sweep of dominics arm  he went down as if shot of course  but this time i noticed that when picking himself up he remained longer than usual on all fours baring his big teeth over his shoulder and glaring upwards at his uncle with a new sort of hate in his round yellow eyes  that permanent sentiment seemed pointed at that moment by especial malice and curiosity  i became quite interested  if he ever manages to put poison in the dishes i thought to myself this is how he will look at us as we sit at our meal  but i did not of course believe for a moment that he would ever put poison in our food  he ate the same things himself moreover he had no poison  and i could not imagine a human being so blinded by cupidity as to sell poison to such an atrocious creature    xliv    we slipped out to sea quietly at dusk and all through the night everything went well  the breeze was gusty a southerly blow was making up  it was fair wind for our course  now and then dominic slowly and rhythmically struck his hands together a few times as if applauding the performance of the tremolino  the balancelle hummed and quivered as she flew along dancing lightly under our feet  at daybreak i pointed out to dominic amongst the several sail in view running before the gathering storm one particular vessel the press of canvas she carried made her loom up high endon like a gray column standing motionless directly in our wake  look at this fellow dominic i said  he seems to be in a hurry  the padrone made no remark but wrapping his black cloak close about him stood up to look  his weathertanned face framed in the hood had an aspect of authority and challenging force with the deepset eyes gazing far away fixedly without a wink like the intent merciless steady eyes of a seabird  chi va piano va sano he remarked at last with a derisive glance over the side in ironic allusion to our own tremendous speed  the tremolino was doing her best and seemed to hardly touch the great burst of foam over which she darted  i crouched down again to get some shelter from the low bulwark  after more than half an hour of swaying immobility expressing a concentrated breathless watchfulness dominic sank on the deck by my side  within the monkish cowl his eyes gleamed with a fierce expression which surprised me  all he said was  he has come out here to wash the new paint off his yards i suppose  what i shouted getting up on my knees  is she the guardacosta  the perpetual suggestion of a smile under dominics piratical moustaches seemed to become more accentuatedquite real grim actually almost visible through the wet and uncurled hair  judging by that symptom he must have been in a towering rage  but i could also see that he was puzzled and that discovery affected me disagreeably  dominic puzzled  for a long time leaning against the bulwark i gazed over the stern at the gray column that seemed to stand swaying slightly in our wake always at the same distance  meanwhile dominic black and cowled sat crosslegged on the deck with his back to the wind recalling vaguely an arab chief in his burnuss sitting on the sand  above his motionless figure the little cord and tassel on the stiff point of the hood swung about inanely in the gale  at last i gave up facing the wind and rain and crouched down by his side  i was satisfied that the sail was a patrol craft  her presence was not a thing to talk about but soon between two clouds charged with hailshowers a burst of sunshine fell upon her sails and our men discovered her character for themselves  from that moment i noticed that they seemed to take no heed of each other or of anything else  they could spare no eyes and no thought but for the slight columnshape astern of us  its swaying had become perceptible  for a moment she remained dazzlingly white then faded away slowly to nothing in a squall only to reappear again nearly black resembling a post stuck upright against the slaty background of solid cloud  since first noticed she had not gained on us a foot  she will never catch the tremolino i said exultingly  dominic did not look at me  he remarked absently but justly that the heavy weather was in our pursuers favour  she was three times our size  what we had to do was to keep our distance till dark which we could manage easily and then haul off to seaward and consider the situation  but his thoughts seemed to stumble in the darkness of some notsolved enigma and soon he fell silent  we ran steadily wingandwing  cape san sebastian nearly ahead seemed to recede from us in the squalls of rain and come out again to meet our rush every time more distinct between the showers  for my part i was by no means certain that this gabelou as our men alluded to her opprobriously was after us at all  there were nautical difficulties in such a view which made me express the sanguine opinion that she was in all innocence simply changing her station  at this dominic condescended to turn his head  i tell you she is in chase he affirmed moodily after one short glance astern  i never doubted his opinion  but with all the ardour of a neophyte and the pride of an apt learner i was at that time a great nautical casuist  what i cant understand i insisted subtly is how on earth with this wind she has managed to be just where she was when we first made her out  it is clear that she could not and did not gain twelve miles on us during the night  and there are other impossibilities     dominic had been sitting motionless like an inanimate black cone posed on the stern deck near the rudderhead with a small tassel fluttering on its sharp point and for a time he preserved the immobility of his meditation  then bending over with a short laugh he gave my ear the bitter fruit of it  he understood everything now perfectly  she was where we had seen her first not because she had caught us up but because we had passed her during the night while she was already waiting for us hoveto most likely on our very track  do you understandalready dominic muttered in a fierce undertone  already  you know we left a good eight hours before we were expected to leave otherwise she would have been in time to lie in wait for us on the other side of the cape andhe snapped his teeth like a wolf close to my faceand she would have had us likethat  i saw it all plainly enough now  they had eyes in their heads and all their wits about them in that craft  we had passed them in the dark as they jogged on easily towards their ambush with the idea that we were yet far behind  at daylight however sighting a balancelle ahead under a press of canvas they had made sail in chase  but if that was so then  dominic seized my arm  yes yes  she came out on an informationdo you see iton information    we have been soldbetrayed  why  how  what for  we always paid them all so well on shore    no  but it is my head that is going to burst  he seemed to choke tugged at the throat button of the cloak jumped up openmouthed as if to hurl curses and denunciation but instantly mastered himself and wrapping up the cloak closer about him sat down on the deck again as quiet as ever  yes it must be the work of some scoundrel ashore i observed  he pulled the edge of the hood well forward over his brow before he muttered  a scoundrel    yes    its evident  well i said they cant get us thats clear  no he assented quietly they cannot  we shaved the cape very close to avoid an adverse current  on the other side by the effect of the land the wind failed us so completely for a moment that the tremolinos two great lofty sails hung idle to the masts in the thundering uproar of the seas breaking upon the shore we had left behind  and when the returning gust filled them again we saw with amazement half of the new mainsail which we thought fit to drive the boat under before giving way absolutely fly out of the boltropes  we lowered the yard at once and saved it all but it was no longer a sail it was only a heap of soaked strips of canvas cumbering the deck and weighting the craft  dominic gave the order to throw the whole lot overboard  i would have had the yard thrown overboard too he said leading me aft again if it had not been for the trouble  let no sign escape you he continued lowering his voice but i am going to tell you something terrible  listen  i have observed that the roping stitches on that sail have been cut  you hear  cut with a knife in many places  and yet it stood all that time  not enough cut  that flap did it at last  what matters it  but look theres treachery seated on this very deck  by the horns of the devil seated here at our very backs  do not turn signorine  we were facing aft then  whats to be done i asked appalled  nothing  silence  be a man signorine  what else i said  to show i could be a man i resolved to utter no sound as long as dominic himself had the force to keep his lips closed  nothing but silence becomes certain situations  moreover the experience of treachery seemed to spread a hopeless drowsiness over my thoughts and senses  for an hour or more we watched our pursuer surging out nearer and nearer from amongst the squalls that sometimes hid her altogether  but even when not seen we felt her there like a knife at our throats  she gained on us frightfully  and the tremolino in a fierce breeze and in much smoother water swung on easily under her one sail with something appallingly careless in the joyous freedom of her motion  another halfhour went by  i could not stand it any longer  they will get the poor barky i stammered out suddenly almost on the verge of tears  dominic stirred no more than a carving  a sense of catastrophic loneliness overcame my inexperienced soul  the vision of my companions passed before me  the whole royalist gang was in monte carlo now i reckoned  and they appeared to me clearcut and very small with affected voices and stiff gestures like a procession of rigid marionettes upon a toy stage  i gave a start  what was this  a mysterious remorseless whisper came from within the motionless black hood at my side  il faul la tuer  i heard it very well  what do you say dominic i asked moving nothing but my lips  and the whisper within the hood repeated mysteriously she must be killed  my heart began to beat violently  thats it i faltered out  but how  you love her well  i do  then you must find the heart for that work too  you must steer her yourself and i shall see to it that she dies quickly without leaving as much as a chip behind  can you i murmured fascinated by the black hood turned immovably over the stern as if in unlawful communion with that old sea of magicians slavedealers exiles and warriors the sea of legends and terrors where the mariners of remote antiquity used to hear the restless shade of an old wanderer weep aloud in the dark  i know a rock whispered the initiated voice within the hood secretly  butcaution  it must be done before our men perceive what we are about  whom can we trust now  a knife drawn across the fore halyards would bring the foresail down and put an end to our liberty in twenty minutes  and the best of our men may be afraid of drowning  there is our little boat but in an affair like this no one can be sure of being saved  the voice ceased  we had started from barcelona with our dinghy in tow afterwards it was too risky to try to get her in so we let her take her chance of the seas at the end of a comfortable scope of rope  many times she had seemed to us completely overwhelmed but soon we would see her bob up again on a wave apparently as buoyant and whole as ever  i understand i said softly  very well dominic  when  not yet  we must get a little more in first answered the voice from the hood in a ghostly murmur    xlv    it was settled  i had now the courage to turn about  our men crouched about the decks here and there with anxious crestfallen faces all turned one way to watch the chaser  for the first time that morning i perceived cesar stretched out full length on the deck near the foremast and wondered where he had been skulking till then  but he might in truth have been at my elbow all the time for all i knew  we had been too absorbed in watching our fate to pay attention to each other  nobody had eaten anything that morning but the men had been coming constantly to drink at the waterbutt  i ran down to the cabin  i had there put away in a locker ten thousand francs in gold of whose presence on board so far as i was aware not a soul except dominic had the slightest inkling  when i emerged on deck again dominic had turned about and was peering from under his cowl at the coast  cape creux closed the view ahead  to the left a wide bay its waters torn and swept by fierce squalls seemed full of smoke  astern the sky had a menacing look  directly he saw me dominic in a placid tone wanted to know what was the matter  i came close to him and looking as unconcerned as i could told him in an undertone that i had found the locker broken open and the moneybelt gone  last evening it was still there  what did you want to do with it he asked me trembling violently  put it round my waist of course i answered amazed to hear his teeth chattering  cursed gold he muttered  the weight of the money might have cost you your life perhaps  he shuddered  there is no time to talk about that now  i am ready  not yet  i am waiting for that squall to come over he muttered and a few leaden minutes passed  the squall came over at last  our pursuer overtaken by a sort of murky whirlwind disappeared from our sight  the tremolino quivered and bounded forward  the land ahead vanished too and we seemed to be left alone in a world of water and wind  prenez la barre monsieur dominic broke the silence suddenly in an austere voice  take hold of the tiller  he bent his hood to my ear  the balancelle is yours  your own hands must deal the blow  ii have yet another piece of work to do  he spoke up loudly to the man who steered  let the signorino take the tiller and you with the others stand by to haul the boat alongside quickly at the word  the man obeyed surprised but silent  the others stirred and pricked up their ears at this  i heard their murmurs  what now are we going to run in somewhere and take to our heels  the padrone knows what he is doing  dominic went forward  he paused to look down at cesar who as i have said before was lying full length face down by the foremast then stepped over him and dived out of my sight under the foresail  i saw nothing ahead  it was impossible for me to see anything except the foresail open and still like a great shadowy wing  but dominic had his bearings  his voice came to me from forward in a just audible cry  now signorino  i bore on the tiller as instructed before  again i heard him faintly and then i had only to hold her straight  no ship ran so joyously to her death before  she rose and fell as if floating in space and darted forward whizzing like an arrow  dominic stooping under the foot of the foresail reappeared and stood steadying himself against the mast with a raised forefinger in an attitude of expectant attention  a second before the shock his arm fell down by his side  at that i set my teeth  and then  talk of splintered planks and smashed timbers  this shipwreck lies upon my soul with the dread and horror of a homicide with the unforgettable remorse of having crushed a living faithful heart at a single blow  at one moment the rush and the soaring swing of speed the next a crash and death stillnessa moment of horrible immobility with the song of the wind changed to a strident wail and the heavy waters boiling up menacing and sluggish around the corpse  i saw in a distracting minute the foreyard fly fore and aft with a brutal swing the men all in a heap cursing with fear and hauling frantically at the line of the boat  with a strange welcoming of the familiar i saw also cesar amongst them and recognised dominics old wellknown effective gesture the horizontal sweep of his powerful arm  i recollect distinctly saying to myself cesar must go down of course and then as i was scrambling on all fours the swinging tiller i had let go caught me a crack under the ear and knocked me over senseless  i dont think i was actually unconscious for more than a few minutes but when i came to myself the dinghy was driving before the wind into a sheltered cove two men just keeping her straight with their oars  dominic with his arm round my shoulders supported me in the sternsheets  we landed in a familiar part of the country  dominic took one of the boats oars with him  i suppose he was thinking of the stream we would have presently to cross on which there was a miserable specimen of a punt often robbed of its pole  but first of all we had to ascend the ridge of land at the back of the cape  he helped me up  i was dizzy  my head felt very large and heavy  at the top of the ascent i clung to him and we stopped to rest  to the right below us the wide smoky bay was empty  dominic had kept his word  there was not a chip to be seen around the black rock from which the tremolino with her plucky heart crushed at one blow had slipped off into deep water to her eternal rest  the vastness of the open sea was smothered in driving mists and in the centre of the thinning squall phantomlike under a frightful press of canvas the unconscious guardacosta dashed on still chasing to the northward  our men were already descending the reverse slope to look for that punt which we knew from experience was not always to be found easily  i looked after them with dazed misty eyes  one two three four  dominic wheres cesar i cried  as if repulsing the very sound of the name the padrone made that ample sweeping knockingdown gesture  i stepped back a pace and stared at him fearfully  his open shirt uncovered his muscular neck and the thick hair on his chest  he planted the oar upright in the soft soil and rolling up slowly his right sleeve extended the bare arm before my face  this he began with an extreme deliberation whose superhuman restraint vibrated with the suppressed violence of his feelings is the arm which delivered the blow  i am afraid it is your own gold that did the rest  i forgot all about your money  he clasped his hands together in sudden distress  i forgot i forgot he repeated disconsolately  cesar stole the belt i stammered out bewildered  and who else  canallia  he must have been spying on you for days  and he did the whole thing  absent all day in barcelona traditore  sold his jacketto hire a horse  ha ha  a good affair  i tell you it was he who set him at us     dominic pointed at the sea where the guardacosta was a mere dark speck  his chin dropped on his breast     on information he murmured in a gloomy voice  a cervoni  oh my poor brother     and you drowned him i said feebly  i struck once and the wretch went down like a stonewith the gold  yes  but he had time to read in my eyes that nothing could save him while i was alive  and had i not the righti dominic cervoni padrone who brought him aboard your felluccamy nephew a traitor  he pulled the oar out of the ground and helped me carefully down the slope  all the time he never once looked me in the face  he punted us over then shouldered the oar again and waited till our men were at some distance before he offered me his arm  after we had gone a little way the fishing hamlet we were making for came into view  dominic stopped  do you think you can make your way as far as the houses by yourself he asked me quietly  yes i think so  but why  where are you going dominic  anywhere  what a question  signorino you are but little more than a boy to ask such a question of a man having this tale in his family  ah  traditore  what made me ever own that spawn of a hungry devil for our own blood  thief cheat coward liarother men can deal with that  but i was his uncle and so    i wish he had poisoned mecharogne  but this  that i a confidential man and a corsican should have to ask your pardon for bringing on board your vessel of which i was padrone a cervoni who has betrayed youa traitorthat is too much  it is too much  well i beg your pardon and you may spit in dominics face because a traitor of our blood taints us all  a theft may be made good between men a lie may be set right a death avenged but what can one do to atone for a treachery like this    nothing  he turned and walked away from me along the bank of the stream flourishing a vengeful arm and repeating to himself slowly with savage emphasis  ah  canaille  canaille  canaille    he left me there trembling with weakness and mute with awe  unable to make a sound i gazed after the strangely desolate figure of that seaman carrying an oar on his shoulder up a barren rockstrewn ravine under the dreary leaden sky of tremolinos last day  thus walking deliberately with his back to the sea dominic vanished from my sight  with the quality of our desires thoughts and wonder proportioned to our infinite littleness we measure even time itself by our own stature  imprisoned in the house of personal illusions thirty centuries in mankinds history seem less to look back upon than thirty years of our own life  and dominic cervoni takes his place in my memory by the side of the legendary wanderer on the sea of marvels and terrors by the side of the fatal and impious adventurer to whom the evoked shade of the soothsayer predicted a journey inland with an oar on his shoulder till he met men who had never set eyes on ships and oars  it seems to me i can see them side by side in the twilight of an arid land the unfortunate possessors of the secret lore of the sea bearing the emblem of their hard calling on their shoulders surrounded by silent and curious men  even as i too having turned my back upon the sea am bearing those few pages in the twilight with the hope of finding in an inland valley the silent welcome of some patient listener    xlvi    a fellow has now no chance of promotion unless he jumps into the muzzle of a gun and crawls out of the touchhole  he who a hundred years ago more or less pronounced the above words in the uneasiness of his heart thirsting for professional distinction was a young naval officer  of his life career achievements and end nothing is preserved for the edification of his young successors in the fleet of todaynothing but this phrase which sailorlike in the simplicity of personal sentiment and strength of graphic expression embodies the spirit of the epoch  this obscure but vigorous testimony has its price its significance and its lesson  it comes to us from a worthy ancestor  we do not know whether he lived long enough for a chance of that promotion whose way was so arduous  he belongs to the great array of the unknownwho are great indeed by the sum total of the devoted effort put out and the colossal scale of success attained by their insatiable and steadfast ambition  we do not know his name we only know of him what is material for us to know that he was never backward on occasions of desperate service  we have this on the authority of a distinguished seaman of nelsons time  departing this life as admiral of the fleet on the eve of the crimean war sir thomas byam martin has recorded for us amongst his all too short autobiographical notes these few characteristic words uttered by one young man of the many who must have felt that particular inconvenience of a heroic age  the distinguished admiral had lived through it himself and was a good judge of what was expected in those days from men and ships a brilliant frigate captain a man of sound judgment of dashing bravery and of serene mind scrupulously concerned for the welfare and honour of the navy he missed a larger fame only by the chances of the service  we may well quote on this day the words written of nelson in the decline of a wellspent life by sir t b martin who died just fifty years ago on the very anniversary of trafalgar  nelsons nobleness of mind was a prominent and beautiful part of his character  his foiblesfaults if you likewill never be dwelt upon in any memorandum of mine he declares and goes on he whose splendid and matchless achievements will be remembered with admiration while there is gratitude in the hearts of britons or while a ship floats upon the ocean he whose example on the breaking out of the war gave so chivalrous an impulse to the younger men of the service that all rushed into rivalry of daring which disdained every warning of prudence and led to acts of heroic enterprise which tended greatly to exalt the glory of our nation  these are his words and they are true  the dashing young frigate captain the man who in middle age was nothing loth to give chase singlehanded in his seventyfour to a whole fleet the man of enterprise and consummate judgment the old admiral of the fleet the good and trusted servant of his country under two kings and a queen had felt correctly nelsons influence and expressed himself with precision out of the fulness of his seamans heart  exalted he wrote not augmented  and therein his feeling and his pen captured the very truth  other men there were ready and able to add to the treasure of victories the british navy has given to the nation  it was the lot of lord nelson to exalt all this glory  exalt the word seems to be created for the man    xlvii    the british navy may well have ceased to count its victories  it is rich beyond the wildest dreams of success and fame  it may well rather on a culminating day of its history cast about for the memory of some reverses to appease the jealous fates which attend the prosperity and triumphs of a nation  it holds indeed the heaviest inheritance that has ever been entrusted to the courage and fidelity of armed men  it is too great for mere pride  it should make the seamen of to day humble in the secret of their hearts and indomitable in their unspoken resolution  in all the records of history there has never been a time when a victorious fortune has been so faithful to men making war upon the sea  and it must be confessed that on their part they knew how to be faithful to their victorious fortune they were exalted  they were always watching for her smile night or day fair weather or foul they waited for her slightest sign with the offering of their stout hearts in their hands  and for the inspiration of this high constancy they were indebted to lord nelson alone  whatever earthly affection he abandoned or grasped the great admiral was always before all beyond all a lover of fame  he loved her jealously with an inextinguishable ardour and an insatiable desirehe loved her with a masterful devotion and an infinite trustfulness  in the plenitude of his passion he was an exacting lover  and she never betrayed the greatness of his trust she attended him to the end of his life and he died pressing her last gift nineteen prizes to his heart  anchor hardyanchor was as much the cry of an ardent lover as of a consummate seaman thus he would hug to his breast the last gift of fame  it was this ardour which made him great  he was a flaming example to the wooers of glorious fortune  there have been great officers beforelord hood for instance whom he himself regarded as the greatest sea officer england ever had  a long succession of great commanders opened the sea to the vast range of nelsons genius his time had come and after the great sea officers the great naval tradition passed into the keeping of a great man  not the least glory of the navy is that it understood nelson  lord hood trusted him  admiral keith told him  we cant spare you either as captain or admiral  earl st vincent put into his hands untrammelled by orders a division of his fleet and sir hyde parker gave him two more ships at copenhagen than he had asked for so much for the chiefs the rest of the navy surrendered to him their devoted affection trust and admiration  in return he gave them no less than his own exalted soul  he breathed into them his own ardour and his own ambition  in a few short years he revolutionized not the strategy or tactics of seawarfare but the very conception of victory itself  and this is genius  in that alone through the fidelity of his fortune and the power of his inspiration he stands unique amongst the leaders of fleets and sailors  he brought heroism into the line of duty  verily he is a terrible ancestor  and the men of his day loved him  they loved him not only as victorious armies have loved great commanders they loved him with a more intimate feeling as one of themselves  in the words of a contemporary he had a most happy way of gaining the affectionate respect of all who had the felicity to serve under his command  to be so great and to remain so accessible to the affection of ones fellowmen is the mark of exceptional humanity  lord nelsons greatness was very human  it had a moral basis it needed to feel itself surrounded by the warm devotion of a band of brothers  he was vain and tender  the love and admiration which the navy gave him so unreservedly soothed the restlessness of his professional pride  he trusted them as much as they trusted him he was a seaman of seamen  sir t b martin states that he never conversed with any officer who had served under nelson without hearing the heartiest expressions of attachment to his person and admiration of his frank and conciliatory manner to his subordinates  and sir robert stopford who commanded one of the ships with which nelson chased to the west indies a fleet nearly double in number says in a letter  we are halfstarved and otherwise inconvenienced by being so long out of port but our reward is that we are with nelson  this heroic spirit of daring and endurance in which all public and private differences were sunk throughout the whole fleet is lord nelsons great legacy triply sealed by the victorious impress of the nile copenhagen and trafalgar  this is a legacy whose value the changes of time cannot affect  the men and the ships he knew how to lead lovingly to the work of courage and the reward of glory have passed away but nelsons uplifting touch remains in the standard of achievement he has set for all time  the principles of strategy may be immutable  it is certain they have been and shall be again disregarded from timidity from blindness through infirmity of purpose  the tactics of great captains on land and sea can be infinitely discussed  the first object of tactics is to close with the adversary on terms of the greatest possible advantage yet no hardandfast rules can be drawn from experience for this capital reason amongst othersthat the quality of the adversary is a variable element in the problem  the tactics of lord nelson have been amply discussed with much pride and some profit  and yet truly they are already of but archaic interest a very few years more and the hazardous difficulties of handling a fleet under canvas shall have passed beyond the conception of seamen who hold in trust for their country lord nelsons legacy of heroic spirit  the change in the character of the ships is too great and too radical  it is good and proper to study the acts of great men with thoughtful reverence but already the precise intention of lord nelsons famous memorandum seems to lie under that veil which time throws over the clearest conceptions of every great art  it must not be forgotten that this was the first time when nelson commanding in chief had his opponents under waythe first time and the last  had he lived had there been other fleets left to oppose him we would perhaps have learned something more of his greatness as a sea officer  nothing could have been added to his greatness as a leader  all that can be affirmed is that on no other day of his short and glorious career was lord nelson more splendidly true to his genius and to his countrys fortune    xlviii    and yet the fact remains that had the wind failed and the fleet lost steerage way or worse still had it been taken aback from the eastward with its leaders within short range of the enemys guns nothing it seems could have saved the headmost ships from capture or destruction  no skill of a great sea officer would have availed in such a contingency  lord nelson was more than that and his genius would have remained undiminished by defeat  but obviously tactics which are so much at the mercy of irremediable accident must seem to a modern seaman a poor matter of study  the commanderinchief in the great fleet action that will take its place next to the battle of trafalgar in the history of the british navy will have no such anxiety and will feel the weight of no such dependence  for a hundred years now no british fleet has engaged the enemy in line of battle  a hundred years is a long time but the difference of modern conditions is enormous  the gulf is great  had the last great fight of the english navy been that of the first of june for instance had there been no nelsons victories it would have been wellnigh impassable  the great admirals slight and passionworn figure stands at the parting of the ways  he had the audacity of genius and a prophetic inspiration  the modern naval man must feel that the time has come for the tactical practice of the great sea officers of the past to be laid by in the temple of august memories  the fleet tactics of the sailing days have been governed by two points  the deadly nature of a raking fire and the dread natural to a commander dependent upon the winds to find at some crucial moment part of his fleet thrown hopelessly to leeward  these two points were of the very essence of sailing tactics and these two points have been eliminated from the modern tactical problem by the changes of propulsion and armament  lord nelson was the first to disregard them with conviction and audacity sustained by an unbounded trust in the men he led  this conviction this audacity and this trust stand out from amongst the lines of the celebrated memorandum which is but a declaration of his faith in a crushing superiority of fire as the only means of victory and the only aim of sound tactics  under the difficulties of the then existing conditions he strove for that and for that alone putting his faith into practice against every risk  and in that exclusive faith lord nelson appears to us as the first of the moderns  against every risk i have said and the men of today born and bred to the use of steam can hardly realize how much of that risk was in the weather  except at the nile where the conditions were ideal for engaging a fleet moored in shallow water lord nelson was not lucky in his weather  practically it was nothing but a quite unusual failure of the wind which cost him his arm during the teneriffe expedition  on trafalgar day the weather was not so much unfavourable as extremely dangerous  it was one of these covered days of fitful sunshine of light unsteady winds with a swell from the westward and hazy in general but with the land about the cape at times distinctly visible  it has been my lot to look with reverence upon the very spot more than once and for many hours together  all but thirty years ago certain exceptional circumstances made me very familiar for a time with that bight in the spanish coast which would be enclosed within a straight line drawn from faro to spartel  my wellremembered experience has convinced me that in that corner of the ocean once the wind has got to the northward of west as it did on the 20th taking the british fleet aback appearances of westerly weather go for nothing and that it is infinitely more likely to veer right round to the east than to shift back again it was in those conditions that at seven on the morning of the 21st the signal for the fleet to bear up and steer east was made holding a clear recollection of these languid easterly sighs rippling unexpectedly against the run of the smooth swell with no other warning than a tenminutes calm and a queer darkening of the coastline i cannot think without a gasp of professional awe of that fateful moment  perhaps personal experience at a time of life when responsibility had a special freshness and importance has induced me to exaggerate to myself the danger of the weather the great admiral and good seaman could read aright the signs of sea and sky as his order to prepare to anchor at the end of the day sufficiently proves but all the same the mere idea of these baffling easterly airs coming on at any time within half an hour or so after the firing of the first shot is enough to take ones breath away with the image of the rearmost ships of both divisions falling off unmanageable broadside on to the westerly swell and of two british admirals in desperate jeopardy  to this day i cannot free myself from the impression that for some forty minutes the fate of the great battle hung upon a breath of wind such as i have felt stealing from behind as it were upon my cheek while engaged in looking to the westward for the signs of the true weather  never more shall british seamen going into action have to trust the success of their valour to a breath of wind  the god of gales and battles favouring her arms to the last has let the sun of englands sailingfleet and of its greatest master set in unclouded glory  and now the old ships and their men are gone the new ships and the new men many of them bearing the old auspicious names have taken up their watch on the stern and impartial sea which offers no opportunities but to those who know how to grasp them with a ready hand and an undaunted heart    xlix    this the navy of the twenty years war knew well how to do and never better than when lord nelson had breathed into its soul his own passion of honour and fame  it was a fortunate navy  its victories were no mere smashing of helpless ships and massacres of cowed men  it was spared that cruel favour for which no brave heart had ever prayed  it was fortunate in its adversaries  i say adversaries for on recalling such proud memories we should avoid the word enemies whose hostile sound perpetuates the antagonisms and strife of nations so irremediable perhaps so fatefuland also so vain  war is one of the gifts of life but alas no war appears so very necessary when time has laid its soothing hand upon the passionate misunderstandings and the passionate desires of great peoples  le temps as a distinguished frenchman has said est un galant homme  he fosters the spirit of concord and justice in whose work there is as much glory to be reaped as in the deeds of arms  one of them disorganized by revolutionary changes the other rusted in the neglect of a decayed monarchy the two fleets opposed to us entered the contest with odds against them from the first  by the merit of our daring and our faithfulness and the genius of a great leader we have in the course of the war augmented our advantage and kept it to the last  but in the exulting illusion of irresistible might a long series of military successes brings to a nation the less obvious aspect of such a fortune may perchance be lost to view  the old navy in its last days earned a fame that no belittling malevolence dare cavil at  and this supreme favour they owe to their adversaries alone  deprived by an illstarred fortune of that selfconfidence which strengthens the hands of an armed host impaired in skill but not in courage it may safely be said that our adversaries managed yet to make a better fight of it in 1797 than they did in 1793  later still the resistance offered at the nile was all and more than all that could be demanded from seamen who unless blind or without understanding must have seen their doom sealed from the moment that the goliath bearing up under the bows of the guerrier took up an inshore berth  the combined fleets of 1805 just come out of port and attended by nothing but the disturbing memories of reverses presented to our approach a determined front on which captain blackwood in a knightly spirit congratulated his admiral by the exertions of their valour our adversaries have but added a greater lustre to our arms  no friend could have done more for even in war which severs for a time all the sentiments of human fellowship this subtle bond of association remains between brave menthat the final testimony to the value of victory must be received at the hands of the vanquished  those who from the heat of that battle sank together to their repose in the cool depths of the ocean would not understand the watchwords of our day would gaze with amazed eyes at the engines of our strife  all passes all changes  the animosity of peoples the handling of fleets the forms of ships and even the sea itself seems to wear a different and diminished aspect from the sea of lord nelsons day  in this ceaseless rush of shadows and shades that like the fantastic forms of clouds cast darkly upon the waters on a windy day fly past us to fall headlong below the hard edge of an implacable horizon we must turn to the national spirit which superior in its force and continuity to good and evil fortune can alone give us the feeling of an enduring existence and of an invincible power against the fates  like a subtle and mysterious elixir poured into the perishable clay of successive generations it grows in truth splendour and potency with the march of ages  in its incorruptible flow all round the globe of the earth it preserves from the decay and forgetfulness of death the greatness of our great men and amongst them the passionate and gentle greatness of nelson the nature of whose genius was on the faith of a brave seaman and distinguished admiral such as to exalt the glory of our nation
