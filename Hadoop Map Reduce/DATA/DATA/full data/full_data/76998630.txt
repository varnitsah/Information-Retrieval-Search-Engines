notes                 the monastery   introduction1830  it would be difficult to assign any good reason why the author of ivanhoe after using in that work all the art he possessed to remove the personages action and manners of the tale to a distance from his own country should choose for the scene of his next attempt the celebrated ruins of melrose in the immediate neighbourhood of his own residence but the reason or caprice which dictated his change of system has entirely escaped his recollection nor is it worth while to attempt recalling what must be a matter of very little consequence  the general plan of the story was to conjoin two characters in that bustling and contentious age who thrown into situations which gave them different views on the subject of the reformation should with the same sincerity and purity of intention dedicate themselves the one to the support of the sinking fabric of the catholic church the other to the establishment of the reformed doctrines it was supposed that some interesting subjects for narrative might be derived from opposing two such enthusiasts to each other in the path of life and contrasting the real worth of both with their passions and prejudices the localities of melrose suited well the scenery of the proposed story the ruins themselves form a splendid theatre for any tragic incident which might be brought forward joined to the vicinity of the fine river with all its tributary streams flowing through a country which has been the scene of so much fierce fighting and is rich with so many recollections of former times and lying almost under the immediate eye of the author by whom they were to be used in composition  the situation possessed farther recommendations on the opposite bank of the tweed might be seen the remains of ancient enclosures surrounded by sycamores and ashtrees of considerable size these had once formed the crofts or arable ground of a village now reduced to a single hut the abode of a fisherman who also manages a ferry the cottages even the church which once existed there have sunk into vestiges hardly to be traced without visiting the spot the inhabitants having gradually withdrawn to the more prosperous town of galashiels which has risen into consideration within two miles of their neighbourhood superstitious eld however has tenanted the deserted groves with aerial beings to supply the want of the mortal tenants who have deserted it the ruined and abandoned churchyard of boldside has been long believed to be haunted by the fairies and the deep broad current of the tweed wheeling in moonlight round the foot of the steep bank with the number of trees originally planted for shelter round the fields of the cottagers but now presenting the effect of scattered and detached groves fill up the idea which one would form in imagination for a scene that oberon and queen mab might love to revel in  there are evenings when the spectator might believe with father chaucer that the    queen of faery   with harp and pipe and symphony   were dwelling in the place  another and even a more familiar refuge of the elfin race if tradition is to be trusted is the glen of the river or rather brook named the allen which falls into the tweed from the northward about a quarter of a mile above the present bridge as the streamlet finds its way behind lord sommervilles huntingseat called the pavilion its valley has been popularly termed the fairy dean or rather the nameless dean because of the supposed ill luck attached by the popular faith of ancient times to any one who might name or allude to the race whom our fathers distinguished as the good neighbours and the highlanders called daoine shie or men of peace rather by way of compliment than on account of any particular idea of friendship or pacific relation which either highlander or borderer entertained towards the irritable beings whom they thus distinguished or supposed them to bear to humanity  footnote see rob roy note p 202  in evidence of the actual operations of the fairy people even at this time little pieces of calcareous matter are found in the glen after a flood which either the labours of those tiny artists or the eddies of the brook among the stones have formed into a fantastic resemblance of cups saucers basins and the like in which children who gather them pretend to discern fairy utensils  besides these circumstances of romantic locality mea paupera regna as captain dalgetty denominates his territory of drumthwacket are bounded by a small but deep lake from which eyes that yet look on the light are said to have seen the waterbull ascend and shake the hills with his roar  indeed the country around melrose if possessing less of romantic beauty than some other scenes in scotland is connected with so many associations of a fanciful nature in which the imagination takes delight as might well induce one even less attached to the spot than the author to accommodate after a general manner the imaginary scenes he was framing to the localities to which he was partial but it would be a misapprehension to suppose that because melrose may in general pass for kennaquhair or because it agrees with scenes of the monastery in the circumstances of the drawbridge the milldam and other points of resemblance that therefore an accurate or perfect local similitude is to be found in all the particulars of the picture it was not the purpose of the author to present a landscape copied from nature but a piece of composition in which a real scene with which he is familiar had afforded him some leading outlines thus the resemblance of the imaginary glendearg with the real vale of the allen is far from being minute nor did the author aim at identifying them this must appear plain to all who know the actual character of the glen of allen and have taken the trouble to read the account of the imaginary glendearg  the stream in the latter case is described as wandering down a romantic little valley shifting itself after the fashion of such a brook from one side to the other as it can most easily find its passage and touching nothing in its progress that gives token of cultivation it rises near a solitary tower the abode of a supposed church vassal and the scene of several incidents in the romance  the real allen on the contrary after traversing the romantic ravine called the nameless dean thrown off from side to side alternately like a billiard ball repelled by the sides of the table on which it has been played and in that part of its course resembling the stream which pours down glendearg may be traced upwards into a more open country where the banks retreat farther from each other and the vale exhibits a good deal of dry ground which has not been neglected by the active cultivators of the district it arrives too at a sort of termination striking in itself but totally irreconcilable with the narrative of the romance  instead of a single peelhouse or border tower of defence such as dame glendinning is supposed to have inhabited the head of the allen about five miles above its junction with the tweed shows three ruins of border houses belonging to different proprietors and each from the desire of mutual support so natural to troublesome times situated at the extremity of the property of which it is the principal messuage one of these is the ruinous mansionhouse of hillslap formerly the property of the cairncrosses and now of mr innes of stow a second the tower of colmslie an ancient inheritance of the borthwick family as is testified by their crest the goats head which exists on the ruin footnote it appears that sir walter scotts memory was not quite accurate on these points john borthwick esq in a note to the publisher june i1 1813 says that colmslie belonged to mr innes of stow while hillslap forms part of the estate of crookston he addsin proof that the tower of hillslap which i have taken measures to preserve from injury was chiefly in his head as the tower of glendearg when writing the monastery i may mention that on one of the occasions when i had the honour of being a visiter at abbotsford the stables then being full i sent a pony to be put up at our tenants at hillslapwell said sir walter if you do that you must trust for its not being lifted before tomorrow to the protection of halbert glendinning against christie of the clintshill at page 58 vol  iii the first edition the winding stair which the monk ascended is described the winding stone stair is still to be seen in hillslap but not in either of the other two towers it is  however probable from the goatshead crest on colmslie that that tower also had been of old a possession of the borthwicks a third the house of langshaw also ruinous but near which the proprietor mr baillie of jerviswood and mellerstain has built a small shooting box  all these ruins so strangely huddled together in a very solitary spot have recollections and traditions of their own but none of them bear the most distant resemblance to the descriptions in the romance of the monastery and as the author could hardly have erred so grossly regarding a spot within a mornings ride of his own house the inference is that no resemblance was intended hillslap is remembered by the humours of the last inhabitants two or three elderly ladies of the class of miss raynalds in the old manor house though less important by birth and fortune colmslie is commemorated in song    colmslie stands on colmslie hill   the water it flows round colmslie mill   the mill and the kiln gang bonnily   and its up with the whippers of colmslie  langshaw although larger than the other mansions assembled at the head of the supposed glendearg has nothing about it more remarkable than the inscription of the present proprietor over his shooting lodgeutinam hane eliam viris impleam amicisa modest wish which i know no one more capable of attaining upon an extended scale than the gentleman who has expressed it upon a limited one  having thus shown that i could say something of these desolated towers which the desire of social intercourse or the facility of mutual defence had drawn together at the head of this glen i need not add any farther reason to show that there is no resemblance between them and the solitary habitation of dame elspeth glendinning beyond these dwellings are some remains of natural wood and a considerable portion of morass and bog but i would not advise any who may be curious in localities to spend time in looking for the fountain and hollytree of the white lady  while i am on the subject i may add that captain clutterbuck the imaginary editor of the monastery has no real prototype in the village of melrose or neighbourhood that ever i saw or heard of to give some individuality to this personage he is described as a character which sometimes occurs in actual societya person who having spent his life within the necessary duties of a technical profession from which he has been at length emancipated finds himself without any occupation whatever and is apt to become the prey of ennui until he discerns some petty subject of investigation commensurate to his talents the study of which gives him employment in solitude while the conscious possession of information peculiar to himself adds to his consequence in society i have often observed that the lighter and trivial branches of antiquarian study are singularly useful in relieving vacuity of such a kind and have known them serve many a captain clutterbuck to retreat upon i was therefore a good deal surprised when i found the antiquarian captain identified with a neighbour and friend of my own who could never have been confounded with him by any one who had read the book and seen the party alluded to this erroneous identification occurs in a work entitled illustrations of the author of waverley being notices and anecdotes of real characters scenes and incidents supposed to be described in his works by robert chambers this work was of course liable to many errors as any one of the kind must be whatever may be the ingenuity of the author which takes the task of explaining what can be only known to another person mistakes of place or inanimate things referred to are of very little moment but the ingenious author ought to have been more cautious of attaching real names to fictitious characters  i think it is in the spectator we read of a rustic wag who in a copy of the whole duty of man wrote opposite to every vice the name of some individual in the neighbourhood and thus converted that excellent work into a libel on a whole parish  the scenery being thus ready at the authors hand the reminiscences of the country were equally favourable in a land where the horses remained almost constantly saddled and the sword seldom quitted the warriors sidewhere war was the natural and constant state of the inhabitants and peace only existed in the shape of brief and feverish trucesthere could be no want of the means to complicate and extricate the incidents of his narrative at pleasure there was a disadvantage notwithstanding in treading this border district for it had been already ransacked by the author himself as well as others and unless presented under a new light was likely to afford ground to the objection of crambe bis cocta  to attain the indispensable quality of novelty something it was thought might be gained by contrasting the character of the vassals of the church with those of the dependants of the lay barons by whom they were surrounded but much advantage could not be derived from this there were indeed differences betwixt the two classes but like tribes in the mineral and vegetable world which resembling each other to common eyes can be sufficiently well discriminated by naturalists they were yet too similar upon the whole to be placed in marked contrast with each other  machinery remainedthe introduction of the supernatural and marvellous the resort of distressed authors since the days of horace but whose privileges as a sanctuary have been disputed in the present age and wellnigh exploded the popular belief no longer allows the possibility of existence to the race of mysterious beings which hovered betwixt this world and that which is invisible  the fairies have abandoned their moonlight turf the witch no longer holds her black orgies in the hemlock dell and    even the last lingering phantom of the brain   the churchyard ghost is now at rest again  from the discredit attached to the vulgar and more common modes in which the scottish superstition displays itself the author was induced to have recourse to the beautiful though almost forgotten theory of astral spirits or creatures of the elements surpassing human beings in knowledge and power but inferior to them as being subject after a certain space of years to a death which is to them annihilation as they have no share in the promise made to the sons of adam these spirits are supposed to be of four distinct kinds as the elements from which they have their origin and are known to those who have studied the cabalistical philosophy by the names of sylphs gnomes salamanders and naiads as they belong to the elements of air earth fire or water the general reader will find an entertaining account of these elementary spirits in the french book entitled entretiens de compte du gabalis the ingenious compte de la motte fouqu composed in german one of the most successful productions of his fertile brain where a beautiful and even afflicting effect is produced by the introduction of a waternymph who loses the privilege of immortality by consenting to become accessible to human feelings and uniting her lot with that of a mortal who treats her with ingratitude  in imitation of an example so successful the white lady of avenel was introduced into the following sheets she is represented as connected with the family of avenel by one of those mystic ties which in ancient times were supposed to exist in certain circumstances between the creatures of the elements and the children of men such instances of mysterious union are recognized in ireland in the real milosian families who are possessed of a banshie and they are known among the traditions of the highlands which in many cases attached an immortal being or spirit to the service of particular families or tribes these demons if they are to be called so announced good or evil fortune to the families connected with them and though some only condescended to meddle with matters of importance others like the may mollach or maid of the hairy arms condescended to mingle in ordinary sports and even to direct the chief how to play at draughts  there was therefore no great violence in supposing such a being as this to have existed while the elementary spirits were believed in but it was more difficult to describe or imagine its attributes and principles of action shakespeare the first of authorities in such a case has painted ariel that beautiful creature of his fancy as only approaching so near to humanity as to know the nature of that sympathy which the creatures of clay felt for each other as we learn from the expressionmine would if i were human the inferences from this are singular but seem capable of regular deduction a being however superior to man in length of lifein power over the elementsin certain perceptions respecting the present the past and the future yet still incapable of human passions of sentiments of moral good and evil of meriting future rewards or punishments belongs rather to the class of animals than of human creatures and must therefore be presumed to act more from temporary benevolence or caprice than from anything approaching to feeling or reasoning such a beings superiority in power can only be compared to that of the elephant or lion who are greater in strength than man though inferior in the scale of creation the partialities which we suppose such spirits to entertain must be like those of the dog their sudden starts of passion or the indulgence of a frolic or mischief may be compared to those of the numerous varieties of the cat all these propensities are however controlled by the laws which render the elementary race subordinate to the command of manliable to be subjected by his science so the sect of gnostics believed and on this turned the rosicrucian philosophy or to be overpowered by his superior courage and daring when it set their illusions at defiance  it is with reference to this idea of the supposed spirits of the elements that the white lady of avenel is represented as acting a varying capricious and inconsistent part in the pages assigned to her in the narrative manifesting interest and attachment to the family with whom her destinies are associated but evincing whim and even a species of malevolence towards other mortals as the sacristan and the border robber whose incorrect life subjected them to receive petty mortifications at her hand the white lady is scarcely supposed however to have possessed either the power or the inclination to do more than inflict terror or create embarrassment and is also subjected by those mortals who by virtuous resolution and mental energy could assert superiority over her in these particulars she seems to constitute a being of a middle class between the esprit follet who places its pleasure in misleading and tormenting mortals and the benevolent fairy of the east who uniformly guides aids and supports them  either however the author executed his purpose indifferently or the public did not approve of it for the white lady of avenel was far from being popular he does not now make the present statement in the view of arguing readers into a more favourable opinion on the subject but merely with the purpose of exculpating himself from the charge of having wantonly intruded into the narrative a being of inconsistent powers and propensities  in the delineation of another character the author of the monastery failed where he hoped for some success as nothing is so successful a subject for ridicule as the fashionable follies of the time it occurred to him that the more serious scenes of his narrative might be relieved by the humour of a cavaliero of the age of queen elizabeth in every period the attempt to gain and maintain the highest rank of society has depended on the power of assuming and supporting a certain fashionable kind of affectation usually connected with some vivacity of talent and energy of character but distinguished at the same time by a transcendent flight beyond sound reason and common sense both faculties too vulgar to be admitted into the estimate of one who claims to be esteemed a choice spirit of the age these in their different phases constitute the gallants of the day whose boast it is to drive the whims of fashion to extremity  on all occasions the manners of the sovereign the court and the time must give the tone to the peculiar description of qualities by which those who would attain the height of fashion must seek to distinguish themselves the reign of elizabeth being that of a maiden queen was distinguished by the decorum of the courtiers and especially the affectation of the deepest deference to the sovereign after the acknowledgment of the queens matchless perfections the same devotion was extended to beauty as it existed among the lesser stars in her court who sparkled as it was the mode to say by her reflected lustre it is true that gallant knights no longer vowed to heaven the peacock and the ladies to perform some feat of extravagant chivalry in which they endangered the lives of others as well as their own but although their chivalrous displays of personal gallantry seldom went farther in elizabeths days than the tiltyard where barricades called barriers prevented the shock of the horses and limited the display of the cavaliers skill to the comparatively safe encounter of their lances the language of the lovers to their ladies was still in the exalted terms which amadis would have addressed to oriana before encountering a dragon for her sake this tone of romantic gallantry found a clever but conceited author to reduce it to a species of constitution and form and lay down the courtly manner of conversation in a pedantic book called euphues and his england of this a brief account is given in the text to which it may now be proper to make some additions  the extravagance of euphuism or a symbolical jargon of the same class predominates in the romances of calprenade and scuderi which were read for the amusement of the fair sex of france during the long reign of louis xiv and were supposed to contain the only legitimate language of love and gallantry in this reign they encountered the satire of moliere and boileau a similar disorder spreading into private society formed the ground of the affected dialogue of the praecieuses as they were styled who formed the coterie of the hotel de rambouillet and afforded moliere matter for his admirable comedy les praecieuses ridicules in england the humour does not seem to have long survived the accession of james i  the author had the vanity to think that a character whose peculiarities should turn on extravagances which were once universally fashionable might be read in a fictitious story with a good chance of affording amusement to the existing generation who fond as they are of looking back on the actions and manners of their ancestors might be also supposed to be sensible of their absurdities he must fairly acknowledge that he was disappointed and that the euphuist far from being accounted a well drawn and humorous character of the period was condemned as unnatural and absurd  it would be easy to account for this failure by supposing the defect to arise from the authors want of skill and probably many readers may not be inclined to look farther but as the author himself can scarcely be supposed willing to acquiesce in this final cause if any other can be alleged he has been led to suspect that contrary to what he originally supposed his subject was injudiciously chosen in which and not in his mode of treating it lay the source of the want of success  the manners of a rude people are always founded on nature and therefore the feelings of a more polished generation immediately sympathize with them we need no numerous notes no antiquarian dissertations to enable the most ignorant to recognize the sentiments and diction of the characters of homer we have but as lear says to strip off our lendingsto set aside the factitious principles and adornments which we have received from our comparatively artificial system of society and our natural feelings are in unison with those of the bard of chios and the heroes who live in his verses it is the same with a great part of the narratives of my friend mr cooper we sympathize with his indian chiefs and backwoodsmen and acknowledge in the characters which he presents to us the same truth of human nature by which we should feel ourselves influenced if placed in the same condition so much is this the case that though it is difficult or almost impossible to reclaim a savage bred from his youth to war and the chase to the restraints and the duties of civilized life nothing is more easy or common than to find men who have been educated in all the habits and comforts of improved society willing to exchange them for the wild labours of the hunter and the fisher the very amusements most pursued and relished by men of all ranks whose constitutions permit active exercise are hunting fishing and in some instances war the natural and necessary business of the savage of dryden where his hero talks of being    as free as nature first made man   when wild in woods the noble savage ran  but although the occupations and even the sentiments of human beings in a primitive state find access and interest in the minds of the more civilized part of the species it does not therefore follow that the national tastes opinions and follies of one civilized period should afford either the same interest or the same amusement to those of another these generally when driven to extravagance are founded not upon any natural taste proper to the species but upon the growth of some peculiar cast of affectation with which mankind in general and succeeding generations in particular feel no common interest or sympathy the extravagances of coxcombry in manners and apparel are indeed the legitimate and often the successful objects of satire during the time when they exist in evidence of this theatrical critics may observe how many dramatic jeux desprit are well received every season because the satirist levels at some wellknown or fashionable absurdity or in the dramatic phrase shoots folly as it flies but when the peculiar kind of folly keeps the wing no longer it is reckoned but waste of powder to pour a discharge of ridicule on what has ceased to exist and the pieces in which such forgotten absurdities are made the subject of ridicule fall quietly into oblivion with the follies which gave them fashion or only continue to exist on the scene because they contain some other more permanent interest than that which connects them with manners and follies of a temporary character  this perhaps affords a reason why the comedies of ben jonson founded upon system or what the age termed humoursby which was meant factitious and affected characters superinduced on that which was common to the rest of their racein spite of acute satire deep scholarship and strong sense do not now afford general pleasure but are confined to the closet of the antiquary whose studies have assured him that the personages of the dramatist were once though they are now no longer portraits of existing nature  let us take another example of our hypothesis from shakspeare himself who of all authors drew his portraits for all ages with the whole sum of the idolatry which affects us at his name the mass of readers peruse without amusement the characters formed on the extravagances of temporary fashion and the euphuist don armado the pedant holofernes even nym and pistol are read with little pleasure by the mass of the public being portraits of which we cannot recognize the humour because the originals no longer exist  in like manner while the distresses of romeo and juliet continue to interest every bosom mercutio drawn as an accurate representation of the finished fine gentleman of the period and as such received by the unanimous approbation of contemporaries has so little to interest the present age that stripped of all his puns and quirks of verbal wit he only retains his place in the scene in virtue of his fine and fanciful speech upon dreaming which belongs to no particular age and because he is a personage whose presence is indispensable to the plot  we have already prosecuted perhaps too far an argument the tendency of which is to prove that the introduction of an humorist acting like sir piercie shafton upon some forgotten and obsolete model of folly once fashionable is rather likely to awaken the disgust of the reader as unnatural than find him food for laughter whether owing to this theory or whether to the more simple and probable cause of the authors failure in the delineation of the subject he had proposed to himself the formidable objection of incredulus odi was applied to the euphuist as well as to the white lady of avenel and the one was denounced as unnatural while the other was rejected as impossible  there was little in the story to atone for these failures in two principal points the incidents were inartificially huddled together there was no part of the intrigue to which deep interest was found to apply and the conclusion was brought about not by incidents arising out of the story itself but in consequence of public transactions with which the narrative has little connexion and which the reader had little opportunity to become acquainted with  this if not a positive fault was yet a great defect in the romance it is true that not only the practice of some great authors in this department but even the general course of human life itself may be quoted in favour of this more obvious and less artificial practice of arranging a narrative  it is seldom that the same circle of personages who have surrounded an individual at his first outset in life continue to have an interest in his career till his fate comes to a crisis on the contrary and more especially if the events of his life be of a varied character and worth communicating to others or to the world the heros later connexions are usually totally separated from those with whom he began the voyage but whom the individual has outsailed or who have drifted astray or foundered on the passage this hackneyed comparison holds good in another point the numerous vessels of so many different sorts and destined for such different purposes which are launched in the same mighty ocean although each endeavours to pursue its own course are in every case more influenced by the winds and tides which are common to the element which they all navigate than by their own separate exertions and it is thus in the world that when human prudence has done its best some general perhaps national event destroys the schemes of the individual as the casual touch of a more powerful being sweeps away the web of the spider  many excellent romances have been composed in this view of human life where the hero is conducted through a variety of detached scenes in which various agents appear and disappear without perhaps having any permanent influence on the progress of the story such is the structure of gil blas roderick random and the lives and adventures of many other heroes who are described as running through different stations of life and encountering various adventures which are only connected with each other by having happened to be witnessed by the same individual whose identity unites them together as the string of a necklace links the beads which are otherwise detached  but though such an unconnected course of adventures is what most frequently occurs in nature yet the province of the romance writer being artificial there is more required from him than a mere compliance with the simplicity of realityjust as we demand from the scientific gardener that he shall arrange in curious knots and artificial parterres the flowers which nature boon distributes freely on hill and dale fielding accordingly in most of his novels but especially in tom jones his chefdoeuvre has set the distinguished example of a story regularly built and consistent in all its parts in which nothing occurs and scarce a personage is introduced that has not some share in tending to advance the catastrophe  to demand equal correctness and felicity in those who may follow in the track of that illustrious novelist would be to fetter too much the power of giving pleasure by surrounding it with penal rules since of this sort of light literature it may be especially saidtout genre est permis hors le genre ennuyeux still however the more closely and happily the story is combined and the more natural and felicitous the catastrophe the nearer such a composition will approach the perfection of the novelists art nor can an author neglect this branch of his profession without incurring proportional censure  for such censure the monastery gave but too much occasion the intrigue of the romance neither very interesting in itself nor very happily detailed is at length finally disentangled by the breaking out of national hostilities between england and scotland and the as sudden renewal of the truce instances of this kind it is true cannot in reality have been uncommon but the resorting to such in order to accomplish the catastrophe as by a tour de force was objected to as inartificial and not perfectly intelligible to the general reader  still the monastery though exposed to severe and just criticism did not fail judging from the extent of its circulation to have some interest for the public and this too was according to the ordinary course of such matters for it very seldom happens that literary reputation is gained by a single effort and still more rarely is it lost by a solitary miscarriage  the author therefore had his days of grace allowed him and time if he pleased to comfort himself with the burden of the old scots song    if it isna weel bobbit   well bob it again  abbotsford 1st november 1830                                         introductory epistle  from captain clutterbuck late of his majestys  regiment of infantry to the author of waverley  sir  although i do not pretend to the pleasure of your personal acquaintance like many whom i believe to be equally strangers to you i am nevertheless interested in your publications and desire their continuancenot that i pretend to much taste in fictitious composition or that i am apt to be interested in your grave scenes or amused by those which are meant to be lively i will not disguise from you that i have yawned over the last interview of macivor and his sister and fell fairly asleep while the schoolmaster was reading the humours of dandie dinmont you see sir that i scorn to solicit your favour in a way to which you are no stranger if the papers i enclose you are worth nothing i will not endeavour to recommend them by personal flattery as a bad cook pours rancid butter upon stale fish no sir what i respect in you is the light you have occasionally thrown on national antiquities a study which i have commenced rather late in life but to which i am attached with the devotions of a first love because it is the only study i ever cared a farthing for  you shall have my history sir it will not reach to three volumes before that of my manuscript and as you usually throw out a few lines of verse by way of skirmishers i suppose at the head of each division of prose i have had the luck to light upon a stanza in the schoolmasters copy of burns which describes me exactly i love it the better because it was originally designed for captain grose an excellent antiquary though like yourself somewhat too apt to treat with levity his own pursuits    tis said he was a soldier bred   and ane wad rather faen than fled   but now hes quit the spurtle blade                    and dogskin wallet   and taen theantiquarian trade                 i think they call it  i never could conceive what influenced me when a boy in the choice of a profession military zeal and ardour it was not which made me stand out for a commission in the scots fusiliers when my tutors and curators wished to bind me apprentice to old david stiles clerk to his majestys signet i say military zeal it was not for i was no fighting boy in my own person and cared not a penny to read the history of the heroes who turned the world upside down in former ages as for courage i had as i have since discovered just as much of it as served my turn and not one frain of surplus i soon found out indeed that in action there was more anger in running away than in standing fast and besides i could not afford to lose my commission which was my chief means of support but as for that overboiling valour which i have heard many of ours talk of though i seldom observed that it influenced them in the actual affairthat exuberant zeal which courts danger as a bridetruly my courage was of a complexion much less ecstatical  again the love of a red coat which in default of all other aptitudes to the profession has made many a bad soldier and some good ones was an utter stranger to my disposition i cared not a  bodle for the company of the misses nay though there was a boardingschool in the village and though we used to meet with its fair inmates at simon lightfoots weekly practising i cannot recollect any strong emotions being excited on these occasions excepting the infinite regret with which i went through the polite ceremonial of presenting my partner with an orange thrust into my pocket by my aunt for this special purpose but which had i dared i certainly would have secreted for my own personal use as for vanity or love of finery for itself i was such a stranger to it that the difficulty was great to make me brush my coat and appear in proper trim upon parade i shall never forget the rebuke of my old colonel on a morning when the king reviewed a brigade of which ours made part i am no friend to extravagance ensign clutterbuck said he but on the day when we are to pass before the sovereign of the kingdom in the name of god i would have at least shown him an inch of clean linen  thus a stranger to the ordinary motives which lead young men to make the army their choice and without the least desire to become either a hero or a dandy i really do not know what determined my thoughts that way unless it were the happy state of halfpay indolence enjoyed by captain doolittle who had set up his staff of rest in my native village every other person had or seemed to have something to do less or more they did not indeed precisely go to school and learn tasks that last of evils in my estimation but it did not escape my boyish observation that they were all bothered with something or other like duty or labourall but the happy captain doolittle the minister had his parish to visit and his preaching to prepare though perhaps he made more fuss than he needed about both  the laird had his farming and improving operations to superintend and besides he had to attend trustee meetings and lieutenancy meetings and headcourts and meetings of justices and what notwas as early up that i detested and as much in the open air wet and dry as his own grieve  the shopkeeper the village boasted but one of eminence stood indeed pretty much at his ease behind his counter for his custom was by no means overburdensome but still he enjoyed his status as the bailie calls it upon condition of tumbling all the wares in his booth over and over when any one chose to want a yard of muslin a mousetrap an ounce of caraways a paper of pins the sermons of mr peden or the life of jack the giantqueller not killer as usually erroneously written and pronouncedsee my essay on the true history of this worthy where real facts have in a peculiar degree been obscured by fable in short all in the village were under the necessity of doing something which they would rather have left undone excepting captain doolittle who walked every morning in the open street which formed the high mall of our village in a blue coat with a red neck and played at whist the whole evening when he could make up a party  this happy vacuity of all employment appeared to me so delicious that it became the primary hint which according to the system of helvetius as the minister says determined my infant talents towards the profession i was destined to illustrate  but who alas can form a just estimate of their future prospects in this deceitful world i was not long engaged in my new profession before i discovered that if the independent indolence of halfpay was a paradise the officer must pass through the purgatory of duty and service in order to gain admission to it captain doolittle might brush his blue coat with the red neck or leave it unbrushed at his pleasure but ensign clutterbuck had no such option captain doolittle might go to bed at ten oclock if he had a mind but the ensign must make the rounds in his turn what was worse the captain might repose under the tester of his tentbed until noon if he was so pleased but the ensign god help him had to appear upon parade at peep of day as for duty i made that as easy as i could had the sergeant to whisper to me the words of command and bustled through as other folks did of service i saw enough for an indolent manwas buffeted up and down the world and visited both the east and west indies egypt and other distant places which my youth had scarce dreamed of  the french i saw and felt too witness two fingers on my right hand which one of their cursed hussars took off with his sabre as neatly as an hospital surgeon at length the death of an old aunt who left me some fifteen hundred pounds snugly vested in the three per cents gave me the longwishedfor opportunity of retiring with the prospect of enjoying a clean shirt and a guinea four times aweek at least  for the purpose of commencing my new way of life i selected for my residence the village of kennaquhair in the south of scotland celebrated for the ruins of its magnificent monastery intending there to lead my future life in the otium cum dignitate of halfpay and annuity i was not long however in making the grand discovery that in order to enjoy leisure it is absolutely necessary it should be preceded by occupation for some time it was delightful to wake at daybreak dreaming of the reveillthen to recollect my happy emancipation from the slavery that doomed me to start at a piece of clattering parchment turn on my other side damn the parade and go to sleep again but even this enjoyment had its termination and time when it became a stock entirely at my own disposal began to hang heavy on my hand  i angled for two days during which time i lost twenty hooks and several scores of yards of gut and line and caught not even a minnow hunting was out of the question for the stomach of a horse by no means agrees with the halfpay establishment when i shot the shepherds and ploughmen and my very dog quizzed me every time that i missed which was generally speaking every time i fired besides the country gentlemen in this quarter like their game and began to talk of prosecutions and interdicts  i did not give up fighting the french to commence a domestic war with the pleasant men of teviotdale as the song calls them so i een spent three days very agreeably in cleaning my gun and disposing it upon two hooks over my chimneypiece  the success of this accidental experiment set me on trying my skill in the mechanical arts accordingly i took down and cleaned my landladys cuckooclock and in so doing silenced that companion of the spring for ever and a day i mounted a turninglathe and in attempting to use it i very nearly cribbed off with an inchandhalf former one of the fingers which the hussar had left me  books i tried both those of the little circulating library and of the more rational subscription collection maintained by this intellectual people but neither the light reading of the one nor the heavy artillery of the other suited my purpose i always fell asleep at the fourth or fifth page of history or disquisition and it took me a months hard reading to wade through a halfbound trashy novel during which i was pestered with applications to return the volumes by every halfbred milliners miss about the place  in short during the time when all the town besides had something to do i had nothing for it but to walk in the churchyard and whistle till it was dinnertime  during these promenades the ruins necessarily forced themselves on my attention and by degrees i found myself engaged in studying the more minute ornaments and at length the general plan of this noble structure  the old sexton aided my labours and gave me his portion of traditional lore every day added something to my stock of knowledge respecting the ancient state of the building and at length i made discoveries concerning the purpose of several detached and very ruinous portions of it the use of which had hitherto been either unknown altogether or erroneously explained  the knowledge which i thus acquired i had frequent opportunities of retailing to those visiters whom the progress of a scottish tour brought to visit this celebrated spot without encroaching on the privilege of my friend the sexton i became gradually an assistant cicerone in the task of description and explanation and often seeing a fresh party of visiters arrive has he turned over to me those to whom he had told half his story with the flattering observation what needs i say ony mair about it  theres the captain kens mair anent it than i do or any man in the town then would i salute the strangers courteously and expatiate to their astonished minds upon crypts and chancels and naves arches gothic and saxon architraves mullions and flying buttresses it not unfrequently happened that an acquaintance which commenced in the abbey concluded in the inn which served to relieve the solitude as well as the monotony of my landladys shoulder of mutton whether roast cold or hashed  by degrees my mind became enlarged i found a book or two which enlightened me on the subject of gothic architecture and i read now with pleasure because i was interested in what i read about even my character began to dilate and expand i spoke with more authority at the club and was listened to with deference because on one subject at least i possessed more information than any of its members indeed i found that even my stories about egypt which to say truth were somewhat threadbare were now listened to with more respect than formerly the captain they said had something in him after athere were few folk kend sae muckle about the abbey  with this general approbation waxed my own sense of selfimportance and my feeling of general comfort i ate with more appetite i digested with more ease i lay down at night with joy and slept sound till morning when i arose with a sense of busy importance and hied me to measure to examine and to compare the various parts of this interesting structure i lost all sense and consciousness of certain unpleasant sensations of a nondescript nature about my head and stomach to which i had been in the habit of attending more for the benefit of the village apothecary than my own for the pure want of something else to think about i had found out an occupation unwittingly and was happy because i had something to do  in a word i had commenced local antiquary and was not unworthy of the name  whilst i was in this pleasing career of busy idleness for so it might at best be called it happened that i was one night sitting in my little parlour adjacent to the closet which my landlady calls my bedroom in the act of preparing for an early retreat to the realms of morpheus dugdales monasticon borrowed from the library at a was lying on the table before me flanked by some excellent cheshire cheese a present by the way from an honest london citizen to whom i had explained the difference between a gothic and a saxon arch and a glass of vanderhagens best ale thus armed at all points against my old enemy time i was leisurely and deliciously preparing for bednow reading a line of old dugdalenow sipping my ale or munching my bread and cheesenow undoing the strings at my breeches knees or a button or two of my waistcoat until the village clock should strike ten before which time i make it a rule never to go to bed  a loud knocking however interrupted my ordinary process on this occasion and the voice of my honest landlord of the george was heard vociferating footnote the george was and is the principal inn in the village of kennaquhair or melrose but the landlord of the period was not the same civil and quiet person by whom the inn is now kept david kyle a melrose proprietor of no little importance a firstrate person of consequence in whatever belonged to the business of the town was the original owner and landlord of the inn poor david like many other busy men took so much care of public affairs as in some degree to neglect his own there are persons still alive at kennaquhair who can recognise him and his peculiarities in the following sketch of mine host of the george what the deevil mrs grimslees the captain is no in his bed  and a gentleman at our house has ordered a fowl and minced collops and a bottle of sherry and has sent to ask him to supper to tell him all about the abbey  na answered luckie grimslees in the true sleepy tone of a scottish matron when ten oclock is going to strike hes no in his bed but ise warrant him no gae out at this time o night to keep folks sitting up waiting for himthe captains a decent man  i plainly perceived this last compliment was made for my hearing by way both of indicating and of recommending the course of conduct which mrs grimslees desired i should pursue but i had not been knocked about the world for thirty years and odd and lived a bluff bachelor all the while to come home and be put under petticoat government by my landlady  accordingly i opened my chamberdoor and desired my old friend david to walk up stairs  captain said he as he entered i am as glad to find you up as if i had hooked a twenty pound saumon theres a gentleman up yonder that will not sleep sound in his bed this blessed night unless he has the pleasure to drink a glass of wine with you  you know david i replied with becoming dignity that i cannot with propriety go out to visit strangers at this time of night or accept of invitations from people of whom i know nothing  david swore a round oath and added was ever the like heard of he has ordered a fowl and egg sauce a pancake and minced collops and a bottle of sherrydye think i wad come and ask you to go to keep company with ony bit english rider that sups on toasted cheese and a cheerer of rumtoddy this is a gentleman every inch of him and a virtuoso a clean virtuosoa sadcoloured stand of claithes and a wig like the curled back of a mugewe the very first question he speered was about the auld drawbrig that has been at the bottom of the water these twal score yearsi have seen the fundations when we were sticking saumonand how the deevil suld he ken ony thing about the old drawbrig unless he were a virtuoso footnote there is more to be said about this old bridge hereafter see note p 57  david being a virtuoso in his own way and moreover a landholder and heritor was a qualified judge of all who frequented his house and therefore i could not avoid again tying the strings of my knees  thats right captain vociferated david you twa will be as thick as three in a bed an ance ye forgather i haena seen the like o him my very sell since i saw the great doctor samuel johnson on his tower through scotland whilk tower is lying in my back parlour for the amusement of my guests wi the twa boards torn aff  then the gentleman is a scholar david  ise uphaud him a scholar answered david he has a black coat on or a brown ane at onyrate  is he a clergyman  i am thinking no for he looked after his horses supper before he spoke o his ain replied mine host  has he a servant demanded i  nae servant answered david but a grand face o his ain that wad gar ony body be willing to serve him that looks upon him  and what makes him think of disturbing me ah david this has been some of your chattering you are perpetually bringing your guests on my shoulders as if it were my business to entertain every man who comes to the george  what the deil wad ye hae me do captain answered mine host a gentleman lights down and asks me in a most earnest manner what man of sense and learning there is about our town that can tell him about the antiquities of the place and specially about the auld abbeyye wadna hae me tell the gentleman a lee and ye ken weel eneugh there is naebody in the town can say a reasonable word about it be it no yoursell except the bedral and he is as fou as a piper by this time so says i theres captain clutterbuck thats a very civil gentleman and has little to do forby telling a the auld cracks about the abbey and dwells just hard by then says the gentleman to me sir says he very civilly have the goodness to step to captain clutterbuck with my compliments and say i am a stranger who have been led to these parts chiefly by the fame of these ruins and that i would call upon him but the hour is late and mair he said that i have forgotten but i weel remember it endedand landlord get a bottle of your best sherry and supper for twoye wadna have had me refuse to do the gentlemans bidding and me a publican  well david said i i wish your virtuoso had taken a fitter hour but as you say he is a gentleman  ise uphaud him thatthe order speaks for itsella bottle of sherry minched collops and a fowlthats speaking like a gentleman i trowthats right captain button weel up the nights rawbut the waters clearing for a that well be ont neist night wi my lords boats and well hae ill luck if i dinna send you a kipper to relish your ale at een footnote  the nobleman whose boats are mentioned in the text is the late kind and amiable lord sommerville an intimate friend of the author  david kyle was a constant and privileged attendant when lord sommerville had a party for spearing salmon on such occasions eighty or a hundred fish were often killed between gleamer and leaderfoot  in five minutes after this dialogue i found myself in the parlour of the george and in the presence of the stranger  he was a grave personage about my own age which we shall call about fifty and really had as my friend david expressed it something in his face that inclined men to oblige and to serve him yet this expression of authority was not at all of the cast which i have seen in the countenance of a general of brigade neither was the strangers dress at all martial it consisted of a uniform suit of irongray clothes cut in rather an oldfashioned form his legs were defended with strong leathern gambadoes which according to an antiquarian contrivance opened at the sides and were secured by steel clasps his countenance was worn as much by toil and sorrow as by age for it intimated that he had seen and endured much his address was singularly pleasing and gentlemanlike and the apology which he made for disturbing me at such an hour and in such a manner was so well and handsomely expressed that i could not reply otherwise than by declaring my willingness to be of service to him  i have been a traveller today sir said he and i would willingly defer the little i have to say till after supper for which i feel rather more appetized than usual  we sate down to table and notwithstanding the strangers alleged appetite as well as the gentle preparation of cheese and ale which i had already laid aboard i really believe that i of the two did the greater honour to my friend davids fowl and minced collops  when the cloth was removed and we had each made a tumbler of negus of that liquor which hosts call sherry and guests call lisbon i perceived that the stranger seemed pensive silent and somewhat embarrassed as if he had something to communicate which he knew not well how to introduce  to pave the way for him i spoke of the ancient ruins of the monastery and of their history but to my great surprise i found i had met my match with a witness the stranger not only knew all that i could tell him but a great deal more and  what was still more mortifying he was able by reference to dates charters and other evidence of facts that as burns says downa be disputed to correct many of the vague tales which i had adopted on loose and vulgar tradition as well as to confute more than one of my favourite theories on the subject of the old monks and their dwellings which i had sported freely in all the presumption of superior information and here i cannot but remark that much of the strangers arguments and inductions rested upon the authority of mr deputy register of scotland footnote  thomas thomson esq whose welldeserved panegyric ought to be found on another page than one written by an intimate friend of thirty years standing and his lucubrations a gentleman whose indefatigable research into the national records is like to destroy my trade and that of all local antiquaries by substituting truth instead of legend and romance alas i would the learned gentleman did but know how difficult it is for us dealers in petty wares of antiquity to    pluck from our memories a rooted legend   raze out the written records of our brain   or cleanse our bosoms of that perilous stuff  and so forth it would i am sure move his pity to think how many old dogs he hath set to learn new tricks how many venerable parrots he hath taught to sing a new song how many gray heads he hath addled by vain attempts to exchange their old mumpsimus for his new sumpsimus but let it pass humana perpessi sumusall changes round us past present and to come that which was history yesterday becomes fable today and the truth of today is hatched into a lie by tomorrow  finding myself like to be overpowered in the monastery which i had hitherto regarded as my citadel i began like a skilful general to evacuate that place of defence and fight my way through the adjacent country i had recourse to my acquaintance with the families and antiquities of the neighbourhood ground on which i thought i might skirmish at large without its being possible for the stranger to meet me with advantage but i was mistaken  the man in the irongray suit showed a much more minute knowledge of these particulars than i had the least pretension to he could tell the very year in which the family of de haga first settled on their ancient barony  footnote the family of de haga modernized into haig of bemerside is of the highest antiquity and is the subject of one of the prophecies of thomas the rhymer    betide betide whateer betide   haig shall be haig of bemerside   not a thane within reach but he knew his family and connexions how many of his ancestors had fallen by the sword of the english how many in domestic brawl and how many by the hand of the executioner for marchtreason their castles he was acquainted with from turret to foundationstone and as for the miscellaneous antiquities scattered about the country he knew every one of them from a cromlech to a cairn and could give as good an account of each as if he had lived in the time of the danes or druids  i was now in the mortifying predicament of one who suddenly finds himself a scholar when he came to teach and nothing was left for me but to pick up as much of his conversation as i could for the benefit of the next company i told indeed allan ramsays story of the monk and millers wife in order to retreat with some honour under cover of a parting volley  here however my flank was again turned by the eternal stranger  you are pleased to be facetious sir said he but you cannot be ignorant that the ludicrous incident you mentioned is the subject of a tale much older than that of allan ramsay  i nodded unwilling to acknowledge my ignorance though in fact i knew no more what he meant than did one of my friend davids posthorses  i do not allude continued my omniscient companion to the curious poem published by pinkerton from the maitland manuscript called the fryars of berwick although it presents a very minute and amusing picture of scottish manners during the reign of james v but rather to the italian novelist by whom so far as i know the story was first printed although unquestionably he first took his original from some ancient fabliau footnote it is curious to remark at how little expense of invention successive ages are content to receive amusement the same story which ramsay and dunbar have successively handled forms also the subject of the modern farce no song no supper  it is not to be doubted answered i not very well understanding however the proposition to which i gave such unqualified assent  yet continued my companion i question much had you known my situation and profession whether you would have pitched upon this precise anecdote for my amusement  this observation he made in a tone of perfect goodhumour i pricked up my ears at the hint and answered as politely as i could that my ignorance of his condition and rank could be the only cause of my having stumbled on anything disagreeable and that i was most willing to apologize for my unintentional offence so soon as i should know wherein it consisted  nay no offence sir he replied offence can only exist where it is taken i have been too long accustomed to more severe and cruel misconstructions to be offended at a popular jest though directed at my profession  am i to understand then i answered that i am speaking with a catholic clergyman  an unworthy monk of the order of saint benedict said the stranger belonging to a community of your own countrymen long established in france and scattered unhappily by the events of the revolution then said i you are a native scotchman and from this neighbourhood  not so answered the monk i am a scotchman by extraction only and never was in this neighbourhood during my whole life  never in this neighbourhood and yet so minutely acquainted with its history its traditions and even its external scenery you surprise me sir i replied  it is not surprising he said that i should have that sort of local information when it is considered that my uncle an excellent man as well as a good scotchman the head also of our religious community employed much of his leisure in making me acquainted with these particulars and that i myself disgusted with what has been passing around me have for many years amused myself by digesting and arranging the various scraps of information which i derived from my worthy relative and other aged brethren of our order  i presume sir said i though i would by no means intrude the question that you are now returned to scotland with a view to settle amongst your countrymen since the great political catastrophe of our time has reduced your corps  no sir replied the benedictine such is not my intention a european potentate who still cherishes the catholic faith has offered us a retreat within his dominions where a few of my scattered brethren are already assembled to pray to god for blessings on their protector and pardon to their enemies no one i believe will be able to object to us under our new establishment that the extent of our revenues will be inconsistent with our vows of poverty and abstinence but let us strive to be thankful to god that the snare of temporal abundance is removed from us  many of your convents abroad sir said i enjoyed very handsome incomesand yet allowing for times i question if any were better provided for than the monastery of this village it is said to have possessed nearly two thousand pounds in yearly moneyrent fourteen chalders and nine bolls of wheat fiftysix chalders five bolls barley fortyfour chalders and ten bolls oats capons and poultry butter salt carriage and arriage peats and kain wool and ale  even too much of all these temporal goods sir said my companion which though well intended by the pious donors served only to make the establishment the envy and the prey of those by whom it was finally devoured  in the meanwhile however i observed the monks had an easy life of it and as the old song goes    made gude kale   on fridays when they fasted  i understand you sir said the benedictine it is difficult saith the proverb to carry a full cup without spilling unquestionably the wealth of the community as it endangered the safety of the establishment by exciting the cupidity of others was also in frequent instances a snare to the brethren themselves and yet we have seen the revenues of convents expended not only in acts of beneficence and hospitality to individuals but in works of general and permanent advantage to the world at large  the noble folio collection of french historians commenced in 1737 under the inspection and at the expense of the community of saint maur will long show that the revenues of the benedictines were not always spent in selfindulgence and that the members of that order did not uniformly slumber in sloth and indolence when they had discharged the formal duties of their rule  as i knew nothing earthly at the time about the community of st maur and their learned labours i could only return a mumbling assent to this proposition i have since seen this noble work in the library of a distinguished family and i must own i am ashamed to reflect that in so wealthy a country as ours a similar digest of our historians should not be undertaken under the patronage of the noble and the learned in rivalry of that which the benedictines of paris executed at the expense of their own conventual funds  i perceive said the exbenedictine smiling that your heretical prejudices are too strong to allow us poor brethren any merit whether literary or spiritual  far from it sir said i i assure you i have been much obliged to monks in my time when i was quartered in a monastery in flanders in the campaign of 1793 i never lived more comfortably in my life they were jolly fellows the flemish canons and right sorry was i to leave my good quarters and to know that my honest hosts were to be at the mercy of the sansculottes but fortune de la guerre  the poor benedictine looked down and was silent i had unwittingly awakened a train of bitter reflections or rather i had touched somewhat rudely upon a chord which seldom ceased to vibrate of itself but he was too much accustomed to this sorrowful train of ideas to suffer it to overcome him on my part i hastened to atone for my blunder if there was any object of his journey to this country in which i could with propriety assist him i begged to offer him my best services i own i laid some little emphasis on the words with propriety as i felt it would ill become me a sound protestant and a servant of government so far as my halfpay was concerned to implicate myself in any recruiting which my companion might have undertaken in behalf of foreign seminaries or in any similar design for the advancement of popery which whether the pope be actually the old lady of babylon or no it did not become me in any manner to advance or countenance  my new friend hastened to relieve my indecision i was about to request your assistance sir he said in a matter which cannot but interest you as an antiquary and a person of research but i assure you it relates entirely to events and persons removed to the distance of two centuries and a half i have experienced too much evil from the violent unsettlement of the country in which i was born to be a rash labourer in the work of innovation in that of my ancestors  i again assured him of my willingness to assist him in anything that was not contrary to my allegiance or religion  my proposal he replied affects neithermay god bless the reigning family in britain they are not indeed of that dynasty to restore which my ancestors struggled and suffered in vain but the providence who has conducted his present majesty to the throne has given him the virtues necessary to his timefirmness and intrepiditya true love of his country and an enlightened view of the dangers by which she is surroundedfor the religion of these realms i am contented to hope that the great power whose mysterious dispensation has rent them from the bosom of the church will in his own good time and manner restore them to its holy pale the efforts of an individual obscure and humble as myself might well retard but could never advance a work so mighty  may i then inquire sir said i with what purpose you seek this country  ere my companion replied he took from his pocket a clasped paper book about the size of a regimental orderlybook full as it seemed of memoranda and drawing one of the candles close to him for david as a strong proof of his respect for the stranger had indulged us with two he seemed to peruse the contents very earnestly  there is among the ruins of the western end of the abbey church said he looking up to me yet keeping the memorandumbook half open and occasionally glancing at it as if to refresh his memory a sort of recess or chapel beneath a broken arch and in the immediate vicinity of one of those shattered gothic columns which once supported the magnificent roof whose fall has now encumbered that part of the building with its ruins  i think said i that i know whereabouts you are is there not in the side wall of the chapel or recess which you mention a large carved stone bearing a coat of arms which no one hitherto has been able to decipher  you are right answered the benedictine and again consulting his memoranda he added the arms on the dexter side are those of glendinning being a cross parted by a cross indented and countercharged of the same and on the sinister three spurrowels for those of avenel they are two ancient families now almost extinct in this countrythe arms part y per pale  i think said i there is no part of this ancient structure with which you are not as well acquainted as was the mason who built it but if your information be correct he who made out these bearings must have had better eyes than mine  his eyes said the benedictine have long been closed in death probably when he inspected the monument it was in a more perfect state or he may have derived his information from the tradition of the place  i assure you said i that no such tradition now exists i have made several reconnoissances among the old people in hopes to learn something of the armorial bearings but i never heard of such a circumstance it seems odd that you should have acquired it in a foreign land  these trifling particulars he replied were formerly looked upon as more important and they were sanctified to the exiles who retained recollection of them because they related to a place dear indeed to memory but which their eyes could never again behold it is possible in like manner that on the potomac or susquehannah you may find traditions current concerning places in england which are utterly forgotten in the neighbourhood where they originated but to my purpose in this recess marked by the armorial bearings lies buried a treasure and it is in order to remove it that i have undertaken my present journey  a treasure echoed i in astonishment  yes replied the monk an inestimable treasure for those who know how to use it rightly  i own my ears did tingle a little at the word treasure and that a handsome tilbury with a neat groom in blue and scarlet livery having a smart cockade on his glazed hat seemed as it were to glide across the room before gay eyes while a voice as of a crier pronounced my ear captain clutterbucks tilburydrive up but i resisted the devil and he fled from me  i believe said i all hidden treasure belongs either to the king or the lord of the soil and as i have served his majesty i cannot concern myself in any adventure which may have an end in the court of exchequer  the treasure i seek said the stranger smiling will not be envied by princes or noblesit is simply the heart of an upright man  ah i understand you i answered some relic forgotten in the confusion of the reformation i know the value which men of your persuasion put upon the bodies and limbs of saints i have seen the three kings of cologne  the relics which i seek however said the benedictine are not precisely of that nature the excellent relative whom i have already mentioned amused his leisure hours with putting into form the traditions of his family particularly some remarkable circumstances which took place about the first breaking out of the schism of the church in scotland he became so much interested in his own labours that at length he resolved that the heart of one individual the hero of his tale should rest no longer in a land of heresy now deserted by all his kindred as he knew where it was deposited he formed the resolution to visit his native country for the purpose of recovering this valued relic but age and at length disease interfered with his resolution and it was on his deathbed that he charged me to undertake the task in his stead the various important events which have crowded upon each other our ruin and our exile have for many years obliged me to postpone this delegated duty why indeed transfer the relics of a holy and worthy man to a country where religion and virtue are become the mockery of the scorner i have now a home which i trust may be permanent if any thing in this earth can be termed so thither will i transport the heart of the good father and beside the shrine which it shall occupy i will construct my own grave  he must indeed have been an excellent man replied i whose memory at so distant a period calls forth such strong marks of regard  he was as you justly term him said the ecclesiastic indeed excellentexcellent in his life and doctrineexcellent above all in his selfdenied and disinterested sacrifice of all that life holds dear to principle and to friendship but you shall read his history i shall be happy at once to gratify your curiosity and to show my sense of your kindness if you will have the goodness to procure me the means of accomplishing my object i replied to the benedictine that as the rubbish amongst which he proposed to search was no part of the ordinary burialground and as i was on the best terms with the sexton i had little doubt that i could procure him the means of executing his pious purpose  with this promise we parted for the night and on the ensuing morning i made it my business to see the sexton who for a small gratuity readily granted permission of search on condition however that he should be present himself to see that the stranger removed nothing of intrinsic value  to banes and skulls and hearts if he can find ony he shall be welcome said this guardian of the ruined monastery theres plenty a about an hes curious of them but if there be ony picts meaning perhaps pyx or chalishes or the like of such popish veshells of gold and silver deil hae me an i conneve at their being removed  the sexton also stipulated that our researches should take place at night being unwilling to excite observation or give rise to scandal my new acquaintance and i spent the day as became lovers of hoar antiquity we visited every corner of these magnificent ruins again and again during the forenoon and having made a comfortable dinner at davids we walked in the afternoon to such places in the neighbourhood as ancient tradition or modern conjecture had rendered mark worthy night found us in the interior of the ruins attended by the sexton who carried a dark lantern and stumbling alternately over the graves of the dead and the fragments of that architecture which they doubtless trusted would have canopied their bones till doomsday  i am by no means particularly superstitious and yet there was that in the present service which i did not very much like there was something awful in the resolution of disturbing at such an hour and in such a place the still and mute sanctity of the grave my companions were free from this impressionthe stranger from his energetic desire to execute the purpose for which he cameand the sexton from habitual indifference we soon stood in the aisle which by the account of the benedictine contained the bones of the family of glendinning and were busily employed in removing the rubbish from a corner which the stranger pointed out if a halfpay captain could have represented an ancient borderknight or an exbenedictine of the nineteenth century a wizard monk of the sixteenth we might have aptly enough personified the search after michael scotts lamp and book of magic power but the sexton would have been de trop in the group  footnote this is one of those passages which must now read awkwardly since every one knows that the novelist and the author of the lay of the minstrel is the same person but before the avowal was made the author was forced into this and similar offences against good taste to meet an argument often repeated that there was something very mysterious in the author of waverleys reserve concerning sir walter scott an author sufficiently voluminous at least i had a great mind to remove the passages from this edition but the more candid way is to explain how they came there  ere the stranger assisted by the sexton in his task had been long at work they came to some hewn stones which seemed to have made part of a small shrine though now displaced and destroyed  let us remove these with caution my friend said the stranger lest we injure that which i come to seek  they are prime stanes said the sexton picked free every ane of themwarse than the best wad never serve the monks ise warrant  a minute after he had made this observation he exclaimed i hae fund something now that stands again the spade as if it were neither earth nor stane  the stranger stooped eagerly to assist him  na na haill o my ain said the sexton nae halves or quartersand he lifted from amongst the ruins a small leaden box  you will be disappointed my friend said the benedictine if you expect any thing there but the mouldering dust of a human heart closed in an inner case of porphyry  i interposed as a neutral party and taking the box from the sexton reminded him that if there were treasure concealed in it still it could not become the property of the finder i then proposed that as the place was too dark to examine the contents of the leaden casket we should adjourn to davids where we might have the advantage of light and fire while carrying on our investigation the stranger requested us to go before assuring us that he would follow in a few minutes  i fancy that old mattocks suspected these few minutes might be employed in effecting farther discoveries amongst the tombs for he glided back through a sideaisle to watch the benedictines motions but presently returned and told me in a whisper that the gentleman was on his knees amang the cauld stanes praying like ony saunt  i stole back and beheld the old man actually employed as mattocks had informed me the language seemed to be latin and as the whispered yet solemn accent glided away through the ruined aisles i could not help reflecting how long it was since they had heard the forms of that religion for the exercise of which they had been reared at such cost of time taste labour and expense come away come away said i let us leave him to himself mattocks this is no business of ours  my certes no captain said mattocks neertheless it winna be amiss to keep an eye on him my father rest his saul was a horsecouper and used to say he never was cheated in a naig in his life saving by a westcountry whig frae kilmarnock that said a grace ower a dram o whisky but this gentleman will be a roman ise warrant  you are perfectly right in that saunders said i  ay i have seen twa or three of their priests that were chased ower here some score o years syne they just

i wad hae made nae great charge i wadna hae excised johnnie dead or alivestay seethe strange gentleman is coming  hold the lantern to assist him mattocks said ithis is rough walking sir  yes replied the benedictine i may say with a poet who is doubtless familiar to you  i should be surprised if he were thought i internally  the stranger continued    saint francis be my speed how oft tonight   have my old feet stumbled at graves  we are now clear of the churchyard said i and have but a short walk to davids where i hope we shall find a cheerful fire to enliven us after our nights work  we entered accordingly the little parlour into which mattocks was also about to push himself with sufficient effrontery when david with a most astounding oath expelled him by head and shoulders dning his curiosity that would not let gentlemen be private in their own inn apparently mine host considered his own presence as no intrusion for he crowded up to the table on which i had laid down the leaden box it was frail and wasted as might be guessed from having lain so many years in the ground  on opening it we found deposited within a case made of porphyry as the stranger had announced to us  i fancy he said gentlemen your curiosity will not be satisfiedperhaps i should say that your suspicions will not be removedunless i undo this casket yet it only contains the mouldering remains of a heart once the seat of the noblest thoughts  he undid the box with great caution but the shrivelled substance which it contained bore now no resemblance to what it might once have been the means used having been apparently unequal to preserve its shape and colour although they were adequate to prevent its total decay we were quite satisfied notwithstanding that it was what the stranger asserted the remains of a human heart and david readily promised his influence in the village which was almost coordinate with that of the bailie himself to silence all idle rumours he was moreover pleased to favour us with his company to supper and having taken the lions share of two bottles of sherry he not only sanctioned with his plenary authority the strangers removal of the heart but i believe would have authorized the removal of the abbey itself were it not that it happens considerably to advantage the worthy publicans own custom  the object of the benedictines visit to the land of his forefathers being now accomplished he announced his intention of leaving us early in the ensuing day but requested my company to breakfast with him before his departure i came accordingly and when we had finished our mornings meal the priest took me apart and pulling from his pocket a large bundle of papers he put them into my hands these said he captain clutterbuck are genuine memoirs of the sixteenth century and exhibit in a singular and as i think an interesting point of view the manners of that period i am induced to believe that their publication will not be an unacceptable present to the british public and willingly make over to you any profit that may accrue from such a transaction  i stared a little at this annunciation and observed that the hand seemed too modern for the date he assigned to the manuscript  do not mistake me sir said the benedictine i did not mean to say the memoirs were written in the sixteenth century but only that they were compiled from authentic materials of that period but written in the taste and language of the present day my uncle commenced this book and i partly to improve my habit of english composition partly to divert melancholy thoughts amused my leisure hours with continuing and concluding it you will see the period of the story where my uncle leaves off his narrative and i commence mine in fact they relate in a great measure to different persons as well as to a different period  retaining the papers in my hand i proceeded to state to him my doubts whether as a good protestant i could undertake or superintend a publication written probably in the spirit of popery  you will find he said no matter of controversy in these sheets nor any sentiments stated with which i trust the good in all persuasions will not be willing to join i remembered i was writing for a land unhappily divided from the catholic faith and i have taken care to say nothing which justly interpreted could give ground for accusing me of partiality but if upon collating my narrative with the proofs to which i refer youfor you will find copies of many of the original papers in that parcelyou are of opinion that i have been partial to my own faith i freely give you leave to correct my errors in that respect i own however i am not conscious of this defect and have rather to fear that the catholics may be of opinion that i have mentioned circumstances respecting the decay of discipline which preceded and partly occasioned the great schism called by you the reformation over which i ought to have drawn a veil and indeed this is one reason why i choose the papers should appear in a foreign land and pass to the press through the hands of a stranger  to this i had nothing to reply unless to object my own incompetency to the task the good father was desirous to impose upon me on this subject he was pleased to say more i fear than his knowledge of me fully warrantedmore at any rate than my modesty will permit me to record at length he ended with advising me if i continued to feel the diffidence which i stated to apply to some veteran of literature whose experience might supply my deficiencies upon these terms we parted with mutual expressions of regard and i have never since heard of him  after several attempts to peruse the quires of paper thus singularly conferred on me in which i was interrupted by the most inexplicable fits of yawning i at length in a sort of despair communicated them to our village club from whom they found a more favourable reception than the unlucky conformation of my nerves had been able to afford them they unanimously pronounced the work to be exceedingly good and assured me i would be guilty of the greatest possible injury to our flourishing village if i should suppress what threw such an interesting and radiant light upon the history of the ancient monastery of saint mary  at length by dint of listening to their opinion i became dubious of my own and indeed when i heard passages read forth by the sonorous voice of our worthy pastor i was scarce more tired than i have felt myself at some of his own sermons such and so great is the difference betwixt reading a thing ones self making toilsome way through all the difficulties of manuscript and as the man says in the play having the same read to youit is positively like being wafted over a creek in a boat or wading through it on your feet with the mud up to your knees still however there remained the great difficulty of finding some one who could act as editor corrector at once of the press and of the language which according to the schoolmaster was absolutely necessary  since the trees walked forth to choose themselves a king never was an honour so bandied about the parson would not leave the quiet of his chimneycornerthe bailie pleaded the dignity of his situation and the approach of the great annual fair as reasons against going to edinburgh to make arrangements for printing the benedictines manuscript the schoolmaster alone seemed of malleable stuff and desirous perhaps of emulating the fame of jedediah cleishbotham evinced a wish to undertake this momentous commission but a remonstrance from three opulent farmers whose sons he had at bed board and schooling for twenty pounds per annum ahead came like a frost over the blossoms of his literary ambition and he was compelled to decline the service  in these circumstances sir i apply to you by the advice of our little council of war nothing doubting you will not be disinclined to take the duty upon you as it is much connected with that in which you have distinguished yourself what i request is that you will review or rather revise and correct the enclosed packet and prepare it for the press by such alterations additions and curtailments as you think necessary forgive my hinting to you that the deepest well may be exhaustedthe best corps of grenadiers as our old general of brigade expressed himself may be used up a few hints can do you no harm and for the prizemoney let the battle be first won and it shall be parted at the drumhead i hope you will take nothing amiss that i have said i am a plain soldier and little accustomed to compliments i may add that i should be well contented to march in the front with youthat is to put my name with yours on the titlepage  i have the honour to be sir your unknown humble servant cuthbert clutterbuck  village of kennaquhair  of april 18  for the author of waverley c care of mr john ballantyne hanover street edinburgh                                           answer by the author of waverley  to the foregoing letter from captain clutterbuck   dear captain  do not admire that notwithstanding the distance and ceremony of your address i return an answer in the terms of familiarity the truth is your origin and native country are better known to me than even to yourself  you derive your respectable parentage if i am not greatly mistaken from a land which has afforded much pleasure as well as profit to those who have traded to it successfullyi mean that part of the terra incognita which is called the province of utopia its productions though censured by many and some who use tea and tobacco without scruple as idle and unsubstantial luxuries have nevertheless like many other luxuries a general acceptation and are secretly enjoyed even by those who express the greatest scorn and dislike of them in public the dramdrinker is often the first to be shocked at the smell of spiritsit is not unusual to hear old maiden ladies declaim against scandalthe private bookcases of some graveseeming men would not brook decent eyesand many i say not of the wise and learned but of those most anxious to seem such when the springlock of their library is drawn their velvet cap pulled over their ears their feet insinuated into their turkey slippers are to be found were their retreats suddenly intruded upon busily engaged with the last new novel  i have said the truly wise and learned disdain these shifts and will open the said novel as avowedly as they would the lid of their snuffbox i will only quote one instance though i know a hundred did you know the celebrated watt of birmingham captain clutterbuck i believe not though from what i am about to state he would not have failed to have sought an acquaintance with you it was only once my fortune to meet him whether in body or in spirit it matters not there were assembled about half a score of our northern lights who had amongst them heaven knows how a wellknown character of your country jedediah cleishbotham  this worthy person having come to edinburgh during the christmas vacation had become a sort of lion in the place and was lead in leash from house to house along with the guisards the stoneeater and other amusements of the season which exhibited their unparalleled feats to private familyparties if required amidst this company stood mr watt the man whose genius discovered the means of multiplying our national resources to a degree perhaps even beyond his own stupendous powers of calculation and combination bringing the treasures of the abyss to the summit of the earthgiving the feeble arm of man the momentum of an afritecommanding manufactures to arise as the rod of the prophet produced water in the desertaffording the means of dispensing with that time and tide which wait for no man and of sailing without that wind which defied the commands and threats of xerxes himself  footnote probably the ingenious author alludes to the national adage    the king said sail   but the wind said no  our schoolmaster who is also a land surveyor thinks this whole passage refers to mr watts improvements on the steam enginenote by captain clutterbuck  this potent commander of the elementsthis abridger of time and spacethis magician whose cloudy machinery has produced a change on the world the effects of which extraordinary as they are are perhaps only now beginning to be feltwas not only the most profound man of science the most successful combiner of powers and calculator of numbers as adapted to practical purposeswas not only one of the most generally wellinformedbut one of the best and kindest of human beings  there he stood surrounded by the little band i have mentioned of northern literati men not less tenacious generally speaking of their own fame and their own opinions than the national regiments are supposed to be jealous of the high character which they have won upon service methinks i yet see and hear what i shall never see or hear again in his eightyfifth year the alert kind benevolent old man had his attention alive to every ones question his information at every ones command  his talents and fancy overflowed on every subject one gentleman was a deep philologisthe talked with him on the origin of the alphabet as if he had been coeval with cadmus another a celebrated criticyou would have said the old man had studied political economy and belleslettres all his lifeof science it is unnecessary to speak it was his own distinguished walk and yet captain clutterbuck when he spoke with your countryman jedediah cleishbotham you would have sworn he had been coeval with claverse and burley with the persecutors and persecuted and could number every shot the dragoons had fired at the fugitive covenanters in fact we discovered that no novel of the least celebrity escaped his perusal and that the gifted man of science was as much addicted to the productions of your native country the land of utopia aforesaid in other words as shameless and obstinate a peruser of novels as if he had been a very milliners apprentice of eighteen i know little apology for troubling you with these things excepting the desire to commemorate a delightful evening and a wish to encourage you to shake off that modest diffidence which makes you afraid of being supposed connected with the fairyland of delusive fiction i will requite your tag of verse from horace himself with a paraphrase for your own use my dear captain and for that of your country club excepting in reverence the clergyman and schoolmaster    ne sit ancillae tibi amor pudori c    take thou no scorn   of fiction born   fair fictions muse to woe   old homers theme   was but a dream   himself a fiction too  having told you your country i must next my dear captain clutterbuck make free to mention your own immediate descent you are not to suppose your land of prodigies so little known to us as the careful concealment of your origin would seem to imply but you have it in common with many of your country studiously and anxiously to hide any connexion with it there is this difference indeed betwixt your countrymen and those of our more material world that many of the most estimable of them such as an old highland gentleman called ossian a monk of bristol called rowley and others are inclined to pass themselves off as denizens of the land of reality whereas most of our fellowcitizens who deny their country are such as that country would be very willing to disclaim the especial circumstances you mention relating to your life and services impose not upon us we know the versatility of the unsubstantial species to which you belong permits them to assume all manner of disguises we have seen them apparelled in the caftan of a persian and the silken robe of a chinese footnote see the persian letters and the citizen of the world and are prepared to suspect their real character under every disguise but how can we be ignorant of your country and manners or deceived by the evasion of its inhabitants when the voyages of discovery which have been made to it rival in number those recorded by purchas or by hackluyt footnote see les voyages imaginaires and to show the skill and perseverance of your navigators and travellers we have only to name sindbad aboulfouaris and robinson crusoe these were the men for discoveries could we have sent captain greenland to look out for the northwest passage or peter wilkins to examine baffins bay what discoveries might we not have expected but there are feats and these both numerous and extraordinary performed by the inhabitants of your country which we read without once attempting to emulate  i wander from my purpose which was to assure you that i know you as well as the mother who did not bear you for macduffs peculiarity sticks to your whole race you are not born of woman unless indeed in that figurative sense in which the celebrated maria edgeworth may in her state of single blessedness be termed mother of the finest family in england  you belong sir to the editors of the land of utopia a sort of persons for whom i have the highest esteem how is it possible it should be otherwise when you reckon among your corporation the sage cid hamet benengeli the shortfaced president of the spectators club poor ben silton and many others who have acted as gentlemenushers to works which have cheered our heaviest and added wings to our lightest hours  what i have remarked as peculiar to editors of the class in which i venture to enrol you is the happy combination of fortuitous circumstances which usually put you in possession of the works which you have the goodness to bring into public notice one walks on the seashore and a wave casts on land a small cylindrical trunk or casket containing a manuscript much damaged with seawater which is with difficulty deciphered and so forth footnote see the history of automathes another steps into a chandlers shop to purchase a pound of butter and behold the wastepaper on which it is laid is the manuscript of a cabalist footnote adventures of a guinea a third is so fortunate as to obtain from a woman who lets lodgings the curious contents of an antique bureau the property of a deceased lodger footnote adventures of an atom all these are certainly possible occurrences but i know not how they seldom occur to any editors save those of your country  at least i can answer for myself that in my solitary walks by the sea i never saw it cast ashore any thing but dulse and tangle and now and then a deceased starfish my landlady never presented me with any manuscript save her cursed bill and the most interesting of my discoveries in the way of wastepaper was finding a favourite passage of one of my own novels wrapt round an ounce of snuff no captain the funds from which i have drawn my power of amusing the public have been bought otherwise than by fortuitous adventure i have buried myself in libraries to extract from the nonsense of ancient days new nonsense of my own i have turned over volumes which from the pothooks i was obliged to decipher might have been the cabalistic manuscripts of cornelius agrippa although i never saw the door open and the devil come in footnote see southeys ballad on the young man who read in a conjurors books but all the domestic inhabitants of the libraries were disturbed by the vehemence of my studies    from my research the boldest spider fled   and moths retreating trembled as i read  from this learned sepulchre i emerged like the magician in the persian tales from his twelvemonths residence in the mountain not like him to soar over the heads of the multitude but to mingle in the crowd and to elbow amongst the throng making my way from the highest society to the lowest undergoing the scorn or what is harder to brook the patronizing condescension of the one and enduring the vulgar familiarity of the otherand all you will say for whatto collect materials for one of those manuscripts with which mere chance so often accommodates your countrymen in other words to write a successful novelo athenians how hard we labour to deserve your praise  i might stop here my dear clutterbuck it would have a touching effect and the air of proper deference to our dear public but i will not be false with youthough falsehood isexcuse the observationthe current coin of your country the truth is i have studied and lived for the purpose of gratifying my own curiosity and passing my own time and though the result has been that in one shape or other i have been frequently before the public perhaps more frequently than prudence warranted yet i cannot claim from them the favour due to those who have dedicated their ease and leisure to the improvement and entertainment of others  having communicated thus freely with you my dear captain it follows of course that i will gratefully accept of your communication which as your benedictine observed divides itself both by subject manner and age into two parts but i am sorry i cannot gratify your literary ambition by suffering your name to appear upon the titlepage and i will candidly tell you the reason  the editors of your country are of such a soft and passive disposition that they have frequently done themselves great disgrace by giving up the coadjutors who first brought them into public notice and public favour and suffering their names to be used by those quacks and impostors who live upon the ideas of others thus i shame to tell how the sage cid hamet benengeli was induced by one juan avellaneda to play the turk with the ingenious miguel cervantes and to publish a second part of the adventures of his hero the renowned don quixote without the knowledge or cooperation of his principal aforesaid it is true the arabian sage returned to his allegiance and thereafter composed a genuine continuation of the knight of la mancha in which the said avellaneda of tordesillas is severely chastised for in this you pseudoeditors resemble the jugglers disciplined ape to which a sly old scotsman likened james i if you have jackoo in your hand you can make him bite me if i have jackoo in my hand i can make him bite you yet notwithstanding the amende honorable thus made by cid hamet benengeli his temporary defection did not the less occasion the decease of the ingenious hidalgo don quixote if he can be said to die whose memory is immortal cervantes put him to death lest he should again fall into bad hands awful yet just consequence of cid hamets defection  to quote a more modern and much less important instance i am sorry to observe my old acquaintance jedediah cleishbotham has misbehaved himself so far as to desert his original patron and set up for himself i am afraid the poor pedagogue will make little by his new allies unless the pleasure of entertaining the public and for aught i know the gentlemen of the long robe with disputes about his identity  footnote i am since more correctly informed that mr cleishbotham died some months since at gandercleuch and that the person assuming his name is an impostor the real jedediah made a most christian and edifying end and as i am credibly informed having sent for a cameronian clergyman when he was in extremis was so fortunate as to convince the good man that after all he had no wish to bring down on the scattered remnant of mountain folks the bonnets of bonny dundee hard that the speculators in print and paper will not allow a good man to rest quiet in his grave  this note and the passages in the text were occasioned by a london bookseller having printed as a speculation an additional collection of tales of my landlord which was not so fortunate as to succeed in passing on the world as genuine  observe therefore captain clutterbuck that wise by these great examples i receive you as a partner but a sleeping partner only as i give you no title to employ or use the firm of the copartnery we are about to form i will announce my property in my titlepage and put my own mark on my own chattels which the attorney tells me it will be a crime to counterfeit as much as it would to imitate the autograph of any other empirica crime amounting as advertisements upon little vials assure to us to nothing short of felony  if therefore my dear friend your name should hereafter appear in any titlepage without mine readers will know what to think of you i scorn to use either arguments or threats but you cannot but be sensible that as you owe your literary existence to me on the one hand so on the other your very all is at my disposal i can at pleasure cut off your annuity strike your name from the halfpay establishment nay actually put you to death without being answerable to any one these are plain words to a gentleman who has served during the whole war but i am aware you will take nothing amiss at my hands  and now my good sir let us address ourselves to our task and arrange as we best can the manuscript of your benedictine so as to suit the taste of this critical age you will find i have made very liberal use of his permission to alter whatever seemed too favourable to the church of rome which i abominate were it but for her fasts and penances  our reader is doubtless impatient and we must own with john bunyan    we have too long detaind him in the porch   and kept him from the sunshine with a torch  adieu therefore my dear captainremember me respectfully to the parson the schoolmaster and the bailie and all friends of the happy club in the village of kennaquhair i have never seen and never shall see one of their faces and notwithstanding i believe that as yet i am better acquainted with them than any other man who livesi shall soon introduce you to my jocund friend mr john ballantyne of trinity grove whom you will find warm from his match at singlestick with a brother publisher footnote in consequence of the pseudo tales of my landlord printed in london as already mentioned the late mr john ballantyne the authors publisher had a controversy with the interloping bibliopolist each insisting that his jedediah cleishbotham was the real simon pure peace to their differences it is a wrathful trade and the irritabile genus comprehends the bookselling as well as the bookwriting speciesonce more adieu  the author of waverley                                         the monastery     chapter the first     o ay the monks the monks they did the mischief   theirs all the grossness all the superstition   of a most gross and superstitious age   may he be praised that sent the healthful tempest   and scatterd all these pestilential vapours   but that we owed them all to yonder harlot   throned on the seven hills with her cup of gold   i will as soon believe with kind sir roger   that old moll white took wing with cat arid broomstick   and raised the last nights thunder                                        old play  the village described in the benedictines manuscript by the name of kennaquhair bears the same celtic termination which occurs in traquhair caquhair and other compounds the learned chalmers derives this word quhair from the winding course of a stream a definition which coincides in a remarkable degree with the serpentine turns of the river tweed near the village of which we speak it has been long famous for the splendid monastery of saint mary founded by david the first of scotland in whose reign were formed in the same county the no less splendid establishments of melrose jedburgh and kelso the donations of land with which the king endowed these wealthy fraternities procured him from the monkish historians the epithet of saint and from one of his impoverished descendants the splenetic censure that he had been a sore saint for the crown  it seems probable notwithstanding that david who was a wise as well as a pious monarch was not moved solely by religious motives to those great acts of munificence to the church but annexed political views to his pious generosity his possessions in northumberland and cumberland became precarious after the loss of the battle of the standard and since the comparatively fertile valley of teviotdale was likely to become the frontier of his kingdom it is probable he wished to secure at least a part of these valuable possessions by placing them in the hands of the monks whose property was for a long time respected even amidst the rage of a frontier war in this manner alone had the king some chance of ensuring protection and security to the cultivators of the soil and in fact for several ages the possessions of these abbeys were each a sort of goshen enjoying the calm light of peace and immunity while the rest of the country occupied by wild clans and marauding barons was one dark scene of confusion blood and unremitted outrage  but these immunities did not continue down to the union of the crowns long before that period the wars betwixt england and scotland had lost their original character of international hostilities and had become on the part of the english a struggle for subjugation on that of the scots a desperate and infuriated defence of their liberties this introduced on both sides a degree of fury and animosity unknown to the earlier period of their history and as religious scruples soon gave way to national hatred spurred by a love of plunder the patrimony of the church was no longer sacred from incursions on either side still however the tenants and vassals of the great abbeys had many advantages over those of the lay barons who were harassed by constant military duty until they became desperate and lost all relish for the arts of peace the vassals of the church on the other hand were only liable to be called to arms on general occasions and at other times were permitted in comparative quiet to possess their farms and feus footnote small possessions conferred upon vassals and their heirs held for a small quitrent or a moderate proportion of the produce this was a favourite manner by which the churchmen peopled the patrimony of their convents and many descendants of such feuars as they are culled are still to be found in possession of their family inheritances in the neighbourhood of the great monasteries of scotland they of course exhibited superior skill in every thing that related to the cultivation of the soil and were therefore both wealthier and better informed than the military retainers of the restless chiefs and nobles in their neighbourhood  the residence of these church vassals was usually in a small village or hamlet where for the sake of mutual aid and protection some thirty or forty families dwelt together this was called the town and the land belonging to the various families by whom the town was inhabited was called the township they usually possessed the land in common though in various proportions according to their several grants the part of the township properly arable and kept as such continually under the plough was called infield here the use of quantities of manure supplied in some degree the exhaustion of the soil and the feuars raised tolerable oats and bear footnote or bigg a kind of coarse barley usually sowed on alternate ridges on which the labour of the whole community was bestowed without distinction the produce being divided after harvest agreeably to their respective interests  there was besides outfield land from which it was thought possible to extract a crop now and then after which it was abandoned to the skiey influences until the exhausted powers of vegetation were restored these outfield spots were selected by any feuar at his own choice amongst the sheepwalks and hills which were always annexed to the township to serve as pasturage to the community the trouble of cultivating these patches of outfield and the precarious chance that the crop would pay the  labour were considered as giving a right to any feuar who chose to undertake the adventure to the produce which might result from it  there remained the pasturage of extensive moors where the valleys often afforded good grass and upon which the whole cattle belonging to the community fed indiscriminately during the summer under the charge of the townherd who regularly drove them out to pasture in the morning and brought them back at night without which precaution they would have fallen a speedy prey to some of the snatchers in the neighbourhood these are things to make modern agriculturists hold up their hands and stare but the same mode of cultivation is not yet entirely in desuetude in some distant parts of north britain and may be witnessed in full force and exercise in the zetland archipelago  the habitations of the churchfeuars were not less primitive than their agriculture in each village or town were several small towers having battlements projecting over the side walls and usually an advanced angle or two with shotholes for flanking the doorway which was always defended by a strong door of oak studded with nails and often by an exterior grated door of iron these small peelhouses were ordinarily inhabited by the principal feuars and their families but upon the alarm of approaching danger the whole inhabitants thronged from their own miserable cottages which were situated around to garrison these points of defence it was then no easy matter for a hostile party to penetrate into the village for the men were habituated to the use of bows and firearms and the towers being generally so placed that the discharge from one crossed that of another it was impossible to assault any of them individually  the interior of these houses was usually sufficiently wretched for it would have been folly to have furnished them in a manner which could excite the avarice of their lawless neighbours yet the families themselves exhibited in their appearance a degree of comfort information and independence which could hardly have been expected their infield supplied them with bread and homebrewed ale their herds and flocks with beef and mutton the extravagance of killing lambs or calves was never thought of each family killed a mart or fat bullock in november which was salted up for winter use to which the good wife could upon great occasions add a dish of pigeons or a fat caponthe illcultivated garden afforded langcaleand the river gave salmon to serve as a relish during the season of lent  of fuel they had plenty for the bogs afforded turf and the remains of the abused woods continued to give them logs for burning as well as timber for the usual domestic purposes in addition to these comforts the goodman would now and then sally forth to the greenwood and mark down a buck of season with his gun or his crossbow and the father confessor seldom refused him absolution for the trespass if duly invited to take his share of the smoking haunch some still bolder made either with their own domestics or by associating themselves with the mosstroopers in the language of shepherds a start and overloup and the golden ornaments and silken headgearworn by the females of one or two families of note were invidiously traced by their neighbours to such successful excursions this however was a more inexplicable crime in the eyes of the abbot and community of saint marys than the borrowing one of the gude kings deer and they failed not to discountenance and punish by every means in their power offences which were sure to lead to severe retaliation upon the property of the church and which tended to alter the character of their peaceful vassalage  as for the information possessed by those dependents of the abbacies they might have been truly said to be better fed than taught even though their fare had been worse than it was still however they enjoyed opportunities of knowledge from which others were excluded the monks were in general well acquainted with their vassals and tenants and familiar in the families of the better class among them where they were sure to be received with the respect due to their twofold character of spiritual father and secular landlord thus it often happened when a boy displayed talents and inclination for study one of the brethren with a view to his being bred to the church or out of goodnature in order to pass away his own idle time if he had no better motive initiated him into the mysteries of reading and writing and imparted to him such other knowledge as he himself possessed and the heads of these allied families having more time for reflection and more skill as well as stronger motives for improving their small properties bore amongst their neighbours the character of shrewd intelligent men who claimed respect on account of their comparative wealth even while they were despised for a less warlike and enterprising turn than the other borderers they lived as much as they well could amongst themselves avoiding the company of others and dreading nothing more than to be involved in the deadly feuds and ceaseless contentions of the secular landholders  such is a general picture of these communities during the fatal wars in the commencement of queen marys reign they had suffered dreadfully by the hostile invasions for the english now a protestant people were so far from sparing the churchlands that they forayed them with more unrelenting severity than even the possessions of the laity but the peace of 1550 had restored some degree of tranquillity to those distracted and harassed regions and matters began again gradually to settle upon the former footing the monks repaired their ravaged shrinesthe feuar again roofed his small fortalice which the enemy had ruinedthe poor labourer rebuilt his cottagean easy task where a few sods stones and some pieces of wood from the next copse furnished all the materials necessary the cattle lastly were driven out of the wastes and thickets in which the remnant of them had been secreted and the mighty bull moved at the head of his seraglio and their followers to take possession of their wonted pastures there ensued peace and quiet the state of the age and nation considered to the monastery of saint mary and its dependencies for several tranquil years     chapter the second     in yon lone vale his early youth was bred   not solitary thenthe buglehorn   of fell alecto often waked its windings   from where the brook joins the majestic river   to the wild northern bog the curlews haunt   where oozes forth its first and feeble streamlet                                            old play  we have said that most of the feuars dwelt in the village belonging to their townships this was not however universally the case a lonely tower to which the reader must now be introduced was at least one exception to the general rule  it was of small dimensions yet larger than those which occurred in the village as intimating that in case of assault the proprietor would have to rely upon his own unassisted strength two or three miserable huts at the foot of the fortalice held the bondsmen and tenants of the feuar the site was a beautiful green knoll which started up suddenly in the very throat of a wild and narrow glen and which being surrounded except on one side by the winding of a small stream afforded a position of considerable strength  but the great security of glendearg for so the place was called lay in its secluded and almost hidden situation to reach the tower it was necessary to travel three miles up the glen crossing about twenty times the little stream which winding through the narrow valley encountered at every hundred yards the opposition of a rock or precipitous bank on the one side which altered its course and caused it to shoot off in an oblique direction to the other the hills which ascend on each side of this glen are very steep and rise boldly over the stream which is thus imprisoned within their barriers the sides of the glen are impracticable for horse and are only to be traversed by means of the sheeppaths which lie along their sides it would not be readily supposed that a road so hopeless and so difficult could lead to any habitation more important than the summer shealing of a shepherd  yet the glen though lonely nearly inaccessible and sterile was not then absolutely void of beauty the turf which covered the small portion of level ground on the sides of the stream was as close and verdant as if it had occupied the scythes of a hundred gardeners once afortnight and it was garnished with an embroidery of daisies and wild flowers which the scythes would certainly have destroyed the little brook now confined betwixt closer limits now left at large to choose its course through the narrow valley danced carelessly on from stream to pool light and unturbid as that better class of spirits who pass their way through life yielding to insurmountable obstacles but as far from being subdued by them as the sailor who meets by chance with an unfavourable wind and shapes his course so as to be driven back as little as possible  the mountains as they would have been called in england scottice the steep braes rose abruptly over the little glen here presenting the gray face of a rock from which the turf had been peeled by the torrents and there displaying patches of wood and copse which had escaped the waste of the cattle and the sheep of the feuars and which feathering naturally up the beds of empty torrents or occupying the concave recesses of the bank gave at once beauty and variety to the landscape above these scattered woods rose the hill in barren but purple majesty the dark rich hue particularly in autumn contrasting beautifully with the thickets of oak and birch the mountain ashes and thorns the alders and quivering aspens which checquered and varied the descent and not less with the darkgreen and velvet turf which composed the level part of the narrow glen  yet though thus embellished the scene could neither be strictly termed sublime nor beautiful and scarcely even picturesque or striking but its extreme solitude pressed on the heart the traveller felt that uncertainty whither he was going or in what so wild a path was to terminate which at times strikes more on the imagination than the grand features of a showscene when you know the exact distance of the inn where your dinner is bespoke and at the moment preparing these are ideas however of a far later age for at the time we treat of the picturesque the beautiful the sublime and all their intermediate shades were ideas absolutely unknown to the inhabitants and occasional visitors of glendearg  these had however attached to the scene feelings fitting the time its name signifying the red valley seems to have been derived not only from the purple colour of the heath with which the upper part of the rising banks was profusely clothed but also from the dark red colour of the rocks and of the precipitous earthen banks which in that country are called scaurs another glen about the head of ettrick has acquired the same name from similar circumstances and there are probably more in scotland to which it has been given  as our glendearg did not abound in mortal visitants superstition that it might not be absolutely destitute of inhabitants had peopled its recesses with beings belonging to another world the savage and capricious brown man of the moors a being which seems the genuine descendant of the northern dwarfs was supposed to be seen there frequently especially after the autumnal equinox when the fogs were thick and objects not easily distinguished the scottish fairies too a whimsical irritable and mischievous tribe who though at times capriciously benevolent were more frequently adverse to mortals were also supposed to have formed a residence in a particularly wild recess of the glen of which the real name was in allusion to that circumstance corrie nan shian which in corrupted celtic signifies the hollow of the fairies but the neighbours were more cautious in speaking about this place and avoided giving it a name from an idea common then throughout all the british and celtic provinces of scotland and still retained in many places that to speak either good or ill of this capricious race of imaginary beings is to provoke their resentment and that secrecy and silence is what they chiefly desire from those who may intrude upon their revels or discover their haunts  a mysterious terror was thus attached to the dale which afforded access from the broad valley of the tweed up the little glen we have described to the fortalice called the tower of glendearg beyond the knoll where as we have said the tower was situated the hills grew more steep and narrowed on the slender brook so as scarce to leave a footpath and there the glen terminated in a wild waterfall where a slender thread of water dashed in a precipitous line of foam over two or three precipices yet farther in the same direction and above these successive cataracts lay a wild and extensive morass frequented only by waterfowl wide waste apparently almost interminable and serving in a great measure to separate the inhabitants of the glen from those who lived to the northward  to restless and indefatigable mosstroopers indeed these morasses were well known and sometimes afforded a retreat they often rode down the glencalled at this towerasked and received hospitalitybut still with a sort of reserve on the part of its more peaceful inhabitants who entertained them as a party of northamerican indians might be received by a new european settler as much out of fear as hospitality while the uppermost wish of the landlord is the speedy departure of the savage guests  this had not always been the current of feeling in the little valley and its tower simon glendinning its former inhabitant boasted his connexion by blood to that ancient family of glendonwyne on the western border he used to narrate at his fireside in the autumn evenings the feats of the family to which he belonged one of whom fell by the side of the brave earl of douglas at otterbourne on these occasions simon usually held upon his knee an ancient broadsword which had belonged to his ancestors before any of the family had consented to accept a fief under the peaceful dominion of the monks of st marys in modern days simon might have lived at ease on his own estate and quietly murmured against the fate that had doomed him to dwell there and cut off his access to martial renown but so many opportunities nay so many calls there were for him who in those days spoke big to make good his words by his actions that simon glendinning was soon under the necessity of marching with the men of the halidome as it was called of st marys in that disastrous campaign which was concluded by the battle of pinkie  the catholic clergy were deeply interested in that national quarrel the principal object of which was to prevent the union of the infant queen mary with the son of the heretical henry viii the monks had called out their vassals under an experienced leader many of themselves had taken arms and marched to the field under a banner representing a female supposed to personify the scottish church kneeling in the attitude of prayer with the legend afflictae sponsae ne obliviscaris footnote forget not the afflicted spouse  the scots however in all their wars had more occasion for good and cautious generals than for excitation whether political or enthusiastic their headlong and impatient courage uniformly induced them to rush into action without duly weighing either their own situation or that of their enemies and the inevitable consequence was frequent defeat with the dolorous slaughter of pinkie we have nothing to do excepting that among ten thousand men of low and high degree simon glendinning of the tower of glendearg bit the dust no way disparaging in his death that ancient race from which he claimed his descent  when the doleful news which spread terror and mourning through the whole of scotland reached the tower of glendearg the widow of simon elspeth brydone by her family name was alone in that desolate habitation excepting a hind or two alike past martial and agricultural labour and the helpless widows and families of those who had fallen with their master the feeling of desolation was universalbut what availed it the monks their patrons and protectors were driven from their abbey by the english forces who now overran the country and enforced at least an appearance of submission on the part of the inhabitants the protector somerset formed a strong camp among the ruins of the ancient castle of roxburgh and compelled the neighbouring country to come in pay tribute and take assurance from him as the phrase then went indeed there was no power of resistance remaining and the few barons whose high spirit disdained even the appearance of surrender could only retreat into the wildest fastnesses of the country leaving their houses and property to the wrath of the english who detached parties everywhere to distress by military exaction those whose chiefs had not made their submission the abbot and his community having retreated beyond the forth their lands were severely forayed as their sentiments were held peculiarly inimical to the alliance with england  amongst the troops detached on this service was a small party commanded by stawarth bolton a captain in the english army and full of the blunt and unpretending gallantry and generosity which has so often distinguished that nation resistance was in vain elspeth brydone when she descried a dozen of horsemen threading their way up the glen with a man at their head whose scarlet cloak bright armour and dancing plume proclaimed him a leader saw no better protection for herself than to issue from the iron grate covered with a long mourning veil and holding one of her two sons in each hand to meet the englishmanstate her deserted conditionplace the little tower at his commandand beg for his mercy she stated in a few brief words her intention and added i submit because i have nae means of resistance  and i do not ask your submission mistress for the same reason replied the englishman to be satisfied of your peaceful intentions is all i ask and from what you tell me there is no reason to doubt them  at least sir said elspeth brydone take share of what our spence and our garners afford your horses are tiredyour folk want refreshment  not a whitnot a whit answered the honest englishman it shall never be said we disturbed by carousal the widow of a brave soldier while she was mourning for her husbandcomrades face aboutyet stay he added checking his warhorse my parties are out in every direction they must have some token that your family are under my assurance of safetyhere my little fellow said he speaking to the eldest boy who might be about nine or ten years old lend me thy bonnet  the child reddened looked sulky and hesitated while the mother with many a fye and nay pshaw and such sarsenet chidings as tender mothers give to spoiled children at length succeeded in snatching the bonnet from him and handing it to the english leader  stawarth bolton took his embroidered red cross from his barretcap and putting it into the loop of the boys bonnet said to the mistress for the title of lady was not given to dames of her degree by this token which all my people will respect you will be freed from any importunity on the part of our forayers footnote as gallantry of all times and nations has the same mode of thinking and acting so it often expresses itself by the same symbols in the civil war 17456 a party of highlanders under a chieftain of rank came to rose castle the seat of the bishop of carlisle but then occupied by the family of squire dacre of cumberland  they demanded quarters which of course were not to be refused to armed men of a strange attire and unknown language but the domestic represented to the captain of the mountaineers that the lady of the mansion had been just delivered of a daughter and expressed her hope that under these circumstances his party would give as little trouble as possible god forbid said the gallant chief that i or mine should be the means of adding to a ladys inconvenience at such a time may i request to see the infant the child was brought and the highlander taking his cockade out of his bonnet and pinning it on the childs breast that will be a token he said to any of our people who may come hither that donald mcdonald of kinlochmoidart has taken the family of rose castle under his protection the lady who received in infancy this gage of highland protection is now mary lady clerk of pennycuik and on the 10th of june still wears the cockade which was pinned on her breast with a white rose as a kindred decoration he placed it on the boys head but it was no sooner there than the little fellow his veins swelling and his eyes shooting fire through tears snatched the bonnet from his head and ere his mother could interfere skimmed it into the brook the other boy ran instantly to fish it out again threw it back to his brother first taking out the cross which with great veneration he kissed and put into his bosom the englishman was half diverted half surprised with the scene  what mean ye by throwing away saint georges red cross said he to the elder boy in a tone betwixt jest and earnest  because saint george is a southern saint said the child sulkily goodsaid stawarth boltonand what did you mean by taking it out of the brook again my little fellow he demanded of the younger because the priest says it is the common sign of salvation to all good christians  why good again said the honest soldier i protest unto you mistress i envy you these boys are they both yours  stawarth bolton had reason to put the question for halbert glendinning the elder of the two had hair as dark as the ravens plumage black eyes large bold and sparkling that glittered under eyebrows of the same complexion a skin deep embrowned though it could not be termed swarthy and an air of activity frankness and determination far beyond his age  on the other hand edward the younger brother was lighthaired blueeyed and of fairer complexion in countenance rather pale and not exhibiting that rosy hue which colours the sanguine cheek of robust health yet the boy had nothing sickly or illconditioned in his look but was on the contrary a fair and handsome child with a smiling face and mild yet cheerful eye  the mother glanced a proud motherly glance first at the one and then at the other ere she answered the englishman surely sir they are both my children  and by the same father mistress said stawarth but seeing a blush of displeasure arise on her brow he instantly added nay i mean no offence i would have asked the same question at any of my gossips in merry lincolnwell dame you have two fair boys i would i could borrow one for dame bolton and i live childless in our old hallcome little fellows which of you will go with me  the trembling mother halffearing as he spoke drew the children towards her one with either hand while they both answered the stranger i will not go with you said halbert boldly for you are a falsehearted southern and the southerns killed my father and i will war on you to the death when i can draw my fathers sword  godamercy my little levinbolt said stawarth the goodly custom of deadly feud will never go down in thy day i presumeand you my fine whitehead will you not go with me to ride a cockhorse no said edward demurely for you are a heretic  why godamercy still said stawarth bolton well dame i see i shall find no recruits for my troop from you and yet i do envy you these two little chubby knaves he sighed a moment as was visible in spite of gorget and corslet and then added and yet my dame and i would but quarrel which of the knaves we should like best for i should wish for the blackeyed rogueand she i warrant me for that blueeyed fairhaired darling natheless we must brook our solitary wedlock and wish joy to those that are more fortunate sergeant brittson do thou remain here till recalledprotect this family as under assurancedo them no wrong and suffer no wrong to be done to them as thou wilt answer itdame brittson is a married man old and steady feed him on what you will but give him not over much liquor  dame glendinning again offered refreshments but with a faltering voice and an obvious desire her invitation should not be accepted the fact was that supposing her boys as precious in the eyes of the englishman as in her own the most ordinary of parental errors she was half afraid that the admiration he expressed of them in his blunt manner might end in his actually carrying off one or other of the little darlings whom he appeared to covet so much she kept hold of their hands therefore as if her feeble strength could have been of service had any violence been intended and saw with joy she could not disguise the little party of horse countermarch in order to descend the glen her feelings did not escape bolton i forgive you dame he said for being suspicious that an english falcon was hovering over your scottish moorbrood but fear notthose who have fewest children have fewest cares nor does a wise man covet those of another household adieu dame when the blackeyed rogue is able to drive a foray from england teach him to spare women and children for the sake of stawarth bolton  god be with you gallant southern said elspeth glendinning but not till he was out of hearing spurring on his good horse to regain the head of his party whose plumage and armour were now glancing and gradually disappearing in the distance as they winded down the glen  mother said the elder boy i will not say amen to a prayer for a southern  mother said the younger more reverentially is it right to pray for a heretic  the god to whom i pray only knows answered poor elspeth but these two words southern and heretic have already cost scotland ten thousand of her best and bravest and me a husband and you a father and whether blessing or banning i never wish to hear them morefollow me to the place sir she said to brittson and such as we have to offer you shall be at your disposal     chapter the third     they lighted down on tweed water     and blew their coals sae het   and fired the march and teviotdale      all in an evening late                        auld maitland  the report soon spread through the patrimony of saint marys and its vicinity that the mistress of glendearg had received assurance from the english captain and that her cattle were not to be driven off or her corn burned among others who heard this report it reached the ears of a lady who once much higher in rank than elspeth glendinning was now by the same calamity reduced to even greater misfortune  she was the widow of a brave soldier walter avenel descended of a very ancient border family who once possessed immense estates in eskdale  these had long since passed from them into other hands but they still enjoyed an ancient barony of considerable extent not very far from the patrimony of saint marys and lying upon the same side of the river with the narrow vale of glendearg at the head of which was the little tower of the glendinnings here they had lived bearing a respectable rank amongst the gentry of their province though neither wealthy nor powerful this general regard had been much augmented by the skill courage and enterprise which had been displayed by walter avenel the last baron  when scotland began to recover from the dreadful shock she had sustained after the battle of pinkiecleuch avenel was one of the first who assembling a small force set an example in those bloody and unsparing skirmishes which showed that a nation though conquered and overrun by invaders may yet wage against them such a war of detail as shall in the end become fatal to the foreigners in one of these however walter avenel fell and the news which came to the house of his fathers was followed by the distracting intelligence that a party of englishmen were coming to plunder the mansion and lands of his widow in order by this act of terror to prevent others from following the example of the deceased  the unfortunate lady had no better refuge than the miserable cottage of a shepherd among the hills to which she was hastily removed scarce conscious where or for what purpose her terrified attendants were removing her and her infant daughter from her own house here she was tended with all the duteous service of ancient times by the shepherds wife tibb tacket who in better days had been her own bowerwoman for a time the lady was unconscious of her misery but when the first stunning effect of grief was so far passed away that she could form an estimate of her own situation the widow of avenel had cause to envy the lot of her husband in his dark and silent abode the domestics who had guided her to her place of refuge were presently obliged to disperse for their own safety or to seek for necessary subsistence and the shepherd and his wife whose poor cottage she shared were soon after deprived of the means of affording their late mistress even that coarse sustenance which they had gladly shared with her  some of the english forayers had discovered and driven off the few sheep which had escaped the first researches of their avarice two cows shared the fate of the remnant of their stock they had afforded the family almost their sole support and now famine appeared to stare them in the face  we are broken and beggared now out and out said old martin the shepherdand he wrung his hands in the bitterness of agony the thieves the harrying thieves i not a cloot left of the haill hirsel  and to see poor grizzle and crumbie said his wife turning back their necks to the byre and routing while the stonyhearted villains were brogging them on wi their lances  there were but four of them said martin and i have seen the day forty wad not have ventured this length but our strength and manhood is gane with our puir maister  for the sake of the holy rood whisht man said the goodwife our leddy is half gane already as ye may see by that fleightering of the eelida word mair and shes dead outright  i could almost wish said martin we were a gane for what to do passes my puir wit i care little for mysell or you tibbwe can make a fendwork or wantwe can do baith but she can do neither  they canvassed their situation thus openly before the lady convinced by the paleness of her look her quivering lip and deadset eye that she neither heard nor understood what they were saying  there is a way said the shepherd but i kenna if she could bring her heart to ittheres simon glendinnings widow of the glen yonder has had assurance from the southern loons and nae soldier to steer them for one cause or other now if the leddy could bow her mind to take quarters with elspeth glendinning till better days cast up nae doubt it wad be doing an honour to the like of her but  an honour answered tibb ay by my word sic an honour as wad be pride to her kin mony a lang year after her banes were in the mould oh gudeman to hear ye even the lady of avenel to seeking quarters wi a kirkvassals widow  loath should i be to wish her to it said martin but what may we doto stay here is mere starvation and where to go im sure i ken nae mair than ony tup i ever herded  speak no more of it said the widow of avenel suddenly joining in the conversation i will go to the towerdame elspeth is of good folk a widow and the mother of orphansshe will give us houseroom until something be thought upon these evil showers make the low bush better than no bield  see there see there said martin you see the leddy has twice our sense  and natural it is said tibb seeing that she is conventbred and can lay silk broidery forby whiteseam and shellwork  do you not think said the lady to martin still clasping her child to her bosom and making it clear from what motives she desired

these wars and gie me a thought of time to it i can do as good a days darg as ever i did in my life and tibb can sort cows with ony living woman  and muckle mair could i do said tibb were it ony

muir and that is nae easy walk for a leddy born and bred  household stuff there was little or none to remove or care for an old pony which had escaped the plunderers owing partly to its pitiful appearance partly from the reluctance which it showed to be caught by strangers was employed to carry the few blankets and other trifles which they possessed when shagram came to his masters wellknown whistle he was surprised to find the poor thing had been wounded though slightly by an arrow which one of the forayers had shot off in anger after he had long chased it in vain  ay shagram said the old man as he applied something to the wound must you rue the langbow as weel as all of us  what corner in scotland rues it not said the lady of avenel  ay ay madam said martin god keep the kindly scot from the clothyard shaft and he will keep himself from the handy stroke but let us go our way the trash that is left i can come back for there is nae ane to stir it but the good neighbours and they  for the love of god goodman said his wife in a remonstrating tone haud your peace think what yere saying and we hae sae muckle wild land to go over before we win to the girth gate  the husband nodded acquiescence for it was deemed highly imprudent to speak of the fairies either by their title of good neighbours or by any other especially when about to pass the places which they were supposed to haunt  footnote this superstition continues to prevail though one would suppose it must now be antiquated it is only a year or two since an itinerant puppet showman who disdaining to acknowledge the profession of gines de passamonte called himself an artist from vauxhall brought a complaint of a singular nature before the author as sheriff of selkirkshire the singular dexterity with which the showman had exhibited the machinery of his little stage had upon a selkirk fairday excited the eager curiosity of some mechanics of galashiels these men from no worse motive that could be discovered than a thirst after knowledge beyond their sphere committed a burglary upon the barn in which the puppets had been consigned to repose and carried them off in the nook of their plaids when returning from selkirk to their own village    but with the morning cool reflection came  the party found however they could not make punch dance and that the whole troop were equally intractable they had also perhaps some apprehensions of the rhadamanth of the district and willing to be quit of their booty they left the puppets seated in a grove by the side of the ettrick where they were sure to be touched by the first beams of the rising sun here a shepherd who was on foot with sunrise to pen his masters sheep on a field of turnips to his utter astonishment saw this train profusely gay sitting in the little grotto his examination proceeded thus  sheriff you saw these gaylooking things what did you think they were  shepherd ou i am no that free to say what i might think they were  sheriff come lad i must have a direct answerwho did you think they were  shepherd ou sir troth i am no that free to say that i mind wha i might think they were  sheriff come come sir i ask you

mind oh who could have believed that the head which a few years since was cradled amongst so many rejoicing friends may perhaps this night seek a cover in vain  the exiled family then set forwardmary avenel a lovely girl between five and six years old riding gipsy fashion upon shagram betwixt two bundles of bedding the lady of avenel walking by the animals side tibb leading the bridle and old martin walking a little before looking anxiously around him to explore the way  martins task as guide after two or three miles walking became more difficult than he himself had expected or than he was willing to avow it happened that the extensive range of pasturage with which he was conversant lay to the west and to get into the little valley of glendearg he had to proceed easterly in the wilder districts of scotland the passage from one vale to another otherwise than by descending that which you leave and reascending the other is often very difficultheights and hollows mosses and rocks intervene and all those local impediments which throw a traveller out of his course so that martin however sure of his general direction became conscious and at length was forced reluctantly to admit that he had missed the direct road to glendearg though he insisted they must be very near it if we can but win across this wide bog he said i shall warrant ye are on the top of the tower but to get across the bog was a point of no small difficulty the farther they ventured into it though proceeding with all the caution which martins experience recommended the more unsound the ground became until after they had passed some places of great peril their best argument for going forward came to be that they had to encounter equal danger in returning  the lady of avenel had been tenderly nurtured but what will not a woman endure when her child is in danger complaining less of the dangers of the road than her attendants who had been inured to such from their infancy she kept herself close by the side of the pony watching its every footstep and ready if it should flounder in the morass to snatch her little mary from its back at length they came to a place where the guide greatly hesitated for all around him was broken lumps of heath divided from each other by deep sloughs of black tenacious mire after great consideration martin selecting what he thought the safest path began himself to lead forward shagram in order to afford greater security to the child but shagram snorted laid his ears back stretched his two feet forward and drew his hind feet under him so as to adopt the best possible posture for obstinate resistance and refused to move one yard in the direction indicated old martin much puzzled now hesitated whether to exert his absolute authority or to defer to the contumacious obstinacy of shagram and was not greatly comforted by his wifes observation who seeing shagram stare with his eyes distend his nostrils and tremble with terror hinted that he surely saw more than they could see  in this dilemma the child suddenly exclaimedbonny leddy signs to us to come yon gate they all looked in the direction where the child pointed but saw nothing save a wreath of rising mist which fancy might form into a human figure but which afforded to martin only the sorrowful conviction that the danger of their situation was about to be increased by a heavy fog he once more essayed to lead forward shagram but the animal was inflexible in its determination not to move in the direction martin recommended take your awn way for it then said martin and let us see what you can do for us  shagram abandoned to the discretion of his own freewill set off boldly in the direction the child had pointed there was nothing wonderful in this nor in its bringing them safe to the other side of the dangerous morass for the instinct of these animals in traversing bogs is one of the most curious parts of their nature and is a fact generally established  but it was remarkable that the child more than once mentioned the beautiful lady and her signals and that shagram seemed to be in the secret always moving in the same direction which she indicated the lady of avenel took little notice at the time her mind being probably occupied by the instant danger but her attendants changed expressive looks with each other more than once  allhallow eve said tibb in a whisper to martin  for the mercy of our lady not a word of that now said martin in reply tell your beads woman if you cannot be silent  when they got once more on firm ground martin recognized certain landmarks or cairns on the tops of the neighbouring hills by which he was enabled to guide his course and ere long they arrived at the tower of glendearg  it was at the sight of this little fortalice that the misery of her lot pressed hard on the poor lady of avenel when by any accident they had met at church market or other place of public resort she remembered the distant and respectful air with which the wife of the warlike baron was addressed by the spouse of the humble feuar and now so much was her pride humbled that she was to ask to share the precarious safety of the same feuars widow and her pittance of food which might perhaps be yet more precarious martin probably guessed what was passing in her mind for he looked at her with a wistful glance as if to deprecate any change of resolution and answering to his looks rather than his words she said while the sparkle of subdued pride once more glanced from her eye if it were for myself alone i could but diebut for this infantthe last pledge of avenel  true my lady said martin hastily and as if to prevent the possibility of her retracting he added i will step on and see dame elspethi kend her husband weel and have bought and sold with him for as great a man as he was  martins tale was soon told and met all acceptance from her companion in misfortune the lady of avenel had been meek and courteous in her prosperity in adversity therefore she met with the greatest sympathy  besides there was a point of pride in sheltering and supporting a woman of such superior birth and rank and not to do elspeth glendinning injustice she felt sympathy for one whose fate resembled her own in so many points yet was so much more severe every species of hospitality was gladly and respectfully extended to the distressed travellers and they were kindly requested to stay as long at glendearg as their circumstances rendered necessary or their inclination prompted     chapter the fourth      neer be i found by thee unawed    on that thrice hallowd eve abroad    when goblins haunt from flood and fen                          the steps of men                             collinss ode to fear  as the country became more settled the lady of avenel would have willingly returned to her husbands mansion but that was no longer in her power it was a reign of minority when the strongest had the best right and when acts of usurpation were frequent amongst those who had much power and little conscience  julian avenel the younger brother of the deceased walter was a person of this description he hesitated not to seize upon his brothers house and lands so soon as the retreat of the english permitted him at first he occupied the property in the name of his niece but when the lady proposed to return with her child to the mansion of its fathers he gave her to understand that avenel being a male fief descended to the brother instead of the daughter of the last possessor  the ancient philosopher declined a dispute with the emperor who commanded twenty legions and the widow of walter avenel was in no condition to maintain a contest with the leader of twenty mosstroopers julian was also a man of service who could back a friend in case of need and was sure therefore to find protectors among the ruling powers in short however clear the little marys right to the possessions of her father her mother saw the necessity of giving way at least for the time to the usurpation of her uncle  her patience and forbearance were so far attended with advantage that julian for very shames sake could no longer suffer her to be absolutely dependant on the charity of elspeth glendinning a drove of cattle and a bull which were probably missed by some english farmer were driven to the pastures of glendearg presents of raiment and household stuff were sent liberally and some little money though with a more sparing hand for those in the situation of julian avenel could come more easily by the goods than the representing medium of value and made their payments chiefly in kind  in the meantime the widows of walter avenel and simon glendinning had become habituated to each others society and were unwilling to part the lady could hope no more secret and secure residence than in the tower of glendearg and she was now in a condition to support her share of the mutual housekeeping elspeth on the other hand felt pride as well as pleasure in the society of a guest of such distinction and was at all times willing to pay much greater deference than the lady of walter avenel could be prevailed on to accept  martin and his wife diligently served the united family in their several vocations and yielded obedience to both mistresses though always considering themselves as the especial servants of the lady of avenel this distinction sometimes occasioned a slight degree of difference between dame elspeth and tibb the former being jealous of her own consequence and the latter apt to lay too much stress upon the rank and family of her mistress  but both were alike desirous to conceal such petty squabbles from the lady her hostess scarce yielding to her old domestic in respect for her person neither did the difference exist in such a degree as to interrupt the general harmony of the family for the one wisely gave way as she saw the other become warm and tibb though she often gave the first provocation had generally the sense to be the first in relinquishing the argument  the world which lay beyond was gradually forgotten by the inhabitants of this sequestered glen and unless when she attended mass at the monastery church upon some high holiday alice of avenel almost forgot that she once held an equal rank with the proud wives of the neighbouring barons and nobles who on such occasions crowded to the solemnity the recollection gave her little pain she loved her husband for himself and in his inestimable loss all lesser subjects of regret had ceased to interest her at times indeed she thought of claiming the protection of the queen regent mary of guise for her little orphan but the fear of julian avenel always came between she was sensible that he would have neither scruple nor difficulty in spiriting away the child if he did not proceed farther should he once consider its existence as formidable to his interest besides he led a wild and unsettled life mingling in all feuds and forays wherever there was a spear to be broken he evinced no purpose of marrying and the fate which he continually was braving might at length remove him from his usurped inheritance alice of avenel therefore judged it wise to check all ambitious thoughts for the present and remain quiet in the rude but peaceable retreat to which providence had conducted her  it was upon an allhallows eve when the family had resided together for the space of three years that the domestic circle was assembled round the blazing turffire in the old narrow hall of the tower of glendearg the idea of the master or mistress of the mansion feeding or living apart from their domestics was at this period never entertained the highest end of the board the most commodious settle by the firethese were the only marks of distinction and the servants mingled with deference indeed but unreproved and with freedom in whatever conversation was going forward  but the two or three domestics kept merely for agricultural purposes had retired to their own cottages without and with them a couple of wenches usually employed within doors the daughters of one of the hinds  after their departure martin locked first the iron grate and secondly the inner door of the tower when the domestic circle was thus arranged  dame elspeth sate pulling the thread from her distaff tibb watched the progress of scalding the whey which hung in a large pot upon the crook a chain terminated by a hook which was suspended in the chimney to serve the purpose of the modern crane martin while busied in repairing some of the household articles for every man in those days was his own carpenter and smith as well as his own tailor and shoemaker kept from time to time a watchful eye upon the three children  they were allowed however to exercise their juvenile restlessness by running up and down the hall behind the seats of the elder members of the family with the privilege of occasionally making excursions into one or two small apartments which opened from it and gave excellent opportunity to play at hideandseek this night however the children seemed not disposed to avail themselves of their privilege of visiting these dark regions but preferred carrying on their gambols in the vicinity of the light  in the meanwhile alice of avenel sitting close to an iron candlestick which supported a misshapen torch of domestic manufacture read small detached passages from a thick clasped volume which she preserved with the greatest care the art of reading the lady had acquired by her residence in a nunnery during her youth but she seldom of late years put it to any other use than perusing this little volume which formed her whole library  the family listened to the portions which she selected as to some good thing which there was a merit in hearing with respect whether it was fully understood or no to her daughter alice of avenel had determined to impart their mystery more fully but the knowledge was at that period attended with personal danger and was not rashly to be trusted to a child  the noise of the romping children interrupted from time to time the voice of the lady and drew on the noisy culprits the rebuke of elspeth  could they not go farther afield if they behoved to make such a din and disturb the ladys good words and this command was backed with the threat of sending the whole party to bed if it was not attended to punctually  acting under the injunction the children first played at a greater distance from the party and more quietly and then began to stray into the adjacent apartments as they became impatient of the restraint to which they were subjected but all at once the two boys came openmouthed into the hall to tell that there was an armed man in the spence  it must be christie of clinthill said martin rising what can have brought him here at this time  or how came he in said elspeth  alas what can he seek said the lady of avenel to whom this man a retainer of her husbands brother and who sometimes executed his commissions at glendearg was an object of secret apprehension and suspicion  gracious heavens she added rising up where is my child all rushed to the spence halbert glendinning first arming himself with a rusty sword and the younger seizing upon the ladys book they hastened to the spence and were relieved of a part of their anxiety by meeting mary at the door of the apartment she did not seem in the slightest degree alarmed or disturbed they rushed into the spence a sort of interior apartment in which the family ate their victuals in the summer season but there was no one there  where is christie of clinthill said martin  i do not know said little mary i never saw him  and what made you ye misleard loons said dame elspeth to her two boys come yon gate into the ha roaring like bullsegs to frighten the leddy and her far frae strong the boys looked at each other in silence and confusion and their mother proceeded with her lecture could ye find nae night for daffin but halloween and nae time but when the leddy was reading to us about the holy saints may neer be in my fingers if i dinna sort ye baith for it the eldest boy bent his eyes on the ground the younger began to weep but neither spoke and the mother would have proceeded to extremities but for the interposition of the little maiden  dame elspeth it was my faulti did say to them that i saw a man in the spence  and what made you do so child said her mother to startle us all thus  because said mary lowering her voice i could not help it  not help it maryyou occasioned all this idle noise and you could not help it how mean you by that minion  there really was an armed man in this spence said mary and because i was surprised to see him i cried out to halbert and edward  she has told it herself said halbert glendinning or it had never been told by me  nor by me neither said edward emulously  mistress mary said elspeth you never told us anything before that was not true tell us if this was a halloween cantrip and make an end of it the lady of avenel looked as if she would have interfered but knew not how and elspeth who was too eagerly curious to regard any distant hint persevered in her inquiries was it christie of the clinthilli would not for a mark that he were about the house and a body no ken whare  it was not christie said mary it wasit was a gentlemana gentleman with a bright breastplate like what i hae seen langsyne when we dwelt at avenel  what like was he continued tibb who now took share in the investigation  blackhaired blackeyed with a peaked black beard said the child and many a fold of pearling round his neck and hanging down his breast ower his breastplate and he had a beautiful hawk with silver bells standing on his left hand with a crimson silk hood upon its head  ask her no more questions for the love of god said the anxious menial to elspeth but look to my leddy but the lady of avenel taking mary in her hand turned hastily away and walking into the hall gave them no opportunity of remarking in what manner she received the childs communication which she thus cut short what tibb thought of it appeared from her crossing herself repeatedly and whispering into elspeths ear saint mary preserve usthe lassie has seen her father  when they reached the hall they found the lady holding her daughter on her knee and kissing her repeatedly when they entered she again arose as if to shun observation and retired to the little apartment where her child and she occupied the same bed  the boys were also sent to their cabin and no one remained by the hall fire save the faithful tibb and dame elspeth excellent persons both and as thorough gossips as ever wagged a tongue  it was but natural that they should instantly resume the subject of the supernatural appearance for such they deemed it which had this night alarmed the family  i could hae wished it had been the deil himselfbe good to and preserve usrather than christie o the clinthill said the matron of the mansion for the word runs rife in the country that he is ane of the maist masterfu thieves ever lap on horse  houttout dame elspeth said tibb fear ye naething frae christie tods keep their ain holes clean you kirkfolk make sic a fasherie about men shifting a wee bit for their living our borderlairds would ride with few men at their back if a the lighthanded lads were out o gate  better they rade wi nane than distress the countryside the gate they do said dame elspeth  but wha is to haud back the southron then said tibb if ye take away the lances and broadswords i trow we auld wives couldna do that wi rock and wheel and as little the monks wi bell and book  and sae weel as the lances and broadswords hae kept them back i trowi was mair beholden to ae southron and that was stawarth bolton than to a the borderriders ever wore saint andrews crossi reckon their skelping back and forward and lifting honest mens gear has been a main cause of a the breach between us and england and i am sure that cost me a kind goodman they spoke about the wedding of the prince and our queen but its as like to be the driving of the cumberland folks stocking that brought them down on us like dragons tibb would not have failed in other circumstances to answer what she thought reflections disparaging to her country folk but she recollected that dame elspeth was mistress of the family curbed her own zealous patriotism and hastened to change the subject  and is it not strange she said that the heiress of avenel should have seen her father this blessed night  and ye think it was her father then said elspeth glendinning  what else can i think said tibb  it may hae been something waur in his likeness said dame glendinning  i ken naething about that said tibbbut his likeness it was that i will be sworn to just as he used to ride out ahawking for having enemies in the country he seldom laid off the breastplate and for my part added tibb i dinna think a man looks like a man unless he has steel on his breast and by his side too  i have no skill of your harness on breast or side either said dame glendinning but i ken there is little luck in halloween sights for i have had ane myself  indeed dame elspeth said old tibb edging her stool closer to the huge elbowchair occupied by her friend i should like to hear about that  ye maun ken then tibb said dame glendinning that when i was a hempie of nineteen or twenty it wasna my fault if i wasna at a the merrymakings time about  that was very natural said tibb but ye hae sobered since that or ye wadna haud our braw gallants sae lightly  i have had that wad sober me or ony ane said the matron aweel tibb a lass like me wasna to lack wooers for i wasna sae illfavoured that the tikes wad bark after me  how should that be said tibb and you sic a weelfavoured woman to this day  fie fie cummer said the matron of glendearg hitching her seat of honour in her turn a little nearer to the cuttlestool on which tibb was seated weelfavoured is past my time of day but i might pass then for i wasna sae tocherless but what i had a bit land at my breastlace my father was portioner of littledearg  ye hae telld me that before said tibb but anent the halloween  aweel aweel i had mair joes than ane but i favoured nane o them and sae at halloween father nicolas the cellarerhe was cellarer before this father father clement that now iswas cracking his nuts and drinking his brown beer with us and as blithe as might be and they would have me try a cantrip to ken wha suld wed me and the monk said there was nae ill in it and if there was he would assoil me for it and wha but i into the barn to winnow my three weights o naethingsair sair my mind misgave me for fear of wrangdoing and wrangsuffering baith but i had aye a bauld spirit i had not winnowed the last weight clean out and the moon was shining bright upon the floor when in stalked the presence of my dear simon glendinning that is now happy i never saw him plainer in my life than i did that moment he held up an arrow as he passed me and i swarfd awa wi fright muckle wark there was to bring me to mysell again and sair they tried to make me believe it was a trick of father nicolas and simon between them and that the arrow was to signify cupids shaft as the father called it and mony a time simon wad threep it to me after i was marriedgude man he liked not it should be said that he was seen out o the bodybut mark the end o it tibb we were married and the graygoose wing was the death o him after a  as it has been of ower mony brave men said tibb i wish there wasna sic a bird as a goose in the wide warld forby the clecking that we hae at the burnside  but tell me tibb said dame glendinning what does your leddy aye do reading out o that thick black book wi the silver claspsthere are ower mony gude words in it to come frae ony body but a priestan it were about robin hood or some o david lindsays ballants ane wad ken better what to say to it i am no misdoubting your mistress nae way but i wad like ill to hae a decent house haunted wi ghaists and gyrecarlines  ye hae nae reason to doubt my leddy or ony thing she says or does dame glendinning said the faithful tibb something offended and touching the bairn its weel kend she was born on halloween was nine years gane and they that are born on halloween whiles see mair than ither folk  and that wad be the cause then that the bairn didna mak muckle din about what it sawif it had been my halbert himself forby edward who is of softer nature he wad hae yammered the haill night of a constancy  but its like mistress mary hae sic sights mair natural to her  that may weel be said tibb for on halloween she was born as i tell ye and our auld parish priest wad fain hae had the night ower and allhallow day begun but for a that the sweet bairn is just like ither bairns as ye may see yourself and except this blessed night and ance before when we were in that weary bog on the road here i kenna that it saw mair than ither folk  but what saw she in the bog then said dame glendinning forby moorcocks and heatherblutters  the wean saw something like a white leddy that weised us the gate said tibb when we were like to hae perished in the mosshags certain it was that shagram reisted and i ken martin thinks he saw something  and what might the white leddy be said elspeth have ye ony guess o that  its weel kend that dame elspeth said tibb if ye had lived under grit folk as i hae dune ye wadna be to seek in that matter  i hae aye keepit my ain ha house abune my head said elspeth not without emphasis and if i havena lived wi grit folk grit folk have lived wi me  weel weel dame said tibb your pardons prayed there was nae offence meant but ye maun ken the great ancient families canna be just served wi the ordinary saunts praise to them like saunt anthony saunt cuthbert and the like that come and gang at every sinners bidding but they hae a sort of saunts or angels or what not to themsells and as for the white maiden of avenel she is kend ower the haill country and she is aye seen to yammer and wail before ony o that family dies as was weel kend by twenty folk before the death of walter avenel haly be his cast  if she can do nae mair than that said elspeth somewhat scornfully they needna make mony vows to her i trow can she make nae better fend for them than that and has naething better to do than wait on them  mony braw services can the white maiden do for them to the boot of that and has dune in the auld histories said tibb but i mind o naething in my day except it was her that the bairn saw in the bog  aweel aweel tibb said dame glendinning rising and lighting the iron lamp these are great privileges of your grand folk but our lady and saunt paul are good eneugh saunts for me and ise warrant them never leave me in a bog that they can help me out o seeing i send four waxen candles to their chapels every candlemas and if they are not seen to weep at my death ise warrant them smile at my joyful rising again whilk heaven send to all of us amen  amen answered tibb devoutly and now its time i should hap up the wee bit gathering turf as the fire is ower low  busily she set herself to perform this duty the relict of simon glendinning did but pause a moment to cast a heedful and cautious glance all around the hall to see that nothing was out of its proper place then wishing tibb goodnight she retired to repose  the deils in the carline said tibb to herself because she was the wife of a cocklaird she thinks herself grander i trow than the bowerwoman of a lady of that ilk having given vent to her suppressed spleen in this little ejaculation tibb also betook herself to slumber     chapter the fifth     a priest ye cry a priestlame shepherds they   how shall they gather in the straggling flock   dumb dogs which bark nothow shall they compel   the loitering vagrants to the masters fold   fitter to bask before the blazing fire   and snuff the mess neathanded phillis dresses   than on the snowwreath battle with the wolf                            reformation   the health of the lady of avenel had been gradually decaying ever since her disaster it seemed as if the few years which followed her husbands death had done on her the work of half a century she lost the fresh elasticity of form the colour and the mien of health and became wasted wan and feeble she appeared to have no formed complaint yet it was evident to those who looked on her that her strength waned daily her lips at length became blenched and her eye dim yet she spoke not of any desire to see a priest until elspeth glendinning in her zeal could not refrain from touching upon a point which she deemed essential to salvation alice of avenel received her hint kindly and thanked her for it  if any good priest would take the trouble of such a journey she said he should be welcome for the prayers and lessons of the good must be at all times advantageous  this quiet acquiescence was not quite what elspeth glendinning wished or expected she made up however by her own enthusiasm for the ladys want of eagerness to avail herself of ghostly counsel and martin was despatched with such haste as shagram would make to pray one of the religious men of saint marys to come up to administer the last consolations to the widow of walter avenel  when the sacristan had announced to the lord abbot that the lady of the umquhile walter de avenel was in very weak health in the tower of glendearg and desired the assistance of a father confessor the lordly monk paused on the request  we do remember walter de avenel he said a good knight and a valiant he was dispossessed of his lands and slain by the southronmay not the lady come hither to the sacrament of confession the road is distant and painful to travel  the lady is unwell holy father answered the sacristan and unable to bear the journey  trueayyesthen must one of our brethren go to herknowest thou if she hath aught of a jointure from this walter de avenel  very little holy father said the sacristan she hath resided at glendearg since her husbands death wellnigh on the charity of a poor widow called elspeth glendinning  why thou knowest all the widows in the countryside said the abbot ho ho ho and he shook his portly sides at his own jest  ho ho ho echoed the sacristan in the tone and tune in which an inferior applauds the jest of his superiorthen added with a hypocritical shuffle and a sly twinkle of his eye it is our duty most holy father to comfort the widowhe he he  this last laugh was more moderate until the abbot should put his sanction on the jest  ho ho said the abbot then to leave jesting father philip take thou thy riding gear and go to confess this dame avenel  but said the sacristan  give me no buts neither but nor if pass between monk and abbot father philip the bands of discipline must not be relaxedheresy gathers force like a snowballthe multitude expect confessions and preachings from the benedictine as they would from so many beggarly friarsand we may not desert the vineyard though the toil be grievous unto us  and with so little advantage to the holy monastery said the sacristan  true father philip but wot you not that what preventeth harm doth good this julian de avenel lives a light and evil life and should we neglect the widow of his brother he might foray our lands and we never able to show who hurt usmoreover it is our duty to an ancient family who in their day have been benefactors to the abbey away with thee instantly brother ride night and day an it be necessary and let men see how diligent abbot boniface and his faithful children are in the execution of their spiritual dutytoil not deterring them for the glen is five miles in lengthfear not withholding them for it is said to be haunted of spectresnothing moving them from pursuit of their spiritual calling to the confusion of calumnious heretics and the comfort and edification of all true and faithful sons of the catholic church i wonder what our brother eustace will say to this  breathless with his own picture of the dangers and toil which he was to encounter and the fame which he was to acquire both by proxy the abbot moved slowly to finish his luncheon in the refectory and the sacristan with no very good will accompanied old martin in his return to glendearg the greatest impediment in the journey being the trouble of restraining his pampered mule that she might tread in something like an equal pace with poor jaded shagram  after remaining an hour in private with his penitent the monk returned moody and full of thought dame elspeth who had placed for the honoured guest some refreshment in the hall was struck with the embarrassment which appeared in his countenance elspeth watched him with great anxiety she observed there was that on his brow which rather resembled a person come from hearing the confession of some enormous crime than the look of a confessor who resigns a reconciled penitent not to earth but to heaven after long hesitating she could not at length refrain from hazarding a question she was sure she said the leddy had made an easy shrift  five years had they resided together and she could safely say no woman lived better  woman said the sacristan sternly thou speakest thou knowest not whatwhat avails clearing the outside of the platter if the inside be foul with heresy  our dishes and trenchers are not so clean as they could be wished holy father said elspeth but half understanding what he said and beginning with her apron to wipe the dust from the plates of which she supposed him to complain  forbear dame elspeth said the monk your plates are as clean as wooden trenchers and pewter flagons can well be the foulness of which i speak is of that pestilential heresy which is daily becoming ingrained in this our holy church of scotland and as a cankerworm in the rosegarland of the spouse  holy mother of heaven said dame elspeth crossing herself have i kept house with a heretic  no elspeth no replied the monk it were too strong a speech for me to make of this unhappy lady but i would i could say she is free from heretical opinions alas they fly about like the pestilence by noonday and infect even the first and fairest of the flock for it is easy to see of this dame that she hath been high in judgment as in rank  and she can write and read i had almost said as weel as your reverence said elspeth  whom doth she write to and what doth she read said the monk eagerly  nay replied elspeth i cannot say i ever saw her write at all but her maiden that wasshe now serves the familysays she can writeand for reading she has often read to us good things out of a thick black volume with silver clasps  let me see it said the monk hastily on your allegiance as a true vassalon your faith as a catholic christianinstantlyinstantly let me see it  the good woman hesitated alarmed at the tone in which the confessor took up her information and being moreover of opinion that what so good a woman as the lady of avenel studied so devoutly could not be of a tendency actually evil but borne down by the clamour exclamations and something like threats used by father philip she at length brought him the fatal volume it was easy to do this without suspicion on the part of the owner as she lay on her bed exhausted with the fatigue of a long conference with her confessor and as the small round or turret closet in which was the book and her other trifling property was accessible by another door of all her effects the book was the last she would have thought of securing for of what use or interest could it be in a family who neither read themselves nor were in the habit of seeing any who did so that dame elspeth had no difficulty in possessing herself of the volume although her heart all the while accused her of an ungenerous and an inhospitable part towards her friend and inmate the double power of a landlord and a feudal superior was before her eyes and to say truth the boldness with which she might otherwise have resisted this double authority was i grieve to say it much qualified by the curiosity she entertained as a daughter of eve to have some explanation respecting the mysterious volume which the lady cherished with so much care yet whose contents she imparted with such caution for never had alice of avenel read them any passage from the book in question until the iron door of the tower was locked and all possibility of intrusion prevented even then she had shown by the selection of particular passages that she was more anxious to impress on their minds the principles which the volume contained than to introduce them to it as a new rule of faith  when elspeth half curious half remorseful had placed the book in the monks hands he exclaimed after turning over the leaves now by mine order it is as i suspectedmy mule my mulei will abide no longer herewell hast thou done dame in placing in my hands this perilous volume  is it then witchcraft or devils work said dame elspeth in great agitation  nay god forbid said the monk signing himself with the cross it is the holy scripture but it is rendered into the vulgar tongue and therefore by the order of the holy catholic church unfit to be in the hands of any lay person  and yet is the holy scripture communicated for our common salvation said elspeth good father you must instruct mine ignorance better but lack of wit cannot be a deadly sin and truly to my poor thinking i should be glad to read the holy scripture  i dare say thou wouldst said the monk and even thus did our mother eve seek to have knowledge of good and evil and thus sin came into the world and death by sin  i am sure and it is true said elspeth oh if she had dealt by the counsel of saint peter and saint paul  if she had reverenced the command of heaven said the monk which as it gave her birth life and happiness fixed upon the grant such conditions as best corresponded with its holy pleasure i tell thee elspeth the word slayeththat is the text alone read with unskilled eye and unhallowed lips is like those strong medicines which sick men take by the advice of the learned such patients recover and thrive while those dealing in them at their own hand shall perish by their own deed  nae doubt nae doubt said the poor woman your reverence knows best  not i said father philip in a tone as deferential as he thought could possibly become the sacristan of saint marysnot i but the holy father of christendom and our own holy father the lord abbot know best i the poor sacristan of saint marys can but repeat what i hear from others my superiors yet of this good woman be assuredthe word the mere word slayetlh but the church hath her ministers to gloze and to expound the same unto her faithful congregation and this i say not so much my beloved brethreni mean my beloved sister for the sacristan had got into the end of one of his old sermonsthis i speak not so much of the rectors curates and secular clergy so called because they live after the fashion of the seculum or age unbound by those ties which sequestrate us from the world neither do i speak this of the mendicant friars whether black or gray whether crossed or uncrossed but of the monks and especially of the monks benedictine reformed on the rule of saint bernard of clairvaux thence called cistercian of which monks christian brethrensister i would saygreat is the happiness and glory of the country in possessing the holy ministers of saint marys whereof i though an unworthy brother may say it hath produced more saints more bishops more popesmay our patrons make us thankfulthan any holy foundation in scotland whereforebut i see martin hath my mule in readiness and i will but salute you with the kiss of sisterhood which maketh not ashamed and so betake me to my toilsome return for the glen is of bad reputation for the evil spirits which haunt it  moreover i may arrive too late at the bridge whereby i may be obliged to take to the river which i observed to be somewhat waxen  accordingly he took his leave of dame elspeth who was confounded by the rapidity of his utterance and the doctrine he gave forth and by no means easy on the subject of the book which her conscience told her she should not have communicated to any one without the knowledge of its owner  notwithstanding the haste which the monk as well as the mule made to return to better quarters than they had left at the head of glendearg notwithstanding the eager desire father philip had to be the very first who should acquaint the abbot that a copy of the book they most dreaded had been found within the halidome or patrimony of the abbey notwithstanding moreover certain feelings which induced him to hurry as fast as possible through the gloomy and evilreputed glen still the difficulties of the road and the riders want of habitude of quick motion were such that twilight came upon him ere he had nearly cleared the narrow valley  it was indeed a gloomy ride the two sides of the vale were so near that at every double of the river the shadows from the western sky fell upon and totally obscured the eastern bank the thickets of copsewood seemed to wave with a portentous agitation of boughs and leaves and the very crags and scaurs seemed higher and grimmer than they had appeared to the monk while he was travelling in daylight and in company father philip was heartily rejoiced when emerging from the narrow glen he gained the open valley of the tweed which held on its majestic course from current to pool and from pool stretched away to other currents with a dignity peculiar to itself amongst the scottish rivers for whatever may have been the drought of the season the tweed usually fills up the space between its banks seldom leaving those extensive sheets of shingle which deform the margins of many of the celebrated scottish streams  the monk insensible to beauties which the age had not regarded as deserving of notice was nevertheless like a prudent general pleased to find himself out of the narrow glen in which the enemy might have stolen upon him unperceived he drew up his bridle reduced his mule to her natural and luxurious amble instead of the agitating and broken trot at which to his no small inconvenience she had hitherto proceeded and wiping his brow gazed forth at leisure on the broad moon which now mingling with the lights of evening was rising over field and forest village and fortalice and above all over the stately monastery seen far and dim amid the vellow light  the worst part of the magnificent view in the monks apprehension was that the monastery stood on the opposite side of the river and that of the many fine bridges which have since been built across that classical stream not one then existed there was however in recompense a bridge then standing which has since disappeared although its ruins may still be traced by the curious  it was of a very peculiar form two strong abutments were built on either side of the river at a part where the stream was peculiarly contracted  upon a rock in the centre of the current was built a solid piece of masonry constructed like the pier of a bridge and presenting like a pier an angle to the current of the stream the masonry continued solid until the pier rose to a level with the two abutments upon either side and from thence the building rose in the form of a tower the lower story of this tower consisted only of an archway or passage through the building over either entrance to which hung a drawbridge with counterpoises either of which when dropped connected the archway with the opposite abutment where the farther end of the drawbridge rested when both bridges were thus lowered the passage over the river was complete  the bridgekeeper who was the dependant of a neighbouring baron resided with his family in the second and third stories of the tower which when both drawbridges were raised formed an insulated fortalice in the midst of the river he was entitled to a small toll or custom for the passage concerning the amount of which disputes sometimes arose between him and the passengers it is needless to say that the bridgeward had usually the better in these questions since he could at pleasure detain the traveller on the opposite side or suffering him to pass half way might keep him prisoner in his tower till they were agreed on the rate of pontage  footnote a bridge of the very peculiar construction described in the text actually existed at a small hamlet about a mile and a half above melrose called from the circumstance bridgeend it is thus noticed in gordons iter septentrionale  in another journey through the south parts of scotland about a mile and a half from melrose in the shire of teviotdale i saw the remains of a curious bridge over the river tweed consisting of three octangular pillars or rather towers standing within the water without any arches to join them the middle one which is the most entire has a door towards the north and i suppose another opposite one toward the south which i could not see without crossing the water in the middle of this tower is a projection or cornice surrounding it the whole is hollow from the door upwards and now open at the top near which is a small window i was informed that not long agro a countryman and his family lived in this towerand got his livelihood by laying out planks from pillar to pillar and conveying passengers over the river whether this be ancient or modern i know not but as it is singular in its kind i have thought fit to exhibit it  the vestiges of this uncommon species of bridge still exist and the author has often seen the foundations of the columns when drifting down the tweed at night for the purpose of killing salmon by torchlight mr john mercer of bridgeend recollects that about fifty years ago the pillars were visible above water and the late mr david kyle of the george inn melrose told the author that he saw a stone taken from the river bearing this inscription  i sir john pringle of palmer stede give an hundred markis of gowd sae reid to help to bigg my brigg ower tweed  pringle of galashiels afterwards of whytbank was the baron to whom the bridge belonged  but it was most frequently with the monks of saint marys that the warder had to dispute his perquisites these holy men insisted for and at length obtained a right of gratuitous passage to themselves greatly to the discontent of the bridgekeeper but when they demanded the same immunity for the numerous pilgrims who visited the shrine the bridgekeeper waxed restive and was supported by his lord in his resistance the controversy grew animated on both sides the abbot menaced excommunication and the keeper of the bridge though unable to retaliate in kind yet made each individual monk who had to cross and recross the river endure a sort of purgatory ere he would accommodate them with a passage this was a great inconvenience and would have proved a more serious one but that the river was fordable for man and horse in ordinary weather  it was a fine moonlight night as we have already said when father philip approached this bridge the singular construction of which gives a curious idea of the insecurity of the times the river was not in flood but it was above its ordinary levela heavy water as it is called in that country through which the monk had no particular inclination to ride if he could manage the matter better  peter my good friend cried the sacristan raising his voice my very excellent friend peter be so kind as to lower the drawbridge peter i say dost thou not hearit is thy gossip father philip who calls thee  peter heard him perfectly well and saw him into the bargain but as he had considered the sacristan as peculiarly his enemy in his dispute with the convent he went quietly to bed after reconnoitring the monk through his loophole observing to his wife that riding the water in a moonlight night would do the sacristan no harm and would teach him the value of a brig the neist time on whilk a man might pass high and dry winter and summer flood and ebb  after exhausting his voice in entreaties and threats which were equally unattended to by peter of the brig as he was called father philip at length moved down the river to take the ordinary ford at the head of the next stream cursing the rustic obstinacy of peter he began nevertheless to persuade himself that the passage of the river by the ford was not only safe but pleasant  the banks and scattered trees were so beautifully reflected from the bosom of the dark stream the whole cool and delicious picture formed so pleasing a contrast to his late agitation to the warmth occasioned by his vain endeavours to move the relentless porter of the bridge that the result was rather agreeable than otherwise  as father philip came close to the waters edge at the spot where he was to enter it there sat a female under a large broken scathed oaktree or rather under the remains of such a tree weeping wringing her hands and looking earnestly on the current of the river the monk was struck with astonishment to see a female there at that time of night but he was in all honest serviceand if a step farther i put it upon his own consciencea devoted squire of dames after observing the maiden for a moment although she seemed to take no notice of his presence he was moved by her distress and willing to offer his assistance damsel said he thou seemest in no ordinary distress peradventure like myself thou hast been refused passage at the bridge by the churlish keeper and thy crossing may concern thee either for performance of a vow or some other weighty charge  the maiden uttered some inarticulate sounds looked at the river and then in the face of the sacristan it struck father philip at that instant that a highland chief of distinction had been for some time expected to pay his vows at the shrine of saint marys and that possibly this fair maiden might be one of his family travelling alone for accomplishment of a vow or left behind by some accident to whom therefore it would be but right and prudent to use every civility in his power especially as she seemed unacquainted with the lowland tongue such at least was the only motive the sacristan was ever known to assign for his courtesy if there was any other i once more refer it to his own conscience  to express himself by signs the common language of all nations the cautious sacristan first pointed to the river then to his mules crupper and then made as gracefully as he could a sign to induce the fair solitary to mount behind him she seemed to understand his meaning for she rose up as if to accept his offer and while the good monk who as we have hinted was no great cavalier laboured with the pressure of the right leg and the use of the left rein to place his mule with her side to the bank in such a position that the lady might mount with ease she rose from the ground with rather portentous activity and at one bound sate behind the monk upon the animal much the firmer rider of the two the mule by no means seemed to approve of this double burden she bounded bolted and would soon have thrown father philip over her head had not the maiden with a firm hand detained him in the saddle  at last the restive brute changed her humour and from refusing to budge off the spot suddenly stretched her nose homeward and dashed into the ford as fast as she could scamper a new terror now invaded the monks mindthe ford seemed unusually deep the water eddied off in strong ripple from the counter of the mule and began to rise upon her side philip lost his presence of mindwhich was at no time his most ready attribute the mule yielded to the weight of the current and as the rider was not attentive to keep her head turned up the river she drifted downward lost the ford and her footing at once and began to swim with her head down the stream  and what was sufficiently strange at the same moment notwithstanding the extreme peril the damsel began to sing thereby increasing if anything could increase the bodily fear of the worthy sacristan                 i    merrily swim we the moon shines bright   both current and ripple are dancing in light   we have roused the night raven i heard him croak   as we plashed along beneath the oak   that flings its broad branches so far and so wide   their shadows are dancing in midst of the tide   who wakens my nestlings the raven he said   my beak shall ere morn in his blood be red   for a blue swoln corpse is a dainty meal   and ill have my share with the pike and the eel                 ii    merrily swim we the moon shines bright   theres a golden gleam on the distant height   theres a silver shower on the alders dank   and the drooping willows that wave on the bank   i see the abbey both turret and tower   it is all astir for the vesper hour   the monks for the chapel are leaving each cell   but wheres father philip should toll the bell                 iii    merrily swim we the moon shines bright   downward we drift through shadow and light   under yon rock the eddies sleep   calm and silent dark and deep   the kelpy has risen from the fathomless pool   he has lighted his candle of death and of dool   look father look and youll laugh to see   how he gapes and glares with his eyes on thee                 iv    good luck to your fishing whom watch ye tonight   a man of mean or a man of might   is it layman or priest that must float in your cove   or lover who crosses to visit his love   hark heard ye the kelpy reply as we passd   gods blessing on the warder he lockd the bridge fast   all that come to my cove are sunk   priest or layman lover or monk   how long the damsel might have continued to sing or where the terrified monks journey might have ended is uncertain as she sung the last stanza they arrived at or rather in a broad tranquil sheet of water caused by a strong wear or damhead running across the river which dashed in a broad cataract over the barrier the mule whether from choice or influenced by the suction of the current made towards the cut intended to supply the convent mills and entered it half swimming half wading and pitching the unlucky monk to and fro in the saddle at a fearful rate  as his person flew hither and thither his garment became loose and in an effort to retain it his hand lighted on the volume of the lady of avenel which was in his bosom no sooner had he grasped it than his companion pitched him out of the saddle into the stream where still keeping her hand on his collar she gave him two or three good souses in the watery fluid so as to ensure that every other part of him had its share of wetting and then quitted her hold when he was so near the side that by a slight effort of a great one he was incapable he might scramble on shore this accordingly he accomplished and turning his eyes to see what had become of his extraordinary companion she was nowhere to be seen but still he heard as if from the surface of the river and mixing with the noise of the water breaking over the damhead a fragment of her wild song which seemed to run thus    landedlanded the black book hath won   else had you seen berwick with morning sun   sain ye and save ye and blithe mot ye be   for seldom they land that go swimming with me  the ecstasy of the monks terror could be endured no longer his head grew dizzy and after staggering a few steps onward and running himself against a wall he sunk down in a state of insensibility     chapter the sixth     now let us sit in conclave that these weeds   be rooted from the vineyard of the church   that these foul tares be severed from the wheat   we are i trust agreedyet how to do this   nor hurt the wholesome crop and tender vineplants   craves good advisement  the reformation  the vesper service in the monastery church of saint marys was now over the abbot had disrobed himself of his magnificent vestures of ceremony and resumed his ordinary habit which was a black gown worn over a white cassock with a narrow scapulary a decent and venerable dress which was calculated to set off to advantage the portly mien of abbot boniface  in quiet times no one could have filled the state of a mitred abbot for such was his dignity more respectably than this worthy prelate he had no doubt many of those habits of selfindulgence which men are apt to acquire who live for themselves alone he was vain moreover and when boldly confronted had sometimes shown symptoms of timidity not very consistent with the high claims which he preferred as an eminent member of the church or with the punctual deference which he exacted from his religious brethren and all who were placed under his command but he was hospitable charitable and by no means of himself disposed to proceed with severity against any one in short he would in other times have slumbered out his term of preferment with as much credit as any other purple abbot who lived easily but at the same time decorouslyslept soundly and did not disquiet himself with dreams  but the wide alarm spread through the whole church of rome by the progress of the reformed doctrines sorely disturbed the repose of abbot boniface and opened to him a wide field of duties and cares which he had never so much as dreamed of there were opinions to be combated and refutedpractices to be inquired intoheretics to be detected and punishedthe fallen off to be reclaimedthe wavering to be confirmedscandal to be removed from the clergy and the vigour of discipline to be reestablished  post upon post arrived at the monastery of saint maryshorses reeking and riders exhaustedthis from the privy council that from the primate of scotland and this other again from the queen mother exhorting approving condemning requesting advice upon this subject and requiring information upon that  these missives abbot boniface received with an important air of helplessness or a helpless air of importancewhichever the reader may please to term it evincing at once gratified vanity and profound trouble of mind  the sharpwitted primate of saint andrews had foreseen the deficiencies of the abbot of st marys and endeavoured to provide for them by getting admitted into his monastery as subprior a brother cistercian a man of parts and knowledge devoted to the service of the catholic church and very capable not only to advise the abbot on occasions of difficulty but to make him sensible of his duty in case he should from goodnature or timidity be disposed to shrink from it  father eustace played the same part in the monastery as the old general who in foreign armies is placed at the elbow of the prince of the blood who nominally commands in chief on condition of attempting nothing without the advice of his drynurse and he shared the fate of all such drynurses being heartily disliked as well as feared by his principal still however the primates intention was fully answered father eustace became the constant theme and often the bugbear of the worthy abbot who hardly dared to turn himself in his bed without considering what father eustace would think of it in every case of difficulty father eustace was summoned and his opinion asked and no sooner was the embarrassment removed than the abbots next thought was how to get rid of his adviser in every letter which he wrote to those in power he recommended father eustace to some high church preferment a bishopric or an abbey and as they dropped one after another and were otherwise conferred he began to think as he confessed to the sacristan in the bitterness of his spirit that the monastery of st  marys had got a liferent lease of their subprior  yet more indignant he would have been had he suspected that father eustaces ambition was fixed upon his own mitre which from some attacks of an apoplectic nature deemed by the abbots friends to be more serious than by himself it was supposed might be shortly vacant but the confidence which like other dignitaries he reposed in his own health prevented abbot boniface from imagining that it held any concatenation with the motions of father eustace  the necessity under which he found himself of consulting with his grand adviser in cases of real difficulty rendered the worthy abbot particularly desirous of doing without him in all ordinary cases of administration though not without considering what father eustace would have said of the matter he scorned therefore to give a hint to the subprior of the bold stroke by which he had dispatched brother philip to glendearg but when the vespers came without his reappearance he became a little uneasy the more as other matters weighed upon his mind the feud with the warder or keeper of the bridge threatened to be attended with bad consequences as the mans quarrel was taken up by the martial baron under whom he served and pressing letters of an unpleasant tendency had just arrived from the primate like a gouty man who catches hold of his crutch while he curses the infirmity that induces him to use if the abbot however reluctant found himself obliged to require eustaces presence after the service was over in his house or rather palace which was attached to and made part of the monastery  abbot boniface was seated in his highbacked chair the grotesque carved back of which terminated in a mitre before a fire where two or three large logs were reduced to one red glowing mass of charcoal at his elbow on an oaken stand stood the remains of a roasted capon on which his reverence had made his evening meal flanked by a goodly stoup of bordeaux of excellent flavour he was gazing indolently on the fire partly engaged in meditation on his past and present fortunes partly occupied by endeavouring to trace towers and steeples in the red embers  yes thought the abbot to himself in that red perspective i could fancy to myself the peaceful towers of dundrennan where i passed my life ere i was called to pomp and to trouble a quiet brotherhood we were regular in our domestic duties and when the frailties of humanity prevailed over us we confessed and were absolved by each other and the most formidable part of the penance was the jest of the convent on the culprit i can almost fancy that i see the cloister garden and the peartrees which i grafted with my own hands and for what have i changed all this but to be overwhelmed with business which concerns me not to be called my lord abbot and to be tutored by father eustace i would these towers were the abbey of aberbrothwick and father eustace the abbotor i would he were in the fire on any terms so i were rid of him the primate says our holy father the pope hath an adviseri am sure he could not live a week with such a one as mine then there is no learning what father eustace thinks till you confess your own difficultiesno hint will bring forth his opinionhe is like a miser who will not unbuckle his purse to bestow a farthing until the wretch who needs it has owned his excess of poverty and wrung out the boon by importunity and thus i am dishonoured in the eyes of my religious brethren who behold me treated like a child which hath no sense of its owni will bear it no longerbrother benneta lay brother answered to his call tell father eustace that i need not his presence  i came to say to your reverence that the holy father is entering even now from the cloisters  be it so said the abbot he is welcomeremove these thingsor rather place a trencher the holy father may be a little hungryyet noremove them for there is no good fellowship in himlet the stoup of wine remain however and place another cup  the lay brother obeyed these contradictory commands in the way he judged most seemlyhe removed the carcass of the halfsacked capon and placed two goblets beside the stoup of bourdeaux at the same instant entered father eustace  he was a thin sharpfaced slightmade little man whose keen grey eyes seemed almost to look through the person to whom he addressed himself his body was emaciated not only with the fasts which he observed with rigid punctuality but also by the active and unwearied exercise of his sharp and piercing intellect    a fiery soul which working out its way   fretted the puny body to decay   and oerinformed the tenement of clay  he turned with conventual reverence to the lord abbot and as they stood together it was scarce possible to see a more complete difference of form and expression the goodnatured rosy face and laughing eye of the abbot which even his present anxiety could not greatly ruffle was a wonderful contrast to the thin pallid cheek and quick penetrating glance of the monk in which an eager and keen spirit glanced through eyes to which it seemed to give supernatural lustre  the abbot opened the conversation by motioning to his monk to take a stool and inviting to a cup of wine the courtesy was declined with respect yet not without a remark that the vesper service was past  for the stomachs sake brother said the abbot colouring a littleyou know the text  it is a dangerous one answered the monk to handle alone or at late hours out off from human society the juice of the grape becomes a perilous companion of solitude and therefore i ever shun it  abbot boniface had poured himself out a goblet which might hold about half an english pint but either struck with the truth of the observation or ashamed to act in direct opposition to it he suffered it to remain untasted before him and immediately changed the subject  the primate hath written to us said he to make strict search within our bounds after the heretical persons denounced in this list who have withdrawn themselves from the justice which their opinions deserve it is deemed probable that they will attempt to retire to england by our borders and the primate requireth me to watch with vigilance and what not  assuredly said the monk the magistrate should not bear the sword in vainthose be they that turn the world upside downand doubtless your reverend wisdom will with due diligence second the exertions of the right reverend father in god being in the peremptory defence of the holy church  ay but how is this to be done answered the abbot saint mary aid us the primate writes to me as if i were a temporal barona man under command having soldiers under him he says send forthscour the countryguard the passestruly these men do not travel as those who would give their lives for nothingthe last who went south passed the drymarch at the ridingburn with an escort of thirty spears as our reverend brother the abbot of kelso did write unto us how are cowls and scapularies to stop the way  your bailiff is accounted a good man at arms holy father said eustace your vassals are obliged to rise for the defence of the holy kirkit is the tenure on which they hold their landsif they will not come forth for the church which gives them bread let their possessions be given to others  we shall not be wanting said the abbot collecting himself with importance to do whatever may advantage holy kirkthyself shall hear the charge to our bailiff and our officialsbut here again is our controversy with the warden of the bridge and the baron of meigallotsaint mary  vexations do so multiply upon the house and upon the generation that a man wots not where to turn to thou didst say father eustace thou wouldst look into our evidents touching this free passage for the pilgrims  i have looked into the chartulary of the house holy father said eustace and therein i find a written and formal grant of all duties and customs payable at the drawbridge of brigton not only by ecclesiastics of this foundation but by every pilgrim truly designed to accomplish his vows at this house to the abbot allford and the monks of the house of saint mary in kennaquhair from that time and for ever the deed is dated on saint bridgets even in the year of redemption 1137 and bears the sign and seal of the granter charles of meigallot greatgreatgrandfather of this baron and purports to be granted for the safety of his own soul and for the weal of the souls of his father and mother and of all his predecessors and successors being barons of meigallot  but he alleges said the abbot that the bridgewards have been in possession of these dues and have rendered them available for more than fifty yearsand the baron threatens violencemeanwhile the journey of the pilgrims is interrupted to the prejudice of their own souls and the diminution of the revenues of saint mary the sacristan advised us to put on a boat but the warden whom thou knowest to be a godless man has sworn the devil tear him but that if they put on a boat on the lairds stream he will rive her board from boardand then some say we should compound the claim for a small sum in silver here the abbot paused a moment for a reply but receiving none he added but what thinkest thou father eustace why art thou silent  because i am surprised at the question which the lord abbot of saint marys asks at the youngest of his brethren  youngest in time of your abode with us brother eustace said the abbot not youngest in years or i think in experience subprior also of this convent  i am astonished continued eustace that the abbot of this venerable house should ask of any one whether he can alienate the patrimony of our holy and divine patroness or give up to an unconscientious and perhaps a heretic baron the rights conferred on this church by his devout progenitor popes and councils alike prohibit itthe honour of the living and the weal of departed souls alike forbid itit may not be to force if he dare use it we must surrender but never by our consent should we see the goods of the church plundered with as little scruple as he would drive off a herd of english beeves rouse yourself reverend father and doubt nothing but that the good cause shall prevail whet the spiritual sword and direct it against the wicked who would usurp our holy rights whet the temporal sword if it be necessary and stir up the courage and zeal of your loyal vassals  the abbot sighed deeply all this he said is soon spoken by him who hath to act it not but he was interrupted by the entrance of bennet rather hastily the mule on which the sacristan had set out in the morning had returned he said to the convent stable all over wet and with the saddle turned round beneath her belly  sancta maria said the abbot our dear brother hath perished by the way  it may not be said eustace hastilylet the bell be tolledcause the brethren to get torchesalarm the villagehurry down to the riveri myself will be the foremost  the real abbot stood astonished and agape when at once he beheld his office filled and saw all which he ought to have ordered going forward at the dictates of the youngest monk in the convent but ere the orders of eustace which nobody dreamed of disputing were carried into execution the necessity was prevented by the sudden apparition of the sacristan whose supposed danger excited all the alarm     chapter the seventh        raze out the written troubles of the brain      cleanse the foul bosom of the perilous stuff      that weighs upon the heart                                          macbeth  what betwixt cold and fright the afflicted sacristan stood before his superior propped on the friendly arm of the convent miller drenched with water and scarce able to utter a syllable  after various attempts to speak the first words he uttered were    swim we merrilythe moon shines bright  swim we merrily retorted the abbot indignantly a merry night have ye chosen for swimming and a becoming salutation to your superior  our brother is bewildered said eustacespeak father philip how is it with you    good luck to your fishing  continued the sacristan making a most dolorous attempt at the tune of his strange companion  good luck to your fishing repeated the abbot still more surprised than displeased by my halidome he is drunken with wine and comes to our presence with his jolly catches in his throat if bread and water can cure this folly  with your pardon venerable father said the subprior of water our brother has had enough and methinks the confusion of his eye is rather that of terror than of aught unbecoming his profession where did you find him hob miller  an it please your reverence i did but go to shut the sluice of the milland as i was going to shut the sluice i heard something groan near to me but judging it was one of giles fletchers hogsfor so please you he never shuts his gatei caught up my lever and was aboutsaint mary forgive meto strike where i heard the sound when as the saints would have it i heard the second groan just like that of a living man so i called up my knaves and found the father sacristan lying wet and senseless under the wall of our kiln so soon as we brought him to himself a bit he prayed to be brought to your reverence but i doubt me his wits have gone a bellwavering by the road it was but now that he spoke in somewhat better form  well said brother eustace thou hast done well hob miller only begone now and remember a second time to pause ere you strike in the dark  please your reverence it shall be a lesson to me said the miller not to mistake a holy man for a hog again so long as i live and making a bow with profound humility the miller withdrew  and now that this churl is gone father philip said eustace wilt thou tell our venerable superior what ails thee art thou vino gravatus man if so we will have thee to thy cell  water water not wine muttered the exhausted sacristan  nay said the monk if that be thy complaint wine may perhaps cure thee and he reached him a cup which the patient drank off to his great benefit  and now said the abbot let his garments be changed or rather let him be carried to the infirmary for it will prejudice our health should we hear his narrative while he stands there steaming like a rising hoarfrost  i will hear his adventure said eustace and report it to your reverence and accordingly he attended the sacristan to his cell in about half an hour he returned to the abbot  how is it with father philip said the abbot and through what came he into such a state  he comes from glendearg reverend sir said eustace and for the rest he telleth such a legend as has not been heard in this monastery for many a long day he then gave the abbot the outlines of the sacristans adventures in the homeward journey and added that for some time he was inclined to think his brain was infirm seeing he had sung laughed and wept all in the same breath  a wonderful thing it is to us said the abbot that satan has been permitted to put forth his hand thus far on one of our sacred brethren  true said father eustace but for every text there is a paraphrase and i have my suspicions that if the drenching of father philip cometh of the evil one yet it may not have been altogether without his own personal fault  how said the father abbot i will not believe that thou makest doubt that satan in former days hath been permitted to afflict saints and holy men even as he afflicted the pious job  god forbid i should make question of it said the monk crossing himself yet where there is an exposition of the sacristans tale which is less than miraculous i hold it safe to consider it at least if not to abide by it now this hob the miller hath a buxom daughter supposei say only supposethat our sacristan met her at the ford on her return from her uncles on the other side for there she hath this evening beensuppose that in courtesy and to save her stripping hose and shoon the sacristan brought her across behind himsuppose he carried his familiarities farther than the maiden was willing to admit and we may easily suppose farther that this wetting was the result of it  and this legend invented to deceive us said the superior reddening with wrath but most strictly shall it be sifted and inquired into it is not upon us that father philip must hope to pass the result of his own evil practices for doings of satan tomorrow cite the wench to appear before uswe will examine and we will punish  under your reverences favour said eustace that were but poor policy as things now stand with us the heretics catch hold of each flying report which tends to the scandal of our clergy we must abate the evil not only by strengthening discipline but also by suppressing and stifling the voice of scandal if my conjectures are true the millers daughter will be silent for her own sake and your reverences authority may also impose silence on her father and on the sacristan if he is again found to afford room for throwing dishonour on his order he can be punished with severity but at the same time with secrecy for what say the decretals facinora ostendi dum punientur flagitia autem abscondi debent  a sentence of latin as eustace had before observed had often much influence on the abbot because he understood it not fluently and was ashamed to acknowledge his ignorance on these terms they parted for the night  the next day abbot boniface strictly interrogated philip on the real cause of his disaster of the previous night but the sacristan stood firm to his story nor was he found to vary from any point of it although the answers he returned were in some degree incoherent owing to his intermingling with them ever and anon snatches of the strange damsels song which had made such deep impression on his imagination that he could not prevent himself from imitating it repeatedly in the course of his examination the abbot had compassion with the sacristans involuntary frailty to which something supernatural seemed annexed and finally became of opinion that father eustaces more natural explanation was rather plausible than just and indeed although we have recorded the adventure as we find it written down we cannot forbear to add that there was a schism on the subject in the convent and that several of the brethren pretended to have good reason for thinking that the millers blackeyed daughter was at the bottom of the affair after all whichever way it might be interpreted all agreed that it had too ludicrous a sound to be permitted to get abroad and therefore the sacristan was charged on his vow of obedience to say no more of his ducking an injunction which having once eased his mind by telling his story it may be well conjectured that he joyfully obeyed  the attention of father eustace was much less forcibly arrested by the marvellous tale of the sacristans danger and his escape than by the mention of the volume which he had brought with him from the tower of glendearg a copy of the scriptures translated into the vulgar tongue had found its way even into the proper territory of the church and had been discovered in one of the most hidden and sequestered recesses of the halidome of saint marys  he anxiously requested to see the volume in this the sacristan was unable to gratify him for he had lost it as far as he recollected when the supernatural being as he conceived her to be took her departure from him father eustace went down to the spot in person and searched all around it in hopes of recovering the volume in question but his labour was in vain he returned to the abbot and reported that it must have fallen into the river or the millstream for i will hardly believe he said that father philips musical friend would fly off with a copy of the holy scriptures  being said the abbot as it is an heretical translation it may be thought that satan may have power over it  ay said father eustace it is indeed his chiefest magazine of artillery when he inspireth presumptuous and daring men to set forth their own opinions and expositions of holy writ but though thus abused the scriptures are the source of our salvation and are no more to be reckoned unholy because of these rash mens proceedings than a powerful medicine is to be contemned or held poisonous because bold and evil leeches have employed it to the prejudice of their patients with the permission of your reverence i would that this matter were looked into more closely i will myself visit the tower of glendearg ere i am many hours older and we shall see if any spectre or white woman of the wild will venture to interrupt my journey or return have i your reverend permission and your blessing he added but in a tone that appeared to set no great store by either  thou hast both my brother said the abbot but no sooner had eustace left the apartment than boniface could not help breaking on the willing ear of the sacristan his sincere wish that any spirit black white or gray would read the adviser such a lesson as to cure him of his presumption in esteeming himself wiser than the whole community  i wish him no worse lesson said the sacristan than to go swimming merrily down the river with a ghost behind and kelpies nightcrows and mudeels all waiting to have a snatch at him    merrily swim we the moon shines bright   good luck to your fishing whom watch you tonight  brother philip said the abbot we exhort thee to say thy prayers compose thyself and banish that foolish chant from thy mindit is but a deception of the devils  i will essay reverend father said the sacristan but the tune hangs by my memory like a bur in a beggars rags it mingles with the psalterthe very bells of the convent seem to repeat the words and jingle to the tune and were you to put me to death at this very moment it is my belief i should die singing itnow swim we merrilyit is as it were a spell upon me  he then again began to warble    good luck to your fishing  and checking himself in the strain with difficulty he exclaimed it is too certaini am but a lost priest swim we merrilyi shall sing it at the very masswo is me i shall sing all the remainder of my life and yet never be able to change the tune  the honest abbot replied he knew many a good fellow in the same condition and concluded the remark with ho ho ho for his reverence as the reader may partly have observed was one of those dull folks who love a quiet joke  the sacristan well acquainted with his superiors humour endeavoured to join in the laugh but his unfortunate canticle came again across his imagination and interrupted the hilarity of his customary echo  by the rood brother philip said the abbot much moved you become altogether intolerable and i am convinced that such a spell could not subsist over a person of religion and in a religious house unless he were under mortal sin wherefore say the seven penitentiary psalmsmake diligent use of thy scourge and hairclothrefrain for three days from all food save bread and wateri myself will shrive thee and we will see if this singing devil may be driven out of thee at least i think father eustace himself could devise no better exorcism  the sacristan sighed deeply but knew remonstrance was vain he retired therefore to his cell to try how far psalmody might be able to drive off the sounds of the syren tune which haunted his memory  meanwhile father eustace proceeded to the drawbridge in his way to the lonely valley of glendearg in a brief conversation with the churlish warder he had the address to render him more tractable in the controversy betwixt him and the convent he reminded him that his father had been a vassal under the community that his brother was childless and that their possession would revert to the church on his death and might be either granted to himself the warder or to some greater favourite of the abbot as matters chanced to stand betwixt them at the time the subprior suggested to him also the necessary connexion of interests betwixt the monastery  and the office which this man enjoyed he listened with temper to his rude and churlish answers and by keeping his own interest firm pitched in his view he had the satisfaction to find that peter gradually softened his tone and consented to let every pilgrim who travelled upon foot pass free of exaction until pentocost next they who travelled on horseback or otherwise contenting to pay the ordinary custom having thus accommodated a matter in which the weal of the convent was so deeply interested father eustace proceeded on his journey     chapter the eighth     nay dally not with time the wise mans treasure   though fools are lavish ontthe fatal fisher   hooks souls while we waste moments                                       old play  a november mist overspread the little valley up which slowly but steadily rode the monk eustace he was not insensible to the feeling of melancholy inspired by the scene and by the season the stream seemed to murmur with a deep and oppressed note as if bewailing the departure of autumn among the scattered copses which here and there fringed its banks the oaktrees only retained that pallid green that precedes their russet hue the leaves of the willows were most of them stripped from the branches lay rustling at each breath and disturbed by every step of the mule while the foliage of other trees totally withered kept still precarious possession of the boughs waiting the first wind to scatter them  the monk dropped into the natural train of pensive thought which these autumnal emblems of mortal hopes are peculiarly calculated to inspire there he said looking at the leaves which lay strewed around lie the hopes of early youth first formed that they may soonest wither and loveliest in spring to become most contemptible in winter but you ye lingerers he added looking to a knot of beeches which still bore their withered leaves you are the proud plans of adventurous manhood formed later and still clinging to the mind of age although it acknowledges their inanity  none lastsnone endures save the foliage of the hardy oak which only begins to show itself when that of the rest of the forest has enjoyed half its existence a pale and decayed hue is all it possesses but still it retains that symptom of vitality to the lastso be it with father eustace the fairy hopes of my youth i have trodden under foot like those neglected rustlersto the prouder dreams of my manhood i look back as to lofty chimeras of which the pith and essence have long since faded but my religious vows the faithful profession which i have made in my maturer age shall retain life while aught of eustace lives dangerous it may befeeble it must beyet live it shall the proud determination to serve the church of which i am a member and to combat the heresies by which she is assailed thus spoke at least thus thought a man zealous according to his imperfect knowledge confounding the vital interests of christianity with the extravagant and usurped claims of the church of rome and defending his cause with an ardour worthy of a better  while moving onward in this contemplative mood he could not help thinking more than once that he saw in his path the form of a female dressed in white who appeared in the attitude of lamentation but the impression was only momentary and whenever he looked steadily to the point where he conceived the figure appeared it always proved that he had mistaken some natural object a white crag or the trunk of a decayed birchtree with its silver bark for the appearance in question  father eustace had dwelt too long in rome to partake the superstitious feelings of the more ignorant scottish clergy yet he certainly thought it extraordinary that so strong an impression should have been made on his mind by the legend of the sacristan it is strange he said to himself that this story which doubtless was the invention of brother philip to cover his own impropriety of conduct should run so much in my head and disturb my more serious thoughtsi am wont i think to have more command over my senses i will repeat my prayers and banish such folly from my recollection  the monk accordingly began with devotion to tell his beads in pursuance of the prescribed rule of his order and was not again disturbed by any wanderings of the imagination until he found himself beneath the little fortalice of glendearg  dame glendinning who stood at the gate set up a shout of surprise and joy at seeing the good father martin she said jasper where be a the folkhelp the right reverend subprior to dismount and take his mule from himo father god has sent you in our needi was just going to send man and horse to the convent though i ought to be ashamed to give so much trouble to your reverences  our trouble matters not good dame said father eustace in what can i pleasure you i came hither to visit the lady of avenel  welladay said dame alice and it was on her part that i had the boldness to think of summoning you for the good lady will never be able to wear over the daywould it please you to go to her chamber  hath she not been shriven by father philip said the monk  shriven she was said the dame of glendearg and by father philip as your reverence truly saysbuti wish it may have been a clean shriftmethought father philip looked but moody upon itand there was a book which he took away with him that she paused as if unwilling to proceed  speak out dame glendinning said the father with us it is your duty to have no secrets  nay if it please your reverence it is not that i would keep anything from your reverences knowledge but i fear i should prejudice the lady in your opinion for she is an excellent ladymonths and years has she dwelt in this tower and none more exemplary than she but this matter doubtless she will explain it herself to your reverence  i desire first to know it from you dame glendinning said the monk and i again repeat it is your duty to tell it to me  this book if it please your reverence which father philip removed from glendearg was this morning returned to us in a strange manner said the good widow  returned said the monk how mean you  i mean answered dame glendinning that it was brought back to the tower of glendearg the saints best know howthat same book which father philip carried with him but yesterday old martin that is my tasker and the ladys servant was driving out the cows to the pasturefor we have three good milkcows reverend father blessed be saint waldave and thanks to the holy monastery  the monk groaned with impatience but he remembered that a woman of the good dames condition was like a top which if you let it spin on untouched must at last come to a pause but if you interrupt it by flogging there is no end to its gyrations but to speak no more of the cows your reverence though they are likely cattle as ever were tied to a stake the tasker was driving them out and the lads that is my halbert and my edward that your reverence has seen at church on holidays and especially halbertfor you patted him on the head and gave him a brooch of saint cuthbert which he wears in his bonnetand little mary avenel that is the ladys daughter they ran all after the cattle and began to play up and down the pasture as young folk will your reverence and at length they lost sight of martin and the cows and they began to run up a little cleugh which we call corrinanshian where there is a wee bit stripe of a burn and they saw theregood guide usa white woman sitting on the burnside wringing her handsso the bairns were frighted to see a strange woman sitting there all but halbert who will be sixteen come whitsuntide and besides he never feared ony thingand when they went up to herbehold she was passed away  for shame good woman said father eustace a woman of your sense to listen to a tale so idlethe young folk told you a lie and that was all  nay sir it was more than that said the old dame for besides that they never told me a lie in their lives i must warn you that on the very ground where the white woman was sitting they found the lady of avenels book and brought it with them to the tower  that is worthy of mark at least said the monk know you no other copy of this volume within these bounds  none your reverence returned elspeth why should thereno one could read it were there twenty  then you are sure it is the very same volume which you gave to father philip said the monk  as sure as that i now speak with your reverence  it is most singular said the monk and he walked across the room in a musing posture  i have been upon nettles to hear what your reverence would say continued dame glendinning respecting this matterthere is nothing i would not do for the lady of avenel and her family and that has been proved and for her servants to boot both martin and tibb although tibb is not so civil sometimes as altogether i have a right to expect but i cannot think it beseeming to have angels or ghosts or fairies or the like waiting upon a leddy when she is in another womans house in respect it is no ways creditable ony thing she had to do was always done to her hand without costing her either pains or pence as a country body says and besides the discredit i cannot but think that there is no safety in having such unchancy creatures about ane but i have tied red thread round the bairnss throats so her fondness still called them and given ilka ane of them a ridingwand of rowantree forby sewing up a slip of witchelm into their doublets and i wish to know of your reverence if there be ony thing mair that a lone woman can do in the matter of ghosts and fairiesbe here that i should have named their unlucky names twice ower  dame glendinning answered the monk somewhat abruptly when the good woman had finished her narrative i pray you do you know the millers daughter  did i know kate happer replied the widow as well as the beggar knows his disha canty quean was kate and a special cummer of my ain maybe twenty years syne  she cannot be the wench i mean said father eustace she after whom i inquire is scarce fifteen a blackeyed girlyou may have seen her at the kirk  your reverence must be in the right and she is my cummers niece doubtless that you are pleased to speak of but i thank god i have always been too duteous in attention to the mass to know whether young wenches have black eyes or green ones  the good father had so much of the world about him that he was unable to avoid smiling when the dame boasted her absolute resistance to a temptation which was not quite so liable to beset her as those of the other sex  perhaps then he said you know her usual dress dame glendinning  ay ay father answered the dame readily enough a white kirtle the wench wears to hide the dust of the mill no doubtand a blue hood that might weel be spared for pridefulness  then may it not be she said the father who has brought back this book and stepped out of the way when the children came near her  the dame pausedwas unwilling to combat the solution suggested by the monkbut was at a loss to conceive why the lass of the mill should come so far from home into so wild a corner merely to leave an old book with three children from whose observation she wished to conceal herself  above all she could not understand why since she had acquaintances in the family and since the dame glendinning had always paid her multure and knaveship duly the said lass of the mill had not come in to rest herself and eat a morsel and tell her the current news of the water  these very objections satisfied the monk that his conjectures were right  dame he said you must be cautious in what you say this is an instancei would it were the sole oneof the power of the enemy in these days the matter must be siftedwith a curious and a careful hand  indeed said elspeth trying to catch and chime in with the ideas of the subprior i have often thought the millers folk at the monasterymill were far over careless in sifting our melder and in bolting it toosome folk say they will not stick at whiles to put in a handful of ashes amongst christian folks cornmeal  that shall be looked after also dame said the subprior not displeased to see that the good old woman went off on a false scent and now by your leave i will see this ladydo you go before and prepare her to see me  dame glendinning left the lower apartment accordingly which the monk paced in anxious reflection considering how he might best discharge with humanity as well as with effect the important duty imposed on him he resolved to approach the bedside of the sick person with reprimands mitigated only by a feeling for her weak conditionhe determined in case of her reply to which late examples of hardened heretics might encourage her to be prepared with answers to the customary scruples high fraught also with zeal against her unauthorized intrusion into the priestly function by study of the sacred scriptures he imagined to himself the answers which one of the modern school of heresy might return to himthe victorious refutation which should lay the disputant prostrate at the confessors mercyand the healing yet awful exhortation which under pain of refusing the last consolations of religion he designed to make to the penitent conjuring her as she loved her own souls welfare to disclose to him what she knew of the dark mystery of iniquity by which heresies were introduced into the most secluded spots of the very patrimony of the church herselfwhat agents they had who could thus glide as it were unseen from place to place bring back the volume which the church had interdicted to the spots from which it had been removed under her express auspices and who by encouraging the daring and profane thirst after knowledge forbidden and useless to the laity had encouraged the fisher of souls to use with effect his old bait of ambition and vainglory  much of this premeditated disputation escaped the good father when elspeth returned her tears flowing faster than her apron could dry them and made him a signal to follow her how said the monk is she then so near her endnay the church must not break or bruise when comfort is yet possible and forgetting his polemics the good subprior hastened to the little apartment where on the wretched bed which she had occupied since her misfortunes had driven her to the tower of glendearg the widow of walter avenel had rendered up her spirit to her creator my god said the subprior and has my unfortunate dallying suffered her to depart without the churchs consolation look to her dame he exclaimed with eager impatience is there not yet a sparkle of the life leftmay she not be recalledrecalled but for a momentoh would that she could express but by the most imperfect wordbut by the most feeble motion her acquiescence in the needful task of penitential prayerdoes she not breatheart thou sure she doth not  she will never breathe more said the matron oh the poor fatherless girlnow motherless alsooh the kind companion i have had these many years whom i shall never see again but she is in heaven for certain if ever woman went there for a woman of better life  wo to me said the good monk if indeed she went not hence in good assurancewo to the reckless shepherd who suffered the wolf to carry a choice one from the flock while he busied himself with trimming his sling and his staff to give the monster battle oh if in the long hereafter aught but weal should that poor spirit share what has my delay costthe value of an immortal soul  he then approached the body full of the deep remorse natural to a good man of his persuasion who devoutly believed the doctrines of the catholic church ay said he gazing on the pallid corpse from which the spirit had parted so placidly as to leave a smile upon the thin blue lips which had been so long wasted by decay that they had parted with the last breath of animation without the slightest convulsive tremoray said father eustace there lies the faded tree and as it fell so it liesawful thought for me should my neglect have left it to descend in an evil direction he then again and again conjured dame glendinning to tell him what she knew of the demeanour and ordinary walk of the deceased  all tended to the high honour of the deceased lady for her companion who admired her sufficiently while alive notwithstanding some trifling points of jealousy now idolized her after her death and could think of no attribute of praise with which she did not adorn her memory  indeed the lady of avenel however she might privately doubt some of the doctrines announced by the church of rome and although she had probably tacitly appealed from that corrupted system of christianity to the volume on which christianity itself is founded had nevertheless been regular in her attendance on the worship of the church not perhaps extending her scruples so far as to break off communion such indeed was the first sentiment of the earlier reformers who seemed to have studied for a time at least to avoid a schism until the violence of the pope rendered it inevitable  father eustace on the present occasion listened with eagerness to everything which could lead to assure him of the ladys orthodoxy in the main points of belief for his conscience reproached him sorely that instead of protracting conversation with the dame of glendearg he had not instantly hastened where his presence was so necessary if he said addressing the dead body thou art yet free from the utmost penalty due to the followers of false doctrineif thou dost but suffer for a time to expiate faults done in the body but partaking of mortal frailty more than of deadly sin fear not that thy abode shall be long in the penal regions to which thou mayest be doomedif vigilsif massesif penanceif maceration of my body till it resembles that extenuated form which the soul hath abandoned may assure thy deliverance the holy churchthe godly foundationour blessed patroness herself shall intercede for one whose errors were counterbalanced by so many virtuesleave me damehere and by her bedside will i perform those dutieswhich this piteous case demands  elspeth left the monk who employed himself in fervent and sincere though erroneous prayers for the weal of the departed spirit for an hour he remained in the apartment of death and then returned to the hall where he found the still weeping friend of the deceased  but it would be injustice to mrs glendinnings hospitality if we suppose her to have been weeping during this long interval or rather if we suppose her so entirely absorbed by the tribute of sorrow which she paid frankly and plentifully to her deceased friend as to be incapable of attending to the rights of hospitality due to the holy visitorwho was confessor at once and subpriormighty in all religious and secular considerations so far as the vassals of the monastery were interested  her barleybread had been toastedher choicest cask of homebrewed ale had been broachedher best butter had been placed on the halltable along with her most savoury ham and her choicest cheese ere she abandoned herself to the extremity of sorrow and it was not till she had arranged her little repast neatly on the board that she sat down in the chimney corner threw her checked apron over her head and gave way to the current of tears and sobs in this there was no grimace or affectation  the good dame held the honours of her house to be as essential a duty especially when a monk was her visitant as any other pressing call upon her conscience nor until these were suitably attended to did she find herself at liberty to indulge her sorrow for her departed friend  when she was conscious of the subpriors presence she rose with the same attention to his reception but he declined all the offers of hospitality with which she endeavoured to tempt him not her butter as yellow as gold and the best she assured him that was made in the patrimony of st  marynot the barley scones which the departed saint god sain her  used to say were so goodnot the ale nor any other cates which poor elspeths stores afforded could prevail on the subprior to break his fast  this day he said i must not taste food until the sun go down happy if in so doing i can expiate my own negligencehappier still if my sufferings of this trifling nature undertaken in pure faith and singleness of heart may benefit the soul of the deceased yet dame he added i may not so far forget the living in my cares for the dead as to leave behind me that book which is to the ignorant what to our first parents the tree of knowledge of good and evil unhappily provedexcellent indeed in itself but fatal because used by those to whom it is prohibited  oh blithely reverend father said the widow of simon glendinning will i give you the book if so be i can while it from the bairns and indeed poor things as the case stands with them even now you might take the heart out of their bodies and they never find it out they are sae begrutten footnote begruttenoverweeped  give them this missal instead good dame said the father drawing from his pocket one which was curiously illuminated with paintings and i will come myself or send one at a fitting time and teach them the meaning of these pictures  the bonny images said dame glendinning forgetting for an instant her grief in her admiration and weel i wot added she it is another sort of a book than the poor lady of avenels and blessed might we have been this day if your reverence had found the way up the glen instead of father philip though the sacristan is a powerful man too and speaks as if he would ger the house fly abroad save that the walls are gey thick  simons forebears may he and they be blessed took care of that  the monk ordered his mule and was about to take his leave and the good dame was still delaying him with questions about the funeral when a horseman armed and accoutred rode into the little courtyard which surrounded the keep     chapter the ninth     for since they rode among our doors   with splent on spauld and rusty spurs   there grows no fruit into our furs     thus said john uponland                        dannatyne ms  the scottish laws which were as wisely and judiciously made as they were carelessly and ineffectually executed had in vain endeavoured to restrain the damage done to agriculture by the chiefs and landed proprietors retaining in their service what were called jackmen from the jack or doublet quilted with iron which they wore as defensive armour  these military retainers conducted themselves with great insolence towards the industrious part of the communitylived in a great measure by plunder and were ready to execute any commands of their master however unlawful  in adopting this mode of life men resigned the quiet hopes and regular labours of industry for an unsettled precarious and dangerous trade which yet had such charms for those once accustomed to it that they became incapable of following any other hence the complaint of john upland a fictitious character representing a countryman into whose mouth the poets of the day put their general satires upon men and manners    they ride about in such a rage   by forest frith and field     with buckler bow and brand   lo where they ride out through the rye   the devil mot save the company     quoth john uponland  christie of the clinthill the horseman who now arrived at the little tower of glendearg was one of the hopeful company of whom the poet complains as was indicated by his splent on spauld ironplates on his shoulder his rusted spurs and his long lance an iron skullcap none of the brightest bore for distinction a sprig of the holly which was avenels badge a long twoedged straight sword having a handle made of polished oak hung down by his side the meagre condition of his horse and the wild and emaciated look of the rider showed their occupation could not be accounted an easy or a thriving one he saluted dame glendinning with little courtesy and the monk with less for the growing disrespect to the religious orders had not failed to extend itself among a class of men of such disorderly habits although it may be supposed they were tolerably indifferent alike to the new or the ancient doctrines  so our lady is dead dame glendinning said the jackman my master has sent you even now a fat bullock for her martit may serve for her funeral i have left him in the upper cleugh as he is somewhat kenspeckle footnote kenspeckleithat which is easily recognized by the eye and is marked both with cut and birnthe sooner the skin is off and he is in saultfat the less like you are to have troubleyou understand me let me have a peck of corn for my horse and beef and beer for myself for i must go on to the monasterythough i think this monk hero might do mine errand  thine errand rude man said the subprior knitting his brows  for gods sake cried poor dame glendinning terrified at the idea of a quarrel between themo christieit is the subprioro reverend sir it is christie of the clinthill the lairds chief jackman ye know that little havings can be expected from the like o them  are you a retainer of the laird of avenel said the monk addressing himself to the horseman and do you speak thus rudely to a brother of saint marys to whom thy master is so much beholden  he means to be yet more beholden to your house sir monk answered the fellow for hearing his sisterinlaw the widow of walter of avenel was on her deathbed he sent me to say to the father abbot and the brethren that he will hold the funeralfeast at their convent and invites himself thereto with a score of horse and some friends and to abide there for three days and three nightshaving horsemeat and mensmeat at the charge of the community of which his intention he sends due notice that fitting preparation may be timeously made  friend said the subprior believe not that i will do to the father abbot the indignity of delivering such an errandthinkst thou the goods of the church were bestowed upon her by holy princes and pious nobles now dead and gone to be consumed in revelry by every profligate layman who numbers in his train more followers than he can support by honest means or by his own incomings tell thy master from the subprior of saint marys that the primate hath issued his commands to us that we submit no longer to this compulsory exaction of hospitality on slight or false pretences our lands and goods were given to relieve pilgrims and pious persons not to feast bands of rude soldiers  this to me said the angry spearman this to me and to my master look to yourself then sir priest and try if ave and credo will keep bullocks from wandering and haystacks from burning  dost thou menace the holy churchs patrimony with waste and fireraising said the subprior and that in the face of the sun i call on all who hear me to bear witness to the words this ruffian has spoken remember how the lord james drowned such as you by scores in the black pool at jeddartto him and to the primate will i complain the soldier shifted the position of his lance and brought it down to a level with the monks body  dame glendinning began to shriek for assistance tibb tacket martin where be ye allchristie for the love of god consider he is a man of holy kirk  i care not for his spear said the subprior if i am slain in defending the rights and privileges of my community the primate will know how to take vengeance  let him look to himself said christie but at the same time depositing his lance against the wall of the tower if the fife men spoke true who came hither with the governor in the last raid norman leslie has him at feud and is like to set him hard we know norman a true bloodhound who will never quit the slot but i had no design to offend the holy father he added thinking perhaps he had gone a little too far i am a rude man bred to lance and stirrup and not used to deal with booklearned men and priests and i am willing to ask his forgivenessand his blessing if i have said aught amiss  for gods sake your reverence said the widow of glendearg apart to the subprior bestow on him your forgivenesshow shall we poor folk sleep in security in the dark nights if the convent is at feud with such men as he is  you are right dame said the subprior your safety should and must be in the first instance consultedsoldier i forgive thee and may god bless thee and send thee honesty  christie of the clinthill made an unwilling inclination with his head and muttered apart that is as much as to say god send thee starvation but now to my masters demand sir priest what answer am i to return  that the body of the widow of walter of avenel answered the father shall be interred as becomes her rank and in the tomb of her valiant husband for your masters proffered visit of three days with such a company and retinue i have no authority to reply to it you must intimate your chiefs purpose to the reverend lord abbot  that will cost me a farther ride said the man but it is all in the days workhow now my lad said he to halbert who was handling the long lance which he had laid aside how do you like such a playthingwill you go with me and be a mosstrooper  the saints in their mercy forbid said the poor mother and then afraid of having displeased christie by the vivacity of her exclamation she followed it up by explaining that since simons death she could not look on a spear or a bow or any implement of destruction without trembling  pshaw answered christie thou shouldst take another husband dame and drive such follies out of thy thoughtswhat sayst thou to such a strapping lad as i why this old tower of thine is fensible enough and there is no want of clenchs and crags and bogs and thickets if one was set hard a man might bide here and keep his halfscore of lads and as many geldings and live on what he could lay his hand on and be kind to thee old wench  alas master christie said the matron that you should talk to a lone woman in such a fashion and death in the house besides  lone womanwhy that is the very reason thou shouldst take a mate thy old friend is dead why goodchoose thou another of somewhat tougher frame and that will not die of the pip like a young chicken better stillcome dame let me have something to eat and we will talk more of this  dame elspeth though she well knew the character of the man whom in fact she both disliked and feared could not help simpering at the personal address which he thought proper to make to her she whispered to the subprior ony thing just to keep him quiet and went into the tower to set before the soldier the food he desired trusting betwixt good cheer and the power of her own charms to keep christie of the clinthill so well amused that the altercation betwixt him and the holy father should not be renewed  the subprior was equally unwilling to hazard any unnecessary rupture between the community and such a person as julian of avenel he was sensible that moderation as well as firmness was necessary to support the tottering cause of the church of rome and that contrary to former times the quarrels betwixt the clergy and laity had in the present usually terminated to the advantage of the latter he resolved therefore to avoid farther strife by withdrawing but failed not in the first place to possess himself of the volume which the sacristan carried off the evening before and which had been returned to the glen in such a marvellous manner  edward the younger of dame elspeths boys made great objections to the books being removed in which mary would probably have joined but that she was now in her little sleepingchamber with tibb who was exerting her simple skill to console the young lady for her mothers death but the younger glendinning stood up in defence of her property and with a positiveness which had hitherto made no part of his character declared that now the kind lady was dead the book was marys and no one but mary should have it  but if it is not a fit book for mary to read my dear boy said the father gently you would not wish it to remain with her  the lady read it answered the young champion of property and so it could not be wrongit shall not be taken awayi wonder where halbert islistening to the bravading tales of gay christie i reckonhe is always wishing for fighting and now he is out of the way  why edward you would not fight with me who am both a priest and old man  if you were as good a priest as the pope said the boy and as old as the hills to boot you shall not carry away marys book without her leave  i will do battle for it  but see you my love said the monk amused with the resolute friendship manifested by the boy i do not take it i only borrow it and i leave in its place my own gay missal as a pledge i will bring it again  edward opened the missal with eager curiosity and glanced at the pictures with which it was illustrated saint george and the dragon halbert will like that and saint michael brandishing his sword over the head of the wicked oneand that will do for halbert too and see the saint john leading his lamb in the wilderness with his little cross made of reeds and his scrip and staffthat shall be my favourite and where shall we find one for poor maryhere is a beautiful woman weeping and lamenting herself  this is saint mary magdalen repenting of her sins my dear boy said the father  that will not suit our mary for she commits no faults and is never angry with us but when we do something wrong  then said the father i will show you a mary who will protect her and you and all good children see how fairly she is represented with her gown covered with golden stars  the boy was lost in wonder at the portrait of the virgin which the subprior turned up to him  this he said is really like our sweet mary and i think i will let you take away the black book that has no such goodly shows in it and leave this for mary instead but you must promise to bring back the book good fatherfor now i think upon it mary may like that best which was her mothers  i will certainly return said the monk evading his answer and perhaps i may teach you to write and read such beautiful letters as you see there written and to paint them blue green and yellow and to blazon them with gold  ay and to make such figures as these blessed saints and especially these two marys said the boy  with their blessing said the subprior i can teach you that art too so far as i am myself capable of showing and you of learning it then said edward will i paint marys pictureand remember you are to bring back the black book that you must promise me  the subprior anxious to get rid of the boys pertinacity and to set forward on his return to the convent without having any further interview with christie the galloper answered by giving the promise edward required mounted his mule and set forth on his return homeward  the november day was well spent ere the subprior resumed his journey for the difficulty of the road and the various delays which he had met with at the tower had detained him longer than he proposed a chill easterly wind was sighing among the withered leaves and stripping them from the hold they had yet retained on the parent trees  even so said the monk our prospects in this vale of time grow more disconsolate as the stream of years passes on little have i gained by my journey saving the certainty that heresy is busy among us with more than his usual activity and that the spirit of insulting religious orders and plundering the churchs property so general in the eastern districts of scotland has now come nearer home  the tread of a horse which came up behind him interrupted his reverie and he soon saw he was mounted by the same wild rider whom he had left at the tower  good even my son and benedicite said the subprior as he passed but the rude soldier scarce acknowledged the greeting by bending his head and dashing the spurs into his horse went on at a pace which soon left the monk and his mule far behind and there thought the subprior goes another plague of the timesa fellow whose birth designed him to cultivate the earth but who is perverted by the unhallowed and unchristian divisions of the country into a daring and dissolute robber the barons of scotland are now turned masterful thieves and ruffians oppressing the poor by violence and wasting the church by extorting freequarters from abbeys and priories without either shame or reason i fear me i shall be too late to counsel the abbot to make a stand against these daring sorners footnote to sorne in scotland is to exact free quarters against the will of the landlord it is declared equivalent to theft by a statute passed in the year 1445 the great chieftains oppressed the monasteries very much by exactions of this nature the community of aberbrothwick complained of an earl of angus i think who was in the regular habit of visiting them once a year with a train of a thousand horse and abiding till the whole winter provisions of the convent were exhaustedi must make haste he struck his mule with his riding wand accordingly but instead of mending her pace the animal suddenly started from the path and the riders utmost efforts could not force her forward  art thou too infected with the spirit of the times said the subprior thou wert wont to be ready and serviceable and art now as restive as any wild jackman or stubborn heretic of them all  while he was contending with the startled animal a voice like that of a female chanted in his ear or at least very close to it   good evening sir priest and so late as you ride   with your mule so fair and your mantle so wide   but ride you through valley or ride you oer hill   there is one that has warrant to wait on you still                back back                the volume black   i have a warrant to carry it back  the subprior looked around but neither bush nor brake was near which could conceal an ambushed songstress may our lady have mercy on me he said i trust my senses have not forsaken meyet how my thoughts should arrange themselves into rhymes which i despise and music which i care not for or why there should be the sound of a female voice in ears in which its melody has been so long indifferent baffles my comprehension and almost realizes the vision of philip the sacristan come good mule betake thee to the path and let us hence while our judgment serves us  but the mule stood as if it had been rooted to the spot backed from the point to which it was pressed by its rider and by her ears laid close into her neck and her eyes almost starting from their sockets testified that she was under great terror  while the subprior by alternate threats and soothing endeavoured to reclaim the wayward animal to her duty the wild musical voice was again heard close beside him    what ho subprior and came you but here   to conjure a book from a dead womans bier   sain you and save you be wary and wise   ride back with the book or youll pay for your prize                back back                theres death in the track   in the name of my master i bid thee bear back  in the name of my master said the astonished monk that name before which all things created tremble i conjure thee to say what thou art that hauntest me thus  the same voice replied    that which is neither ill nor well   that which belongs not to heaven nor to hell   a wreath of the mist a bubble of the stream   twixt a waking thought and a sleeping dream                a form that men spy                with the halfshut eye   in the beams of the setting sun am i  this is more than simple fantasy said the subprior rousing himself though notwithstanding the natural hardihood of his temper the sensible presence of a supernatural being so near him failed not to make his blood run cold and his hair bristle i charge thee he said aloud be thine errand what it will to depart and trouble me no more false spirit thou canst not appal any save those who do the work negligently the voice immediately answered    vainly sir prior wouldst thou bar me my right   like the star when it shoots i can dart through the night   i can dance on the torrent and ride on the air   and travel the world with the bonny nightmare                  again again                 at the crook of the glen   where bickers the burnie ill meet thee again  the road was now apparently left open for the mule collected herself and changed from her posture of terror to one which promised advance although a profuse perspiration and general trembling of the joints indicated the bodily terror she had undergone  i used to doubt the existence of cabalists and rosicrucians thought the subprior but by my holy order i know no longer what to say my pulse beats temperatelymy hand is cooli am fasting from everything but sin and possessed of my ordinary facultieseither some fiend is permitted to bewilder me or the tales of cornelius agrippa paracelsus and others who treat of occult philosophy are not without foundationat the crook of the glen i could have desired to avoid a second meeting but i am on the service of the church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against me  he moved around accordingly but with precaution and not without fear for he neither knew the manner in which or the place where his journey might be next interrupted by his invisible attendant he descended the glen without interruption for about a mile farther when just at the spot where the brook approached the steep hill with a winding so abrupt as to leave scarcely room for a horse to pass the mule was again visited with the same symptoms of terror which had before interrupted her course better acquainted than before with the cause of her restiveness the priest employed no effort to make her proceed but addressed himself to the object which he doubted not was the same that had formerly interrupted him in the words of solemn exorcism prescribed by the church of rome on such occasions  in reply to his demand the voice again sung    men of good are bold as sacklessfootnote sacklessinnocent   men of rude are wild and reckless       lie thou still       in the nook of the hill   for those be before thee that wish thee ill  while the subprior listened with his head turned in the direction from which the sounds seemed to come he felt as if something rushed against him and ere he could discover the cause he was pushed from his saddle with gentle but irresistible force before he reached the ground his senses were gone and he lay long in a state of insensibility for the sunset had not ceased to gild the top of the distant hill when he felland when he again became conscious of existence the pale moon was gleaming on the landscape he awakened in a state of terror from which for a few minutes he found it difficult to shake himself free at length he sate upon the grass and became sensible by repeated exertion that the only personal injury which he had sustained was the numbness arising from extreme cold the motion of something near him made the blood again run to his heart and by a sudden effort he started up and looking around saw to his relief that the noise was occasioned by the footsteps of his own mule the peaceable animal had remained quietly beside her master during his trance browsing on the grass which grew plentifully in that sequestered nook  with some exertion he collected himself remounted the animal and meditating upon his wild adventure descended the glen till its junction with the broader valley through which the tweed winds the drawbridge was readily dropped at his first summons and so much had he won upon the heart of the churlish warden that peter appeared himself with a lantern to show the subprior his way over the perilous pass  by my sooth sir he said holding the light up to father eustaces face you look sorely travelled and deadly palebut a little matter serves to weary out you men of the cell i now who speak to youi have riddenbefore i was perched up here on this pillar betwixt wind and waterit may be thirty scots miles before i broke my fast and have had the red of a bramble rose in my cheek all the whilebut will you taste some food or a cup of distilled waters  i may not said father eustace being under a vow but i thank you for your kindness and pray you to give what i may not accept to the next poor pilgrim who comes hither pale and fainting for so it shall be the better both with him here and with you hereafter  by my faith and i will do so said peter bridgeward even for thy sakeit is strange now how this subprior gets round ones heart more than the rest of these cowled gentry that think of nothing but quaffing and stuffingwife i saywife we will give a cup of distilled waters and a crust of bread unto the next pilgrim that comes over and ye may keep for footnote an oldfashioned name for an earthen jar for holding spirits the purpose the grunds of the last greybeard and the illbaked bannock which the bairns couldna eat  while peter issued these charitable and at the same time prudent injunctions the subprior whose mild interference had awakened the bridgeward to such an act of unwonted generosity was pacing onward to the monastery in the way he had to commune with and subdue his own rebellious heart an enemy he was sensible more formidable than any which the external powers of satan could place in his way  father eustace had indeed strong temptation to suppress the extraordinary incident which had befallen him which he was the more reluctant to confess because he had passed so severe a judgment upon father philip who as he was not unwilling to allow had on his return from glendearg encountered obstacles somewhat similar to his own of this the subprior was the more convinced when feeling in his bosom for the book which he had brought off from the tower of glendearg he found it was amissing which he could only account for by supposing it had been stolen from him during his trance  if i confess this strange visitation thought the subprior i become the ridicule of all my brethreni whom the primate sent hither to be a watch as it were and a check upon their follies i give the abbot an advantage over me which i shall never again recover and heaven only knows how he may abuse it in his foolish simplicity to the dishonour and loss of holy kirkbut then if i make not true confession of my shame with what face can i again presume to admonish or restrain othersavow proud heart continued he addressing himself that the weal of holy church interests thee less in this matter than thine own humiliationyes heaven has punished thee even in that point in which thou didst deem thyself most strong in thy spiritual pride and thy carnal wisdom thou hast laughed at and derided the inexperience of thy brethrenstoop thyself in turn to their derisiontell what they may not believeaffirm that which they will ascribe to idle fear or perhaps to idle falsehoodsustain the disgrace of a silly visionary or a wilful deceiverbe it so i will do my duty and make ample confession to my superior if the discharge of this duty destroys my usefulness in this house god and our lady will send me where i can better serve them  there was no little merit in the resolution thus piously and generously formed by father eustace to men of any rank the esteem of their order is naturally most dear but in the monastic establishment cut off as the brethren are from other objects of ambition as well as from all exterior friendship and relationship the place which they hold in the opinion of each other is all in all  but the consciousness how much he should rejoice the abbot and most of the other monks of saint marys who were impatient of the unauthorized yet irresistible control which he was wont to exercise in the affairs of the convent by a confession which would put him in a ludicrous or perhaps even in a criminal point of view could not weigh with father eustace in comparison with the task which his belief enjoined  as strong in his feelings of duty he approached the exterior gate of the monastery he was surprised to see torches gleaming and men assembled around it some on horseback some on foot while several of the monks distinguished through the night by their white scapularies were making themselves busy among the crowd the subprior was received with a unanimous shout of joy which at once made him sensible that he had himself been the object of their anxiety  there he is there he is god be thankedthere he is hale and fear exclaimed the vassals while the monks exclaimed te deum laudamusthe blood of thy servants is precious in thy sight  what is the matter children what is the matter my brethren said father eustace dismounting at the gate  nay brother if thou knowst not we will not tell thee till thou art in the refectory answered the monks suffice it that the lord abbot had ordered these our zealous and faithful vassals instantly to set forth to guard thee from imminent perilye may ungirth your horses children and dismiss and tomorrow each who was at this rendezvous may send to the convent kitchen for a quarter of a yard of roast beef and a blackjack full of double ale footnote it was one of the few reminiscences of old parr or henry jenkins i forget which that at some convent in the veterans neighbourhood the community before the dissolution used to dole out roastbeef in the measure of feet and yards  the vassals dispersed with joyful acclamation and the monks with equal jubilee conducted the subprior into the refectory     chapter the tenth     here we stand   woundless and well may heavens high name be blessd fort   as erst ere treason couchd a lance against us                                                   decker  no sooner was the subprior hurried into the refectory by his rejoicing companions than the first person on whom he fixed his eye proved to be christie of the clinthill he was seated in the chimneycorner fettered and guarded his features drawn into that air of sulky and turbid resolution with which those hardened in guilt are accustomed to view the approach of punishment but as the subprior drew near to him his face assumed a more wild and startled expression while he exclaimedthe devil the devil himself brings the dead back upon the living  nay said a monk to him say rather that our lady foils the attempts of the wicked on her faithful servantsour dear brother lives and moves  lives and moves said the ruffian rising and shuffling towards the subprior as well as his chains would permit nay then i will never trust ashen shaft and steel point moreit is even so he added as he gazed on the subprior with astonishment neither wem nor woundnot as much as a rent in his frock  and whence should my wound have come said father eustace  from the good lance that never failed me before replied christie of the clinthill  heaven absolve thee for thy purpose said the subprior wouldst thou have slain a servant of the altar  to choose answered christie the fifemen say an the whole pack of ye were slain there were more lost at flodden  villain art thou heretic as well as murderer  not i by saint giles replied the rider i listened blithely enough to the laird of monance when he told me ye were all cheats and knaves but when he would have had me go hear one wiseheart a gospeller as they call him he might as well have persuaded the wild colt that had flung one rider to kneel down and help another into the saddle  there is some goodness about him yet said the sacristan to the abbot who at that moment enteredhe refused to hear a heretic preacher  the better for him in the next world answered the abbot prepare for death my sonwe deliver thee over to the secular arm of our bailie for execution on the gallowhill by peep of light  amen said the ruffian tis the end i must have come by sooner or laterand what care i whether i feed the crows at saint marys or at carlisle  let me implore your reverend patience for an instant said the subprior until i shall inquire  what exclaimed the abbot observing him for the first timeour dear brother restored to us when his life was unhoped fornay kneel not to a sinner like mestand upthou hast my blessing when this villain came to the gate accused by his own evil conscience and crying out he had murdered thee i thought that the pillar of our main aisle had fallenno more shall a life so precious be exposed to such risks as occur in this border country no longer shall one beloved and rescued of heaven hold so low a station in the church as that of a poor subpriori will write by express to the primate for thy speedy removal and advancement  nay but let me understand said the subprior did this soldier say he had slain me  that he had transfixed you answered the abbot in full career with his lancebut it seems he had taken an indifferent aim but no sooner didst thou fall to the ground mortally gored as he deemed with his weapon than our blessed patroness appeared to him as he averred  i averred no such thing said the prisoner i said a woman in white interrupted me as i was about to examine the priests cassock for they are usually well linedshe had a bulrush in her hand with one touch of which she struck me from my horse as i might strike down a child of four years old with an iron maceand then like a singing fiend as she was she sung to me    thank the hollybush     that nods on thy brow   or with this slender rush     i had strangled thee now  i gathered myself up with fear and difficulty threw myself on my horse and came hither like a fool to get myself hanged for a rogue  thou seest honoured brother said the abbot to the subprior in what favour thou art with our blessed patroness that she herself becomes the guardian of thy pathsnot since the days of our blessed founder hath she shown such grace to any one all unworthy were we to hold spiritual superiority over thee and we pray thee to prepare for thy speedy removal to aberbrothwick  alas my lord and father said the subprior your words pierce my very soul under the seal of confession will i presently tell thee why i conceive myself rather the baffled sport of a spirit of another sort than the protected favourite of the heavenly powers but first let me ask this unhappy man a question or two  do as ye list replied the abbotbut you shall not convince me that it is fitting you remain in this inferior office in the convent of saint mary  i would ask of this poor man said father eustace for what purpose he nourished the thought of putting to death one who never did him evil  ay but thou didst menace me with evil said the ruffian and no one but a fool is menaced twice dost thou not remember what you said touching the primate and lord james and the black pool of jedwood didst thou think me fool enough to wait till thou hadst betrayed me to the sack and the fork there were small wisdom in that methinksas little as in coming hither to tell my own misdeedsi think the devil was in me when i took this roadi might have remembered the proverb never friar forgot feud  and it was solely for thatfor that only hasty word of mine uttered in a moment of impatience and forgotten ere it was well spoken said father eustace  ay for that andfor the love of thy gold crucifix said christie of the clinthill  gracious heaven and could the yellow metalthe glittering earth so far overcome every sense of what is thereby representedfather abbot i pray as a dear boon you will deliver this guilty person to my mercy  nay brother interposed the sacristan to your doom if you will not to your mercyremember we are not all equally favoured by our blessed lady nor is it likely that every frock in the convent will serve as a coat of proof when a lance is couched against it  for that very reason said the subprior i would not that for my worthless self the community were to fall at feud with julian of avenel this mans master  our lady forbid said the sacristan he is a second julian the apostate  with our reverend father the abbots permission then said father eustace i desire this man be freed from his chains and suffered to depart uninjuredand here friend he added giving him the golden crucifix is the image for which thou wert willing to stain thy hands with murder  view it well and may it inspire thee with other and better thoughts than those which referred to it as a piece of bullion part with it nevertheless if thy necessities require and get thee one of such coarse substance that mammon shall have no share in any of the reflections to which it gives rise it was the bequest of a dear friend to me but dearer service can it never do than that of winning a soul to heaven  the borderer now freed from his chains stood gazing alternately on the subprior and on the golden crucifix by saint giles said he i understand ye notan ye give me gold for couching my lance at thee what would you give me to level it at a heretic  the church said the subprior will try the effect of her spiritual censures to bring these stray sheep into the fold ere she employ the edge of the sword of saint peter  ay but said the ruffian they say the primate recommends a little strangling and burning in aid of both censure and of sword but fare ye weel i owe you a life and it may be i will not forget my debt  the bailie now came bustling in dressed in his blue coat and bandaliers and attended by two or three halberdiers i have been a thought too late in waiting upon your reverend lordship i am grown somewhat fatter since the field of pinkie and my leathern coat slips not on so soon as it was wont but the dungeon is ready and though as i said i have been somewhat late  here his intended prisoner walked gravely up to the officers nose to his great amazement  you have been indeed somewhat late bailie said he and i am greatly obligated to your buffcoat and to the time you took to put it on  if the secular arm had arrived some quarter of an hour sooner i had been out of the reach of spiritual grace but as it is i wish you good even and a safe riddance out of your garment of durance in which you have much the air of a hog in armour  wroth was the bailie at this comparison and exclaimed in irean it were not for the presence of the venerable lord abbot thou knave  nay an thou wouldst try conclusions said christie of the clinthill i will meet thee at daybreak by saint marys well  hardened wretch said father eustace art thou but this instant delivered from death and dost thou so soon morse thoughts of slaughter  i will meet with thee ere it be long thou knave said the bailie and teach thee thine oremus  i will meet thy cattle in a moonlight night before that day said he of the clinthill  i will have thee by the neck one misty morning thou strong thief answered the secular officer of the church  thou art thyself as strong a thief as ever rode retorted christie and if the worms were once feasting on that fat carcass of thine i might well hope to have thine office by favour of these reverend men  a cast of their office and a cast of mine answered the bailie a cord and a confessor that is all thou wilt have from us  sirs said the subprior observing that his brethren began to take more interest than was exactly decorous in this wrangling betwixt justice and iniquity i pray you both to departmaster bailie retire with your halberdiers and trouble not the man whom we have dismissedand thou christie or whatever be thy name take thy departure and remember thou owest thy life to the lord abbots clemency  nay as to that answered christie i judge that i owe it to your own but impute it to whom ye list i owe a life among ye and there is an end and whistling as he went he left the apartment seeming as if he held the life which he had forfeited not worthy further thanks  obstinate even to brutality said father eustace and yet who knows but some better ore may lie under so rude an exterior  save a thief from the gallows said the sacristanyou know the rest of the proverb and admitting as may heaven grant that our lives and limbs are safe from this outrageous knave who shall insure our meal and our malt our herds and our flocks  marry that will i my brethren said an aged monk ah brethren you little know what may be made of a repentant robber in abbot ingilrams daysay and i remember them as it were yesterdaythe freebooters were the best welcome men that came to saint marys ay they paid tithe of every drove that they brought over from the south and because they were something lightly come by i have known them make the tithe a sevenththat is if their confessor knew his businessay when we saw from the tower a score of fat bullocks or a drove of sheep coming down the valley with two or three stout menatarms behind them with their glittering steel caps and their blackjacks and their long lances the good lord abbot ingilram was wont to sayhe was a merry manthere come the tithes of the spoilers of the egyptians ay and i have seen the famous john the armstranga fair man he was and a goodly the more pity that hemp was ever heckled for himi have seen him come into the abbeychurch with nine tassels of gold in his bonnet and every tassel made of nine english nobles and he would go from chapel to chapel and from image to image and from altar to altar on his kneesand leave here a tassel and there a noble till there was as little gold on his bonnet as on my hoodyou will find no such border thieves now  no truly brother nicolas answered the abbot they are more apt to take any gold the church has left than to bequeath or bestow anyand for cattle beshrew me if i think they care whether beeves have fed on the meadows of lanercost abbey or of saint marys  there is no good thing left in them said father nicolas they are clean naughtah the thieves that i have seensuch proper men and as pitiful as proper and as pious as pitiful  it skills not talking of it brother nicolas said the abbot and i will now dismiss you my brethren holding your meeting upon this our inquisition concerning the danger of our reverend subprior instead of the attendance on the lauds this eveningyet let the bells be duly rung for the edification of the laymen without and also that the novices may give due reverenceand now benedicite brethren the cellarer will bestow on each a gracecup and a morsel as ye pass the buttery for ye have been turmoiled and anxious and dangerous it is to fall asleep in such case with empty stomach  gratias agimus quam maximas domine reverendissime replied the brethren departing in their due order  but the subprior remained behind and falling on his knees before the abbot as he was about to withdraw craved him to hear under the seal of confession the adventures of the day the reverend lord abbot yawned and would have alleged fatigue but to father eustace of all men he was ashamed to show indifference in his religious duties the confession therefore proceeded in which father eustace told all the extraordinary circumstances which had befallen him during the journey and being questioned by the abbot whether he was not conscious of any secret sin through which he might have been subjected for a time to the delusions of evil spirits the subprior admitted with frank avowal that he thought he might have deserved such penance for having judged with unfraternal rigour of the report of father philip the sacristan  heaven said the penitent may have been willing to convince me not only that he can at pleasure open a communication betwixt us and beings of a different and as we word it supernatural class but also to punish our pride of superior wisdom or superior courage or superior learning  it is well said that virtue is its own reward and i question if duty was ever more completely recompensed than by the audience which the reverend abbot so unwillingly yielded to the confession of the subprior to find the object of his fear shall we say or of his envy or of both accusing himself of the very error with which he had so tacitly charged him was a corroboration of the abbots judgment a soothing of his pride and an allaying of his fears the sense of triumph however rather increased than diminished his natural goodhumour and so far was abbot boniface from being disposed to tyrannize over his subprior in consequence of this discovery that in his exhortation he hovered somewhat ludicrously betwixt the natural expression of his own gratified vanity and his timid reluctance to hurt the feelings of father eustace  my brother said he ex cathedra it cannot have escaped your judicious observation that we have often declined our own judgment in favour of your opinion even about those matters which most nearly concerned the community nevertheless grieved would we be could you think that we did this either because we deemed our own opinion less pregnant or our wit more shallow than that of our brethren for it was done exclusively to give our younger brethren such as your much esteemed self my dearest brother that courage which is necessary to a free deliverance of your opinionwe ofttimes setting apart our proper judgment that our inferiors and especially our dear brother the subprior may be comforted and encouraged in proposing valiantly his own thoughts  which our deference and humility may in some sort have produced in your mind most reverend brother that selfopinion of parts and knowledge which hath led unfortunately to your overestimating your own faculties and thereby subjecting yourself as is but too visible to the japes and mockeries of evil spirits  for it is assured that heaven always holdeth us in the least esteem when we deem of ourselves most highly and also on the other hand it may be that we have somewhat departed from what became our high seat in this abbey in suffering ourselves to be too much guided and even as it were controlled by the voice of our inferior wherefore continued the lord abbot in both of us such faults shall and must be amendedyou hereafter presuming less upon your gifts and carnal wisdom and i taking heed not so easily to relinquish mine own opinion for that of one lower in place and in office nevertheless we would not that we should thereby lose the high advantage which we have derived and may yet derive from your wise counsels which hath been so often recommended to us by our most reverend primate wherefore on affairs of high moment we will call you to our presence in private and listen to your opinion which if it shall agree with our own we will deliver to the chapter as emanating directly from ourselves thus sparing you dearest brother that seeming victory which is so apt to engender spiritual pride and avoiding ourselves the temptation of falling into that modest facility of opinion whereby our office is lessened and our person were that of consequence rendered less important in the eyes of the community over which we preside  notwithstanding the high notions which as a rigid catholic father eustace entertained of the sacrament of confession as his church calls it there was some danger that a sense of the ridiculous might have stolen on him when he heard his superior with such simple cunning lay out a little plan for availing himself of the subpriors wisdom and experience while he should take the whole credit to himself yet his conscience immediately told him he was right  i should have thought more he reflected of the spiritual superior and less of the individual i should have spread my mantle over the frailties of my spiritual father and done what i might to support his character and of course to extend his utility among the brethren as well as with others the abbot cannot be humbled but what the community must be humbled in his person her boast is that over all her children especially over those called to places of distinction she can diffuse those gifts which are necessary to render them illustrious  actuated by these sentiments father eustace frankly assented to the charge which his superior even in that moment of authority had rather intimated than made and signified his humble acquiescence in any mode of communicating his counsel which might be most agreeable to the lord abbot and might best remove from himself all temptation to glory in his own wisdom he then prayed the reverend father to assign him such penance as might best suit his offence intimating at the same time that he had already fasted the whole day  and it is that i complain of answered the abbot instead of giving him credit for his abstinence it is these very penances fasts and vigils of which we complain as tending only to generate airs and fumes of vanity which ascending from the stomach into the head do but puff us up with vainglory and selfopinion it is meet and beseeming that novices should undergo fasts and vigils for some part of every community must fast and young stomachs may best endure it besides in them it abates wicked thoughts and the desire of worldly delights but reverend brother for those to fast who are dead and mortified to the world as i and thou is work of supererogation and is but the matter of spiritual pride wherefore i enjoin thee most reverend brother go to the buttery and drink two cups at least of good wine eating withal a comfortable morsel such as may best suit thy taste and stomach and in respect that thine opinion of thy own wisdom hath at times made thee less conformable to and companionable with the weaker and less learned brethren i enjoin thee during the said repast to choose for thy companion our reverend brother nicolas and without interruption or impatience to listen for a stricken hour to his narration concerning those things which befel in the times of our venerable predecessor abbot ingilram on whose soul may heaven have mercy and for such holy exercises as may farther advantage your soul and expiate the faults whereof you have contritely and humbly avowed yourself guilty we will ponder upon that matter and announce our will unto you the next morning  it was remarkable that after this memorable evening the feelings of the worthy abbot towards his adviser were much more kindly and friendly than when he deemed the subprior the impeccable and infallible person in whose garment of virtue and wisdom no flaw was to be discerned it seemed as if this avowal of his own imperfections had recommended father eustace to the friendship of the superior although at the same time this increase of benevolence was attended with some circumstances which to a man of the subpriors natural elevation of mind and temper were more grievous than even undergoing the legends of the dull and verbose father nicolas for instance the abbot seldom mentioned him to the other monks without designing him our beloved brother eustace poor manand now and then he used to warn the younger brethren against the snares of vainglory and spiritual pride which satan sets for the more rigidly righteous with such looks and demonstrations as did all but expressly designate the subprior as one who had fallen at one time under such delusions upon these occasions it required all the votive obedience of a monk all the philosophical discipline of the schools and all the patience of a christian to enable father eustace to endure the pompous and patronizing parade of his honest but somewhat thickheaded superior he began himself to be desirous of leaving the monastery or at least he manifestly declined to interfere with its affairs in that marked and authoritative manner which he had at first practised                                        chapter the eleventh       you call this education do you not     why tis the forced march of a herd of bullocks     before a shouting drover the glad van     move on at ease and pause a while to snatch     a passing morsel from the dewy greensward     while all the blows the oaths the indignation     fall on the croupe of the illfated laggard     that cripples in the rear                                           old play  two or three years glided on during which the storm of the approaching alteration in church government became each day louder and more perilous owing to the circumstances which we have intimated in the end of the last chapter the subprior eustace appeared to have altered considerably his habits of life he afforded on all extraordinary occasions to the abbot whether privately or in the assembled chapter the support of his wisdom and experience but in his ordinary habits he seemed now to live more for himself and less for the community than had been his former practice  he often absented himself for whole days from the convent and as the adventure of glendearg dwelt deeply on his memory he was repeatedly induced to visit that lonely tower and to take an interest in the orphans who had their shelter under its roof besides he felt a deep anxiety to know whether the volume which he had lost when so strangely preserved from the lance of the murderer had again found its way back to the tower of glendearg it was strange he thought that a spirit for such he could not help judging the being whose voice he had heard should on the one side seek the advancement of heresy and on the other interpose to save the life of a zealous catholic priest  but from no inquiry which he made of the various inhabitants of the tower of glendearg could he learn that the copy of the translated scriptures for which he made such diligent inquiry had again been seen by any of them  in the meanwhile the good fathers occasional visits were of no small consequence to edward glendinning and to mary avenel the former displayed a power of apprehending and retaining whatever was taught him which tilled father eustace with admiration he was at once acute and industrious alert and accurate one of those rare combinations of talent and industry which are seldom united  it was the earnest desire of father eustace that the excellent qualities thus early displayed by edward should be dedicated to the service of the church to which he thought the youths own consent might be easily obtained as he was of a calm contemplative retired habit and seemed to consider knowledge as the principal object and its enlargement as the greatest pleasure in life as to the mother the subprior had little doubt that trained as she was to view the monks of saint marys with such profound reverence she would be but too happy in an opportunity of enrolling one of her sons in its honoured community but the good father proved to be mistaken in both these particulars  when he spoke to elspeth glendinning of that which a mother best loves to hearthe proficiency and abilities of her sonshe listened with a delighted ear but when father eustace hinted at the duty of dedicating to the service of the church talents which seemed fitted to defend and adorn it the dame endeavoured always to shift the subject and when pressed farther enlarged on her own incapacity as a lone woman to manage the feu on the advantage which her neighbours of the township were often taking of her unprotected state and on the wish she had that edward might fill his fathers place remain in the tower and close her eyes  on such occasions the subprior would answer that even in a worldly point of view the welfare of the family would be best consulted by one of the sons entering into the community of saint marys as it was not to be supposed that he would fail to afford his family the important protection which he could then easily extend towards them what could be a more pleasing prospect than to see him high in honour or what more sweet than to have the last duties rendered to her by a son reverend for his holiness of life and exemplary manners besides he endeavoured to impress upon the dame that her eldest son halbert whose bold temper and headstrong indulgence of a wandering humour rendered him incapable of learning was for that reason as well as that he was her eldest born fittest to bustle through the affairs of the world and manage the little fief  elspeth durst not directly dissent from what was proposed for fear of giving displeasure and yet she always had something to say against it halbert she said was not like any of the neighbour boyshe was taller by the head and stronger by the half than any boy of his years within the halidome but he was fit for no peaceful work that could be devised  if he liked a book ill he liked a plough or a pattle worse he had scoured his fathers old broadswordsuspended it by a belt round his waist and seldom stirred without it he was a sweet boy and a gentle if spoken fair but cross him and he was a born devil in a word she said bursting into tears deprive me of edward good father and ye bereave my house of prop and pillar for my heart tells me that halbert will take to his fathers gates and die his fathers death  when the conversation came to this crisis the goodhumoured monk was always content to drop the discussion for the time trusting some opportunity would occur of removing her prejudices for such he thought them against edwards proposed destination  when leaving the mother the subprior addressed himself to the son animating his zeal for knowledge and pointing out how amply it might be gratified should he agree to take holy orders he found the same repugnance which dame elspeth had exhibited edward pleaded a want of sufficient vocation to so serious a professionhis reluctance to leave his mother and other objections which the subprior treated as evasive  i plainly perceive he said one day in answer to them that the devil has his factors as well as heaven and that they are equally or alas the former are perhaps more active in bespeaking for their master the first of the market i trust young man that neither idleness nor licentious pleasure nor the love of worldly gain and worldly grandeur the chief baits with which the great fisher of souls conceals his hook are the causes of your declining the career to which i would incite you but above all i trustabove all i hopethat the vanity of superior knowledgea sin with which those who have made proficiency in learning are most frequently besethas not led you into the awful hazard of listening to the dangerous doctrines which are now afloat concerning religion better for you that you were as grossly ignorant as the beasts which perish that that the pride of knowledge should induce you to lend an ear to the voice of heretics edward glendinning listened to the rebuke with a downcast look and failed not when it was concluded earnestly to vindicate himself from the charge of having pushed his studies into any subjects which the church inhibited and so the monk was left to form vain conjectures respecting the cause of his reluctance to embrace the monastic state  it is an old proverb used by chaucer and quoted by elizabeth that the greatest clerks are not the wisest men and it is as true as if the poet had not rhymed or the queen reasoned on it if father eustace had not had his thoughts turned so much to the progress of heresy and so little to what was passing in the tower he might have read in the speaking eyes of mary avenel now a girl of fourteen or fifteen reasons which might disincline her youthful companion towards the monastic vows i have said that she also was a promising pupil of the good father upon whom her innocent and infantine beauty had an effect of which he was himself perhaps unconscious her rank and expectations entitled her to be taught the arts of reading and writingand each lesson which the monk assigned her was conned over in company with edward and by him explained and reexplained and again illustrated until she became perfectly mistress of it  in the beginning of their studies halbert had been their school companion  but the boldness and impatience of his disposition soon quarrelled with an occupation in which without assiduity and unremitted attention no progress was to be expected the subpriors visits were at regular intervals and often weeks would intervene between them in which case halbert was sure to forget all that had been prescribed for him to learn and much which he had partly acquired before his deficiencies on these occasions gave him pain but it was not of that sort which produces amendment  for a time like all who are fond of idleness he endeavoured to detach the attention of his brother and mary avenel from their task rather than to learn his own and such dialogues as the following would ensue  take your bonnet edward and make hastethe laird of colmslie is at the head of the glen with his hounds  i care not halbert answered the younger brother two brace of dogs may kill a deer without my being there to see them and i must help mary avenel with her lesson  ay you will labour at the monks lessons till you turn monk yourself answered halbertmary will you go with me and i will show you the cushats nest i told you of  i cannot go with you halbert answered mary because i must study this lessonit will take me long to learn iti am sorry i am so dull for if i could get my task as fast as edward i should like to go with you  should you indeed said halbert then i will wait for youand what is more i will try to get my lesson also  with a smile and a sigh he took up the primer and began heavily to con over the task which had been assigned him as if banished from the society of the two others he sat sad and solitary in one of the deep windowrecesses and after in vain struggling with the difficulties of his task and his disinclination to learn it he found himself involuntarily engaged in watching the movements of the other two students instead of toiling any longer  the picture which halbert looked upon was delightful in itself but somehow or other it afforded very little pleasure to him the beautiful girl with looks of simple yet earnest anxiety was bent on disentangling those intricacies which obstructed her progress to knowledge and looking ever and anon to edward for assistance while seated close by her side and watchful to remove every obstacle from her way he seemed at once to be proud of the progress which his pupil made and of the assistance which he was able to render her there was a bond betwixt them a strong and interesting tie the desire of obtaining knowledge the pride of surmounting difficulties  feeling most acutely yet ignorant of the nature and source of his own emotions halbert could no longer endure to look upon this quiet scene but starting up dashed his book from him and exclaimed aloud to the fiend i bequeath all books and the dreamers that make themi would a score of southrons would come up the glen and we should learn how little all this muttering and scribbling is worth  mary avenol and his brother started and looked at halbert with surprise while he went on with great animation his features swelling and the tears starting into his eyes as he spokeyes maryi wish a score of southrons came up the glen this very day and you should see one good hand and one good sword do more to protect you than all the books that were ever opened and all the pens that ever grew on a gooses wing  mary looked a little surprised and a little frightened at his vehemence but instantly replied affectionately you are vexed halbert because you do not get your lesson so fast as edward can and so am i for i am as stupid as youbut come and edward shall sit betwixt us and teach us  he shall not teach me said halbert in the same angry mood i never can teach him to do any thing that is honourable and manly and he shall not teach me any of his monkish tricksi hate the monks with their drawling nasal tone like so many frogs and their long black petticoats like so many women and their reverences and their lordships and their lazy vassals that do nothing but peddle in the mire with plough and harrow from yule to michaelmas i will call none lord but him who wears a sword to make his title good and i will call none man but he that can bear himself manlike and masterful  for heavens sake peace brother said edward if such words were taken up and reported out of the house they would be our mothers ruin  report them yourself then and they will be your making and nobodys marring save mine own say that halbert glendinning will never be vassal to an old man with a cowl and shaven crown while there are twenty barons who wear casque and plume that lack bold followers let them grant you these wretched acres and much meal may they bear you to make your brachan he left the room hastily but instantly returned and continued to speak with the same tone of quick and irritated feeling and you need not think so much neither of you and especially you edward need not think so much of your parchment book there and your cunning in reading it by my faith i will soon learn to read as well as you andfor i know a better teacher than your grim old monk and a better book than his printed breviary and since you like scholarcraft so well mary avenel you shall see whether edward or i have most of it he left the apartment and came not again  what can be the matter with him said mary following halbert with her eyes from the window as with hasty and unequal steps he ran up the wild glenwhere can your brother be going edwardwhat book what teacher does he talk of  it avails not guessing said edward halbert is angry he knows not why and speaks of he knows not what let us go again to our lessons and he will come home when he has tired himself with scrambling among the crags as usual  but marys anxiety on account of halbert seemed more deeply rooted she declined prosecuting the task in which they had been so pleasingly engaged under the excuse of a headache nor could edward prevail upon her to resume it again that morning  meanwhile halbert his head unbonneted his features swelled with jealous anger and the tear still in his eye sped up the wild and upper extremity of the little valley of glendearg with the speed of a roebuck choosing as if in desperate defiance of the difficulties of the way the wildest and most dangerous paths and voluntarily exposing himself a hundred times to dangers which he might have escaped by turning a little aside from them  it seemed as if he wished his course to be as straight as that of the arrow to its mark  he arrived at length in a narrow and secluded cleuch or deep ravine which ran down into the valley and contributed a scanty rivulet to the supply of the brook with which glendearg is watered up this he sped with the same precipitate haste which had marked his departure from the tower nor did he pause and look around until he had reached the fountain from which the rivulet had its rise  here halbert stopt short and cast a gloomy and almost a frightened glance around him a huge rock rose in front from a cleft of which grew a wild hollytree whose dark green branches rustled over the spring which arose beneath the banks on either hand rose so high and approached each other so closely that it was only when the sun was at its meridian height and during the summer solstice that its rays could reach the bottom of the chasm in which he stood but it was now summer and the hour was noon so that the unwonted reflection of the sun was dancing in the pellucid fountain  it is the season and the hour said halbert to himself and now ii might soon become wiser than edward with all his pains mary should see whether he alone is fit to be consulted and to sit by her side and hang over her as she reads and point out every word and every letter  and she loves me better than himi am sure she doesfor she comes of noble blood and scorns sloth and cowardiceand do i myself not stand here slothful and cowardly as any priest of them allwhy should i fear to call upon this formthis shapealready have i endured the vision and why not again what can it do to me who am a man of lith and limb and have by my side my fathers sword does my heart beatdo my hairs bristle at the thought of calling up a painted shadow and how should i face a band of southrons in flesh and blood by the soul of the first glendinning i will make proof of the charm  he cast the leathern brogue or buskin from his right foot planted himself in a firm posture unsheathed his sword and first looking around to collect his resolution he bowed three times deliberately towards the hollytree and as often to the little fountain repeating at the same time with a determined voice the following rhyme    thrice to the holly brake   thrice to the well   i bid thee awake   white maid of avenel    noon gleams on the lake   noon glows on the fell   wake thee o wake   white maid of avenel  these lines were hardly uttered when there stood the figure of a female clothed in white within three steps of halbert glendinning    i guesstwas frightful there to see   a lady richly clad as she   beautiful exceedingly footnote coleridges christabelle                                        chapter the twelfth     theres something in that ancient superstition   which erring as it is our fancy loves   the spring that with its thousand crystal bubbles   bursts from the bosom of some desert rock   in secret solitude may well be deemd   the haunt of something purer more refined   and mightier than ourselves               old play  young halbert glendinning had scarcely pronounced the mystical rhymes than as we have mentioned in the conclusion of the last chapter an appearance as of a beautiful female dressed in white stood within two yards of him his terror for the moment overcame his natural courage as well as the strong resolution which he had formed that the figure which he had now twice seen should not a third time daunt him but it would seem there is something thrilling and abhorrent to flesh and blood in the consciousness that we stand in presence of a being in form like to ourselves but so different in faculties and nature that we can neither understand its purposes nor calculate its means of pursuing them  halbert stood silent and gasped for breath his hairs erecting themselves on his headhis mouth openhis eyes fixed and as the sole remaining sign of his late determined purpose his sword pointed towards the apparition  at length with a voice of ineffable sweetness the white lady for by that name we shall distinguish this being sung or rather chanted the following lines    youth of the dark eye wherefore didst thou call me   wherefore art thou here if terrors can appal thee   he that seeks to deal with us must know no fear nor failing   to coward and churl our speech is dark our gifts are unavailing   the breeze that brought me hither now must sweep egyptian ground   the fleecy cloud on which i ride for araby is bound   the fleecy cloud is drifting by the breeze sighs for my stay   for i must sail a thousand miles before the close of day  the astonishment of halbert began once more to give way to his resolution and he gained voice enough to say though with a faltering accent in the name of god what art thou the answer was in melody of a different tone and measure    what i am i must not show   what i am thou couldst not know   something betwixt heaven and hell   something that neither stood nor fell   something that through thy wit or will   may work thee goodmay work thee ill   neither substance quite nor shadow   haunting lonely moor and meadow   dancing by the haunted spring   riding on the whirlwinds wing   aping in fantastic fashion   every change of human passion    while oer our frozen minds they pass   like shadows from the mirrord glass   wayward fickle is our mood   hovering betwixt bad and good   happier than briefdated man   living twenty times his span   far less happy for we have   help nor hope beyond the grave   man awakes to joy or sorrow   ours the sleep that knows no morrow   this is all that i can show   this is all that thou mayest know  the white lady paused and appeared to await an answer but as halbert hesitated how to frame his speech the vision seemed gradually to fade and became more and more incorporeal justly guessing this to be a symptom of her disappearance halbert compelled himself to saylady when i saw you in the glen and when you brought back the black book of mary avenel thou didst say i should one day learn to read it  the white lady replied    ay and i taught thee the word and the spell   to waken me here by the fairies well   but thou hast loved the heron and hawk   more than to seek my haunted walk   and thou hast loved the lance and the sword   more than good text and holy word   and thou hast loved the deer to track   more than the lines and the letters black   and thou art a ranger of moss and of wood   and scornest the nurture of gentle blood  i will do so no longer fair maiden said halbert i desire to learn and thou didst promise me that when i did so desire thou wouldst be my helper i am no longer afraid of thy presence and i am no longer regardless of instruction as he uttered these words the figure of the white maiden grew gradually as distinct as it had been at first and what had wellnigh faded into an illdefined and colourless shadow again assumed an appearance at least of corporeal consistency although the hues were less vivid and the outline of the figure less distinct and definedso at least it seemed to halbertthan those of an ordinary inhabitant of earth wilt thou grant my request he said fair lady and give to my keeping the holy book which mary of avenel has so often wept for  the white lady replied    thy craven fear my truth accused   thine idlehood my trust abused   he that draws to harbour late   must sleep without or burst the gate    there is a star for thee which burnd   its influence wanes its course is turnd   valour and constancy alone   can bring thee back the chance thats flown  if i have been a loiterer lady answered young glendinning thou shalt now find me willing to press forward with double speed other thoughts have filled my mind other thoughts have engaged my heart within a brief periodand by heaven other occupations shall henceforward fill up my time i have lived in this day the space of yearsi came hither a boyi will return a mana man such as may converse not only with his own kind but with whatever god permits to be visible to him i will learn the contents of that mysterious volumei will learn why the lady of avenel loved itwhy the priests feared and would have stolen itwhy thou didst twice recover it from their handswhat mystery is wrapt in itspeak i conjure thee the lady assumed an air peculiarly sad and solemn as drooping her head and folding her arms on her bosom she replied    within that awful volume lies   the mystery of mysteries   happiest they of human race   to whom god has granted grace    to read to fear to hope to pray   to lift the latch and force the way   and better had they neer been born   who read to doubt or read to scorn  give me the volume lady said young glendinning they call me idlethey call me dullin this pursuit my industry shall not fail nor with gods blessing shall my understanding give me the volume the apparition again replied    many a fathom dark and deep   i have laid the book to sleep   ethereal fires around it glowing   ethereal music ever flowing     the sacred pledge of heavn       all things revere       each in his sphere     save man for whom twas givn   lend thy hand and thou shalt spy   things neer seen by mortal eye  halbert glendinning boldly reached his hand to the white lady  fearest thou to go with me she said as his hand trembled at the soft and cold touch of her own    fearest thou to go with me   still it is free to thee     a peasant to dwell   thou mayst drive the dull steer   and chase the kings deer   but never more come near   this haunted well  if what thou sayest be true said the undaunted boy my destinies are higher than thine own there shall be neither well nor wood which i dare not visit no fear of aught natural or supernatural shall bar my path through my native valley  he had scarce uttered the words when they both descended through the earth with a rapidity which took away halberts breath and every other sensation saving that of being hurried on with the utmost velocity at length they stopped with a shock so sudden that the mortal journeyer through this unknown space must have been thrown down with violence had he not been upheld by his supernatural companion  it was more than a minute ere looking around him he beheld a grotto or natural cavern composed of the most splendid spars and crystals which returned in a thousand prismatic hues the light of a brilliant flame that glowed on an altar of alabaster this altar with its fire formed the central point of the grotto which was of a round form and very high in the roof resembling in some respects the dome of a cathedral corresponding to the four points of the compass there went off four long galleries or arcades constructed of the same brilliant materials with the dome itself and the termination of which was lost in darkness  no human imagination can conceive or words suffice to describe the glorious radiance which shot fiercely forth by the flame was returned from so many hundred thousand points of reflection afforded by the sparry pillars and their numerous angular crystals the fire itself did not remain steady and unmoved but rose and fell sometimes ascending in a brilliant pyramid of condensed flame half way up the lofty expanse and again fading into a softer and more rosy hue and hovering as it were on the surface of the altar to collect its strength for another powerful exertion  there was no visible fuel by which it was fed nor did it emit either smoke or vapour of any kind  what was of all the most remarkable the black volume so often mentioned lay not only unconsumed but untouched in the slightest degree amid this intensity of fire which while it seemed to be of force sufficient to melt adamant had no effect whatever on the sacred book thus subjected to its utmost influence  the white lady having paused long enough to let young glendinning take a complete survey of what was around him now said in her usual chant    here lies the volume thou boldly hast sought   touch it and take ittwill dearly be bought  familiarized in some degree with marvels and desperately desirous of showing the courage he had boasted halbert plunged his hand without hesitation into the flame trusting to the rapidity of the motion to snatch out the volume before the fire could greatly affect him but he was much disappointed the flame instantly caught upon his sleeve and though he withdrew his hand immediately yet his arm was so dreadfully scorched that he had wellnigh screamed with pain he suppressed the natural expression of anguish however and only intimated the agony which he felt by a contortion and a muttered groan the white lady passed her cold hand over his arm and ere she had finished the following metrical chant his pain had entirely gone and no mark of the scorching was visible            rash thy deed           mortal weed     to immortal flames applying           rasher trust           has thing of dust     on his own weak worth relying   strip thee of such fences vain   strip and prove thy luck again  obedient to what he understood to be the meaning of his conductress halbert bared his arm to the shoulder throwing down the remains of his sleeve which no sooner touched the floor on which he stood than it collected itself together shrivelled itself up and was without any visible fire reduced to light tinder which a sudden breath of wind dispersed into empty space the white lady observing the surprise of the youth immediately repeated    mortal warp and mortal woof   cannot brook this charmed roof   all that mortal art hath wrought   in our cell returns to nought   the molten gold returns to clay   the polishd diamond melts away   all is alterd all is flown   nought stands fast but truth alone   not for that thy quest give oer   courage prove thy chance once more  imboldened by her words halbert glendinning made a second effort and plunging his bare arm into the flame took out the sacred volume without feeling either heat or inconvenience of any kind astonished and almost terrified at his own success he beheld the flame collect itself and shoot up into one long and final stream which seemed as if it would ascend to the very roof of the cavern and then sinking as suddenly became totally extinguished the deepest darkness ensued but halbert had no time to consider his situation for the white lady had already caught his hand and they ascended to upper air with the same velocity with which they had sunk into the earth  they stood by the fountain in the corrinanshian when they emerged from the bowels of the earth but on casting a bewildered glance around him the youth was surprised to observe that the shadows had fallen far to the east and that the day was wellnigh spent he gazed on his conductress for explanation but her figure began to fade before his eyesher cheeks grew paler her features less distinct her form became shadowy and blended itself with the mist which was ascending the hollow ravine  what had late the symmetry of form and the delicate yet clear hues of feminine beauty now resembled the flitting and pale ghost of some maiden who has died for love as it is seen indistinctly and by moonlight by her perjured lover  stay spirit said the youth imboldened by his success in the subterranean dome thy kindness must not leave me as one encumbered with a weapon he knows not how to wield thou must teach me the art to read and to understand this volume else what avails it me that i possess it  but the figure of the white lady still waned before his eye until it became an outline as pale and indistinct as that of the moon when the winter morning is far advanced and ere she had ended the following chant she was entirely invisible    alas alas   not ours the grace   these holy characters to trace       idle forms of painted air       not to us is given to share   the boon bestowd on adams race       with patience bide       heaven will provide   the fitting time the fitting guide  the form was already gone and now the voice itself had melted away in melancholy cadence softening as if the being who spoke had been slowly wafted from the spot where she had commenced her melody  it was at this moment that halbert felt the extremity of the terror which he had hitherto so manfully suppressed the very necessity of exertion had given him spirit to make it and the presence of the mysterious being while it was a subject of fear in itself had nevertheless given him the sense of protection being near to him it was when he could reflect with composure on what had passed that a cold tremor shot across his limbs his hair bristled and he was afraid to look around lest he should find at his elbow something more frightful than the first vision a breeze arising suddenly realized the beautiful and wild idea of the most imaginative of our modern bards footnote coleridge    it fannd his cheek it raised his hair     like a meadow pale in spring   it mingled strangely with his fears     yet it fell like a welcoming  the youth stood silent and astonished for a few minutes it seemed to him that the extraordinary being he had seen half his terror half his protectress was still hovering on the gale which swept past him and that she might again make herself sensible to his organs of sight speak he said wildly tossing his arms speak yet againbe once more present lovely visionthrice have i now seen thee yet the idea of thy invisible presence around or beside me makes my heart beat faster than if the earth yawned and gave up a demon  but neither sound nor appearance indicated the presence of the white lady and nothing preternatural beyond what he had already witnessed was again audible or visible halbert in the meanwhile by the very exertion of again inviting the presence of this mysterious being had recovered his natural audacity he looked around once more and resumed his solitary path down the valley into whose recesses he had penetrated  nothing could be more strongly contrasted than the storm of passion with which he had bounded over stock and crag in order to plunge himself into the corrinanshian and the sobered mood in which he now returned homeward industriously seeking out the most practicable path not from a wish to avoid danger but that he might not by personal toil distract his attention deeply fixed on the extraordinary scene which he had witnessed in the former case he had sought by hazard and bodily exertion to indulge at once the fiery excitation of passion and to banish the cause of the excitement from his recollection while now he studiously avoided all interruption to his contemplative walk lest the difficulty of the way should interfere with or disturb his own deep reflections thus slowly pacing forth his course with the air of a pilgrim rather than of a deerhunter halbert about the close of the evening regained his paternal tower     chapter the thirteenth     the miller was of manly make     to meet him was na mows   there durst na ten come him to take     sae noited he their pows             christs kirk on the green  it was after sunset as we have already stated when halbert glendinning returned to the abode of his father the hour of dinner was at noon and that of supper about an hour after sunset at this period of the year  the former had passed without halberts appearing but this was no uncommon circumstance for the chase or any other pastime which occurred made halbert a frequent neglecter of hours and his mother though angry and disappointed when she saw him not at table was so much accustomed to his occasional absence and knew so little how to teach him more regularity that a testy observation was almost all the censure with which such omissions were visited  on the present occasion however the wrath of good dame elspeth soared higher than usual it was not merely on account of the special tups head and trotters the haggis and the side of mutton with which her table was set forth but also because of the arrival of no less a person than hob miller as he was universally termed though the mans name was happer  the object of the millers visit to the tower of glendearg was like the purpose of those embassies which potentates send to each others courts partly ostensible partly politic in outward show hob came to visit his friends of the halidome and share the festivity common among country folk after the barnyard has been filled and to renew old intimacies by new conviviality but in very truth he also came to have an eye upon the contents of each stack and to obtain such information respecting the extent of the crop reaped and gathered in by each feuar as might prevent the possibility of abstracted multures  all the world knows that the cultivators of each barony or regality temporal or spiritual in scotland are obliged to bring their corn to be grinded at the mill of the territory for which they pay a heavy charge called the intown multures i could speak to the thirlage of invecta et illata too but let that pass i have said enough to intimate that i talk not without book  those of the sucken or enthralled ground were liable in penalties if deviating from this thirlage or thraldom they carried their grain to another mill now such another mill erected on the lands of a laybaron lay within a tempting and convenient distance of glendearg and the miller was so obliging and his charges so moderate that it required hob millers utmost vigilance to prevent evasions of his right of monopoly  the most effectual means he could devise was this show of good fellowship and neighbourly friendshipunder colour of which he made his annual cruise through the baronynumbered every cornstack and computed its contents by the boll so that he could give a shrewd hint afterwards whether or not the grist came to the right mill  dame elspeth like her compeers was obliged to take these domiciliary visits in the sense of politeness but in her case they had not occurred since her husbands death probably because the tower of glendearg was distant and there was but a trifling quantity of arable or infield land attached to it this year there had been upon some speculation of old martins several bolls sown in the exitfield which the season being fine had ripened remarkably well perhaps this circumstance occasioned the honest millers including glendearg on this occasion in his annual round dame glendinning received with pleasure a visit which she used formerly only to endure with patience and she had changed her view of the matter chiefly if not entirely because hob had brought with him his daughter mysie of whose features she could give so slight an account but whose dress she had described so accurately to the subprior  hitherto this girl had been an object of very trifling consideration in the eyes of the good widow but the subpriors particular and somewhat mysterious inquiries had set her brains to work on the subject of mysie of the mill and she had here asked a broad question and there she had thrown out an innuendo and there again she had gradually led on to a conversation on the subject of poor mysie and from all inquiries and investigations she had collected that mysie was a darkeyed laughterloving wench with cherrycheeks and a skin as white as her fathers finest bolted flour out of which was made the abbots own wastelbread for her temper she sung and laughed from morning to night and for her fortune a material article besides that which the miller might have amassed by means of his proverbial golden thumb mysie was to inherit a good handsome lump of land with a prospect of the mill and millacres descending to her husband on an easy lease if a fair word were spoken in season to the abbot and to the prior and to the subprior and to the sacristan and so forth  by turning and again turning these advantages over in her own mind elspeth at length came to be of opinion that the only way to save her son halbert from a life of spur spear and snaffle as they called that of the borderriders from the dint of a clothyard shaft or the loop of an inchcord was that he should marry and settle and that mysie happer should be his destined bride  as if to her wish hob miller arrived on his strongbuilt mare bearing on a pillion behind him the lovely mysie with cheeks like a peonyrose if dame glendinning had ever seen one spirits all afloat with rustic coquetry and a profusion of hair as black as ebony the beauideal which dame glendinning had been bodying forth in her imagination became unexpectedly realized in the buxom form of mysie happer whom in the course of half an hour she settled upon as the maiden who was to fix the restless and untutored halbert true mysie as the dame soon saw was like to love dancing round a maypole as well as managing a domestic establishment and halbert was like to break more heads than he would grind stacks of corn but then a miller should always be of manly make and has been described so since the days of chaucer and james i footnote the verse we have chosen for a motto is from a poem imputed to james i of scotland as for the miller who figures among the canterbury pilgrims besides his sword and buckler he boasted other attributes all of which but especially the last show that he relied more on the strength of the outside than that of the inside of his skull    the miller was a stout carl for the nones   full big he was of brawn and eke of bones   that proved well for wheresoer he cam   at wrestling he wold bear away the ram   he was short shoulderd broad a thick gnar   there nas no door that he nold heave of bar   or break it at a running with his head c   indeed to be able to outdo and bully the whole sucken once more we use this barbarous phrase in all athletic exercises was one way to render easy the collection of dues which men would have disputed with a less formidable champion  then as to the deficiencies of the millers wife the dame was of opinion that they might be supplied by the activity of the millers mother i will keep house for the young folk myself for the tower is grown very lonely thought dame glendinning and to live near the kirk will be mair comfortable in my auld ageand then edward may agree with his brother about the feu more especially as he is a favourite with the subprior and then he may live in the auld tower like his worthy father before himand wha kens but mary avenel highblood as she is may een draw in her stool to the chimneynook and sit down here for good and aits true she has no tocher but the like of her for beauty and sense neer crossed my een and i have kend every wench in the halidome of st  marysay and their mothers that bore themay she is a sweet and a lovely creature as ever tied snood over brown hairay and then though her uncle keeps her out of her ain for the present time yet it is to be thought the graygoose shaft will find a hole in his coat of proof as god help us it has done in many a better mansand moreover if they should stand on their pedigree and gentle race edward might say to them that is to her gentle kith and kin whilk o ye was her best friend when she came down the glen to glendearg in a misty evening on a beast mair like a cuddie than aught elseand if they tax him with churls blood edward might say that forby the old proverb how    gentle deed   makes gentle bleid  yet moreover there comes no churls blood from glendinning or brydone for says edward  the hoarse voice of the miller at this moment recalled the dame from her reverie and compelled her to remember that if she meant to realize her airy castle she must begin by laying the foundation in civility to her guest and his daughter whom she was at that moment most strangely neglecting though her whole plan turned on conciliating their favour and good opinion and that in fact while arranging matters for so intimate a union with her company she was suffering them to sit unnoticed and in their riding gear as if about to resume their journey and so i say dame concluded the miller for she had not marked the beginning of his speech an ye be so busied with your housekep or ought else why mysie and i will trot our way down the glen again to johnnie broxmouths who pressed us right kindly to bide with him  starting at once from her dream of marriages and intermarriages mills milllands and baronies dame elspeth felt for a moment like the milkmaid in the fable when she overset the pitcher on the contents of which so many golden dreams were founded but the foundation of dame glendinnings hopes was only tottering not overthrown and she hastened to restore its equilibrium instead of attempting to account for her absence of mind and want of attention to her guests which she might have found something difficult she assumed the offensive like an able general when he finds it necessary by a bold attack to disguise his weakness  a loud exclamation she made and a passionate complaint she set up against the unkindness of her old friend who could for an instant doubt the heartiness of her welcome to him and to his hopeful daughter and then to think of his going back to johnny broxmouths when the auld tower stood where it did and had room in it for a friend or two in the worst of timesand he too a neighbour that his umquhile gossip simon blessed be his cast used to think the best friend he had in the halidome and on she went urging her complaint with so much seriousness that she had wellnigh imposed on herself as well as upon hob miller who had no mind to take any thing in dudgeon and as it suited his plans to pass the night at glendearg would have been equally contented to do so even had his reception been less vehemently hospitable  to all elspeths expostulations on the unkindness of his proposal to leave her dwelling he answered composedly nay dame what could i tell ye might have had other grist to grind for ye looked as if ye scarce saw usor what know i ye might bear in mind the words martin and i had about the last barley ye sawedfor i ken dry multures footnote dry multures were a fine or compensation in money for not grinding at the mill of the thirl it was and is accounted a vexatious exaction will sometimes stick in the throat a man seeks but his awn and yet folk shall hold him for both miller and millers man that is millar and knave footnote the under miller is in the language of thirlage called the knave which indeed signified originally his lad knabegerman but by degrees came to be taken in a worse sense in the old translation of the bible paul is made to term himself the knave of our saviour the allowance of meal taken by the millers servant was called knaveship all the country over  alas that you will say so neighbour hob said dame elspeth or that martin should have had any words with you about the milldues i will chide him roundly for it i promise you on the faith of a true widow  you know full well that a lone woman is sore put upon by her servants  nay dame said the miller unbuckling the broad belt which made fast his cloak and served at the same time to suspend by his side a swinging andrea ferrara bear no grudge at martin for i bear nonei take it on me as a thing of mine office to maintain my right of multure lock and gowpen  note the multure was the regular exaction for grinding the meal the lock signifying a small quantity and the gowpen a handful were additional perquisites demanded by the miller and submitted to or resisted by the suckener as circumstances permitted these and other petty dues were called in general the sequels and reason good for as the old song says    i live by my mill god bless her    shes parent child and wife  the poor old slut i am beholden to her for my living and bound to stand by her as i say to my mill knaves in right and in wrong and so should every honest fellow stand by his breadwinnerand so mysie ye may doff your cloak since our neighbour is so kindly glad to see uswhy i think we are as blithe to see hernot one in the halidome pays their multures more duly sequels arriage and carriage and millservices used and wont  with that the miller hung his ample cloak without farther ceremony upon a huge pair of stags antlers which adorned at once the naked walls of the tower and served for what we vulgarly call cloakpins  in the meantime dame elspeth assisted to disembarrass the damsel whom she destined for her future daughterinlaw of her hood mantle and the rest of her riding gear giving her to appear as beseemed the buxom daughter of the wealthy miller gay and goodly in a white kirtle the seams of which were embroidered with green silken lace or fringe entwined with some silver thread an anxious glance did elspoth cast upon the goodhumoured face which was now more fully shown to her and was only obscured by a quantity of raven black hair which the maid of the mill had restrained by a snood of green silk embroidered with silver corresponding to the trimmings of her kirtle the countenance itself was exceedingly comelythe eyes black large and roguishly goodhumouredthe mouth was smallthe lips well formed though somewhat fullthe teeth were pearly whiteand the chin had a very seducing dimple in it the form belonging to this joyous face was full and round and firm and fair it might become coarse and masculine some years hence which is the common fault of scottish beauty but in mysies sixteenth year she had the shape of a hebe the anxious elspeth with all her maternal partiality could not help admitting within herself that a better man than halbert might go farther and fare worse  she looked a little giddy and halbert was not nineteen still it was time he should be settled for to that point the dame always returned and here was an excellent opportunity  the simple cunning of dame elspeth now exhausted itself in commendations of her fair guest from the snood as they say to the singlesoled shoe  mysie listened and blushed with pleasure for the first five minutes but ere ten had elapsed she began to view the old ladys compliments rather as subjects of mirth than of vanity and was much more disposed to laugh at than to be flattered with them for nature had mingled the goodhumour with which she had endowed the damsel with no small portion of shrewdness  even hob himself began to tire of hearing his daughters praises and broke in with ay ay she is a clever quean enough and were she five years older she shall lay a loaded sack on an aver note averproperly a horse of labour with eer a lass in the halidome but i have been looking for your two sons dame men say downby that halberts turned a wild springald and that we may have word of him from westmoreland one moonlight night or another  god forbid my good neighbour god in his mercy forbid said dame glendinning earnestly for it was touching the very keynote of her apprehensions to hint any probability that halbert might become one of the marauders so common in the age and country but fearful of having betrayed too much alarm on this subject she immediately added that though since the last rout at pinkiecleuch she had been all of a tremble when a gun or a spear was named or when men spoke of fighting yet thanks to god and our lady her sons were like to live and die honest and peaceful tenants to the abbey as their father might have done but for that awful hosting which he went forth to with mony a brave man that never returned  ye need not tell me of it dame said the miller since i was there myself and made two pair of legs and these were not mine but my mares worth one pair of hands i judged how it would be when i saw our host break ranks with rushing on through that broken ploughed field and so as they had made a pricker of me i een pricked off with myself while the play was good  ay ay neighbour said the dame ye were aye a wise and a wary man if my simon had had your wit he might have been here to speak about it this day but he was aye cracking of his good blood and his high kindred and less would not serve him than to bide the bang to the last with the earls and knights and squires that had no wives to greet for them or else had wives that cared not how soon they were widows but that is not for the like of us but touching my son halbert there is no fear of him for if it should be his misfortune to be in the like case he has the best pair of heels in halidome and could run almost as fast as your mare herself  is this he neighbour quoth the miller  no replied the mother that is my youngest son edward who can read and write like the lord abbot himself if it were not a sin to say so  ay said the miller and is that the young clerk the subprior thinks so much of they say he will come far ben that lad wha kens but he may come to be subprior himselfas broken a ship has come to land  to be a prior neighbour miller said edward a man must first be a priest and for that i judge i have little vocation  he will take to the pleughpettle neighbour said the good dame and so will halbert too i trust i wish you saw halbertedward where is your brother  hunting i think replied edward at least he left us this morning to join the laird of colmslie and his hounds i have heard them baying in the glen all day  and if i had heard that music said the miller it would have done my heart good ay and may be taken me two or three miles out of my road  when i was the miller of morebattles knave i have followed the hounds from eckford to the foot of hounamlawfollowed them on foot dame glendinning ay and led the chase when the laird of cessford and his gay riders were all thrown out by the mosses and gills i brought the stag on my back to hounam cross when the dogs had pulled him down i think i see the old gray knight as he sate so upright on his strong warhorse all white with foam and miller said he to me an thou wilt turn thy back on the mill and wend with me i will make a man of thee but i chose rather to abide by clap and happer and the better luck was mine for the proud percy caused hang five of the lairds henchmen at alnwick for burning a rickle of houses some gate beyond fowberry and it might have been my luck as well as another mans  ah neighbour neighbour said dame glendinning you were aye wise and wary but if you like hunting i must say halberts the lad to please you he hath all those fair holiday terms of hawk and hound as ready in his mouth as tom with the tods tail that is the lord abbots ranger  ranges he not homeward at dinnertime dame demanded the miller for we call noon the dinnerhour at kennaquhair  the widow was forced to admit that even at this important period of the day halbert was frequently absent at which the miller shook his head intimating at the same time some allusion to the proverb of macfarlanes geese which liked their play better than their meat footnote a brood of wildgeese which long frequented one of the uppermost islands in lochlomond called inchtavoe were supposed to have some mysterious connexion with the ancient family of macfarlane of that ilk and it is said were never seen after the ruin and extinction of that house the macfarlanes had a house and garden upon that same island of inchtavoe here james vi was on one occasion regaled by the chieftain his majesty had been previously much amused by the geese pursuing each other on the loch but when one which was brought to table was found to be tough and ill fed james observedthat macfarlanes geese liked their play better than their meat a proverb which has been current ever since  that the delay of dinner might not increase the millers disposition to prejudge halbert dame glendinning called hastily on mary avenel to take her task of entertaining mysie happer while she herself rushed to the kitchen and entering at once into the province of tibb tacket rummaged among trenchers and dishes snatched pots from the fire and placed pans and gridirons on it accompanying her own feats of personal activity with such a continued list of injunctions to tibb that tibb at length lost patience and said here was as muckle wark about meating an auld miller as if they had been to banquet the blood of bruce but this as it was supposed to be spoken aside dame glendinning did not think it convenient to hear                                         chapter the fourteenth     nay let me have the friends who eat my victuals   as various as my dishesthe feasts naught   where one huge plate predominates john plaintext   he shall be mighty beef our english staple   the worthy alderman a butterd dumpling   yon pair of whiskerd cornets ruffs and rees   their friend the dandy a green goose in sippets   and so the hoard is spread at once and filld   on the same principlevariety                            new play  and what brave lass is this said hob miller as mary avenel entered the apartment to supply the absence of dame elspeth glendinning  the young lady of avenel father said the maid of the mill dropping as low a curtsy as her rustic manners enabled her to make the miller her father doffed his bonnet and made his reverence not altogether so low perhaps as if the young lady had appeared in the pride of rank and riches yet so as to give high birth the due homage which the scotch for a length of time scrupulously rendered to it  indeed from having had her mothers example before her for so many years and from a native sense of propriety and even of dignity mary avenel had acquired a demeanour which marked her title to consideration and effectually checked any attempt at familiarity on the part of those who might be her associates in her present situation but could not be well termed her equals she was by nature mild pensive and contemplative gentle in disposition and most placable when accidentally offended but still she was of a retired and reserved habit and shunned to mix in ordinary sports evenwhen the rare occurrence of a fair or wake gave her an opportunity of mingling with companions of her own age if at such scenes she was seen for an instant she appeared to behold them with the composed indifference of one to whom their gaiety was a matter of no interest and who seemed only desirous to glide away from the scene as soon as she possibly could  something also had transpired concerning her being born on allhallow eve and the powers with which that circumstance was supposed to invest her over the invisible world and from allthese particulars combined the young men and women of the halidome used to distinguish mary among themselves by the name of the spirit of avenel as if the fair but fragile form the beautiful but rather colourless cheek the dark blue eye and the shady hair had belonged rather to the immaterial than the substantial world the general tradition of the white lady who was supposed to wait on the fortunes of the family of avenel gave a sort of zest to this piece of rural wit it gave great offence however to the two sons of simon glendinning and when the expression was in their presence applied to the young lady edward was wont to check the petulance of those who used it by strength of argument and halbert by strength of arm in such cases halbert had this advantage that although ho could render no aid to his brothers argument yet when circumstances required it he was sure to have that of edward who never indeed himself commenced a fray but on the other hand did not testify any reluctance to enter into combat in halberts behalf or in his rescue  but the zealous attachment of the two youths being themselves from the retired situation in which they dwelt comparative strangers in the halidome did not serve in any degree to alter the feelings of the inhabitants towards the young lady who seemed to have dropped amongst them from another sphere of life still however she was regarded with respect if not with fondness and the attention of the subprior to the family not to mention the formidable name of julian avenel which every new incident of those tumultuous times tended to render more famous attached to his niece a certain importance thus some aspired to her acquaintance out of pride while the more timid of the feuars were anxious to inculcate upon their children the necessity of being respectful to the noble orphan so that mary avenel little loved because little known was regarded with a mysterious awe partly derived from fear of her uncles mosstroopers and partly from her own retired and distant habits enhanced by the superstitious opinions of the time and country  it was not without some portion of this awe that mysie felt herself left alone in company with a young person so distant in rank and so different in bearing from herself for her worthy father had taken the first opportunity to step out unobserved in order to mark how the barnyard was filled and what prospect it afforded of grist to the mill in youth however there is a sort of freemasonry which without much conversation teaches young persons to estimate each others character and places them at ease on the shortest acquaintance it is only when taught deceit by the commerce of the world that we learn to shroud our character from observation and to disguise our real sentiments from those with whom we are placed in communion  accordingly the two young women were soon engaged in such objects of interest as best became their age they visited mary avenels pigeons which she nursed with the tenderness of a mother they turned over her slender stores of finery which yet contained some articles that excited the respect of her companion though mysie was too goodhumoured to nourish envy a golden rosary and some female ornaments marking superior rank had been rescued in the moment of their utmost adversity more by tibb tackets presence of mind than by the care of their ownerwho was at that sad period too much sunk in grief to pay any attention to such circumstances  they struck mysie with a deep impression of veneration for excepting what the lord abbot and the convent might possess she did not believe there was so much real gold in the world as was exhibited in these few trinkets and mary however sage and serious was not above being pleased with the admiration of her rustic companion  nothing indeed could exhibit a stronger contrast than the appearance of the two girlsthe goodhumoured laughterloving countenance of the maid of the mill who stood gazing with unrepressed astonishment on whatever was in her inexperienced eye rare and costly and with an humble and at the same time cheerful acquiescence in her inferiority asking all the little queries about the use and value of the ornaments while mary avenel with her quiet composed dignity and placidity of manner produced them one after another for the amusement of her companion  as they became gradually more familiar mysie of the mill was just venturing to ask why mary avenel never appeared at the maypole and to express her wonder when the young lady said she disliked dancing when a trampling of horses at the gate of the tower interrupted their conversation  mysie flew to the shotwindow in the full ardour of unrestrained female curiosity saint mary sweet lady here come two wellmounted gallants will you step this way to look at them   no said mary avenel you shall tell me who they are  well if you like it better said mysiebut how shall i know themstay i do know one of them and so do you lady he is a blithe man somewhat light of hand they say but the gallants of these days think no great harm of that he is your uncles henchman that they call christie of the clinthill and he has not his old green jerkin and the rusty blackjack over it but a scarlet cloak laid down with silver lace three inches broad and a breastplate you might see to dress your hair in as well as in that keekingglass in the ivory frame that you showed me even now come dear lady come to the shotwindow and see him  if it be the man you mean mysie replied the orphan of avenel i shall see him soon enough considering either the pleasure or comfort the sight will give me  nay but if you will not come to see gay christie replied the maid of the mill her face flushed with eager curiosity come and tell me who the gallant is that is with him the handsomest the very lovesomest young man i ever saw with sight  it is my fosterbrother halbert glendinning said mary with apparent indifference for she had been accustomed to call the sons of elspeth her fosterbrethren and to live with them as if they had been brothers in earnest  nay by our lady that it is not said mysie i know the favour of both the glendinnings well and i think this rider be not of our country  he has a crimson velvet bonnet and long brown hair falling down under it and a beard on his upper lip and his chin clean and close shaved save a small patch on the point of the chin and a skyblue jerkin slashed and lined with white satin and trunkhose to suit and no weapon but a rapier and daggerwell if i was a man i would never wear weapon but the rapier  it is so slender and becoming instead of having a cartload of iron at my back like my fathers broadsword with its great rusty baskethilt do you not delight in the rapier and poniard lady  the best sword answered mary if i must needs answer a question of the sort is that which is drawn in the best cause and which is best used when it is out of the scabbard  but can you not guess who this stranger should be said mysie  indeed i cannot even attempt it but to judge by his companion it is no matter how little he is known replied mary  my benison on his bonny face said mysie if he is not going to alight here now i am as much pleased as if my father had given me the silver earrings he has promised me so oftennay you had as well come to the window for you must see him by and by whether you will or not i do not know how much sooner mary avenel might have sought the point of observation if she had not been scared from it by the unrestrained curiosity expressed by her buxom friend but at length the same feeling prevailed over her sense of dignity and satisfied with having displayed all the indifference that was necessary in point of decorum she no longer thought herself bound to restrain her curiosity  from the outshot or projecting window she could perceive that christie of the clinthill was attended on the present occasion by a very gay and gallant cavalier who from the nobleness of his countenance and manner his rich and handsome dress and the showy appearance of his horse and furniture must she agreed with her new friend be a person of some consequence  christie also seemed conscious of something which made him call out with more than his usual insolence of manner what ho so ho the house churl peasants will no one answer when i callho martintibbdame glendinninga murrain on you must we stand keeping our horses in the cold here and they steaming with heat when we have ridden so sharply  at length he was obeyed and old martin made his appearance ha said christie art thou there old truepenny here stable me these steeds and see them well bedded and stretch thine old limbs by rubbing them down and see thou quit not the stable till there is not a turned hair on either of them  martin took the horses to the stable as commanded but suppressed not his indignation a moment after he could vent it with safety would not any one think he said to jasper an old ploughman who in coming to his assistance had heard christies imperious injunctions that this loon this christie of the clinthill was laird or lord at least of him no such thing man i remember him a little dirty turnspit boy in the house of avenel that every body in a frosty morning like this warmed his fingers by kicking or cuffing and now he is a gentleman and swears dn him and renounce him as if the gentlemen could not so much as keep their own wickedness to themselves without the like of him going to hell in their very company and by the same road i have as much a mind as ever i had to my dinner to go back and tell him to sort his horse himself since he is as able as i am  hout tout man answered jasper keep a calm sough better to fleech a fool than fight with him  martin acknowledged the truth of the proverb and much comforted therewith betook himself to cleaning the strangers horse with great assiduity remarking it was a pleasure to handle a handsome nag and turned over the other to the charge of jasper nor was it until christies commands were literally complied with that he deemed it proper after fitting ablutions to join the party in the spence not for the purpose of waiting upon them as a mere modern reader might possibly expect but that he might have his share of dinner in their company  in the meanwhile christie had presented his companion to dame glendinning as sir piercie shafton a friend of his and of his master come to spend three or four days with little din in the tower the good dame could not conceive how she was entitled to such an honour and would fain have pleaded her want of every sort of convenience to entertain a guest of that quality but indeed the visiter when he cast his eyes round the bare walls eyed the huge black chimney scrutinized the meagre and broken furniture of the apartment and beheld the embarrassment of the mistress of the family intimated great reluctance to intrude upon dame glendinning a visit which could scarce from all appearances prove otherwise than an inconvenience to her and a penance to himself  but the reluctant hostess and her guest had to do with an inexorable man who silenced all expostulations with such was his masters pleasure and moreover he continued though the baron of avenels will must and ought to prove law to all within ten miles around him yet here dame he said is a letter from your petticoated baron the lordpriest yonder who enjoins you as you regard his pleasure that you afford to this good knight such decent accommodation as is in your power suffering him to live as privately as he shall desireand for you sir piercie shafton continued christie you will judge for yourself whether secrecy and safety is not more your object even now than soft beds and high cheer and do not judge of the dames goods by the semblance of her cottage for you will see by the dinner she is about to spread for us that the vassal of the kirk is seldom found with her basket bare to mary avenel christie presented the stranger after the best fashion he could as to the niece of his master the baron  while he thus laboured to reconcile sir piercie shafton to his fate the widow having consulted her son edward on the real import of the lord abbots injunction and having found that christie had given a true exposition saw nothing else left for her but to make that fate as easy as she could to the stranger he himself also seemed reconciled to his lot by some feeling probably of strong necessity and accepted with a good grace the hospitality which the dame offered with a very indifferent one  in fact the dinner which soon smoked before the assembled guests was of that substantial kind which warrants plenty and comfort dame glendinning had cooked it after her best manner and delighted with the handsome appearance which her good cheer made when placed on the table forgot both her plans and the vexations which interrupted them in the hospitable duty of pressing her assembled visiters to eat and drink watching every trencher as it waxed empty and loading it with fresh supplies ere the guest could utter a negative  in the meanwhile the company attentively regarded each others motions and seemed endeavouring to form a judgment of each others character  sir piercie shafton condescended to speak to no one but to mary avenel and on her he conferred exactly the same familiar and compassionate though somewhat scornful sort of attention which a pretty fellow of these days will sometimes condescend to bestow on a country miss when there is no prettier or more fashionable woman present the manner indeed was different for the etiquette of those times did not permit sir piercie shafton to pick his teeth or to yawn or to gabble like the beggar whose tongue as he says was cut out by the turks or to affect deafness or blindness or any other infirmity of the organs but though the embroidery of his conversation was different the groundwork was the same and the highflown and ornate compliments with which the gallant knight of the sixteenth century interlarded his conversation were as much the offspring of egotism and selfconceit as the jargon of the coxcombs of our own days  the english knight was however something daunted at finding that mary avenel listened with an air of indifference and answered with wonderful brevity to all the fine things which ought as he conceived to have dazzled her with their brilliancy and puzzled her by their obscurity but if he was disappointed in making the desired or rather the expected impression upon her whom he addressed sir piercie shaftons discourse was marvellous in the ears of mysie the millers daughter and not the less so that she did not comprehend the meaning of a single word which he uttered indeed the gallant knights language was far too courtly to be understood by persons of much greater acuteness than mysies  it was about this period that the only rare poet of his time the witty comical facetiouslyquick and quicklyfacetious john lyllyhe that sate at apollos table and to whom phoebus gave a wreath of his own bays without snatching footnote such and yet more extravagant are the compliments paid to this author by his editor blount notwithstanding all exaggeration lylly was really a man of wit and imagination though both were deformed by the most unnatural affectation that ever disgraced a printed pagehe in short who wrote that singularly coxcomical work called euphues and his england was in the very zenith of his absurdity and his reputation the quaint forced and unnatural style which he introduced by his anatomy of wit had a fashion as rapid as it was momentaryall the court ladies were his scholars and to parler euphuisme was as necessary a qualification to a courtly gallant as those of understanding how to use his rapier or to dance a measure  it was no wonder that the maid of the mill was soon as effectually blinded by the intricacies of this erudite and courtly style of conversation as she had ever been by the dust of her fathers own mealsacks but there she sate with her mouth and eyes as open as the milldoor and the two windows showing teeth as white as her fathers bolted flour and endeavouring to secure a word or two for her own future use out of the pearls of rhetoric which sir piercie shafton scattered around him with such bounteous profusion  for the male part of the company edward felt ashamed of his own manner and slowness of speech when he observed the handsome young courtier with an ease and volubility of which he had no conception run over all the commonplace topics of highflown gallantry it is true the good sense and natural taste of young glendinning soon informed him that the gallant cavalier was speaking nonsense but alas where is the man of modest merit and real talent who has not suffered from being outshone in conversation and outstripped in the race of life by men of less reserve and of qualities more showy though less substantial and well constituted must the mind be that can yield up the prize without envy to competitors more worthy than himself  edward glendinning had no such philosophy while he despised the jargon of the gay cavalier he envied the facility with which he could run on as well as the courtly tone and expression and the perfect ease and elegance with which he offered all the little acts of politeness to which the duties of the table gave opportunity and if i am to speak truth i must own that he envied those qualities the more as they were all exercised in mary avenels service and although only so far accepted as they could not be refused intimated a wish on the strangers part to place himself in her good graces as the only person in the room to whom he thought it worth while to recommend himself his title rank and very handsome figure together with some sparks of wit and spirit which flashed across the cloud of nonsense which he uttered rendered him as the words of the old song say a lad for a ladys viewing so that poor edward with all his real worth and acquired knowledge in his homespun doublet blue cap and deerskin trowsers looked like a clown beside the courtier and feeling the full inferiority nourished no goodwill to him by whom he was eclipsed  christie on the other hand as soon as he had satisfied to the full a commodious appetite by means of which persons of his profession could like the wolf and eagle gorge themselves with as much food at one meal as might serve them for several days began also to feel himself more in the background than he liked to be this worthy had amongst his other good qualities an excellent opinion of himself and being of a bold and forward disposition had no mind to be thrown into the shade by any one with an impudent familiarity which such persons mistake for graceful ease he broke in upon the knights finest speeches with as little remorse as he would have driven the point of his lance through a laced doublet  sir piercie shafton a man of rank and high birth by no means encouraged or endured this familiarity and requited the intruder either with total neglect or such laconic replies as intimated a sovereign contempt for the rude spearman who affected to converse with him upon terms of equality  the miller held his peace for as his usual conversation turned chiefly on his clapper and tolldish he had no mind to brag of his wealth in presence of christie of the clinthill or to intrude his discourse on the english cavalier  a little specimen of the conversation may not be out of place were it but to show young ladies what fine things they have lost by living when euphuism is out of fashion  credit me fairest lady said the knight that such is the cunning of our english courtiers of the hodiernal strain that as they have infinitely refined upon the plain and rusticial discourse of our fathers which as i may say more beseemed the mouths of country roisterers in a maygame than that of courtly gallants in a galliard so i hold it ineffably and unutterably impossible that those who may succeed us in that garden of wit and courtesy shall alter or amend it venus delighted but in the language of mercury bucephalus will stoop to no one but alexander none can sound apollos pipe but orpheus  valiant sir said mary who could scarcely help laughing we have but to rejoice in the chance which hath honoured this solitude with a glimpse of the sun of courtesy though it rather blinds than enlightens us  pretty and quaint fairest lady answered the euphuist ah that i had with me my anatomy of witthat alltobeunparalleled volumethat quintessence of human witthat treasury of quaint inventionthat exquisitivelypleasanttoread and inevitablynecessarytoberemembered manual of all that is worthy to be knownwhich indoctrines the rude in civility the dull in intellectuality the heavy in jocosity the blunt in gentility the vulgar in nobility and all of them in that unutterable perfection of human utterance that eloquence which no other eloquence is sufficient to praise that art which when we call it by its own name of euphuism we bestow on it its richest panegyric  by saint mary said christie of the clinthill if your worship had told me that you had left such stores of wealth as you talk of at prudhoe castle long dickie and i would have had them off with us if man and horse could have carried them but you told us of no treasure i wot of save the silver tongs for turning up your mustachoes  the knight treated this intruders mistakefor certainly christie had no idea that all these epithets which sounded so rich and splendid were lavished upon a small quarto volumewith a stare and then turning again to mary avenel the only person whom he thought worthy to address he proceeded in his strain of highflown oratory even thus said he do hogs contemn the splendour of oriental pearls even thus are the delicacies of a choice repast in vain offered to the longeared grazer of the common who turneth from them to devour a thistle surely as idle is it to pour forth the treasures of oratory before the eyes of the ignorant and to spread the dainties of the intellectual banquet before those who are morally and metaphysically speaking no better than asses  sir knight since that is your quality said edward we cannot strive with you in loftiness of language but i pray you in fair courtesy while you honour my fathers house with your presence to spare us such vile comparisons  peace good villagio said the knight gracefully waving his hand i prithee peace kind rustic and you my guide whom i may scarce call honest let me prevail upon you to imitate the laudable taciturnity of that honest yeoman who sits as mute as a millpost and of that comely damsel who seems as with her ears she drank in what she did not altogether comprehend even as a palfrey listening to a lute whereof howsoever he knoweth not the gamut  marvellous fine words at length said dame glendinning who began to be tired of sitting so long silent marvellous fine words neighbour happer are they not  brave wordsvery brave wordsvery exceeding pyet words answered the miller nevertheless to speak my mind a lippy of bran were worth a bushel of them  i think so too under his worships favour answered christie of the clinthill i well remember that at the race of morham as we call it near berwick i took a young southern fellow out of saddle with my lance and cast him it might be a gads length from his nag and so as he had some gold on his laced doublet i deemed he might ha the like on it in his pocket too though that is a rule that does not aye hold goodso i was speaking to him of ransom and out he comes with a handful of such terms as his honour there hath gleaned up and craved me for mercy as i was a true son of mars and such like  and obtained no mercy at thy hand i dare be sworn said the knight who deigned not to speak euphuism excepting to the fair sex  by my troggs replied christie i would have thrust my lance down his throat but just then they flung open that accursed posterngate and forth pricked old hunsdon and henry carey and as many fellows at their heels as turned the chase northward again so i een pricked bayard with the spur and went off with the rest for a man should ride when he may not wrestle as they say in tynedale  trust me said the knight again turning to mary avenel if i do not pity you lady who being of noble blood are thus in a manner compelled to abide in the cottage of the ignorant like the precious stone in the head of the toad or like a precious garland on the brow of an assbut soft what gallant have we here whose garb savoureth more of the rustic than doth his demeanour and whose looks seem more lofty than his habit even as  i pray you sir knight said mary to spare your courtly similitudes for refined ears and give me leave to name unto you my fosterbrother halbert glendinning  the son of the good dame of the cottage as i opine answered the english knight for by some such name did my guide discriminate the mistress of this mansion which you madam enrich with your presenceand yet touching this juvenal he hath that about him which belongeth to higher birth for all are not black who dig coals  nor all white who are millers said honest happer glad to get in a word as they say edgeways  halbert who had sustained the glance of the englishman with some impatience and knew not what to make of his manner and language replied with some asperity sir knight we have in this land of scotland an ancient saying scorn not the bush that bields youyou are a guest of my fathers house to shelter you from danger if i am rightly informed by the domestics scoff not its homeliness nor that of its inmatesye might long have abidden at the court of england ere we had sought your favour or cumbered you with our society since your fate has sent you hither amongst us be contented with such fare and such converse as we can afford you and scorn us not for our kindness for the scots wear short patience and long daggers  all eyes were turned on halbert while he was thus speaking and there was a general feeling that his countenance had an expression of intelligence and his person an air of dignity which they had never before observed  whether it were that the wonderful being with whom he had so lately held communication had bestowed on him a grace and dignity of look and bearing which he had not before or whether the being conversant in high matters and called to a destiny beyond that of other men had a natural effect in giving becoming confidence to his language and manner we pretend not to determine but it was evident to all that from this day young halbert was an altered man that he acted with the steadiness promptitude and determination which belonged to riper years and bore himself with a manner which appertained to higher rank  the knight took the rebuke with good humour by my mine honour he said thou hast reason on thy side good juvenalnevertheless i spoke not as in ridicule of the roof which relieves me but rather in your own praise to whom if this roof be native thou mayst nevertheless rise from its lowliness even as the lark which maketh its humble nest in the furrow ascendeth towards the sun as well as the eagle which buildeth her eyry in the cliff  this highflown discourse was interrupted by dame glendinning who with all the busy anxiety of a mother was loading her sons trencher with food and dinning in his ear her reproaches on account of his prolonged absence and see she said that you do not one day get such a sight while you are walking about among the haunts of them that are not of our flesh and bone as befell mungo murray when he slept on the greensward ring of the auld kirkhill at sunset and wakened at daybreak in the wild hills of breadalbane and see that when you are looking for deer the red stag does not gall you as he did diccon thorburn who never overcast the wound that he took from a bucks horn and see when you go swaggering about with a long broadsword by your side whilk it becomes no peaceful man to do that you dinna meet with them that have broadsword and lance boththere are enow of rank riders in this land that neither fear god nor regard man  here her eye in a fine frenzy rolling fell full upon that of christie of the clinthill and at once her fears for having given offence interrupted the current of maternal rebuke which like rebuke matrimonial may be often better meant than timed there was something of sly and watchful significance in christies eye an eye gray keen fierce yet wily formed to express at once cunning and malice which made the dame instantly conjecture she had said too much while she saw in imagination her twelve goodly cows go lowing down the glen in a moonlight night with half a score of border spearsmen at their heels  her voice therefore sunk from the elevated tone of maternal authority into a whimpering apologetic sort of strain and she proceeded to say it is no that i have ony ill thoughts of the border riders for tibb tacket there has often heard me say that i thought spear and bridle as natural to a borderman as a pen to a priest or a featherfan to a lady andhave you not heard me say it tibb  tibb showed something less than her expected alacrity in attesting her mistresss deep respect for the freebooters of the southland hills but thus conjured did at length reply hout ay mistress ise warrant i have heard you say something like that  mother said halbert in a firm and commanding tone of voice what or whom is it that you fear under my fathers roofi well hope that it harbours not a guest in whose presence you are afraid to say your pleasure to me or my brother i am sorry i have been detained so late being ignorant of the fair company which i should encounter on my returni pray you let this excuse suffice and what satisfies you will i trust be nothing less than acceptable to your guests  an answer calculated so jistly betwixt the submission due to his parent and the natural feeling of dignity in one who was by birth master of the mansion excited universal satisfaction and as elspeth herself confessed to tibb on the same evening she did not think it had been in the callant  till that night he took pets and passions if he was spoke to and lap through the house like a fouryearauld at the least word of advice that was minted at him but now he spoke as grave and as douce as the lord abbot himself  she kendna she said what might be the upshot of it but it was like he was a wonderfu callant even now  the party then separated the young men retiring to their apartments the elder to their household cares while christie went to see his horse properly accommodated edward betook himself to his book and halbert who was as ingenious in employing his hands as he had hitherto appeared imperfect in mental exertion applied himself to constructing a place of concealment in the floor of his apartment by raising a plank beneath which he resolved to deposit that copy of the holy scriptures which had been so strangely regained from the possession of men and spirits  in the meanwhile sir piercie shafton sate still as a stone in the chair in which he had deposited himself his hands folded on his breast his legs stretched straight out before him and resting upon the heels his eyes cast up to the ceiling as if he had meant to count every mesh of every cobweb with which the arched roof was canopied wearing at the same time a face of as solemn and imperturbable gravity as if his existence had depended on the accuracy of his calculation  he could scarce be roused from his listless state of contemplative absorption so as to take some supper a meal at which the younger females appeared not sir piercie stared around twice or thrice as if he missed something but he asked not for them and only evinced his sense of a proper audience being wanting by his abstraction and absence of mind seldom speaking until he was twice addressed and then replying without trope or figure in that plain english which nobody could speak better when he had a mind  christie finding himself in undisturbed possession of the conversation indulged all who chose to listen with details of his own wild and inglorious warfare while dame elspeths curch bristled with horror and tibb tacket rejoiced to find herself once more in the company of a jackman listened to his tales like desdemona to othellos with undisguised delight meantime the two young glendinnings were each wrapped up in his own reflections and only interrupted in them by the signal to move bedward                                                chapter the fifteenth     he strikes no cointis true but coins new phrases   and vends them forth as knaves vend gilded counters   which wise men scorn and fools accept in payment                              old play  in the morning christie of the clinthill was nowhere to be seen as this worthy personage did seldom pique himself on sounding a trumpet before his movements no one was surprised at his moonlight departure though some alarm was excited lest he had not made it emptyhanded so in the language of the national ballad    some ran to cupboard and some to kist   but nought was away that could be mist  all was in order the key of the stable left above the door and that of the irongrate in the inside of the lock in short the retreat had been made with scrupulous attention to the security of the garrison and so far christie left them nothing to complain of  the safety of the premises was ascertained by halbert who instead of catching up a gun or crossbow and sallying out for the day as had been his frequent custom now with a gravity beyond his years took a survey of all around the tower and then returned to the spence or public apartment in which at the early hour of seven the morning meal was prepared  there he found the euphuist in the same elegant posture of abstruse calculation which he had exhibited on the preceding evening his arms folded in the same angle his eyes turned up to the same cobwebs and his heels resting on the ground as before tired of this affectation of indolent importance and not much flattered with his guests persevering in it to the last halbert resolved at once to break the ice being determined to know what circumstance had brought to the tower of glendinning a guest at once so supercilious and so silent  sir knight he said with some firmness i have twice given you good morning to which the absence of your mind hath i presume prevented you from yielding attention or from making return this exchange of courtesy is at your pleasure to give or withholdbut as what i have further to say concerns your comfort and your motions in an especial manner i will entreat you to give me some signs of attention that i may be sure i am not wasting my words on a monumental image  at this unexpected address sir piercie shafton opened his eyes and afforded the speaker a broad stare but as halbert returned the glance without either confusion or dismay the knight thought proper to change his posture draw in his legs raise his eyes fix them on young glendinning and assume the appearance of one who listens to what is said to him nay to make his purpose more evident he gave voice to his resolution in these words speak we do hear  sir knight said the youth it is the custom of this halidome or patrimony of st marys to trouble with inquiries no guests who receive our hospitality providing they tarry in our house only for a single revolution of the sun we know that both criminals and debtors come hither for sanctuary and we scorn to extort from the pilgrim whom chance may make our guest an avowal of the cause of his pilgrimage and penance but when one so high above our rank as yourself sir knight and especially one to whom the possession of such preeminence is not indifferent shows his determination to be our guest for a longer time it is our usage to inquire of him whence he comes and what is the cause of his journey  the english knight gaped twice or thrice before he answered and then replied in a bantering tone truly good villagio your question hath in it somewhat of embarrassment for you ask me of things concerning which i am not as yet altogether determined what answer i may find it convenient to make let it suffice thee kind juvenal that thou hast the lord abbots authority for treating me to the best of that power of thine which indeed may not always so well suffice for my accommodation as either of us would desire  i must have a more precise answer than this sir knight said the young glendinning  friend said the knight be not outrageous it may suit your northern manners thus to press harshly upon the secrets of thy betters but believe me that even as the lute struck by an unskilful hand doth produce discords so at this moment the door of the apartment opened and mary avenel presented herselfbut who can talk of discords said the knight assuming his complimentary vein and humour when the soul of harmony descends upon us in the presence of surpassing beauty for even as foxes wolves and other animals void of sense and reason do fly from the presence of the resplendent sun of heaven when he arises in his glory so do strife wrath and all ireful passions retreat and as it were scud away from the face which now beams upon us with power to compose our angry passions illuminate our errors and difficulties soothe our wounded minds and lull to rest our disorderly apprehensions for as the heat and warmth of the eye of day is to the material and physical world so is the eye which i now bow down before to that of the intellectual microcosm  he concluded with a profound bow and mary avenel gazing from one to the other and plainly seeing that something was amiss could only say for heavens sake what is the meaning of this  the newlyacquired tact and intelligence of her fosterbrother was as yet insufficient to enable him to give an answer he was quite uncertain how he ought to deal with a guest who preserving a singularly high tone of assumed superiority and importance seemed nevertheless so little serious in what he said that it was quite impossible to discern with accuracy whether he was in jest or earnest  forming however the internal resolution to bring sir piercie shafton to a reckoning at a more fit place and season he resolved to prosecute the matter no farther at present and the entrance of his mother with the damsel of the mill and the return of the honest miller from the stackyard where he had been numbering and calculating the probable amount of the seasons grist rendered farther discussion impossible for the moment  in the course of the calculation it could not but strike the man of meal and grindstones that after the churchs dues were paid and after all which he himself could by any means deduct from the crop still the residue which must revert to dame glendinning could not be less than considerable i wot not if this led the honest miller to nourish any plans similar to those adopted by elspeth but it is certain that he accepted with grateful alacrity an invitation which the dame gave to his daughter to remain a week or two as her guest at glendearg  the principal persons being thus in high good humour with each other all business gave place to the hilarity of the morning repast and so much did sir piercie appear gratified by the attention which was paid to every word that he uttered by the nutbrown mysie that notwithstanding his high birth and distinguished quality he bestowed on her some of the more ordinary and secondrate tropes of his elocution  mary avenel when relieved from the awkwardness of feeling the full weight of his conversation addressed to herself enjoyed it much more and the good knight encouraged by those conciliating marks of approbation from the sex for whose sake he cultivated his oratorical talents made speedy intimation of his purpose to be more communicative than he had shown himself in his conversation with halbert glendinning and gave them to understand that it was in consequence of some pressing danger that he was at present their involuntary guest  the conclusion of the breakfast was a signal for the separation of the company the miller went to prepare for his departure his daughter to arrange matters for her unexpected stay edward was summoned to consultation by martin concerning some agricultural matter in which halbert could not be brought to interest himself the dame left the room upon her household concerns and mary was in the act of following her when she suddenly recollected that if she did so the strange knight and halbert must be left alone together at the risk of another quarrel  the maiden no sooner observed this circumstance than she instantly returned from the door of the apartment and seating herself in a small stone windowseat resolved to maintain that curb which she was sensible her presence imposed on halbert glendinning of whose quick temper she had some apprehensions  the stranger marked her motions and either interpreting them as inviting his society or obedient to those laws of gallantry which permitted him not to leave a lady in silence and solitude he instantly placed himself near to her side and opened the conversation as follows  credit me fair lady he said addressing mary avenel it much rejoiceth me being as i am a banished man from the delights of mine own country that i shall find here in this obscure and silvan cottage of the north a fair form and a candid soul with whom i may explain my mutual sentiments and let me pray you in particular lovely lady that according to the universal custom now predominant in our court the garden of superior wits you will exchange with me some epithet whereby you may mark my devotion to your service be henceforward named for example my protection and let me be your affability  our northern and country manners sir knight do not permit us to exchange epithets with those to whom we are strangers replied mary avenel  nay but see now said the knight how you are startled even as the unbroken steed which swerves aside from the shaking of a handkerchief though he must in time encounter the waving of a pennon this courtly exchange of epithets of honour is no more than the compliments which pass between valour and beauty wherever they meet and under whatever circumstances elizabeth of england herself calls philip sydney her courage and he in return calls that princess his inspiration wherefore my fair protection for by such epithet it shall be mine to denominate you  not without the young ladys consent sir interrupted halbert most truly do i hope your courtly and quaint breeding will not so far prevail over the more ordinary rules of civil behaviour  fair tenant of an indifferent copyhold replied the knight with the same coolness and civility of mien but in a tone somewhat more lofty than he used to the young lady we do not in the southern parts much intermingle discourse save with those with whom we may stand on some footing of equality and i must in all discretion remind you that the necessity which makes us inhabitants of the same cabin doth not place us otherwise on a level with each other  by saint mary replied young glendinning it is my thought that it does for plain men hold that he who asks the shelter is indebted to him who gives it and so far therefore is our rank equalized while this roof covers us both  thou art altogether deceived answered sir piercie and that thou mayst fully adapt thyself to our relative condition know that i account not myself thy guest but that of thy master the lord abbot of saint marys who for reasons best known to himself and me chooseth to administer his hospitality to me through the means of thee his servant and vassal who art therefore in good truth as passive an instrument of my accommodation as this illmade and rugged jointstool on which i sit or as the wooden trencher from which i eat my coarse commons wherefore he added turning to mary fairest mistress or rather as i said before most lovely protection footnote there are many instances to be met with in the ancient dramas of this whimsical and conceited custom of persons who formed an intimacy distinguishing each other by some quaint epithet in every man out of his humour there is a humorous debate upon names most fit to bind the relation betwixt sogliardo and cavaliero shift which ends by adopting those of countenance and resolution what is more to the point is in the speech of hedon a voluptuary and a courtier in cynthias revels you know that i call madam plilantia my honour and she calls me her ambition now when i meet her in the presence anon i will come to her and say sweet honour i have hitherto contented my sense with the lilies of your hand and now i will taste the roses of your lip to which she cannot but blushing answer nay now you are too ambitious and then do i reply i cannot be too ambitious of honour sweet lady wilt not be goodi think there is some remnant of this foppery preserved in masonic lodges where each brother is distinguished by a name in the lodge signifying some abstract quality as discretion or the like see the poems of gavin wilson  mary avenel was about to reply to him when the stern fierce and resentful expression of voice and countenance with which halbert exclaimed not from the king of scotland did he live would i brook such terms induced her to throw herself between him and the stranger exclaiming for gods sake halbert beware what you do  fear not fairest protection replied sir piercie with the utmost serenity that i can be provoked by this rustical and mistaught juvenal to do aught misbecoming your presence or mine own dignity for as soon shall the gunners linstock give fire unto the icicle as the spark of passion inflame my blood tempered as it is to serenity by the respect due to the presence of my gracious protection  you may well call her your protection sir knight said halbert by saint andrew it is the only sensible word i have heard you speak but we may meet where her protection shall no longer afford you shelter  fairest protection continued the courtier not even honouring with a look far less with a direct reply the threat of the incensed halbert doubt not that thy faithful affability will be more commoved by the speech of this rudesby than the bright and serene moon is perturbed by the baying of the cottagecur proud of the height of his own dunghill which in his conceit lifteth him nearer unto the majestic luminary  to what lengths so unsavoury a simile might have driven halberts indignation is left uncertain for at that moment edward rushed into the apartment with the intelligence that two most important officers of the convent the kitchener and refectioner were just arrived with a sumptermule loaded with provisions announcing that the lord abbot the subprior and the sacristan were on their way thither a circumstance so very extraordinary had never been recorded in the annals of saint marys or in the traditions of glendearg though there was a faint legendary report that a certain abbot had dined there in old days after having been bewildered in a hunting expedition amongst the wilds which lie to the northward but that the present lord abbot should have taken a voluntary journey to so wild and dreary a spot the very kamtschatka of the halidome was a thing never dreamt of and the news excited the greatest surprise in all the members of the family saving halbert alone  this fiery youth was too full of the insult he had received to think of anything as unconnected with it i am glad of it he exclaimed i am glad the abbot comes hither i will know of him by what right this stranger is sent hither to domineer over us under our fathers roof as if we were slaves and not freemen i will tell the proud priest to his beard  alas alas my brother said edward think what these words may cost thee  and what will or what can they cost me said halbert that i should sacrifice my human feelings and my justifiable resentment to the fear of what the abbot can do  our motherour mother exclaimed edward think if she is deprived of her home expelled from her property how can you amend what your rashness may ruin  it is too true by heaven said halbert striking his forehead then stamping his foot against the floor to express the full energy of the passion to which he dared no longer give vent he turned round and left the apartment  mary avenel looked at the stranger knight while she was endeavouring to frame a request that he would not report the intemperate violence of her fosterbrother to the prejudice of his family in the mind of the abbot but sir piercie the very pink of courtesy conjectured her meaning from her embarrassment and waited not to be entreated  credit me fairest protection said he your affability is less than capable of seeing or hearing far less of reciting or reiterating aught of an unseemly nature which may have chanced while i enjoyed the elysium of your presence the winds of idle passion may indeed rudely agitate the bosom of the rude but the heart of the courtier is polished to resist them  as the frozen lake receives not the influence of the breeze even so  the voice of dame glendinning in shrill summons here demanded mary avenels attendance who instantly obeyed not a little glad to escape from the compliments and similes of this courtlike gallant nor was it apparently less a relief on his part for no sooner was she past the threshold of the room than he exchanged the look of formal and elaborate politeness which had accompanied each word he had uttered hitherto for an expression of the utmost lassitude and ennui and after indulging in one or two portentous yawns broke forth into a soliloquy  what the foul fiend sent this wench hither as if it were not sufficient plague to be harboured in a hovel that would hardly serve for a dogs kennel in england baited by a rude peasantboy and dependent on the faith of a mercenary ruffian but i cannot even have time to muse over my own mishap but must come aloft frisk fidget and make speeches to please this pale hectic phantom because she has gentle blood in her veins by mine honour setting prejudice aside the millwench is the more attractive of the twobut patienza piercie shafton thou must not lose thy wellearned claim to be accounted a devout servant of the fair sex a wittybrained prompt and accomplished courtier rather thank heaven piercie shafton which hath sent thee a subject wherein without derogating from thy rank since the honours of the avenel family are beyond dispute thou mayest find a whetstone for thy witty compliments a strop whereon to sharpen thine acute engine a butt whereat to shoot the arrows of thy gallantry  for even as a bilboa blade the more it is rubbed the brighter and the sharper will it prove sobut what need i waste my stock of similitudes in holding converse with myselfyonder comes the monkish retinue like some half score of crows winging their way slowly up the valleyi hope agad they have not forgotten my trunkmails of apparel amid the ample provision they have made for their own bellytimbermercy agad i were finely helped up if the vesture has miscarried among the thievish borderers  stung by this reflection he ran hastily down stairs and caused his horse to be saddled that he might as soon as possible ascertain this important point by meeting the lord abbot and his retinue as they came up the glen  he had not ridden a mile before he met them advancing with the slowness and decorum which became persons of their dignity and profession the knight failed not to greet the lord abbot with all the formal compliments with which men of rank at that period exchanged courtesies he had the good fortune to find that his mails were numbered among the train of baggage which attended upon the party and satisfied in that particular he turned his horses head and accompanied the abbot to the tower of glendearg  great in the meanwhile had been the turmoil of the good dame elspeth and her coadjutors to prepare for the fitting reception of the father lord abbot and his retinue the monks had indeed taken care not to trust too much to the state of her pantry but she was not the less anxious to make such additions as might enable her to claim the thanks of her feudal lord and spiritual father meeting halbert as with his blood on fire he returned from his altercation with her guest she commanded him instantly to go forth to the hill and not to return without venison reminding him that he was apt enough to go thither for his own pleasure and must now do so for the credit of the house  the miller who was now hastening his journey homewards promised to send up some salmon by his own servant dame elspeth who by this time thought she had guests enough had begun to repent of her invitation to poor mysie and was just considering by what means short of giving offence she could send off the maid of the mill behind her father and adjourn all her own aerial architecture till some future opportunity when this unexpected generosity on the part of the sire rendered any present attempt to return his daughter on his hands too highly ungracious to be farther thought on so the miller departed alone on his homeward journey  dame elspeths sense of hospitality proved in this instance its own reward for mysie had dwelt too near the convent to be altogether ignorant of the noble art of cookery which her father patronized to the extent of consuming on festival days such dainties as his daughter could prepare in emulation of the luxuries of the abbots kitchen laying aside therefore her holiday kirtle and adopting a dress more suitable to the occasion the goodhumored maiden bared her snowy arms above the elbows and as elspeth acknowledged in the language of the time and country took entire and aefauld part with her in the labours of the day showing unparalleled talent and indefatigable industry in the preparation of mortreux blancmanger and heaven knows what delicacies besides which dame glendinning unassisted by her skill dared not even have dreamt of presenting leaving this able substitute in the kitchen and regretting that mary avenel was so brought up that she could intrust nothing to her care unless it might be seeing the great chamber strewed with rushes and ornamented with such flowers and branches as the season afforded dame elspeth hastily donned her best attire and with a beating heart presented herself at the door of her little tower to make her obeisance to the lord abbot as he crossed her humble threshold edward stood by his mother and felt the same palpitation which his philosophy was at a loss to account for he was yet to learn how long it is ere our reason is enabled to triumph over the force of external circumstances and how much our feelings are affected by novelty and blunted by use and habit  on the present occasion he witnessed with wonder and awe the approach of some halfscore of riders sober men upon sober palfreys muffled in their long black garments and only relieved by their white scapularies showing more like a funeral procession than aught else and not quickening their pace beyond that which permitted easy conversation and easy digestion  the sobriety of the scene was indeed somewhat enlivened by the presence of sir piercie shafton who to show that his skill in the manege was not inferior to his other accomplishments kept alternately pressing and checking his gay courser forcing him to piaffe to caracole to passage and to do all the other feats of the school to the great annoyance of the lord abbot the wonted sobriety of whose palfrey became at length discomposed by the vivacity of its companion while the dignitary kept crying out in bodily alarm i do pray yousir knightgood now sir pierciebe quiet benedict there is a good steedsoh poor fellow and uttering all the other precatory and soothing exclamations by which a timid horseman usually bespeaks the favour of a frisky companion or of his own unquiet nag and concluding the beadroll with a sincere deo gratias so soon as he alighted in the courtyard of the tower of glendearg  the inhabitants unanimously knelt down to kiss the hand of the lord abbot a ceremony which even the monks were often condemned to good abbot boniface was too much fluttered by the incidents of the latter part of his journey to go through this ceremony with much solemnity or indeed with much patience he kept wiping his brow with a snowwhite handkerchief with one hand while another was abandoned to the homage of his vassals and then signing the cross with his outstretched arm and exclaiming bless yebless ye my children he hastened into the house and murmured not a little at the darkness and steepness of the rugged winding stair whereby he at length scaled the spence destined for his entertainment and overcome with fatigue threw himself i do not say into an easy chair but into the easiest the apartment afforded     chapter the sixteenth        a courtier extraordinary who by diet      of meats and drinks his temperate exercise      choice music frequent bath his horary shifts      of shirts and waistcoats means to immortalize      mortality itself and makes the essence      of his whole happiness the trim of court                                          magnetic lady   when the lord abbot had suddenly and superciliously vanished from the eyes of his expectant vassals the subprior made amends for the negligence of his principal by the kind and affectionate greeting which he gave to all the members of the family but especially to dame elspeth her fosterdaughter and her son edward where he even condescended to inquire is that naughty nimrod halberthe hath not yet i trust turned like his great prototype his huntingspear against man  o no an it please your reverence said dame glendinning halbert is up at the glen to get some venison or surely he would not have been absent when such a day of honour dawned upon me and mine  oh to get savoury meat such as our soul loveth muttered the subprior it has been at times an acceptable gifti bid you good morrow my good dame as i must attend upon his lordship the father abbot  and o reverend sir said the good widow detaining him if it might be your pleasure to take part with us if there is any thing wrong and if there is any thing wanted to say that it is just coming or to make some excuses your learning best knows how every bit of vassail and silver work have we been spoiled of since pinkie cleuch when i lost poor simon glendinning that was the warst of a  never mindnever fear said the subprior gently extricating his garment from the anxious grasp of dame elspeth the refectioner has with him the abbots plate and drinking cups and i pray you to believe that whatever is short in your entertainment will be deemed amply made up in your goodwill  so saying he escaped from her and went into the spence where such preparations as haste permitted were making for the noon collation of the abbot and the english knight here he found the lord abbot for whom a cushion composed of all the plaids in the house had been unable to render simons huge elbowchair a soft or comfortable place of rest  benedicite said abbot boniface now marry fie upon these hard benches with all my heartthey are as uneasy as the scabella of our novices saint jude be with us sir knight how have you contrived to pass over the night in this dungeon an your bed was no softer than your seat you might as well have slept on the stone couch of saint pacomius  after trotting a full ten miles a man needs a softer seat than has fallen to my hard lot  with sympathizing faces the sacristan and the refectioner ran to raise the lord abbot and to adjust his seat to his mind which was at length accomplished in some sort although he continued alternately to bewail his fatigue and to exult in the conscious sense of having discharged an arduous duty you errant cavaliers said he addressing the knight may now perceive that others have their travail and their toils to undergo as well as your honoured faculty and this i will say for myself and the soldiers of saint mary among whom i may be termed captain that it is not our wont to flinch from the heat of the service or to withdraw from the good fight  no by saint maryno sooner did i learn that you were here and dared not for certain reasons come to the monastery where with as good will and with more convenience we might have given you a better reception than striking the table with my hammer i called a brothertimothy said i let them saddle benedictlet them saddle my black palfrey and bid the subprior and some halfscore of attendants be in readiness tomorrow after matinswe would ride to glendeargbrother timothy stared thinking i imagine that his ears had scarce done him justicebut i repeated my commands and said let the kitchener and refectioner go before to aid the poor vassals to whom the place belongs in making a suitable collation so that you will consider good sir piercie our mutual in commodities and forgive whatever you may find amiss  by my faith said sir piercie shafton there is nothing to forgiveif you spiritual warriors have to submit to the grievous incommodities which your lordship narrates it would ill become me a sinful and secular man to complain of a bed as hard as a board of broth which relished as if made of burnt wool of flesh which in its sable and singed shape seemed to put me on a level with richard coeurdelionwhen he ate up the head of a moor carbonadoed and of other viands savouring rather of the rusticity of this northern region  by the good saints sir said the abbot somewhat touched in point of his character for hospitality of which he was in truth a most faithful and zealous professor it grieves me to the heart that you have found our vassals no better provided for your receptionyet i crave leave to observe that if sir piercie shaftons affairs had permitted him to honour with his company our poor house of saint marys he might have had less to complain of in respect of easements  to give your lordship the reasons said sir piercie shafton why i could not at this present time approach your dwelling or avail myself of its wellknown and undoubted hospitality craves either some delay or looking around him a limited audience  the lord abbot immediately issued his mandate to the refectioner hie thee to the kitchen brother hilarius and there make inquiry of our brother the kitchener within what time he opines that our collation may be prepared since sin and sorrow it were considering the hardships of this noble and gallant knight no whit mentioning orweighing those we ourselves have endured if we were now either to advance or retard the hour of refection beyond the time when the viands are fit to be set before us  brother hilarius parted with an eager alertness to execute the will of his superior and returned with the assurance that punctually at one afternoon would the collation be ready  before that time said the accurate refectioner the wafers flamms and pastrymeat will scarce have had the just degree of fire which learned pottingers prescribe as fittest for the body and if it should be past one oclock were it but ten minutes our brother the kitchener opines that the haunch of venison would suffer in spite of the skill of the little turnbroche whom he has recommended to your holiness by his praises  how said the abbot a haunch of venisonfrom whence comes that dainty i remember not thou didst intimate its presence in thy hamper of vivers  so please your holiness and lordship said the refectioner he is a son of the woman of the house who has shot it and sent it inkilled but now yet as the animal heat hath not left the body the kitchener undertakes it shall eat as tender as a young chickenand this youth hath a special gift in shooting deer and never misses the heart or the brain so that the blood is not driven through the flesh as happens too often with us  it is a hart of greaseyour holiness has seldom seen such a haunch  silence brother hilarius said the abbot wiping his mouth it is not beseeming our order to talk of food so earnestly especially as we must oft have our animal powers exhausted by fasting and be accessible as being ever mere mortals to those signs of longing he again wiped his mouth which arise on the mention of victuals to an hungry manminute down however the name of that youthit is fitting merit should be rewarded and he shall hereafter be a frater ad succurrendum in the kitchen and buttery  alas reverend father and my good lord replied the refectioner i did inquire after the youth and i learn he is one who prefers the casque to the cowl and the sword of the flesh to the weapons of the spirit  and if it be so said the abbot see that thou retain him as a deputykeeper and manatarms and not as a lay brother of the monasteryfor old tallboy our forester waxes dimeyed and hath twice spoiled a noble buck by hitting him unwarily on the haunch ah tis a foul fault the abusing by evilkilling evildressing evilappetite or otherwise the good creatures indulged to us for our use wherefore secure us the service of this youth brother hilarius in the way that may best suit himand now sir piercie shafton since the fates have assigned us a space of wellnigh an hour ere we dare hope to enjoy more than the vapour or savour of our repast may i pray you of your courtesy to tell me the cause of this visit and above all to inform us why you will not approach our more pleasant and better furnished hospitium  reverend father and my very good lord said sir piercie shafton it is well known to your wisdom that there are stone walls which have ears and that secrecy is to be looked to in matters which concern a mans head the abbot signed to his attendants excepting the subprior to leave the room and then said your valour sir piercie may freely unburden yourself before our faithful friend and counsellor father eustace the benefits of whose advice we may too soon lose inasmuch as his merits will speedily recommend him to an higher station in which we trust he may find the blessing of a friend and adviser as valuable as himself since i may say of him as our claustral rhyme goethfootnote the rest of this doggerel rhyme may be found in fosbrookes learned work on british monachism    dixit abbas ad prioris   tu es homo boni moris   quia semper sanioris   mihi das concilia  indeed he added the office of subprior is altogether beneath our dear brother nor can we elevate him unto that of prior which for certain reasons is at present kept vacant amongst us howbeit father eustace is fully possessed of my confidence and worthy of yours and well may it be said of him intravit in secretis nostris  sir piercie shafton bowed to the reverend brethren and heaving a sigh as if he would burst his steel cuirass he thus commenced his speech  certes reverend sirs i may well heave such a suspiration who have as it were exchanged heaven for purgatory leaving the lightsome sphere of the royal court of england for a remote nook in this inaccessible desertquitting the tiltyard where i was ever ready among my compeers to splinter a lance either for the love of honour or for the honour of love in order to couch my knightly spear against base and pilfering besognios and maraudersexchanging the lighted halls wherein i used nimbly to pace the swift coranto or to move with a loftier grace in the stately galliard for this rugged and decayed dungeon of rustycoloured stonequitting the gay theatre for the solitary chimneynook of a scottish doghousebartering the sounds of the soulravishing lute and the loveawaking violdegamba for the discordant squeak of a northern bagpipeabove all exchanging the smiles of those beauties who form a gay galaxy around the throne of england for the cold courtesy of an untaught damsel and the bewildered stare of a millers maiden more might i say of the exchange of the conversation of gallant knights and gay courtiers of mine own order and capacity whose conceits are bright and vivid as the lightning for that of monks and churchmenbut it were discourteous to urge that topic  the abbot listened to this list of complaints with great round eyes which evinced no exact intelligence of the orators meaning and when the knight paused to take breath he looked with a doubtful and inquiring eye at the subprior not well knowing in what tone he should reply to an exordium so extraordinary the subprior accordingly stepped in to the relief of his principal  we deeply sympathize with you sir knight in the several mortifications and hardships to which fate has subjected you particularly in that which has thrown you into the society of those who as they were conscious they deserved not such an honour so neither did they at all desire it but all this goes little way to expound the cause of this train of disasters or in plainer words the reason which has compelled you into a situation having so few charms for you  gentle and reverend sir replied the knight forgive an unhappy person who in giving a history of his miseries dilateth upon them extremely even as he who having fallen from a precipice looketh upward to measure the height from which he hath been precipitated  yea but said father eustace methinks it were wiser in him to tell those who come to lift him up which of his bones have been broken  you reverend sir said the knight have in the encounter of our wits made a fair attaint whereas i may be in some sort said to have broken my staff across footnote attaint was a term of tilting used to express the champions having attained his mark or in other words struck his lance straight and fair against the helmet or breast of his adversary whereas to break the lance across intimated a total failure in directing the point of the weapon on the object of his aim pardon me grave sir that i speak in the language of the tiltyard which is doubtless strange to your reverend yearsah brave resort of the noble the fair and the gayah throne of love and citadel of honourah celestial beauties by whose bright eyes it is graced  never more shall piercie shafton advance as the centre of your radiant glances couch his lance and spur his horse at the sound of the spiritstirring trumpets nobly called the voice of warnever more shall he baffle his adversarys encounter boldly break his spear dexterously and ambling around the lovely circle receive the rewards with which beauty honours chivalry  here he paused wrung his hands looked upwards and seemed lost in contemplation of his own fallen fortunes  mad very mad whispered the abbot to the subprior i would we were fairly rid of him for of a truth i expect he will proceed from raving to mischiefwere it not better to call up the rest of the brethren  but the subprior knew better than his superior how to distinguish the jargon of affectation from the ravings of insanity and although the extremity of the knights passion seemed altogether fantastic yet he was not ignorant to what extravagancies the fashion of the day can conduct its votaries  allowing therefore two minutes space to permit the knights enthusiastic feelings to exhaust themselves he again gravely reminded him that the lord abbot had taken a journey unwonted to his age and habits solely to learn in what he could serve sir piercie shaftonthat it was altogether impossible he could do so without his receiving distinct information of the situation in which he had now sought refuge in scotlandthe day wore on he observed looking at the window and if the abbot should be obliged to return to the monastery without obtaining the necessary intelligence the regret might be mutual but the inconvenience was like to be all on sir piercies own side  the hint was not thrown away  o goddess of courtesy said the knight can i so far have forgotten thy behests as to make this good prelates ease and time a sacrifice to my vain complaints know then most worthy and not less worshipful that i your poor visitor and guest am by birth nearly bound to the piercie of northumberland whose fame is so widely blown through all parts of the world where english worth hath been known now this present earl of northumberland of whom i propose to give you the brief history  it is altogether unnecessary said the abbot we know him to be a good and true nobleman and a sworn upholder of our catholic faith in the spite of the heretical woman who now sits upon the throne of england  and it is specially as his kinsman and as knowing that ye partake with him in such devout and faithful belief and adherence to our holy mother church that we say to you sir piercie shafton that ye be heartily welcome to us and that and we wist how we would labour to do you good service in your extremity  for such kind offer i rest your most humble debtor said sir piercie nor need i at this moment say more than that my right honourable cousin of northumberland having devised with me and some others the choice and picked spirits of the age how and by what means the worship of god according to the catholic church might be again introduced into this distracted kingdom of england even as one deviseth by the assistance of his friend to catch and bridle a runaway steed it pleased him so deeply to intrust me in those communications that my personal safety becomes as it were entwined or complicated therewith natheless as we have had sudden reason to believe this princess elizabeth who maintaineth around her a sort of counsellors skilful in tracking whatever schemes may be pursued for bringing her title into challenge or for erecting again the discipline of the catholic church has obtained certain knowledge of the trains which we had laid before we could give fire unto them wherefore my right honourable cousin of northumberland thinking it best belike that one man should take both blame and shame for the whole did lay the burden of all this trafficking upon my back which load i am the rather content to bear in that he hath always shown himself my kind and honourable kinsman as well as that my estate i wot not how hath of late been somewhat insufficient to maintain the expense of those braveries wherewith it is incumbent on us who are chosen and selected spirits to distinguish ourselves from the vulgar  so that possibly said the subprior your private affairs rendered a foreign journey less incommodious to you than it might have been to the noble earl your right worthy cousin  you are right reverend sir answered the courtier rem acuyou have touched the point with a needlemy cost and expenses had been indeed somewhat lavish at the late triumphs and tourneys and the flatcappd citizens had shown themselves unwilling to furnish my pocket for new gallantries for the honour of the nation as well as for mine own peculiar gloryand to speak truth it was in some part the hope of seeing these matters amended that led me to desire a new world in england  so that the miscarriage of your public enterprise with the derangement of your own private affairs said the subprior have induced you to seek scotland as a place of refuge  rem acu once again said sir piercie and not without good cause since my neck if i remained might have been brought within the circumstances of a halterand so speedy was my journey northward that i had but time to exchange my peachcoloured doublet of genoa velvet thickly laid over with goldsmiths work for this cuirass which was made by bonamico of milan and travelled northward with all speed judging that i might do well to visit my right honourable cousin of northumberland at one of his numerous castles but as i posted towards alnwick even with the speed of a star which darting from its native sphere shoots wildly downwards i was met at northallerton by one henry vaughan a servant of my right honourable kinsman who showed me that as then i might not with safety come to his presence seeing that in obedience to orders from his court he was obliged to issue out letters for my incarceration  this said the abbot seems but hard measure on the part of your honourable kinsman  it might be so judged my lord replied sir piercie nevertheless i will stand to the death for the honour of my right honourable cousin of northumberland also henry vaughan gave me from my said cousin a good horse and a purse of gold with two borderprickers as they are called for my guides who conducted me by such roads and bypaths as have never been seen since the days of sir lancelot and sir tristrem into this kingdom of scotland and to the house of a certain baron or one who holds the style of such called julian avenel with whom i found such reception as the place and party could afford  and that said the abbot must have been right wretched for to judge from the appetite which julian showeth when abroad he hath not i judge overabundant provision at home  you are right siryour reverence is in the right continued sir piercie we had but lenten fare and what was worse a score to clear at the departure for though this julian avenel called us to no reckoning yet he did so extravagantly admire the fashion of my poniardthe poignet being of silver exquisitely hatched and indeed the weapon being altogether a piece of exceeding rare device and beautythat in faith i could not for very shames sake but pray his acceptance of it words which he gave me not the trouble of repeating twice before he had stuck it into his greasy buffbelt where credit me reverend sir it showed more like a butchers knife than a gentlemans dagger  so goodly a gift might at least have purchased you a few days hospitality said father eustace  reverend sir said sir piercie had i abidden with him i should have been complimented out of every remnant of my wardrobeactually flayed by the hospitable gods i swear it sir he secured my spare doublet and had a pluck at my galligaskinsi was enforced to beat a retreat before i was altogether unrigged that border knave his serving man had a pluck at me too and usurped a scarlet cassock and steel cuirass belonging to the page of my body whom i was fain to leave behind me in good time i received a letter from my right honourable cousin showing me that he had written to you in my behalf and sent to your charge two mails filled with wearing apparelnamely my rich crimson silk doublet slashed out and lined with cloth of gold which i wore at the last revels with baldric and trimmings to correspondalso two pair black silk slops with hanging garters of carnation silkalso the fleshcoloured silken doublet with the trimmings of fur in which i danced the salvage man at the graysinn mummeryalso  sir knight said the subprior i pray you to spare the farther inventory of your wardrobe the monks of saint marys are no freebooting barons and whatever part of your vestments arrived at our house have been this day faithfully brought hither with the mails which contained them i may presume from what has been said as we have indeed been given to understand by the earl of northumberland that your desire is to remain for the present as unknown and as unnoticed as may be consistent with your high worth and distinction  alas reverend father replied the courtier a blade when it is in the scabbard cannot give lustre a diamond when it is in the casket cannot give light and worth when it is compelled by circumstances to obscure itself cannot draw observationmy retreat can only attract the admiration of those few to whom circumstances permit its displaying itself  i conceive now my venerable father and lord said the subprior that your wisdom will assign such a course of conduct to this noble knight as may be alike consistent with his safety and with the weal of the community  for you wot well that perilous strides have been made in these audacious days to the destruction of all ecclesiastical foundations and that our holy community has been repeatedly menaced hitherto they have found no flaw in our raiment but a party friendly as well to the queen of england as to the heretical doctrines of the schismatical church or even to worse and wilder forms of heresy prevails now at the court of our sovereign who dare not yield to her suffering clergy the protection she would gladly extend to them  my lord and reverend sir said the knight i will gladly relieve you of my presence while ye canvass this matter at your freedom and to speak truly i am desirous to see in what case the chamberlain of my noble kinsman hath found my wardrobe and how he hath packed the same and whether it has suffered from the journeythere are four suits of as pure and elegant device as ever the fancy of a fair lady doated upon every one having a treble and appropriate change of ribbons trimmings and fringes which in case of need may as it were renew each of them and multiply the four into twelvethere is also my sadcoloured ridingsuit and three cutwork shirts with falling bandsi pray you pardon mei must needs see how matters stand with them without farther dallying  thus speaking he left the room and the subprior looking after him significantly added where the treasure is will the heart be also  saint mary preserve our wits said the abbot stunned with the knights abundance of words were mans brains ever so stuffed with silk and broadcloth cutwork and i wot not what besides and what could move the earl of northumberland to assume for his bosom counsellor in  matters of death and danger such a featherbrained coxcomb as this  had he been other than what he is venerable father said the subprior he had been less fitted for the part of scapegoat to which his right honourable cousin had probably destined him from the commencement in case of their plot failing i know something of this piercie shafton the legitimacy of his mothers descent from the piercie family the point on which he is most jealous hath been called in question if hairbrained courage and an outrageous spirit of gallantry can make good his pretensions to the high lineage he claims these qualities have never been denied him for the rest he is one of the ruffling gallants of the time like howland yorke stukely  footnote yorke says camden was a londoner a man of loose and dissolute behaviour and desperately audaciousfamous in his time amongst the common bullies and swaggerers as being the first that to the great admiration of many at his boldness brought into england the bold and dangerous way of fencing with the rapier in duelling whereas till that time the english used to fight with long swords and bucklers striking with the edge and thought it no part of man either to push or strike beneath the girdle  having a command in the low countries yorke revolted to the spaniards and died miserably poisoned as was supposed by his new allies three years afterwards his bones were dug up and gibbeted by the command of the states of holland  thomas stukely another distinguished gallant of the time was bred a merchant being the son of a rich clothier in the west he wedded the daughter and heiress of a wealthy alderman of london named curtis after whose death he squandered the riches he thus acquired in all manner of extravagance his wife whose fortune supplied his waste represented to him that he ought to make more of her stukely replied i will make as much of thee believe me as it is possible for any to do and he kept his word in one sense having stripped her even of her wearing apparel before he finally ran away from her  having fled to italy he contrived to impose upon the pope with a plan of invading ireland for which he levied soldiers and made some preparations but ended by engaging himself and his troops in the service of king sebastian of portugal he sailed with that prince on his fatal voyage to barbary and fell with him at the battle of alcazar  stukely as one of the first gallants of the time has had the honour to be chronicled in song in evans old ballads vol iii edition 1810 his fate is also introduced in a tragedy by george peel as has been supposed called the battle of alcazar from which play dryden is alleged to have taken the idea of don sebastian if so it is surprising he omitted a character so congenial to king charles the seconds time as the witty brave and profligate thomas stukely  and others who wear out their fortunes and endanger their lives in idle braveries in order that they may be esteemed the only choice gallants of the time and afterwards endeavour to repair their estate by engaging in the desperate plots and conspiracies which wiser heads have devised to use one of his own conceited similitudes such courageous fools resemble hawks which the wiser conspirator keeps hooded and blinded on his wrist until the quarry is on the wing and who are then flown at them  saint mary said the abbot he were an evil guest to introduce into our quiet household our young monks make bustle enough and more than is beseeming gods servants about their outward attire alreadythis knight were enough to turn their brains from the vestiarius down to the very scullion boy  a worse evil might follow said the subprior in these bad days the patrimony of the church is bought and sold forfeited and distrained as if it were the unhallowed soil appertaining to a secular baron think what penalty awaits us were we convicted of harbouring a rebel to her whom they call the queen of england there would neither be wanting scottish parasites to beg the lands of the foundation nor an army from england to burn and harry the halidome the men of scotland were once scotsmen firm and united in the love of their country and throwing every other consideration aside when the frontier was menacednow they arewhat shall i call themthe one part french the other part english considering their dear native country merely as a prizefighting stage upon which foreigners are welcome to decide their quarrels  benedictine replied the abbot they are indeed slippery and evil times  and therefore said father eustace we must walk warilywe must not for example bring this manthis sir piercie shafton to our house of saint marys  but how then shall we dispose of him replied the abbot bethink thee that he is a sufferer for holy churchs sakethat his patron the earl of northumberland hath been our friend and that lying so near us he may work us weal or wo according as we deal with his kinsman  and accordingly said the subprior for these reasons as well as for discharge of the great duty of christian charity i would protect and relieve this man let him not go back to julian avenelthat unconscientious baron would not stick to plunder the exiled strangerlet him remain herethe spot is secluded and if the accommodation be beneath his quality discovery will become the less likely we will make such means for his convenience as we can devise  will he be persuaded thinkest thou said the abbot i will leave my own travelling bed for his repose and send up a suitable easychair  with such easements said the subprior he must not complain and then if threatened by any sudden danger he can soon come down to the sanctuary where we will harbour him in secret until means can be devised of dismissing him in safety  were we not better said the abbot send him on to the court and get rid of him at once  ay but at the expense of our friendsthis butterfly may fold his wings and lie under cover in the cold air of glendearg but were he at holyrood he would did his life depend on it expand his spangled drapery in the eyes of the queen and courtrather than fail of distinction he would sue for love to our gracious sovereignthe eyes of all men would be upon him in the course of three short days and the international peace of the two ends of the island endangered for a creature who like a silly moth cannot abstain from fluttering round a light  thou hast prevailed with me father eustace said the abbot and it will go hard but i improve on thy plani will send up in secret not only household stuff but wine and wassellbread there is a young swankie here who shoots venison well i will give him directions to see that the knight lacks none  whatever accommodation he can have which infers not a risk of discovery said the subprior it is our duty to afford him  nay said the abbot we will do more and will instantly despatch a servant express to the keeper of our revestiary to send us such things as he may want even this night see it done good father  i will answered father eustace but i hear the gull clamorous for some one to truss his pointsfootnote the points were the strings of cord or ribbon so called because pointed with metal like the laces of womens stays which attached the doublet to the hose they were very numerous and required assistance to tie them properly which was called trussing he will be fortunate if he lights on any one here who can do him the office of groom of the chamber  i would he would appear said the abbot for here comes the refectioner with the collationby my faith the ride hath given me a sharp appetite                                         chapter the seventeenth     ill seek for other aidspirits they say   flit round invisible as thick as motes   dance in the sunbeam if that spell   or necromancers sigil can compel them   they shall hold council with me                 james duff  the readers attention must be recalled to halbert glendinning who had left the tower of glendearg immediately after his quarrel with its new guest sir piercie shafton as he walked with a rapid pace up the glen old martin followed him beseeching him to be less hasty  halbert said the old man you will never live to have white hair if you take fire thus at every spark of provocation  and why should i wish it old man said halbert if i am to be the butt that every fool may aim a shaft of scorn againstwhat avails it old man that you yourself move sleep and wake eat thy niggard meal and repose on thy hard palletwhy art thou so well pleased that the morning should call thee up to daily toil and the evening again lay thee down a weariedout wretch were it not better sleep and wake no more than to undergo this dull exchange of labour for insensibility and of insensibility for labour  god help me answered martin there may be truth in what thou sayestbut walk slower for my old limbs cannot keep pace with your young legswalk slower and i will tell you why age though unlovely is yet endurable  speak on then said halbert slackening his pace but remember we must seek venison to refresh the fatigues of these holy men who will this morning have achieved a journey of ten miles and if we reach not the brocksburn head we are scarce like to see an antler  then know my good halbert said martin whom i love as my own son that i am satisfied to live till death calls me because my maker wills it ay and although i spend what men call a hard life pinched with cold in winter and burnt with heat in summer though i feed hard and sleep hard and am held mean and despised yet i bethink me that were i of no use on the face of this fair creation god would withdraw me from it  thou poor old man said halbert and can such a vain conceit as this of thy fancied use reconcile thee to a world where thou playest so poor a part  my part was nearly as poor said martin my person nearly as much despised the day that i saved my mistress and her child from perishing in the wilderness  right martin answered halbert there indeed thou didst what might be a sufficient apology for a whole life of insignificance  and do you account it for nothing halbert that i should have the power of giving you a lesson of patience and submission to the destinies of providence methinks there is use for the grey hairs on the old scalp were it but to instruct the green head by precept and by example  halbert held down his face and remained silent for a minute or two and then resumed his discourse martin seest thou aught changed in me of late  surely said martin i have always known you hasty wild and inconsiderate rude and prompt to speak at the volley and without reflection but now methinks your bearing without losing its natural fire has something in it of force and dignity which it had not before it seems as if you had fallen asleep a carle and awakened a gentleman  thou canst judge then of noble bearing said halbert  surely answered martin in some sort i can for i have travelled through court and camp and city with my master walter avenel although he could do nothing for me in the long run but give me room for two score of sheep on the hilland surely even now while i speak with you i feel sensible that my language is more refined than it is my wont to use and thatthough i know not the reasonthe rude northern dialect so familiar to my tongue has given place to a more townbred speech  and this change in thyself and me thou canst by no means account for said young glendinning  change replied martin by our lady it is not so much a change which i feel as a recalling and renewing sentiments and expressions which i had some thirty years since ere tibb and i set up our humble household  it is singular that your society should have this sort of influence over me halbert and that i should never have experienced it ere now  thinkest thou said halbert thou seest in me aught that can raise me from this base low despised state into one where i may rank with those proud men who now despise my clownish poverty  martin paused an instant and then answered doubtless you may halbert as broken a ship has come to land heard ye never of hughie dun who left this halidome some thirtyfive years gone by a deliverly fellow was hughiecould read and write like a priest and could wield brand and buckler with the best of the riders i mind himthe like of him was never seen in the halidome of saint marys and so was seen of the preferment that god sent him  and what was that said halbert his eyes sparkling with eagerness  nothing less answered martin than bodyservant to the archbishop of saint andrews  halberts countenance fella servantand to a priest was this all that knowledge and activity could raise him to  martin in his turn looked with wistful surprise in the face of his young friend and to what could fortune lead him farther answered he  the son of a kirkfeuar is not the stuff that lords and knights are made of courage and school craft cannot change churls blood into gentle blood i trow i have heard forby that hughie dun left a good five hundred punds of scots money to his only daughter and that she married the bailie of pittenweem  at this moment and while halbert was embarrassed with devising a suitable answer a deer bounded across their path in an instant the crossbow was at the youths shoulder the bolt whistled and the deer after giving one bound upright dropt dead on the green sward  there lies the venison our dame wanted said martin who would have thought of an outlying stag being so low down the glen at this seasonand it is a hart of grease too in full season and three inches of fat on the brisket now this is all your luck halbert that follows you go where you like were you to put in for it i would warrant you were made one of the abbots yeomanprickers and ride about in a purple doublet as bold as the best  tush man answered halbert i will serve the queen or no one take thou care to have down the venison to the tower since they expect it  i will on to the moss i have two or three birdbolts at my girdle and it may be i shall find wildfowl  he hastened his pace and was soon out of sight martin paused for a moment and looked after him there goes the making of a right gallant stripling an ambition have not the spoiling of himserve the queen said he by my faith and she hath worse servants from all that i eer heard of him and wherefore should he not keep a high head they that ettle to the top of the ladder will at least get up some rounds they that mint footnote mintaim at at a gown of gold will always get a sleeve of it but come sir addressing the stag you shall go to glendearg on my two legs somewhat more slowly than you were frisking it even now on your own four nimble shanks nay by my faith if you be so heavy i will content me with the best of you and thats the haunch and the nombles and een heave up the rest on the old oaktree yonder and come back for it with one of the yauds footnote yaudshorses more particularly horses of labour  while martin returned to glendearg with the venison halbert prosecuted his walk breathing more easily since he was free of his companion the domestic of a proud and lazy priestbodysquire to the archbishop of saint andrews he repeated to himself and this with the privilege of allying his blood with the bailie of pittenween is thought a preferment worth a brave mans struggling fornay more a preferment which if allowed should crown the hopes past present and to come of the son of a kirkvassal by heaven but that i find in me a reluctance to practise their acts of nocturnal rapine i would rather take the jack and lance and join with the borderriders something i will do here degraded and dishonoured i will not live the scorn of each whiffling stranger from the south because forsooth he wears tinkling spurs on a tawney boot this thingthis phantom be it what it will i will see it once more  since i spoke with her and touched her hand thoughts and feelings have dawned on me of which my former life had not even dreamed but shall i who feel my fathers glen too narrow for my expanding spirit brook to be bearded in it by this vain gewgaw of a courtier and in the sight too of mary avenel i will not stoop to it by heaven  as he spoke thus he arrived in the sequestered glen of corrinanshian as it verged upon the hour of noon a few moments he remained looking upon the fountain and doubting in his own mind with what countenance the white lady might receive him she had not indeed expressly forbidden his again evoking her but yet there was something like such a prohibition implied in the farewell which recommended him to wait for another guide  halbert glendinning did not long however allow himself to pause hardihood was the natural characteristic of his mind and under the expansion and modification which his feelings had lately undergone it had been augmented rather than diminished he drew his sword undid the buskin from his foot bowed three times with deliberation towards the fountain and as often towards the tree and repeated the same rhyme as formerly    thrice to the holy brake     thrice to the well   i bid thee awake     white maid of avenel    noon gleams on the lake     noon glows on the fell   wake thee o wake     white maid of avenel  his eye was on the holly bush as he spoke the last line and it was not without an involuntary shuddering that he saw the air betwixt his eye and that object become more dim and condense as it were into the faint appearance of a form through which however so thin and transparent was the first appearance of the phantom he could discern the outline of the bush as through a veil of fine crape but gradually it darkened into a more substantial appearance and the white lady stood before him with displeasure on her brow she spoke and her speech was still song or rather measured chant but as if now more familiar it flowed occasionally in modulated blankverse and at other times in the lyrical measure which she had used at their former meeting    this is the day when the fairy kind     sits weeping alone for their hopeless lot   and the woodmaiden sighs to the sighing wind     and the mermaiden weeps in her crystal grot   for this is the day that a deed was wrought     in which we have neither part nor share   for the children of clay was salvation bought     but not for the forms of sea or air   and ever the mortal is most forlorn     who meeteth our race on the friday morn  spirit said halbert glendinning boldly it is bootless to threaten  one who holds his life at no rate thine anger can but slay nor do i think thy power extendeth or thy will stretcheth so far the terrors which your race produce upon others are vain against me my heart is hardened against fear as by a sense of despair if i am as thy words infer of a race more peculiarly the care of heaven than thine it is mine to call it must be thine to answer i am the nobler being  as he spoke the figure looked upon him with a fierce and ireful countenance which without losing the similitude of that which it usually exhibited had a wilder and more exaggerated cast of features the eyes seemed to contract and become more fiery and slight convulsions passed over the face as if it was about to be transformed into something hideous  the whole appearance resembled those faces which the imagination summons up when it is disturbed by laudanum but which do not remain under the visionarys command and beautiful in their first appearance become wild and grotesque ere we can arrest them  but when halbert had concluded his bold speech the white lady stood before him with the same pale fixed and melancholy aspect which she usually bore he had expected the agitation which she exhibited would conclude in some frightful metamorphosis folding her arms on her bosom the phantom replied    daring youth for thee it is well   here calling me in haunted dell   that thy heart has not quaild        nor thy courage faild        and that thou couldst brook   the angry look        of her of avenel    did one limb shiver        or an eyelid quiver   thou wert lost for ever   though i am formd from the ether blue   and my blood is of the unfallen dew        and thou art framed of mud and dust   tis thine to speak reply i must  i demand of thee then said the youth by what charm it is that i am thus altered in mind and in wishesthat i think no longer of deer or dog of bow or boltthat my soul spurns the bounds of this obscure glenthat my blood boils at an insult from one by whose stirrup i would some days since have run for a whole summers morn contented and honoured by the notice of a single word why do i now seek to mate me with princes and knights and noblesam i the same who but yesterday as it were slumbered in contented obscurity but who am today awakened to glory and ambitionspeaktell me if thou canst the meaning of this changeam i spellboundor have i till now been under the influence of a spell that i feel as another being yet am conscious of remaining the same speak and tell me is it to thy influence that the change is owing  the white lady replied    a mightier wizard far than i     wields oer the universe his power   him owns the eagle in the sky     the turtle in the bower   chanceful in shape yet mightiest still   he wields the heart of man at will   from ill to good from good to ill   in cot and castletower  speak not thus darkly said the youth colouring so deeply that face neck and hands were in a sanguine glow make me sensible of thy purpose  the spirit answered    ask thy heartwhose secret cell   is filld with marv avenel   ask thy pridewhy scornful look   in marys view it will not brook   ask it why thou seekst to rise   among the mighty and the wise   why thou spurnst thy lowly lot   why thy pastimes are forgot   why thou wouldst in bloody strife   mend thy luck or lose thy life   ask thy heart and it shall tell   sighing from its secret cell   tis for mary avenel  tell me then said halbert his cheek still deeply crimsoned thou who hast said to me that which i dared not say to myself by what means shall i urge my passionby what means make it known  the white lady replied    do not ask me   on doubts like these thou canst not task me   we only see the passing show   of human passions ebb and flow   and view the pageants idle glance   as mortals eye the northern dance   when thousand streamers flashing bright   career it oer the brow of night   and gazers mark their changeful gleams   but feel no influence from their beams  yet thine own fate replied halbert unless men greatly err is linked with that of mortals  the phantom answered    by ties mysterious linkd our fated race   holds strange connexion with the sons of men   the star that rose upon the house of avenel   when norman ulric first assumed the name   that star when culminating in its orbit   shot from its sphere a drop of diamond dew   and this bright font received itand a spirit   rose from the fountain and her date of life   hath coexistence with the house of avenel   and with the star that rules it  speak yet more plainly answered young glendinning of this i can understand nothing say what hath forged thy wierded footnote wierdedfated link of destiny with the house of avenel say especially what fate now overhangs that house  the white lady replied    look on my girdleon this thread of gold   tis fine as web of lightest gossamer   and but there is a spell ont would not bind   light as they are the folds of my thin robe   but when twas donnd it was a massive chain   such as might bind the champion of the jews    even when his looks were longestit hath dwindled   hath minishd in its substance and its strength   as sunk the greatness of the house of avenel   when this frail thread gives way i to the elements   resign the principles of life they lent me   ask me no more of thisthe stars forbid it  then canst thou read the stars answered the youth and mayest tell me the fate of my passion if thou canst not aid it  the white lady again replied    dim burns the once bright star of avenel   dim as the beacon when the morn is nigh   and the oerwearied warder leaves the lighthouse   there is an influence sorrowful and fearful   that dogs its downward course disastrous passion   fierce hate and rivalry are in the aspect   that lowers upon its fortunes  and rivalry repeated glendinning it is then as i fearedbut shall that english silkworm presume to beard me in my fathers house and in the presence of mary avenelgive me to meet him spiritgive me to do away the vain distinction of rank on which he refuses me the combat  place us on equal terms and gleam the stars with what aspect they will the sword of my father shall control their influences  she answered as promptly as before    complain not of me child of clay   if to thy harm i yield the way   we who soar thy sphere above   know not aught of hate or love   as will or wisdom rules thy mood   my gifts to evil turn or good  give me to redeem my honour said halbert glendinninggive me to retort on my proud rival the insults he has thrown on me and let the rest fare as it will if i cannot revenge my wrong i shall sleep quiet and know nought of my disgrace  the phantom failed not to reply    when piercie shafton boasteth high   let this token meet his eye   the sun is westering from the dell   thy wish is grantedfare thee well  as the white lady spoke or chanted these last words she undid from her locks a silver bodkin around which they were twisted and gave it to halbert glendinning then shaking her dishevelled hair till it fell like a veil around her the outlines of her form gradually became as diffuse as her flowing tresses her countenance grew pale as the moon in her first quarter her features became indistinguishable and she melted into the air  habit inures us to wonders but the youth did not find himself alone by the fountain without experiencing though in a much less degree the revulsion of spirits which he had felt upon the phantoms former disappearance  a doubt strongly pressed upon his mind whether it were safe to avail himself of the gifts of a spirit which did not even pretend to belong to the class of angels and might for aught he knew have a much worse lineage than that which she was pleased to avow i will speak of it he said to edward who is clerkly learned and will tell me what i should do and yet noedward is scrupulous and waryi will prove the effect of her gift on sir piercie shafton if he again braves me and by the issue i will be myself a sufficient judge whether there is danger in resorting to her counsel home then homeand we shall soon learn whether that home shall longer hold me for not again will i brook insult with my fathers sword by my side and mary for the spectator of my disgrace     chapter the eighteenth     i give thee eighteenpence aday     and my bow shall thou bear   and over all the north country     i make thee the chief rydere   and i thirteenpence aday quoth the queen     by god and by my faye   come fetch thy payment when thou wilt     no man shall say thee nay               william of cloudesley  the manners of the age did not permit the inhabitants of glendearg to partake of the collation which was placed in the spence of that ancient tower before the lord abbot and his attendants and sir piercie shafton  dame glendinning was excluded both by inferiority of rank and by sex for though it was a rule often neglected the superior of saint marys was debarred from taking his meals in female society to mary avenel the latter and to edward glendinning the former incapacity attached but it pleased his lordship to require their presence in the apartment and to say sundry kind words to them upon the ready and hospitable reception which they had afforded him  the smoking haunch now stood upon the table a napkin white as snow was with due reverence tucked under the chin of the abbot by the refectioner and nought was wanting to commence the repast save the presence of sir piercie shafton who at length appeared glittering like the sun in a carnationvelvet doublet slashed and puffed out with cloth of silver his hat of the newest block surrounded by a hatband of goldsmiths work while around his neck he wore a collar of gold set with rubies and topazes so rich that it vindicated his anxiety for the safety of his baggage from being founded upon his love of mere finery this gorgeous collar or chain resembling those worn by the knights of the highest orders of chivalry fell down on his breast and terminated in a medallion  we waited for sir piercie shafton said the abbot hastily assuming his place in the great chair which the kitchener advanced to the table with ready hand  i pray your pardon reverend father and my good lord replied that pink of courtesy i did but wait to cast my riding slough and to transmew myself into some civil form meeter for this worshipful company  i cannot but praise your gallantry sir knight said the abbot and your prudence also for choosing the fitting time to appear thus adorned  certes had that goodly chain been visible in some part of your late progress there was risk that the lawful owner might have parted company therewith  this chain said your reverence answered sir piercie surely it is but a toy a trifle a slight thing which shows but poorly with this doubletmarry when i wear that of the murreycoloured doublepiled genoa velvet puffed out with ciprus the gems being relieved and set off by the darker and more grave ground of the stuff show like stars giving a lustre through dark clouds  i nothing doubt it said the abbot but i pray you to sit down at the board  but sir piercie had now got into his element and was not easily interruptedi own he continued that slight as the toy is it might perchance have had some captivation for juliansanta maria said he interrupting himself what was i about to say and my fair and beauteous protection or shall i rather term her my discretion here in presenceindiscreet hath it been in your affability o most lovely discretion to suffer a stray word to have broke out of the penfold of his mouth that might overleap the fence of civility and trespass on the manor of decorum  marry said the abbot somewhat impatiently the greatest discretion that i can see in the matter is to eat our victuals being hotfather eustace say the benedicite and cut up the haunch  the subprior readily obeyed the first part of the abbots injunction but paused upon the secondit is friday most reverend he said in latin desirous that the hint should escape if possible the ears of the stranger  we are travellers said the abbot in reply and viatoribus licitum estyou know the canona traveller must eat what food his hard fate sets before him i grant you all a dispensation to eat flesh this day conditionally that you brethren say the confiteor at curfew time that the knight give alms to his ability and that all and each of you fast from flesh on such day within the next month that shall seem most convenientwherefore fall to and eat your food with cheerful countenances and you father refectioner da mixtus  while the abbot was thus stating the conditions on which his indulgence was granted he had already half finished a slice of the noble haunch and now washed it down with a flagon of rhenish modestly tempered with water  well is it said he observed as he required from the refectioner another slice that virtue is its own reward for though this is but humble fare and hastily prepared and eaten in a poor chamber i do not remember me of having had such an appetite since i was a simple brother in the abbey of dundrennan and was wont to labour in the garden from morning until nones when our abbot struck the cymbalum then would i enter keen with hunger parched with thirst da mihi vinum quaeso et merum sit and partake with appetite of whatever was set before us according to our rule feast or fast day caritas or penitentia was the same to me i had no stomach complaints then which now crave both the aid of wine and choice cookery to render my food acceptable to my palate and easy of digestion  it may be holy father said the subprior an occasional ride to the extremity of saint marys patrimony may have the same happy effect on your health as the air of the garden at dundrennan  perchance with our patronesss blessing such progresses may advantage us said the abbot having an especial eye that our venison is carefully killed by some woodsman that is master of his craft  if the lord abbot will permit me said the kitchener i think the best way to assure his lordship on that important point would be to retain as a yeomanpricker or deputyranger the eldest son of this good woman dame glendinning who is here to wait upon us i should know by mine office what belongs to killing of game and i can safely pronounce that never saw i or any other coquinarius a bolt so justly shot it has cloven the very heart of the buck  what speak you to us of one good shot father said sir piercie i would advise you that such no more maketh a shooter than doth one swallow make a summeri have seen this springald of whom you speak and if his hand can send forth his shafts as boldly as his tongue doth utter presumptuous speeches i will own him as good an archer as robin hood  marry said the abbot and it is fitting we know the truth of this matter from the dame herself for ill advised were we to give way to any rashness in this matter whereby the bounties which heaven and our patroness provide might be unskilfully mangled and rendered unfit for worthy mens usestand forth therefore dame glendinning and tell to us as thy liege lord and spiritual superior using plainness and truth without either fear or favour as being a matter wherein we are deeply interested doth this son of thine use his bow as well as the father kitchener avers to us  so please your noble fatherhood answered dame glendinning with a deep curtsy i should know somewhat of archery to my cost seeing my husbandgod assoilzie himwas slain in the field of pinkie with an arrowshot while he was fighting under the kirks banner as became a liege vassal of the halidome he was a valiant man please your reverence and an honest and saving that he loved a bit of venison and shifted for his living at a time as bordermen will sometimes do i wot not of sin that he did and yet though i have paid for mass after mass to the matter of a forty shilling besides a quarter of wheat and four firlocks of rye i can have no assurance yet that he has been delivered from purgatory  dame said the lord abbot this shall be looked into heedfully and since thy husband fell as thou sayest in the kirks quarrel and under her banner rely upon it that we will have him out of purgatory forthwiththat is always provided he be therebut it is not of thy husband whom we now devise to speak but of thy son not of a shot scotsman but of a shot deerwherefore i say answer me to the point is thy son a practised archer ay or no  alack my reverend lord replied the widow and my croft would be better tilled if i could answer your reverence that he is notpractised archermarry holy sir i would he would practise something elsecrossbow and longbow handgun and hackbut falconet and saker he can shoot with them all and if it would please this right honourable gentleman our guest to hold out his hat at the distance of a hundred yards our halbert shall send shaft bolt or bullet through it so that right honourable gentleman swerve not but hold out steady and i will forfeit a quarter of barley if he touch but a knot of his ribands i have seen our old martin do as much and so has our right reverend the subprior if he be pleased to remember it  i am not like to forget it dame said father eustace for i knew not which most to admire the composure of the young marksman or the steadiness of the old mark yet i presume not to advise sir piercie shafton to subject his valuable beaver and yet more valuable person to such a risk unless it should be his own special pleasure  be assured it is not said sir piercie shafton something hastily be well assured holy father that it is not i dispute not the lads qualities for which your reverence vouches but bows are but wood strings are but flax or the silkworm excrement at best archers are but men fingers may slip eyes may dazzle the blindest may hit the butt the best marker may shoot a bows length beside therefore will we try no perilous experiments  be that as you will sir piercie said the abbot meantime we will name this youth bowbearer in the forest granted to us by good king david that the chase might recreate our wearied spirits the flesh of the dear improve our poor commons and the hides cover the books of our library thus tending at once to the sustenance of body and soul  kneel down woman kneel down said the refectioner and the kitchener with one voice to dame glendinning and kiss his lordships hand for the grace which he has granted to thy son  they then as if they had been chanting the service and the responses set off in a sort of duetto enumerating the advantages of the situation  a green gown and a pair of leathern galligaskins every pentecost said the kitchener  four marks by the year at candlemas answered the refectioner  a hogshead of ale at martlemas of the double strike and single ale at pleasure as he shall agree with the cellarer  who is a reasonable man said the abbot and will encourage an active servant of the convent  a mess of broth and a dole of mutton or beef at the kitcheners on each high holiday resumed the kitchener  the gang of two cows and a palfrey on our ladys meadow answered his brother officer  an oxhide to make buskins of yearly because of the brambles echoed the kitchener  and various other perquisites quae nunc praescribere longum said the abbot summing with his own lordly voice the advantages attached to the office of conventional bowbearer  dame glendinning was all this while on her knees her head mechanically turning from the one church officer to the other which as they stood one on each side of her had much the appearance of a figure moved by clockwork and so soon as they were silent most devotedly did she kiss the munificent hand of the abbot conscious however of halberts intractability in some points she could not help qualifying her grateful and reiterated thanks for the abbots bountiful proffer with a hope that halbert would see his wisdom and accept of it  how said the abbot bending his brows accept of itwoman is thy son in his right wits  elspeth stunned by the tone in which this question was asked was altogether unable to reply to it indeed any answer she might have made could hardly have been heard as it pleased the two officebearers of the abbots table again to recommence their alternate dialogue  refuse said the kitchener  refuse answered the refectioner echoing the others word in a tone of still louder astonishment  refuse four marks by the year said the one  ale and beerbroth and muttoncows grass and palfreys shouted the kitchener  gown and galligaskins responded the refectioner  a moments patience my brethren answered the subprior and let us not be thus astonished before cause is afforded of our amazement this good dame best knoweth the temper and spirit of her sonthis much i can say that it lieth not towards letters or learning of which i have in vain endeavoured to instil into him some tincture nevertheless he is a youth of no common spirit but much like those in my weak judgment whom god raises up among a people when he meaneth that their deliverance shall be wrought out with strength of hand and valour of heart such men we have seen marked with a waywardness and even an obstinacy of character which hath appeared intractability and stupidity to those among whom they walked and were conversant until the very opportunity hath arrived in which it was the will of providence that they should be the fitting instrument of great things  now in good time hast thou spoken father eustace said the abbot and we will see this swankie before we decide upon the means of employing himhow say you sir piercie shafton is it not the court fashion to suit the man to the office and not the office to the man  so please your reverence and lordship answered the northumbrian knight i do partly that is in some sort subscribe to what your wisdom hath deliverednevertheless under reverence of the subprior we do not look for gallant leaders and national deliverers in the hovels of the mean common people credit me that if there be some flashes of martial spirit about this young person which i am not called upon to dispute though i have seldom seen that presumption and arrogance were made good upon the upshot by deed and action yet still these will prove insufficient to distinguish him save in his own limited and lowly sphereeven as the glowworm which makes a goodly show among the grass of the field would be of little avail if deposited in a beacongrate  now in good time said the subprior and here comes the young huntsman to speak for himself for being placed opposite to the window he could observe halbert as he ascended the little mound on which the tower was situated  summon him to our presence said the lord abbot and with an obedient start the two attendant monks went off with emulous alertness dame glendinning sprung away at the same moment partly to gain an instant to recommend obedience to her son partly to prevail with him to change his apparel before coming in presence of the abbot but the kitchener and refectioner both speaking at once had already seized each an arm and were leading halbert in triumph into the apartment so that she could only ejaculate his will be done but an he had but had on him his sundays hose  limited and humble as this desire was the fates did not grant it for halbert glendinning was hurried into the presence of the lord abbot and his party without a word of explanation and without a moments time being allowed to assume his holiday hose which in the language of the time implied both breeches and stockings  yet though thus suddenly presented amid the centre of all eyes there was something in halberts appearance which commanded a certain degree of respect from the company into which he was so unceremoniously intruded and the greater part of whom were disposed to consider him with hauteur if not with absolute contempt but his appearance and reception we must devote to another chapter                                                       chapter the nineteenth     now choose thee gallant betwixt wealth and honour   there lies the pelf in sum to bear thee through   the dance of youth and the turmoil of manhood   yet leave enough for ages chimneycorner   but an thou grasp to it farewell ambition   farewell each hope of bettering thy condition   and raising thy low rank above the churls   that till the earth for bread                                  old play  it is necessary to dwell for some brief space on the appearance and demeanour of young glendinning ere we proceed to describe his interview with the abbot of st marys at this momentous crisis of his life  halbert was now about nineteen years old tall and active rather than strong yet of that hardy conformation of limb and sinew which promises great strength when the growth shall be complete and the system confirmed  he was perfectly well made and like most men who have that advantage possessed a grace and natural ease of manner and carriage which prevented his height from being the distinguished part of his external appearance it was not until you had compared his stature with that of those amongst or near to whom he stood that you became sensible that the young glendinning was upwards of six feet high in the combination of unusual height with perfect symmetry ease and grace of carriage the young heir of glendearg notwithstanding his rustic birth and education had greatly the advantage even of sir piercie shafton himself whose stature was lower and his limbs though there was no particular point to object to were on the whole less exactly proportioned on the other hand sir piercies very handsome countenance afforded him as decided an advantage over the scotsman as regularity of features and brilliance of complexion could give over traits which were rather strongly marked than beautiful and upon whose complexion the skyey influences to which he was constantly exposed had blended the red and white into the purely nutbrown hue which coloured alike cheeks neck and forehead and blushed only in a darker glow upon the former halberts eyes supplied a marked and distinguished part of his physiognomy they were large and of a hazel colour and sparkled in moments of animation with such uncommon brilliancy that it seemed as if they actually emitted light nature had closely curled the locks of darkbrown hair which relieved and set off the features such as we have described them displaying a bold and animated disposition much more than might have been expected from his situation or from his previous manners which hitherto had seemed bashful homely and awkward  halberts dress was certainly not of that description which sets off to the best advantage a presence of itself prepossessing his jerkin and hose were of coarse rustic cloth and his cap of the same a belt round his waist served at once to sustain the broadsword which we have already mentioned and to hold five or six arrows and birdbolts which were stuck into it on the right side along with a large knife hilted with buckhorn or as it was then called a dudgeondagger to complete his dress we must notice his loose buskins of deers hide formed so as to draw up on the leg as high as the knee or at pleasure to be thrust down lower than the calves these were generally used at the period by such as either had their principal occupation or their chief pleasure in silvan sports as they served to protect the legs against the rough and tangled thickets into which the pursuit of game frequently led themand these trifling particulars complete his external appearance  it is not easy to do justice to the manner in which young glendinnings soul spoke through his eyes when ushered so suddenly into the company of those whom his earliest education had taught him to treat with awe and reverence the degree of embarrassment which his demeanor evinced had nothing in it either meanly servile or utterly disconcerted it was no more than became a generous and ingenuous youth of a bold spirit but totally inexperienced who should for the first time be called upon to think and act for himself in such society and under such disadvantageous circumstances  there was not in his carriage a grain either of forwardness or of timidity which a friend could have wished away  he kneeled and kissed the abbots hand then rose and retiring two paces bowed respectfully to the circle around smiling gently as he received an encouraging nod from the subprior to whom alone he was personally known and blushing as he encountered the anxious look of mary avenel who beheld with painful interest the sort of ordeal to which her fosterbrother was about to be subjected recovering from the transient flurry of spirits into which the encounter of her glance had thrown him he stood composedly awaiting till the abbot should express his pleasure  the ingenuous expression of countenance noble form and graceful attitude of the young man failed not to prepossess in his favor the churchmen in whose presence he stood the abbot looked round and exchanged a gracious and approving glance with his counsellor father eustace although probably the appointment of a ranger or bowbearer was one in which he might have been disposed to proceed without the subpriors advice were it but to show his own free agency but the good mien of the young man now in nomination was such that he rather hastened to exchange congratulation on meeting with so proper a subject of promotion than to indulge any other feeling father eustace enjoyed the pleasure which a wellconstituted mind derives from seeing a benefit light on a deserving object for as he had not seen halbert since circumstances had made so material a change in his manner and feelings he scarce doubted that the proffered appointment would notwithstanding his mothers uncertainty suit the disposition of a youth who had appeared devoted to woodland sports and a foe alike to sedentary or settled occupation of any kind the refectioner and kitchener were so well pleased with halberts prepossessing appearance that they seemed to think that the salary emoluments and perquisites the dole the grazing the gown and the galligaskins could scarce be better bestowed than on the active and graceful figure before them  sir piercie shafton whether from being more deeply engaged in his own cogitations or that the subject was unworthy of his notice did not seem to partake of the general feeling of approbation excited by the young mans presence he sate with his eyes half shut and his arms folded appearing to be wrapped in contemplations of a nature deeper than those arising out of the scene before him but notwithstanding his seeming abstraction and absence of mind there was a flutter of vanity in sir piercies very handsome countenance an occasional change of posture from one striking attitude or what he conceived to be such to another and an occasional stolen glance at the female part of the company to spy how far he succeeded in riveting their attention which gave a marked advantage in comparison to the less regular and more harsh features of halbert glendinning with their composed manly and deliberate expression of mental fortitude  of the females belonging to the family of glendearg the millers daughter alone had her mind sufficiently at leisure to admire from time to time the graceful attitudes of sir piercie shafton for both mary avenel and dame glendinning were waiting in anxiety and apprehension the answer which halbert was to return to the abbots proposal and fearfully anticipating the consequences of his probable refusal the conduct of his brother edward for a lad constitutionally shy respectful and even timid was at once affectionate and noble this younger son of dame elspeth had stood unnoticed in a corner after the abbot at the request of the subprior had honoured him with some passing notice and asked him a few commonplace questions about his progress in donatus and in the promptuarium parvulorum without waiting for the answers from his corner he now glided round to his brothers side and keeping a little behind him slid his right hand into the huntsmans left and by a gentle pressure which halbert instantly and ardently returned expressed at once his interest in his situation and his resolution to share his fate  the group was thus arranged when after the pause of two or three minutes which he employed in slowly sipping his cup of wine in order that he might enter on his proposal with due and deliberate dignity the abbot at length expressed himself thus  my sonwe your lawful superior and the abbot under gods favour of the community of saint marys have heard of your manifold good giftsahemespecially touching woodcraftand the huntsmanlike fashion in which you strike your game truly and as a yeoman should not abusing heavens good benefits by spoiling the flesh as is too often seen in careless rangersahem he made here a pause but observing that glendinning only replied to his compliment by a bow he proceededmy son we commend your modesty nevertheless we will that thou shouldst speak freely to us touching that which we have premeditated for thine advancement meaning to confer on thee the office of bowbearer and ranger as well over the chases and forests wherein our house hath privilege by the gifts of pious kings and nobles whose souls now enjoy the fruits of their bounties to the church as to those which belong to us in exclusive right of property and perpetuity thy knee my sonthat we may with our own hand and without loss of time induct thee into office  kneel down said the kitchener on the one side and kneel down said the refectioner on the other  but halbert glendinning remained standing  were it to show gratitude and goodwill for your reverend lordships noble offer i could not he said kneel low enough or remain long enough kneeling but i may not kneel to take investure of your noble gift my lord abbot being a man determined to seek my fortune otherwise  how is that sir said the abbot knitting his brows do i hear you speak aright and do you a born vassal of the halidome at the moment when i am destining to you such a noble expression of my goodwill propose exchanging my service for that of any other  my lord said halbert glendinning it grieves me to think you hold me capable of undervaluing your gracious offer or of exchanging your service for another but your noble proffer doth but hasten the execution of a determination which i have long since formed  ay my son said the abbot is it indeed soright early have you learned to form resolutions without consulting those on whom you naturally depend but what may it be this sagacious resolution if i may so far pray you  to yield up to my brother and mother answered halbert mine interest in the fief of glendearg lately possessed by my father simon glendinning and having prayed your lordship to be the same kind and generous master to them that your predecessors the venerable abbots of saint marys have been to my fathers in times past for myself i am determined to seek my fortune where i may best find it  dame glendinning here ventured emboldened by maternal anxiety to break silence with an exclamation of o my son edward clinging to his brothers side half spoke half whispered a similar ejaculation of brother brother  the subprior took up the matter in a tone of grave reprehension which as he conceived the interest he had always taken in the family at glendearg required at his hand  wilful young man he said what folly can urge thee to push back the hand that is stretched out to aid thee what visionary aim hast thou before thee that can compensate for the decent and sufficient independence which thou art now rejecting with scorn  four marks by the year duly and truly said the kitchener  cowsgrass doublet and galligaskins responded the refectioner  peace my brethren said the subprior and may it please your lordship venerable father upon my petition to allow this headstrong youth a day for consideration and it shall be my part so to indoctrinate him as to convince him what is due on this occasion to your lordship and to his family and to himself  your kindness reverend father said the youth craves my dearest thanksit is the continuance of a long train of benevolence towards me for which i give you my gratitude for i have nothing else to offer it is my mishap not your fault that your intentions have been frustrated but my present resolution is fixed and unalterable i cannot accept the generous offer of the lord abbot my fate calls me elsewhere to scenes where i shall end it or mend it  by our lady said the abbot i think the youth be mad indeedor that you sir piercie judged of him most truly when you prophesied that he would prove unfit for the promotion we designed himit may be you knew something of this wayward humour before  by the mass not i answered sir piercie shafton with his usual indifference i but judged of him by his birth and breeding for seldom doth a good hawk come out of a kites egg  thou art thyself a kite and kestrel to boot replied halbert glendinning without a moments hesitation  this in our presence and to a man of worship said the abbot the blood rushing to his face  yes my lord answered the youth even in your presence i return to this gay mans face the causeless dishonourwhich he has flung on my name my brave father who fell in the cause of his country demands that justice at the hands of his son  unmannered boy said the abbot  nay my good lord said the knight praying pardon for the coarse interruption let me entreat you not to be wroth with this rusticalcredit me the north wind shall as soon puff one of your rocks from its basis as aught which i hold so slight and inconsiderate as the churlish speech of an untaught churl shall move the spleen of piercie shafton  proud as you are sir knight said halbert in your imagined superiority be not too confident that you cannot be moved  faith by nothing that thou canst urge said sir piercie  knowest thou then this token said young glendinning offering to him the silver bodkin he had received from the white lady  never was such an instant change from the most contemptuous serenity to the most furious state of passion as that which sir piercie shafton exhibited it was the difference between a cannon lying quiet in its embrasure and the same gun when touched by the linstock he started up every limb quivering with rage and his features so inflamed and agitated by passion that he more resembled a demoniac than a man under the regulation of reason he clenched both his fists and thrusting them forward offered them furiously at the face of glendinning who was even himself startled at the frantic state of excitation which his action had occasioned  the next moment he withdrew them struck his open palm against his own forehead and rushed out of the room in a state of indescribable agitation  the whole matter had been so sudden that no person present had time to interfere  when sir piercie shafton had left the apartment there was a moments pause of astonishment and then a general demand that halbert glendinning should instantly explain by what means he had produced such a violent change in the deportment of the english cavalier  i did nought to him answered halbert glendinning but what you all sawam i to answer for his fantastic freaks of humour  boy said the abbot in his most authoritative manner these subterfuges shall not avail thee this is not a man to be driven from his temperament without some sufficient cause that cause was given by thee and must have been known to thee i command thee as thou wilt save thyself from worse measure to explain to me by what means thou hast moved our friend thuswe choose not that our vassals shall drive our guests mad in our very presence and we remain ignorant of the means whereby that purpose is effected  so may it please your reverence i did but show him this token said halbert glendinning delivering it at the same time to the abbot who looked at it with much attention and then shaking his head gravely delivered it to the subprior without speaking a word  father eustace looked at the mysterious token with some attention and then addressing halbert in a stern and severe voice said young man if thou wouldst not have us suspect thee of some strange doubledealing in this matter let us instantly know whence thou hadst this token and how it possesses an influence on sir piercie shaftonit would have been extremely difficult for halbert thus hard pressed to have either evaded or answered so puzzling a question to have avowed the truth might in those times have occasioned his being burnt at a stake although in ours his confession would have only gained for him the credit of a liar beyond all rational credibility he was fortunately relieved by the return of sir piercie shafton himself whose ear caught as he entered the sound of the subpriors question  without waiting until halbert glendinning replied he came forward whispering to him as he passed be secretthou shalt have the satisfaction thou hast dared to seek for  when he returned to his place there were still marks of discomposure on his brow but becoming apparently collected and calm he looked around him and apologized for the indecorum of which he had been guilty which he ascribed to sudden and severe indisposition all were silent and looked on each other with some surprise  the lord abbot gave orders for all to retire from the apartment save himself sir piercie shafton and the subprior and have an eye he added on that bold youth that he escape not for if he hath practised by charm or otherwise on the health of our worshipful guest i swear by the alb and mitre which i wear that his punishment shall be most exemplary  my lord and venerable father said halbert bowing respectfully fear not but that i will abide my doom i think you will best learn from the worshipful knight himself what is the cause of his distemperature and how slight my share in it has been  be assured said the knight without looking up however while he spoke i will satisfy the lord abbot  with these words the company retired and with them young glendinning when the abbot the subprior and the english knight were left alone father eustace contrary to his custom could not help speaking the first expound unto us noble sir he said by what mysterious means the production of this simple toy could so far move your spirit and overcome your patience after you had shown yourself proof to all the provocation offered by this selfsufficient and singular youth  the knight took the silver bodkin from the good fathers hand looked at it with great composure and having examined it all over returned it to the subprior saying at the same time in truth venerable father i cannot but marvel that the wisdom implied alike in your silver hairs and in your eminent rank should like a babbling hound excuse the similitude open thus loudly on a false scent i were indeed more slight to be moved than the leaves of the aspentree which wag at the least breath of heaven could i be touched by such a trifle as this which in no way concerns me more than if the same quantity of silver were stricken into so many groats truth is that from my youth upward i have been subjected to such a malady as you saw me visited with even nowa cruel and searching pain which goeth through nerve and bone even as a good brand in the hands of a brave soldier sheers through limb and sinewbut it passes away speedily as you yourselves may judge  still said the subprior this will not account for the youth offering to you this piece of silver as a token by which you were to understand something and as we must needs conjecture something disagreeable  your reverence is to conjecture what you will said sir piercie but i cannot pretend to lay your judgment on the right scent when i see it at fault i hope i am not liable to be called upon to account for the foolish actions of a malapert boy  assuredly said the subprior we shall prosecute no inquiry which is disagreeable to our guest nevertheless said he looking to his superior this chance may in some sort alter the plan your lordship had formed for your worshipful guests residence for a brief term in this tower as a place alike of secrecy and of security both of which in the terms which we now stand on with england are circumstances to be desired  in truth said the abbot and the doubt is well thought on were it as well removed for i scarce know in the halidome so fitting a place of refuge yet see i not how to recommend it to our worshipful guest considering the unrestrained petulance of this headstrong youth  tush reverend sirswhat would you make of me said sir piercie shafton i protest by mine honour i would abide in this house were i to choose what i take no exceptions at the youth for showing a flash of spirit though the spark may light on mine own head i honour the lad for it i protest i will abide here and he shall aid me in striking down a deer i must needs be friends with him and he be such a shot and we will speedily send down to my lord abbot a buck of the first head killed so artificially as shall satisfy even the reverend kitchener  this was said with such apparent ease and goodhumour that the abbot made no farther observation on what had passed but proceeded to acquaint his guest with the details of furniture hangings provisions and so forth which he proposed to send up to the tower of glendearg for his accommodation this discourse seasoned with a cup or two of wine served to prolong the time until the reverend abbot ordered his cavalcade to prepare for their return to the monastery  as we have he said in the course of this our toilsome journey lost our meridian footnote the hour of repose at noon which in the middle ages was employed in slumber and which the monastic rules of nocturnal vigils rendered necessary indulgence shall be given to those of our attendants who shall from very weariness be unable to attend the duty at prime footnote prime was the midnight service of the monks and this by way of misericord or indulgentia footnote misericord according to the learned work of fosbrooke on british monachism meant not only an indulgence or exoneration from particular duties but also a particular apartment in a convent where the monks assembled to enjoy such indulgences or allowances as were granted beyond the rule  having benevolently intimated a boon to his faithful followers which he probably judged would be far from unacceptable the good abbot seeing all ready for his journey bestowed his blessing on the assembled householdgave his hand to be kissed by dame glendinninghimself kissed the cheek of mary avenel and even of the millers maiden when they approached to render him the same homagecommanded halbert to rule his temper and to be aiding and obedient in all things to the english knightadmonished edward to be discipulus impiger atque strenuusthen took a courteous farewell of sir piercie shafton advising him to lie close for fear of the english borderers who might be employed to kidnap him and having discharged these various offices of courtesy moved forth to the courtyard followed by the whole establishment here with a heavy sigh approaching to a groan the venerable father heaved himself upon his palfrey whose dark purple housings swept the ground and greatly comforted that the discretion of the animals pace would be no longer disturbed by the gambadoes of sir piercie and his prancing warhorse he set forth at a sober and steady trot upon his return to the monastery  when the subprior had mounted to accompany his principal his eye sought out halbert who partly hidden by a projection of the outward wall of the court stood apart from and gazing upon the departing cavalcade and the group which assembled around them unsatisfied with the explanation he had received concerning the mysterious transaction of the silver bodkin yet interesting himself in the youth of whose character he had formed a favourable idea the worthy monk resolved to take an early opportunity of investigating that matter in the meanwhile he looked upon halbert with a serious and warning aspect and held up his finger to him as he signed farewell he then joined the rest of the churchmen and followed his superior down the valley     chapter the twentieth     i hope youll give me cause to think you noble   and do me right with your sword sir as becomes   one gentleman of honour to another    all this is fair sirlet us make no days ont   ill lead your way  loves pilgrimage  the look and sign of warning which the subprior gave to halbert glendinning as they parted went to his heart for although he had profited much less than edward by the good mans instructions he had a sincere reverence for his person and even the short time he had for deliberation tended to show him he was embarked in a perilous adventure the nature of the provocation which he had given to sir piercie shafton he could not even conjecture but he saw that it was of a mortal quality and he was now to abide the consequences  that he might not force these consequences forward by any premature renewal of their quarrel he resolved to walk apart for an hour and consider on what terms he was to meet this haughty foreigner the time seemed propitious for his doing so without having the appearance of wilfully shunning the stranger as all the members of the little household were dispersing either to perform such tasks as had been interrupted by the arrival of the dignitaries or to put in order what had been deranged by their visit  leaving the tower therefore and descending unobserved as he thought the knoll on which it stood halbert gained the little piece of level ground which extended betwixt the descent of the hill and the first sweep made by the brook after washing the foot of the eminence on which the tower was situated where a few straggling birch and oaktrees served to secure him from observation but scarcely had he reached the spot when he was surprised to feel a smart tap upon the shoulder and turning around he perceived he had been closely followed by sir piercie shafton  when whether from our state of animal spirits want of confidence in the justice of our cause or any other motive our own courage happens to be in a wavering condition nothing tends so much altogether to disconcert us as a great appearance of promptitude on the part of our antagonist  halbert glendinning both morally and constitutionally intrepid was nevertheless somewhat troubled at seeing the stranger whose resentment he had provoked appear at once before him and with an aspect which boded hostility but though his heart might beat somewhat thicker he was too highspirited to exhibit any external signs of emotionwhat is your pleasure sir piercie he said to the english knight enduring without apparent discomposure all the terrors which his antagonist had summoned into his aspect  what is my pleasure answered sir piercie a goodly question after the part you have acted towards meyoung man i know not what infatuation has led thee to place thyself in direct and insolent opposition to one who is a guest of thy liegelord the abbot and who even from the courtesy due to thy mothers roof had a right to remain there without meeting insult neither do i ask or care by what means thou hast become possessed of the fatal secret by which thou hast dared to offer me open shame but i must now tell thee that the possession of it has cost thee thy life  not i trust if my hand and sword can defend it replied halbert boldly  true said the englishman i mean not to deprive thee of thy fair chance of selfdefence i am only sorry to think that young and countrybred as thou art it can but little avail thee but thou must be well aware that in this quarrel i shall use no terms of quarter  rely on it proud man answered the youth that i shall ask none and although thou speakest as if i lay already at thy feet trust me that as i am determined never to ask thy mercy so i am not fearful of needing it  thou wilt then said the knight do nothing to avert the certain fate which thou hast provoked with such wantonness  and how were that to be purchased replied halbert glendinning more with the wish of obtaining some farther insight into the terms on which he stood with this stranger than to make him the submission which he might require  explain to me instantly said sir piercie without equivocation or delay by what means thou wert enabled to wound my honour so deeplyand shouldst thou point out to me by so doing an enemy more worthy of my resentment i will permit thine own obscure insignificance to draw a veil over thine insolence  this is too high a flight said glendinning fiercely for thine own presumption to soar without being checked thou hast come to my fathers house as well as i can guess a fugitive and an exile and thy first greeting to its inhabitants has been that of contempt and injury by what means i have been able to retort that contempt let thine own conscience tell thee enough for me that i stand on the privilege of a free scotchman and will brook no insult unreturned and no injury unrequited  it is well then said sir piercie shafton we will dispute this matter tomorrow morning with our swords let the time be daybreak and do thou assign the place we will go forth as if to strike a deer  content replied halbert glendinning i will guide thee to a spot where an hundred men might fight and fall without any chance of interruption  it is well answered sir piercie shafton here then we partmany will say that in thus indulging the right of a gentleman to the son of a clodbreaking peasant i derogate from my sphere even as the blessed sun would derogate should he condescend to compare and match his golden beams with the twinkle of a pale blinking expiring grossfed taper but no consideration of rank shall prevent my avenging the insult thou hast offered me we bear a smooth face observe me sir villagio before the worshipful inmates of yonder cabin and tomorrow we try conclusions with our swords so saying he turned away towards the tower  it may not be unworthy of notice that in the last speech only had sir piercie used some of those flowers of rhetoric which characterized the usual style of his conversation apparently a sense of wounded honour and the deep desire of vindicating his injured feelings had proved too strong for the fantastic affectation of his acquired habits indeed such is usually the influence of energy of mind when called forth and exerted that sir piercie shafton had never appeared in the eyes of his youthful antagonist half so much deserving of esteem and respect as in this brief dialogue by which they exchanged mutual defiance as he followed him slowly to the tower he could not help thinking to himself that had the english knight always displayed this superior tone of bearing and feeling he would not probably have felt so earnestly disposed to take offence at his hand mortal offence however had been exchanged and the matter was to be put to mortal arbitrement  the family met at the evening meal when sir piercie shafton extended the benignity of his countenance and the graces of his conversation far more generally over the party than he had hitherto condescended to do the greater part of his attention was of course still engrossed by his divine inimitable discretion as he chose to term mary avenel but nevertheless there were interjectional flourishes to the maid of the mill under the title of comely damsel and to the dame under that of worthy matron  nay lest he should fail to excite their admiration by the graces of his rhetoric he generously and without solicitation added those of his voice and after regretting bitterly the absence of his violdegamba he regaled them with a song which said he the inimitable astrophel whom mortals call philip sidney composed in the nonage of his muse to show the world what they are to expect from his riper years and which will one day see the light in that nottobeparalleled perfection of human wit which he has addressed to his sister the matchless parthenope whom men call countess of pembroke a work he continued whereof his friendship hath permitted me though unworthy to be an occasional partaker and whereof i may well say that the deep afflictive tale which awakeneth our sorrows is so relieved with brilliant similitudes dulcet descriptions pleasant poems and engaging interludes that they seem as the stars of the firmament beautifying the dusky robe of night  and though i wot well how much the lovely and quaint language will suffer by my widowed voice widowed in that it is no longer matched by my beloved violdegamba i will essay to give you a taste of the ravishing sweetness of the poesy of the untobeimitated astrophel  so saying he sung without mercy or remorse about five hundred verses of which the two first and the four last may suffice for a specimen    what tongue can her perfections tell   on whose each part all pens may dwell    of whose high praise arid praiseful bliss   goodness the pen heaven paper is   the ink immortal fame doth send   as i began so i must end  as sir piercie shafton always sung with his eyes half shut it was not until agreeably to the promise of poetry he had fairly made an end that looking round he discovered that the greater part of his audience had in the meanwhile yielded to the charms of repose mary avenel indeed from a natural sense of politeness had contrived to keep awake through all the perplexities of the divine astrophel but mysie was transported in dreams back to the dusty atmosphere of her fathers mill edward himself who had given his attention for some time had at length fallen fast asleep and the good dames nose could its tones have been put in regulation might have supplied the bass of the lamented violdegamba halbert however who had no temptation to give way to the charms of slumber remained awake with his eyes fixed on the songster not that he was better entertained with the words or more ravished with the execution than the rest of the company but rather because he admired or perhaps envied the composure which could thus spend the evening in interminable madrigals when the next morning was to be devoted to deadly combat yet it struck his natural acuteness of observation that the eye of the gallant cavalier did now and then furtively as it were seek a glance of his countenance as if to discover how he was taking the exhibition of his antagonists composure and serenity of mind  he shall read nothing in my countenance thought halbert proudly that can make him think my indifference less than his own  and taking from the shelf a bag full of miscellaneous matters collected for the purpose he began with great industry to dress hooks and had finished halfadozen of flies we are enabled for the benefit of those who admire the antiquities of the gentle art of angling to state that they were brown hackles by the time that sir piercie had arrived at the conclusion of his longwinded strophes of the divine astrophel so that he also testified a magnanimous contempt of that which tomorrow should bring forth  as it now waxed late the family of glendearg separated for the evening sir piercie first saying to the dame that her son albert  halbert said elspeth with emphasis halbert after his goodsire halbert brydone  well then i have prayed your son halbert that we may strive tomorrow with the suns earliness to wake a stag from his lair that i may see whether he be as prompt at that sport as fame bespeaks him  alas sir answered dame elspeth he is but too prompt an you talk of promptitude at any thing that has steel at one end of it and mischief at the other but he is at your honourable disposal and i trust you will teach him how obedience is due to our venerable father and lord the abbot and prevail with him to take the bowbearers place in fee for as the two worthy monks said it will be a great help to a widowwoman  trust me good dame replied sir piercie it is my purpose so to indoctrinate him touching his conduct and bearing towards his betters that he shall not lightly depart from the reverence due to themwe meet then beneath the birchtrees in the plain he said looking to halbert so soon as the eye of day hath opened its lidshalbert answered with a sign of acquiescence and the knight proceeded and now having wished to my fairest discretion those pleasant dreams which wave their pinions around the couch of sleeping beauty and to this comely damsel the bounties of morpheus and to all others the common goodnight i will crave you leave to depart to my place of rest though i may say with the poet    ah restno rest but change of place and posture   ah sleepno sleep but wornout natures swooning   ah bedno bed but cushion filld with stones   rest sleep nor bed await not on an exile  with a delicate obeisance he left the room evading dame glendinning who hastened to assure him he would find his accommodations for repose much more agreeable than they had been the night before there having been store of warm coverlets and a soft featherbed sent up from the abbey  but the good knight probably thought that the grace and effect of his exit would be diminished if he were recalled from his heroics to discuss such sublunary and domestic topics and therefore hastened away without waiting to hear her out  a pleasant gentleman said dame glendinning but i will warrant him an humorous footnote humorousfull of whimsthus shakspeare humorous as winterthe vulgar word humorsome comes nearest to the meaningand sings a sweet song though it is somewhat of the longestwell i make mine avow he is goodly companyi wonder when he will go away  having thus expressed her respect for her guest not without intimation that she was heartily tired of his company the good dame gave the signal for the family to disperse and laid her injunctions on halbert to attend sir piercie shafton at daybreak as he required  when stretched on his pallet by his brothers side halbert had no small cause to envy the sound sleep which instantly settled on the eyes of edward but refused him any share of its influence he saw now too well what the spirit had darkly indicated that in granting the boon which he had asked so unadvisedly she had contributed more to his harm than his good he was now sensible too late of the various dangers and inconveniences with which his dearest friends were threatened alike by his discomfiture or his success in the approaching duel if he fell he might say personally goodnight all but it was not the less certain that he should leave a dreadful legacy of distress and embarrassment to his mother and familyan anticipation which by no means tended to render the front of death in itself a grisly object more agreeable to his imagination the vengeance of the abbot his conscience told him was sure to descend on his mother and brother or could only be averted by the generosity of the victorand mary avenelhe should have shown himself if he succumbed in the present combat as inefficient in protecting her as he had been unnecessarily active in bringing disaster on her and on the house in which she had been protected from infancy and to this view of the case were to be added all those imbittered and anxious feelings with which the bravest men even in a better or less doubtful quarrel regard the issue of a dubious conflict the first time when it has been their fate to engage in an affair of that nature  but however disconsolate the prospect seemed in the event of his being conquered halbert could expect from victory little more than the safety of his own life and the gratification of his wounded pride to his friendsto his mother and brotherespecially to mary avenelthe consequences of his triumph would be more certain destruction than the contingency of his defeat and death if the english knight survived he might in courtesy extend his protection to them but if he fell nothing was likely to screen them from the vindictive measures which the abbot and convent would surely adopt against the violation of the peace of the halidome and the slaughter of a protected guest by one of their own vassals within whose house they had lodged him for shelter these thoughts in which neither view of the case augured aught short of ruin to his family and that ruin entirely brought on by his own rashness were thorns in halbert glendinnings pillow and deprived his soul of peace and his eyes of slumber  there appeared no middle course saving one which was marked by degradation and which even if he stooped to it was by no means free of danger  he might indeed confess to the english knight the strange circumstances which led to his presenting him with that token which the white lady in her displeasure as it now seemed had given him that he might offer it to sir piercie shafton but to this avowal his pride could not stoop and reason who is wonderfully ready to be of counsel with pride on such occasions offered many arguments to show it would be useless as well as mean so far to degrade himself if i tell a tale so wonderful thought he shall i not either be stigmatized as a liar or punished as a wizardwere sir piercie shafton generous noble and benevolent as the champions of whom we hear in romance i might indeed gain his ear and without demeaning myself escape from the situation in which i am placed but as he is or at least seems to be selfconceited arrogant vain and presumptuousi should but humble myself in vainand i will not humble myself he said starting out of bed grasping his broadsword and brandishing it in the light of the moon which streamed through the deep niche that served them as a window when to his extreme surprise and terror an airy form stood in the moonlight but intercepted not the reflection on the floor dimly as it was expressed the sound of the voice soon made him sensible he saw the white lady  at no time had her presence seemed so terrific to him for when he had invoked her it was with the expectation of the apparition and the determination to abide the issue but now she had come uncalled and her presence impressed him with a sense of approaching misfortune and with the hideous apprehension that he had associated himself with a demon over whose motions he had no control and of whose powers and quality he had no certain knowledge he remained therefore in mere terror gazing on the apparition which chanted or recited in cadence the following lines    he whose heart for vengeance sued   must not shrink from shedding blood   the knot that thou hast tied with word   thou must loose by edge of sword  avaunt thee false spirit said halbert glendinning i have bought thy advice too dearly alreadybegone in the name of god  the spirit laughed and the cold unnatural sound of her laughter had something in it more fearful than the usually melancholy tones of her voice she then replied    you have summond me onceyou have summoned me twice   and without eer a summons i come to you thrice   unaskd for unsued for you came to my glen   unsued and unaskd i am with you again  halbert glendinning gave way for a moment to terror and called on his brother edward waken waken for our ladys sake  edward awaked accordingly and asked what he wanted  look out said halbert look up seest thou no one in the room  no upon my good word said edward looking out  what seest thou nothing in the moonshine upon the floor there  no nothing answered edward save thyself resting on thy naked sword i tell thee halbert thou shouldst trust more to thy spiritual arms and less to those of steel and iron for this many a night hast thou started and moaned and cried out of fighting and of spectres and of goblinsthy sleep hath not refreshed theethy waking hath been a dreamcredit me dear halbert say the pater and credo resign thyself to the protection of god and thou wilt sleep sound and wake in comfort  it may be said halbert slowly and having his eye still bent on the female form which to him seemed distinctly visibleit may be but tell me dear edward seest thou no one on the chamber floor but me  no one answered edward raising himself on his elbow dear brother lay aside thy weapon say thy prayers and lay thee down to rest  while he thus spoke the spirit smiled at halbert as if in scorn her wan cheek faded in the wan moonlight even before the smile had passed away and halbert himself no longer beheld the vision to which he had so anxiously solicited his brothers attention may god preserve my wits he said as laying aside his weapon he again threw himself on his bed  amen my dearest brother answered edward but we must not provoke that heaven in our wantonness which we invoke in our miserybe not angry with me my dear brotheri know not why you have totally of late estranged yourself from meit is true i am neither so athletic in body nor so alert in courage as you have been from your infancy yet till lately you have not absolutely cast off my societybelieve me i have wept in secret though i forbore to intrude myself on your privacy the time has beenwhen you held me not so cheap andwhen if i could not follow the game so closely or mark it so truly as you i could fill up our intervals of pastime with pleasant tales of the olden times which i had read or heard and which excited even your attention as we sate and ate our provision by some pleasant springbut now i have though i know not why lost thy regard and affectionnay toss not thy arms about thee thus wildly said the younger brother from thy strange dreams i fear some touch of fever hath affected thy bloodlet me draw closer around thee thy mantle  forbear said halbertyour care is needlessyour complaints are without reasonyour fears on my account are in vain  nay but hear me brother said edward your speech in sleep and now even your waking dreams are of beings which belong not to this world or to our raceour good father eustace says that howbeit we may not do well to receive all idle tales of goblins and spectres yet there is warrant from holy scripture to believe that the fiends haunt waste and solitary places and that those who frequent such wildernesses alone are the prey or the sport of these wandering demons and therefore i pray thee brother let me go with you when you go next up the glen where as you well know there be places of evil reputationthou carest not for my escort but halbert such dangers are more safely encountered by the wise in judgment than by the bold in bosom and though i have small cause to boast of my own wisdom yet i have that which ariseth from the written knowledge of elder times  there was a moment during this discourse when halbert had wellnigh come to the resolution of disburdening his own breast by intrusting edward with all that weighed upon it but when his brother reminded him that this was the morning of a high holiday and that setting aside all other business or pleasure he ought to go to the monastery and shrive himself before father eustace who would that day occupy the confessional pride stepped in and confirmed his wavering resolution i will not avow he thought a tale so extraordinary that i may be considered as an impostor or something worsei will not fly from this englishman whose arm and sword may be no better than my own my fathers have faced his betters were he as much distinguished in battle as he is by his quaint discourse  pride which has been said to save man and woman too from falling has yet a stronger influence on the mind when it embraces the cause of passion and seldom fails to render it victorious over conscience and reason halbert once determined though not to the better course at length slept soundly and was only awakened by the dawn of day                                                chapter the twentyfirst     indifferent but indifferentpshaw he doth it not   like one who is his crafts masterneer the less   i have seen a clown confer a bloody coxcomb   on one who was a master of defence                                       old play  with the first gray peep of dawn halbert glendinning arose and hastened to dress himself girded on his weapon and took a crossbow in his hand as if his usual sport had been his sole object he groped his way down the dark and winding staircase and undid with as little noise as possible the fastenings of the inner door and of the exterior iron grate  at length he stood free in the courtyard and looking up to the tower saw a signal made with a handkerchief from the window nothing doubting that it was his antagonist he paused expecting him but it was mary avenel who glided like a spirit from under the low and rugged portal  halbert was much surprised and felt he knew not why like one caught in the act of a meditated trespass the presence of mary avenel had till that moment never given him pain she spoke too in a tone where sorrow seemed to mingle with reproach while she asked him with emphasis what he was about to do  he showed his crossbow and was about to express the pretext he had meditated when mary interrupted him  not so halbertthat evasion were unworthy of one whose word has hitherto been truth you meditate not the destruction of the deeryour hand and your heart are aimed at other gameyou seek to do battle with this stranger  and wherefore should i quarrel with our guest answered halbert blushing deeply  there are indeed many reasons why you should not replied the maiden nor is there one of avail wherefore you shouldyet nevertheless such a quarrel you are now searching after  why should you suppose so mary said halbert endeavouring to hide his conscious purposehe is my mothers guesthe is protected by the abbot and the community who are our mastershe is of high degree alsoand wherefore should you think that i can or dare resent a hasty word which he has perchance thrown out against me more from the wantonness of his wit than the purpose of his heart  alas answered the maiden the very asking that question puts your resolution beyond a doubt since your childhood you were ever daring seeking danger rather than avoiding itdelighting in whatever had the air of adventure and of courage and it is not from fear that you will now blench from your purposeoh let it then be from pityfrom pity halbert to your aged mother whom your death or victory will alike deprive of the comfort and stay of her age  she has my brother edward said halbert turning suddenly from her  she has indeed said mary avenel the calm the nobleminded the considerate edward who has thy courage halbert without thy fiery rashnessthy generous spirit with more of reason to guide it he would not have heard his mother would not have heard his adopted sister beseech him in vain not to ruin himself and tear up their future hopes of happiness and protection  halberts heart swelled as he replied to this reproach wellwhat avails it speakingyou have him that is better than mewiser more consideratebraver for aught i knowyou are provided with a protector and need care no more for me  again he turned to depart but mary avenel laid her hand on his arm so gently that he scarce felt her hold yet felt that it was impossible for him to strike it off there he stood one foot advanced to leave the courtyard but so little determined on departure that he resembled a traveller arrested by the spell of a magician and unable either to quit the attitude of motion or to proceed on his course  mary avenel availed herself of his state of suspense hear me she said hear me halberti am an orphan and even heaven hears the orphani have been the companion of your infancy and if you will not hear me for an instant from whom may mary avenel claim so poor a boon  i hear you said halbert glendinning but be brief dear maryyou mistake the nature of my businessit is but a morning of summer sport which we propose  say not thus said the maiden interrupting him say not thus to me others thou mayst deceive but me thou canst notthere has been that in me from the earliest youth which fraud flies from and which imposture cannot deceive for what fate has given me such a power i know not but bred an ignorant maiden in this sequestered valley mine eyes can too often see what man would most willingly hidei can judge of the dark purpose though it is hid under the smiling brow and a glance of the eye says more to me than oaths and protestations do to others  then said halbert if thou canst so read the human heartsay dear marywhat dost thou see in minetell me thatsay that what thou seestwhat thou readest in this bosom does not offend theesay but that and thou shalt be the guide of my actions and mould me now and henceforward to honour or to dishonour at thy own free will  mary avenel became first red and then deadly pale as halbert glendinning spoke but when turning round at the close of his address he took her hand she gently withdrew it and replied i cannot read the heart halbert and i would not of my will know aught of yours save what beseems us bothi only can judge of signs words and actions of little outward import more truly than those around me as my eyes thou knowest have seen objects not presented to those of others  let them gaze then on one whom they shall never see more said halbert once more turning from her and rushing out of the courtyard without again looking back  mary avenel gave a faint scream and clasped both her hands firmly on her forehead and eyes she had been a minute in this attitude when she was thus greeted by a voice from behind generously done my most clement discretion to hide those brilliant eyes from the far inferior beams which even now begin to gild the eastern horizoncertes peril there were that phoebus outshone in splendour might in very shamefacedness turn back his ear and rather leave the world in darkness than incur the disgrace of such an encountercredit me lovely discretion  but as sir piercie shafton the reader will readily set down these flowers of eloquence to the proper owner attempted to take mary avenels hand in order to proceed in his speech she shook him abruptly off and regarding him with an eye which evinced terror and agitation rushed past him into the tower  the knight stood looking after her with a countenance in which contempt was strongly mingled with mortification by my knighthood he ejaculated i have thrown away upon this rude rustic phidel a speech which the proudest beauty at the court of felicia so let me call the elysium from which i am banished might have termed the very matins of cupid hard and inexorable was the fate that sent thee thither piercie shafton to waste thy wit upon country wenches and thy valour upon hobnailed clowns  but that insultthat affronthad it been offered to me by the lowest plebeian he must have died for it by my hand in respect the enormity of the offence doth countervail the inequality of him by whom it is given i trust i shall find this clownish roisterer not less willing to deal in blows than in taunts  while he held this conversation with himself sir piercie shafton was hastening to the little tuft of birchtrees which had been assigned as the place of meeting he greeted his antagonist with a courtly salutation followed by this commentary i pray you to observe that i doff my hat to you though so much my inferior in rank without derogation on my part inasmuch as my having so far honoured you in receiving and admitting your defiance doth in the judgment of the best martialists in some sort and for the time raise you to a level with mean honour which you may and ought to account cheaply purchased even with the loss of your life if such should chance to be the issue of this duello  for which condescension said halbert i have to thank the token which i presented to you  the knight changed colour and grinded his teeth with ragedraw your weapon said he to glendinning  not in this spot answered the youth we should be liable to interruptionfollow me and i will bring you to a place where we shall encounter no such risk  he proceeded to walk up the glen resolving that their place of combat should be in the entrance of the corrinanshian both because the spot lying under the reputation of being haunted was very little frequented and also because he regarded it as a place which to him might be termed fated and which he therefore resolved should witness his death or victory  they walked up the glen for some time in silence like honourable enemies who did not wish to contend with words and who had nothing friendly to exchange with each other silence however was always an irksome state with sir piercie and moreover his anger was usually a hasty and shortlived passion as therefore he went forth in his own idea in all love and honour towards his antagonist he saw not any cause for submitting longer to the painful restraint of positive silence he began by complimenting halbert on the alert activity with which he surmounted the obstacles and impediments of the way  trust me said he worthy rustic we have not a lighter or a firmer step in our courtlike revels and if duly set forth by a silk hose and trained unto that stately exercise your leg would make an indifferent good show in a pavin or a galliard and i doubt nothing he added that you have availed yourself of some opportunity to improve yourself in the art of fence which is more akin than dancing to our present purpose  i know nothing more of fencing said halbert than hath been taught me by an old shepherd of ours called martin and at whiles a lesson from christie of the clinthillfor the rest i must trust to good sword strong arm and sound heart  marry and i am glad of it young audacity i will call you my audacity and you will call me your condescension while we are on these terms of unnatural equality i am glad of your ignorance with all my heart for we martialists proportion the punishments which we inflict upon our opposites to the length and hazard of the efforts wherewith they oppose themselves to us and i see not why you being but a tyro may not be held sufficiently punished for your outrecuidance and orgillous presumption by the loss of an ear an eye or even a finger accompanied by some fleshwound of depth and severity suited to your errorwhereas had you been able to stand more effectually on your defence i see not how less than your life could have atoned sufficiently for your presumption  now by god and our lady said halbert unable any longer to restrain himself thou art thyself overpresumptuous who speakest thus daringly of the issue of a combat which is not yet even begunare you a god that you already dispose of my life and limbs or are you a judge in the justiceair telling at your ease and without risk how the head and quarters of a condemned criminal are to be disposed of  not so o thouwhom i have well permitted to call thyself my audacity  i thy condescension am neither a god to judge the issue of the combat before it is fought nor a judge to dispose at my ease and in safety of the limbs and head of a condemned criminal but i am an indifferent good master of fence being the first pupil of the first master of the first school of fence that our royal england affords the said master being no other than the truly noble and allunutterably skilful vincentio saviola from whom i learned the firm step quick eye and nimble handof which qualities thou o my most rustical audacity art full like to reap the fruits so soon as we shall find a piece of ground fitting for such experiments  they had now reached the gorge of the ravine where halbert had at first intended to stop but when he observed the narrowness of the level ground he began to consider that it was only by superior agility that he could expect to make up his deficiency in the science as it was called of defence he found no spot which afforded sufficient room to traverse for this purpose until he gained the wellknown fountain by whose margin and in front of the huge rock from which it sprung was an amphitheatre of level turf of small space indeed compared with the great height of the cliffs with which it was surrounded on every point save that from which the rivulet issued forth yet large enough for their present purpose  when they had reached this spot of ground fitted well by its gloom and sequestered situation to be a scene of mortal strife both were surprised to observe that a grave was dug close by the foot of the rock with great neatness and regularity the green turf being laid down upon the one side and the earth thrown out in a heap upon the other a mattock and shovel lay by the verge of the grave  sir piercie shafton bent his eye with unusual seriousness upon halbert glendinning as he asked him sternly does this bode treason young man and have you purpose to set upon me here as in an emboscata or place of vantage  not on my part by heaven answered the youth i told no one of our purpose nor would i for the throne of scotland take odds against a single arm  i believe thou wouldst not mine audacity said the knight resuming the affected manner which was become a second nature to him nevertheless this fosse is curiously well shaped and might be the masterpiece of natures last bedmaker i would say the sextonwherefore let us be thankful to chance or some unknown friend who hath thus provided for one of us the decencies of sepulture and let us proceed to determine which shall have the advantage of enjoying this place of undisturbed slumber  so saying he stripped off his doublet and cloak which he folded up with great care and deposited upon a large stone while halbert glendinning not without some emotion followed his example their vicinity to the favourite haunt of the white lady led him to form conjectures concerning the incident of the graveit must have been her work he thought the spirit foresaw and has provided for the fatal event of the combati must return from this place a homicide or i must remain here for ever  the bridge seemed now broken down behind him and the chance of coming off honourably without killing or being killed the hope of which issue has cheered the sinking heart of many a duellist seemed now altogether to be removed yet the very desperation of his situation gave him on an instants reflection both firmness and courage and presented to him one sole alternative conquest namely or death  as we are here said sir piercie shafton unaccompanied by any patrons or seconds it were well you should pass your hands over my sides as i shall over yours not that i suspect you to use any quaint device of privy armour but in order to comply with the ancient and laudable custom practised on all such occasions  while complying with his antagonists humour halbert glendinning went through this ceremony sir piercie shafton did not fail to solicit his attention to the quality and fineness of his wrought and embroidered shirtin this very shirt said he o mine audacityi say in this very garment in which i am now to combat a scottish rustic like thyself it was my envied lot to lead the winning party at that wonderous match at ballon made betwixt the divine astrophel our matchless sidney and the right honourable my very good lord of oxford all the beauties of felicia by which name i distinguish our beloved england stood in the gallery waving their kerchiefs at each turn of the game and cheering the winners by their plaudits after which noble sport we were refreshed by a suitable banquet whereat it pleased the noble urania being the unmatched countess of pembroke to accommodate me with her fan for the cooling my somewhat too much inflamed visage to requite which courtesy i said casting my features into a smiling yet melancholy fashion o divinest urania receive again that too fatal gift which not like the zephyr cooleth but like the hot breath of the sirocco heateth yet more that which is already inflamed whereupon looking upon me somewhat scornfully yet not so but what the experienced courtier might perceive a certain cast of approbative affection  here the knight was interrupted by halbert who had waited with courteous patience for some little time till he found that far from drawing to a close sir piercie seemed rather inclined to wax prolix in his reminiscences  sir knight said the youth if this matter be not very much to the purpose we will if you object not proceed to that which we have in hand  you should have abidden in england had you desired to waste time in words for here we spend it in blows  i crave your pardon most rusticated audacity answered sir piercie truly i become oblivious of every thing beside when the recollections of the divine court of felicia press upon my wakened memory even as a saint is dazzled when he bethinks him of the beatific vision ah felicitous feliciana  delicate nurse of the fair chosen abode of the wise the birthplace and cradle of nobility the temple of courtesy the fane of sprightly chivalryah heavenly court or rather courtly heaven cheered with dances lulled asleep with harmony wakened with sprightly sports and tourneys decored with silks and tissues glittering with diamonds and jewels standing on end with doublepiled velvets satins and satinettas  the token sir knight the token exclaimed halbert glendinning who impatient of sir piercies interminable oratory reminded him of the ground of their quarrel as the best way to compel him to the purpose of their meeting  and he judged right for sir piercie shafton no sooner heard him speak than he exclaimed thy deathhour has struckbetake thee to thy swordvia  both swords were unsheathed and the combatants commenced their engagement halbert became immediately aware that as he had expected he was far inferior to his adversary in the use of his weapon sir piercie shafton had taken no more than his own share of real merit when he termed himself an absolutely good fencer and glendinning soon found that he should have great difficulty in escaping with life and honour from such a master of the sword the english knight was master of all the mystery of the stoccata imbrocata puntoreverso incartata and so forth which the italian masters of defence had lately introduced into general practice but glendinning on his part was no novice in the principles of the art according to the old scottish fashion and possessed the first of all qualities a steady and collected mind at first being desirous to try the skill and become acquainted with the play of his enemy he stood on his defence keeping his foot hand eye and body in perfect unison and holding his sword short and with the point towards his antagonists face so that sir piercie in order to assail him was obliged to make actual passes and could not avail himself of his skill in making feints while on the other hand halbert was prompt to parry these attacks either by shifting his ground or with the sword the consequence was that after two or three sharp attempts on the part of sir piercie which were evaded or disconcerted by the address of his opponent he began to assume the defensive in his turn fearful of giving some advantage by being repeatedly the assailant but halbert was too cautious to press on a swordsman whose dexterity had already more than once placed him within a hairs breadth of death which he had only escaped by uncommon watchfulness and agility  when each had made a feint or two there was a pause in the conflict both as if by one assent dropping their swords point and looking on each other for a moment without speaking at length halbert glendinning who felt perhaps more uneasy on account of his family than he had done before he had displayed his own courage and proved the strength of his antagonist could not help saying is the subject of our quarrel sir knight so mortal that one of our two bodies must needs fill up that grave or may we with honour having proved ourselves against each other sheathe our swords and depart friends  valiant and most rustical audacity said the southron knight to no man on earth could you have put a question on the code of honour who was more capable of rendering you a reason let us pause for the space of one venue until i give you my opinion on this dependence footnote dependencea phrase among the brethren of the sword for an existing quarrel for certain it is that brave men should not run upon their fate like brute and furious wild beasts but should slay each other deliberately decently and with reason  therefore if we coolly examine the state of our dependence we may the better apprehend whether the sisters three have doomed one of us to expiate the same with his blooddost thou understand me  i have heard father eustace said halbert after a moments recollection speak of the three furies with their thread and their shears  enoughenoughinterrupted sir piercie shafton crimsoning with a new fit of rage the thread of thy life is spun  and with these words he attacked with the utmost ferocity the scottish youth who had but just time to throw himself into a posture of defence  but the rash fury of the assailant as frequently happens disappointed its own purpose for as he made a desperate thrust halbert glendinning avoided it and ere the knight could recover his weapon requited him to use his own language with a resolute stoccata which passed through his body and sir piercie shafton fell to the ground                                         chapter the twentysecond     yes life hath left himevery busy thought   each fiery passion every strong affection   all sense of outward ill and inward sorrow   are fled at once from the pale trunk before me   and i have given that which spoke and moved   thought acted sufferd as a living man   to be a ghastly form of bloody clay   soon the foul food for reptiles                                         old play  i believe few successful duellists if the word successful can be applied to a superiority so fatal have beheld their dead antagonist stretched on the earth at their feet without wishing they could redeem with their own blood that which it has been their fate to spill least of all could such indifference be the lot of so young a man as halbert glendinning who unused to the sight of human blood was not only struck with sorrow but with terror when he beheld sir piercie shafton lie stretched on the greensward before him vomiting gore as if impelled by the strokes of a pump he threw his bloody sword on the ground and hastened to kneel and support him vainly striving at the same time to stanch his wound which seemed rather to bleed inwardly than externally  the unfortunate knight spoke at intervals when the syncope would permit him and his words so far as intelligible partook of his affected and conceited yet not ungenerous character  most rustical youth he said thy fortune hath prevailed over knightly skilland audacity hath overcome condescension even as the kite hath sometimes hawked at and struck down the falcongentlefly and save thyselftake my purseit is in the nether pocket of my carnationcoloured hoseand is worth a clowns acceptance see that my mails with my vestments be sent to the monastery of saint maryshere his voice grew weak and his mind and recollection seemed to waveri bestow the cut velvet jerkin with

saints and angelsknights and ladiesmasques and theatresquaint deviceschainwork and broiderylove honour and beauty  while muttering these last words which slid from him as it were unawares while doubtless he was calling to mind the glories of the english court the gallant sir piercie shafton stretched out his limbsgroaned deeply shut his eyes and became motionless  the victor tore his hair for very sorrow as he looked on the pale countenance of his victim life he thought had not utterly fled but without better aid than his own he saw not how it could be preserved  why he exclaimed in vain penitence why did i provoke him to an issue so fatal would to god i had submitted to the worst insult man could receive from man rather than be the bloody instrument of this bloody deedand doubly cursed be this evilboding spot which haunted as i knew it to be by a witch or a devil i yet chose for the place of combat in any other place save this there had been help to be gotten by speed of foot or by uplifting of voicebut here there is no one to be found by search no one to hear my shouts save the evil spirit who has counselled this mischief  it is not her houri will essay the spell howsoever and if she can give me aid she shall do it or know of what a madman is capable even against those of another world  he spurned his bloody shoe from his foot and repeated the spell with which the reader is well acquainted but there was neither voice apparition nor signal of answer the youth in the impatience of his despair and with the rash hardihood which formed the basis of his character shouted aloud witchsorceressfiendart thou deaf to my cries of help and so ready to appear and answer those of vengeance arise and speak to me or i will choke up thy fountain tear down thy hollybush and leave thy haunt as waste and bare as thy fatal assistance has made me waste of comfort and bare of counselthis furious and raving invocation was suddenly interrupted by a distant sound resembling a hollo from the gorge of the ravine now may saint mary be praised said the youth hastily fastening his sandal i hear the voice of some living man who may give me counsel and help in this fearful extremity  having donned his sandal halbert glendinning hallooing at intervals in answer to the sound which he had heard ran with the speed of a hunted buck down the rugged defile as if paradise had been before him hell and all her furies behind and his eternal happiness or misery had depended upon the speed which he exerted in a space incredibly short for any one but a scottish mountaineer having his nerves strung by the deepest and most passionate interest the youth reached the entrance of the ravine through which the rill that flows down corrinanshian discharges itself and unites with the brook that waters the little valley of glendearg  here he paused and looked around him upwards and downwards through the glen without perceiving a human form his heart sank within him but the windings of the glen intercepted his prospect and the person whose voice he had heard might therefore be at no great distance though not obvious to his sight the branches of an oaktree which shot straight out from the face of a tall cliff proffered to his bold spirit steady head and active limbs the means of ascending it as a place of outlook although the enterprise was what most men would have shrunk from but by one bound from the earth the active youth caught hold of the lower branch and swung himself up into the tree and in a minute more gained the top of the cliff from which he could easily descry a human figure descending the valley  it was not that of a shepherd or of a hunter and scarcely any others used to traverse this deserted solitude especially coming from the north since the reader may remember that the brook took its rise from an extensive and dangerous morass which lay in that direction  but halbert glendinning did not pause to consider who the traveller might be or what might be the purpose of his journey to know that he saw a human being and might receive in the extremity of his distress the countenance and advice of a fellowcreature was enough for him at the moment he threw himself from the pinnacle of the cliff once more into the arms of the projecting oaktree whose boughs waved in middle air anchored by the roots in a huge rift or chasm of the rock catching at the branch which was nearest to him he dropped himself from that height upon the ground and such was the athletic springiness of his youthful sinews that he pitched there as lightly and with as little injury as the falcon stooping from her wheel  to resume his race at full speed up the glen was the work of an instant and as he turned angle after angle of the indented banks of the valley without meeting that which he sought he became half afraid that the form which he had seen at such a distance had already melted into thin air and was either a deception of his own imagination or of the elementary spirits by which the valley was supposed to be haunted  but to his inexpressible joy as he turned round the base of a huge and distinguished crag he saw straight before and very near to him a person whose dress as he viewed it hastily resembled that of a pilgrim  he was a man of advanced life and wearing a long beard having on his head a large slouched hat without either band or brooch his dress was a tunic of black serge which like those commonly called hussarcloaks had an upper part which covered the arms and fell down on the lower a small scrip and bottle which hung at his back with a stout staff in his hand completed his equipage his step was feeble like that of one exhausted by a toilsome journey  save ye good father said the youth god and our lady have sent you to my assistance  and in what my son can so frail a creature as i am be of service to you said the old man not a little surprised at being thus accosted by so handsome a youth his features discomposed by anxiety his face flushed with exertion his hands and much of his dress stained with blood  a man bleeds to death in the valley here hard by come with mecome with me you are agedyou have experienceyou have at least your sensesand mine have well nigh left me  a manand bleeding to deathand here in this desolate spot said the stranger  stay not to question it father said the youth but come instantly to his rescue follow mefollow me without an instants delay  nay but my son said the old man we do not lightly follow the guides who present themselves thus suddenly in the bosom of a howling wilderness ere i follow thee thou must expound to me thy name thy purpose and thy cause  there is no time to expound any thing said halbert i tell thee a mans life is at stake and thou must come to aid him or i will carry thee thither by force  nay thou shalt not need said the traveller if it indeed be as thou sayest i will follow thee of freewillthe rather that i am not wholly unskilled in leechcraft and have in my scrip that which may do thy friend a serviceyet walk more slowly i pray thee for i am already wellnigh forespent with travel  with the indignant impatience of the fiery steed when compelled by his rider to keep pace with some slow drudge upon the highway halbert accompanied the wayfarer burning with anxiety which he endeavoured to subdue that he might not alarm his companion who was obviously afraid to trust him when they reached the place where they were to turn off the wider glen into the corri the traveller made a doubtful pause as if unwilling to leave the broader pathyoung man he said if thou meanest aught but good to these gray hairs thou wilt gain little by thy crueltyi have no earthly treasure to tempt either robber or murderer  and i said the youth am neitherand yetgod of heaveni may be a murderer unless your aid comes in time to this wounded wretch  is it even so said the traveller and do human passions disturb the breast of nature even in her deepest solitudeyet why should i marvel that where darkness abides the works of darkness should aboundby its fruits is the tree knownlead on unhappy youthi follow thee  and with better will to the journey than he had evinced hitherto the stranger exerted himself to the uttermost and seemed to forget his own fatigue in his efforts to keep pace with his impatient guide  what was the surprise of halbert glendinning when upon arriving at the fatal spot he saw no appearance of the body of sir piercie shafton  the traces of the fray were otherwise sufficiently visible the knights cloak had indeed vanished as well as his body but his doublet remained where he had laid it down and the turf on which he had been stretched was stained with blood in many a dark crimson spot  as he gazed round him in terror and astonishment halberts eyes fell upon the place of sepulture which had so lately appeared to gape for a victim it was no longer open and it seemed that earth had received the expected tenant for the usual narrow hillock was piled over what had lately been an open grave and the green sod was adjusted over all with the accuracy of an experienced sexton halbert stood aghast the idea rushed on his mind irresistibly that the earthheap before him enclosed what had lately been a living moving and sentient fellowcreature whom on little provocation his fell act had reduced to a clod of the valley as senseless and as cold as the turf under which he rested the hand that scooped the grave had completed its word and whose hand could it be save that of the mysterious being of doubtful quality whom his rashness had invoked and whom he had suffered to intermingle in his destinies  as he stood with clasped hands and uplifted eyes bitterly ruing his rashness he was roused by the voice of the stranger whose suspicions of his guide had again been awakened by finding the scene so different from what halbert had led him to expectyoung man he said hast thou baited thy tongue with falsehood to cut perhaps only a few days from the life of one whom nature will soon call home without guilt on thy part to hasten his journey  by the blessed heavenby our dear lady ejaculated halbert  swear not at all said the stranger interrupting him neither by heaven for it is gods throne nor by earth for it is his footstoolnor by the creatures whom he hath made for they are but earth and clay as we are let thy yea be yea and thy nay nay tell me in a word why and for what purpose thou hast feigned a tale to lead a bewildered traveller yet farther astray  as i am a christian man said glendinning i left him here bleeding to deathand now i nowhere spy him and much i doubt that the tomb that thou seest has closed on his mortal remains  and who is he for whose fate thou art so anxious said the stranger or how is it possible that this wounded man could have been either removed from or interred in a place so solitary  his name said halbert after a moments pause is piercie shaftonthere on that very spot i left him bleeding and what power has conveyed him hence i know no more than thou dost  piercie shafton said the stranger sir piercie shafton of wilverton a kinsman as it is said of the great piercie of northumberland if thou hast slain him to return to the territories of the proud abbot is to give thy neck to the gallows he is well known that piercie shafton the meddling tool of wiser plottersa harebrained trafficker in treasona champion of the pope employed as a forlorn hope by those more politic heads who have more will to work mischief than valour to encounter dangercome with me youth and save thyself from the evil consequences of this deedguide me to the castle of avenel and thy reward shall be protection and safety  again halbert paused and summoned his mind to a hasty council the vengeance with which the abbot was likely to visit the slaughter of shafton his friend and in some measure his guest was likely to be severe yet in the various contingencies which he had considered previous to their duel he had unaccountably omitted to reflect what was to be his line of conduct in case of sir piercie falling by his hand if he returned to glendearg he was sure to draw on his whole family including mary avenel the resentment of the abbot and community whereas it was possible that flight might make him be regarded as the sole author of the deed and might avert the indignation of the monks from the rest of the inhabitants of his paternal tower halbert recollected also the favour expressed for the household and especially for edward by the subprior and he conceived that he could by communicating his own guilt to that worthy ecclesiastic when at a distance from glendearg secure his powerful interposition in favour of his family these thoughts rapidly passed through his mind and he determined on flight the strangers company and his promised protection came in aid of that resolution but he was unable to reconcile the invitation which the old man gave him to accompany him for safety to the castle of avenel with the connexions of julian the present usurper of that inheritance  good father he said i fear that you mistake the man with whom you wish me to harbour avenel guided piercie shafton into scotland and his henchman christie of the clinthill brought the southron hither  of that said the old man i am well aware yet if thou wilt trust to me as i have shown no reluctance to confide in thee thou shalt find with julian avenel welcome or at least safety  father replied halbert though i can ill reconcile what thou sayest with what julian avenel hath done yet caring little about the safety of a creature so lost as myself and as thy words seem those of truth and honesty and finally as thou didst render thyself frankly up to my conduct i will return the confidence thou hast shown and accompany thee to the castle of avenel by a road which thou thyself couldst never have discovered he led the way and the old man followed for some time in silence                                         chapter the twentythird     tis when the wound is stiffening with the cold   the warrior first feels paintis when the heat   and fiery fever of his soul is passd   the sinner feels remorse                                old play  the feelings of compunction with which halbert glendinning was visited upon this painful occasion were deeper than belonged to an age and country in which human life was held so cheap they fell far short certainly of those which might have afflicted a mind regulated by better religious precepts and more strictly trained under social laws but still they were deep and severely felt and divided in halberts heart even the regret with which he parted from mary avenel and the tower of his fathers  the old traveller walked silently by his side for some time and then addressed himmy son it has been said that sorrow must speak or diewhy art thou so much cast downtell me thy unhappy tale and it may be that my gray head may devise counsel and aid for your young life  alas  said halbert glendinning can you wonder why i am cast downi am at this instant a fugitive from my fathers house from my mother and from my friends and i bear on my head the blood of a man who injured me but in idle words which i have thus bloodily requited my heart now tells me i have done evilit were harder than these rocks if it could bear unmoved the thought that i have sent this man to a long account unhousled and unshrieved  pause there my son said the traveller that thou hast defaced gods image in thy neighbours personthat thou hast sent dust to dust in idle wrath or idler pride is indeed a sin of the deepest dyethat thou hast cut short the space which heaven might have allowed him for repentance makes it yet more deadlybut for all this there is balm in gilead  i understand you not father said halbert struck by the solemn tone which was assumed by his companion  the old man proceeded thou hast slain thine enemyit was a cruel deed thou hast cut him off perchance in his sinsit is a fearful aggravation  do yet by my counsel and in lieu of him whom thou hast perchance consigned to the kingdom of satan let thine efforts wrest another subject from the reign of the evil one  i understand you father said halbert thou wouldst have me atone for my rashness by doing service to the soul of my adversarybut how may this be i have no money to purchase masses and gladly would i go barefoot to the holy land to free his spirit from purgatory only that  my son said the old man interrupting him the sinner for whose redemption i entreat you to labour is not the dead but the living it is not for the soul of thine enemy i would exhort thee to praythat has already had its final doom from a judge as merciful as he is just nor wert thou to coin that rock into ducats and obtain a mass for each one would it avail the departed spirit where the tree hath fallen it must lie  but the sapling which hath in it yet the vigour and juice of life may be bended to the point to which it ought to incline  art thou a priest father said the young man or by what commission dost thou talk of such high matters  by that of my almighty master said the traveller under whose banner i am an enlisted soldier  halberts acquaintance with religious matters was no deeper than could be derived from the archbishop of saint andrews catechism and the pamphlet called the twapennie faith both which were industriously circulated and recommended by the monks of saint marys yet however indifferent and superficial a theologian he began to suspect that he was now in company with one of the gospellers or heretics before whose influence the ancient system of religion now tottered to the very foundation bred up as may well be presumed in a holy horror against these formidable sectaries the youths first feelings were those of a loyal and devoted church vassal old man he said wert thou able to make good with thy hand the words that thy tongue hath spoken against our holy mother church we should have tried upon this moor which of our creeds hath the better champion  nay said the stranger if thou art a true soldier of rome thou wilt not pause from thy purpose because thou hast the odds of years and of strength on thy side hearken to me my son i have showed thee how to make thy peace with heaven and thou hast rejected my proffer i will now show thee how thou shalt make thy reconciliation with the powers of this world take this gray head from the frail body which supports it and carry it to the chair of proud abbot boniface and when thou tellest him thou hast slain piercie shafton and his ire rises at the deed lay the head of henry warden at his foot and thou shalt have praise instead of censure  halbert glendinning stepped back in surprise what are you that henry warden so famous among the heretics that even knoxs name is scarce more frequently in their mouths art thou he and darest thou to approach the halidome of saint marys  i am henry warden of a surety said the old man far unworthy to be named in the same breath with knox but yet willing to venture on whatever dangers my masters service may call me to  hearken to me then said halbert to slay thee i have no heartto make thee prisoner were equally to bring thy blood on my headto leave thee in this wild without a guide were little better i will conduct thee as i promised in safety to the castle of avenel but breathe not while we are on the journey a word against the doctrines of the holy church of which i am an unworthybut though an ignorant a zealous memberwhen thou art there arrived beware of thyselfthere is a high price upon thy head and julian avenel loves the glance of gold bonnetpieces footnote a gold coin of james v the most beautiful of the scottish series so called because the effigy of the sovereignty is represented wearing a bonnet  yet thou sayest not answered the protestant preacher for such he was that for lucre he would sell the blood of his guest  not if thou comest an invited stranger relying on his faith said the youth evil as julian may be he dare not break the rites of hospitality for loose as we on these marches may be in all other ties these are respected amongst us even to idolatry and his nearest relations would think it incumbent on them to spill his blood themselves to efface the disgrace such treason would bring upon their name and lineage but if thou goest selfinvited and without assurance of safety i promise thee thy risk is great  i am in gods hand answered the preacher it is on his errand that i traverse these wilds amidst dangers of every kind while i am useful for my masters service they shall not prevail against me and when like the barren figtree i can no longer produce fruit what imports it when or by whom the axe is laid to the root  your courage and devotion said glendinning are worthy of a better cause  that said warden cannot bemine is the very best  they continued their journey in silence halbert glendinning tracing with the utmost accuracy the mazes of the dangerous and intricate morasses and hills which divided the halidome from the barony of avenel from time to time he was obliged to stop in order to assist his companion to cross the black intervals of quaking bog called in the scottish dialect hags by which the firmer parts of the morass were intersected  courage old man said halbert as he saw his companion almost exhausted with fatigue we shall soon be upon hard ground and yet soft as this moss is i have seen the merry falconers go through it as light as deer when the quarry was upon the flight  true my son answered warden for so i will still call you though you term me no longer father and even so doth headlong youth pursue its pleasures without regard to the mire and the peril of the paths through which they are hurried  i have already told thee answered halbert glendinning sternly that i will hear nothing from thee that savours of doctrine  nay but my son answered warden thy spiritual father himself would surely not dispute the truth of what i have now spoken for your edification  glendinning stoutly replied i know not how that may bebut i wot well it is the fashion of your brotherhood to bait your hook with fair discourse and to hold yourselves up as angels of light that you may the better extend the kingdom of darkness  may god replied the preacher pardon those who have thus reported of his servants i will not offend thee my son by being instant out of seasonthou speakest but as thou art taughtyet sure i trust that so goodly a youth will be still rescued like a brand from the burning  while he thus spoke the verge of the morass was attained and their path lay on the declivity greensward it was and viewed from a distance chequered with its narrow and verdant line the darkbrown heath which it traversed though the distinction was not so easily traced when they were walking on it  footnote this sort of path visible when looked at from a distance but not to be seen when you are upon it is called on the border by the significant name of a blindroad the old man pursued his journey with comparative ease and unwilling again to awaken the jealous zeal of his young companion for the roman faith he discoursed on other matters the tone of his conversation was still grave moral and instructive he had travelled much and knew both the language and manners of other countries concerning which halbert glendinning already anticipating the possibility of being obliged to leave scotland for the deed he had done was naturally and anxiously desirous of information by degrees he was more attracted by the charms of the strangers conversation than repelled by the dread of his dangerous character as a heretic and halbert had called him father more than once ere the turrets of avenel castle came in view  the situation of this ancient fortress was remarkable it occupied a small rocky islet in a mountain lake or tarn as such a piece of water is called in westmoreland the lake might be about a mile in circumference surrounded by hills of considerable height which except where old trees and brushwood occupied the ravines that divided them from each other were bare and heathy the surprise of the spectator was chiefly excited by finding a piece of water situated in that high and mountainous region and the landscape around had features which might rather be termed wild than either romantic or sublime yet the scene was not without its charms  under the burning sun of summer the clear azure of the deep unruffled lake refreshed the eye and impressed the mind with a pleasing feeling of deep solitude in winter when the snow lay on the mountains around these dazzling masses appeared to ascend far beyond their wonted and natural height while the lake which stretched beneath and filled their bosom with all its frozen waves lay like the surface of a darkened and broken mirror around the black and rocky islet and the walls of the gray castle with which it was crowned  as the castle occupied either with its principal buildings or with its flanking and outward walls every projecting point of rock which served as its site it seemed as completely surrounded by water as the nest of a wild swan save where a narrow causeway extended betwixt the islet and the shore but the fortress was larger in appearance than in reality and of the buildings which it actually contained many had become ruinous and uninhabitable in the times of the grandeur of the avenel family these had been occupied by a considerable garrison of followers and retainers but they were now in a great measure deserted and julian avenel would probably have fixed his habitation in a residence better suited to his diminished fortunes had it not been for the great security which the situation of the old castle afforded to a man of his precarious and perilous mode of life indeed in this respect the spot could scarce have been more happily chosen for it could be rendered almost completely inaccessible at the pleasure of the inhabitant the distance betwixt the nearest shore and the islet was not indeed above an hundred yards but then the causeway which connected them was extremely narrow and completely divided by two cuts one in the midway between the islet and shore and another close under the outward gate of the castle these formed a formidable and almost insurmountable interruption to any hostile approach each was defended by a drawbridge one of which being that nearest to the castle was regularly raised at all times during the day and both were lifted at night footnote it is in vain to search near melrose for any such castle as is here described the lakes at the head of the yarrow and those at the rise of the water of ale present no object of the kind but in vetholm loch a romantic sheet of water in the dry march as it is called there are the remains of a fortress called lochside tower which like the supposed castle of avenel is built upon an island and connected with the land by a causeway it is much smaller than the castle of avenel is described consisting only of a single inous tower  the situation of julian avenel engaged in a variety of feuds and a party to almost every dark and mysterious transaction which was on foot in that wild and military frontier required all these precautions for his security his own ambiguous and doubtful course of policy had increased these dangers for as he made professions to both parties in the state and occasionally united more actively with either the one or the other as chanced best to serve his immediate purpose he could not be said to have either firm allies and protectors or determined enemies his life was a life of expedients and of peril and while in pursuit of his interest he made all the doubles which he thought necessary to attain his object he often overran his prey and missed that which he might have gained by observing a straighter course                                        chapter the twentyfourth     ill walk on tiptoe arm my eye with caution   my heart with courage and my hand with weapon   like him who ventures on a lions den                              old play  when issuing from the gorge of a pass which terminated upon the lake the travellers came in sight of the ancient castle of avenel the old man looked with earnest attention upon the scene before him the castle was as we have said in many places ruinous as was evident even at this distance by the broken rugged and irregular outline of the walls and of the towers in others it seemed more entire and a pillar of dark smoke which ascended from the chimneys of the donjon and spread its long dusky pennon through the clear ether indicated that it was inhabited but no cornfields or enclosed pasturegrounds on the side of the lake showed that provident attention to comfort and subsistence which usually appeared near the houses of the greater and even of the lesser barons there were no cottages with their patches of infield and their crofts and gardens surrounded by rows of massive sycamores no church with its simple tower in the valley no herds of sheep among the hills no cattle on the lower ground nothing which intimated the occasional prosecution of the arts of peace and of industry it was plain that the inhabitants whether few or numerous must be considered as the garrison of the castle living within its defended precincts and subsisting by means which were other than peaceful  probably it was with this conviction that the old man gazing on the castle muttered to himself lapis offensionis et petra scandali and then turning to halbert glendinning he added we may say of yonder fort as king james did of another fastness in this province that he who built it was a thief in his heart footnote it was of lochwood the hereditary fortress of the johnstones of aunandale a strong castle situated in the centre of a quaking bog that james vi made this remark  but it was not so answered glendinning yonder castle was built by the old lords of avenel men as much beloved in peace as they were respected in war they were the bulwark of the frontiers against foreigners and the protectors of the natives from domestic oppression the present usurper of their inheritance no more resembles them than the nightprowling owl resembles a falcon because she builds on the same rock  this julian avenel then holds no high place in the love and regard of his neighbours said warden  so little answered halbert that besides the jackmen and riders with whom he has associated himself and of whom he has many at his disposal i know of few who voluntarily associate with him he has been more than once outlawed both by england and scotland his lands declared forfeited and his head set at a price but in these unquiet times a man so daring as julian avenel has ever found some friends willing to protect him against the penalties of the law on condition of his secret services  you describe a dangerous man replied warden  you may have experience of that replied the youth if you deal not the more warilythough it may be that he also has forsaken the community of the church and gone astray in the path of heresy  what your blindness terms the path of heresy answered the reformer is indeed the straight and narrow way wherein he who walks turns not aside whether for worldly wealth or for worldly passions would to god this man were moved by no other and no worse spirit than that which prompts my poor endeavours to extend the kingdom of heaven this baron of avenel is personally unknown to me is not of our congregation or of our counsel yet i bear to him charges touching my safety from those whom he must fear if he does not respect them and upon that assurance i will venture upon his holdi am now sufficiently refreshed by these few minutes of repose  take then this advice for your safety said halbert and believe that it is founded upon the usage of this country and its inhabitants if you can better shift for yourself go not to the castle of avenelif you do risk going thither obtain from him if possible his safe conduct and beware that he swears it by the black roodand lastly observe whether he eats with you at the board or pledges you in the cup for if he gives you not these signs of welcome his thoughts are evil towards you  alas said the preacher i have no better earthly refuge for the present than these frowning towers but i go thither trusting to aid which is not of this earthbut thou good youth needest thou trust thyself in this dangerous den  i answered halbert am in no danger i am well known to christie of the clinthill the henchman of this julian avenel and what is a yet better protection i have nothing either to provoke malice or to tempt plunder  the tramp of a steed which clattered along the shingly banks of the loch was now heard behind them and when they looked back a rider was visible his steel cap and the point of his long lance glancing in the setting sun as he rode rapidly towards them  halbert glendinning soon recognized christie of the clinthill and made his companion aware that the henchman of julian avenel was approaching  ha youngling said christie to halbert as he came up to them thou hast made good my word at last and come to take service with my noble master hast thou not thou shalt find a good friend and a true and ere saint barnaby come round again thou shalt know every pass betwixt millburn plain and netherby as if thou hadst been born with a jack on thy back and a lance in thy handwhat old carle hast thou with theehe is not of the brotherhood of saint marysat least he has not the buist footnote buistthe brand or mark set upon sheep or cattle by their owners of these black cattle  he is a wayfaring man said halbert who has concerns with julian of avenel for myself i intend to go to edinburgh to see the court and the queen and when i return hither we will talk of your proffer meantime as thou hast often invited me to the castle i crave hospitality there tonight for myself and my companion  for thyself and welcome young comrade replied christie but we harbour no pilgrims nor aught that looks like a pilgrim  so please you said warden i have letters of commendation to thy master from a sure friend whom he will right willingly oblige in higher matters than in affording me a brief protectionand i am no pilgrim but renounce the same with all its superstitious observances he offered his letters to the horseman who shook his head  these he said are matters for my master and it will be well if he can read them himself for me sword and lance are my book and psalter and have been since i was twelve years old but i will guide you to the castle and the baron of avenel will himself judge of your errand  by this time the party had reached the causeway along which christie advanced at a trot intimating his presence to the warders within the castle by a shrill and peculiar whistle at this signal the farther drawbridge was lowered the horseman passed it and disappeared under the gloomy portal which was beyond it  glendinning and his companion advancing more leisurely along the rugged causeway stood at length under the same gateway over which frowned in dark red freestone the ancient armorial bearings of the house of avenel which represented a female figure shrouded and muffled which occupied the whole field the cause of their assuming so singular a device was uncertain but the figure was generally supposed to represent the mysterious being called the white lady of avenel footnote there is an ancient english family i believe which bears or did bear a ghost or spirit passant sable in a field argent this seems to have been a device of a punning or canting herald the sight of this mouldering shield awakened in the mind of halbert the strange circumstances which had connected his fate with that of mary avenel and with the doings of the spiritual being who was attached to her house and whom he saw here represented in stone as he had before seen her effigy upon the sealring of walter avenel which with other trinkets formerly mentioned had been saved from pillage and brought to glendearg when marys mother was driven from her habitation  you sigh my son said the old man observing the impression made on his youthful companions countenance but mistaking the cause if you fear to enter we may yet return  that can ye not said christie of the clinthill who emerged at that instant from the sidedoor under the archway look yonder and choose whether you will return skimming the water like a wildduck or winging the air like a plover  they looked and saw that the drawbridge which they had just crossed was again raised and now interposed its planks betwixt the setting sun and the portal of the castle deepening the gloom of the arch under which they stood christie laughed and bid them follow him saying by way of encouragement in halberts ear answer boldly and readily to whatever the baron asks you never stop to pick your words and above all show no fear of himthe devil is not so black as he is painted  as he spoke thus he introduced them into the large stone hall at the upper end of which blazed a huge fire of wood the long oaken table which as usual occupied the midst of the apartment was covered with rude preparations for the evening meal of the baron and his chief domestics five or six of whom strong athletic savagelooking men paced up and down the lower end of the hall which rang to the jarring clang of their long swords that clashed as they moved and to the heavy tramp of their highheeled jackboots iron jacks or coats of buff formed the principal part of their dress and steelbonnets or large slouched hats with spanish plumes drooping backwards were their head attire  the baron of avenel was one of those tall muscular martial figures which are the favourite subjects of salvator rosa he wore a cloak which had been once gaily trimmed but which by long wear and frequent exposure to the weather was now faded in its colours thrown negligently about his tall person it partly hid and partly showed a short doublet of buff under which was in some places visible that light shirt of mail which was called a secret because worn instead of more ostensible armour to protect against private assassination a leathern belt sustained a large and heavy sword on one side and on the other that gay poniard which had once called sir piercie shafton master of which the hatchments and gildings were already much defaced either by rough usage or neglect  notwithstanding the rudeness of his apparel julian avenels manner and countenance had far more elevation than those of the attendants who surrounded him he might be fifty or upwards for his dark hair was mingled with gray but age had neither tamed the fire of his eye nor the enterprise of his disposition his countenance had been handsome for beauty was an attribute of the family but the lines were roughened by fatigue and exposure to the weather and rendered coarse by the habitual indulgence of violent passions  he seemed in deep and moody reflection and was pacing at a distance from his dependents along the upper end of the hall sometimes stopping from time to time to caress and feed a goshawk which sat upon his wrist with its jesses i e the leathern straps fixed to its legs wrapt around his hand the bird which seemed not insensible to its masters attention answered his caresses by ruffling forward its feathers and pecking playfully at his finger at such intervals the baron smiled but instantly resumed the darksome air of sullen meditation he did not even deign to look upon an object which few could have passed and repassed so often without bestowing on it a transient glance  this was a woman of exceeding beauty rather gaily than richly attired who sat on a low seat close by the huge hall chimney the gold chains round her neck and armsthe gay gown of green which swept the floorthe silver embroidered girdle with its bunch of keys depending in housewifely pride by a silver chainthe yellow silken couvrechef scottice curch which was disposed around her head and partly concealed her dark profusion of hairabove all the circumstance so delicately touched in the old ballad that the girdle was too short the gown of green all too strait for the wearers present shape would have intimated the barons lady  but then the lowly seatthe expression of deep melancholy which was changed into a timid smile whenever she saw the least chance of catching the eye of julian avenelthe subdued look of grief and the starting tear for which that constrained smile was again exchanged when she saw herself entirely disregardedthese were not the attributes of a wife or they were those of a dejected and afflicted female who had yielded her love on less than legitimate terms  julian avenel as we have said continued to pace the hall without paying any of that mute attention which is rendered to almost every female either by affection or courtesy he seemed totally unconscious of her presence or of that of his attendants and was only roused from his own dark reflections by the notice he paid to the falcon to which however the lady seemed to attend as if studying to find either an opportunity of speaking to the baron or of finding something enigmatical in the expressions which he used to the bird all this the strangers had time enough to remark for no sooner had they entered the apartment than their usher christie of the clinthill after exchanging a significant glance with the menials or troopers at the lower end of the apartment signed to halbert glendinning and to his companion to stand still near the door while he himself advancing nearer the table placed himself in such a situation as to catch the barons observation when he should be disposed to look around but without presuming to intrude himself on his masters notice indeed the look of this man naturally bold hardy and audacious seemed totally changed when he was in presence of his master and resembled the dejected and cowering manner of a quarrelsome dog when rebuked by his owner or when he finds himself obliged to deprecate the violence of a superior adversary of his own species  in spite of the novelty of his own situation and every painful feeling connected with it halbert felt his curiosity interested in the female who sate by the chimney unnoticed and unregarded he marked with what keen and trembling solicitude she watched the broken words of julian and how her glance stole towards him ready to be averted upon the slightest chance of his perceiving himself to be watched  meantime he went on with his dalliance with his feathered favourite now giving now withholding the morsel with which he was about to feed the bird and so exciting its appetite and gratifying it by turns what more yetthou foul kite thou wouldst never have donegive thee part thou wilt have allay prune thy feathers and prink thyself gaymuch thou wilt make of it nowdost think i know thee notdost think i see not that all that ruffling and pluming of wing and feathers is not for thy master but to try what thou canst make of him thou greedy gledwelltheretake it then and rejoice thyselflittle boon goes far with thee and with all thy sexand so it should  he ceased to look on the bird and again traversed the apartment then taking another small piece of raw meat from the trencher on which it was placed ready cut for his use he began once again to tempt and tease the bird by offering and withdrawing it until he awakened its wild and bold disposition what struggling fluttering aiming at me with beak and single footnote in the kindly language of hawking as lady juliana berners terms it

well to her casting and to her bathingwe will see her fly tomorrowhow now christie so soon returned   christie advanced to his master and gave an account of himself and his journey in the way in which a policeofficer holds communication with his magistrate that is as much by signs as by words  noble sir said that worthy satellite the laird of he named no place but pointed with his finger in a southwestern direction may not ride with you the day he purposed because the lord warden has threatened that he will  here another blank intelligibly enough made up by the speaker touching his own

time and stopped short in the midst of what he was about to say though there was something so contemptuous in the glance that the blank might have been thus filled upour women are such as she is  he said it not however and as if desirous of attracting his attention at all risks and in whatever manner she rose and came forward to him but with a timorousness illdisguised by affected gaietyour women julianwhat would you say of the women  nothing answered julian avenel at least nothing but that they are kindhearted wenches like thyself kate the female coloured deeply and returned to her seatand what strangers hast thou brought with thee christie that stand yonder like two stone statues said the baron  the taller answered christie is so please you a young fellow called halbert glendinning the eldest son of the old widow at glendearg  what brings him here said the baron hath he any message from mary avenel  not as i think said christie the youth is roving the countryhe was always a wild slip for i have known him since he was the height of my sword  what qualities hath he said the baron  all manner of qualities answered his followerhe can strike a buck track a deer fly a hawk halloo to a houndhe shoots in the long and crossbow to a hairs breadthwields a lance or sword like myself nearlybacks a horse manfully and fairlyi wot not what more a man need to do to make him a gallant

some cast of a priest as i fancyhe says he is charged with letters to you  bid them come forward said the baron and no sooner had they approached him more nearly than struck by the fine form and strength displayed by halbert glendinning he addressed him thus i am told young swankie that you are roaming the world to seek your fortuneif you will serve julian avenel you may find it without going farther  so please you answered glendinning something has chanced to me that makes it better i should leave this land and i am bound for edinburgh  whatthou hast stricken some of the kings deer i warrantor lightened the meadows of saint marys of some of their beevesor thou hast taken a moonlight leap over the border  no sir said halbert my case is entirely different  then i warrant thee said the baron thou hast stabbed some brother churl in a fray about a wenchthou art a likely lad to wrangle in such a cause  ineffably disgusted at his tone and manner halbert glendinning remained silent while the thought darted across his mind what would julian avenel have said had he known the quarrel of which he spoke so lightly had arisen on account of his own brothers daughter but be thy cause of flight what it will said julian in continuation dost thou think the law or its emissaries can follow thee into this island or arrest thee under the standard of avenellook at the depth of the lake the strength of the walls the length of the causewaylook at my men and think if they are likely to see a comrade injured or if i their master am a man to desert a faithful follower in good or evil i tell thee it shall be an eternal day of truce betwixt thee and justice as they call it from the instant thou hast put my colours into thy capthou shalt ride by the wardens nose as thou wouldst pass an old marketwoman and neer a cur which follows him shall dare to bay at thee  i thank you for your offers noble sir replied halbert but i must answer in brief that i cannot profit by themmy fortunes lead me elsewhere  thou art a selfwilled fool for thy pains said julian turning from him and signing christie to approach he whispered in his ear there is promise in that young fellows looks christie and we want men of limbs and sinews so compactedthose thou hast brought to me of late are the mere refuse of mankind wretches scarce worth the arrow that ends them this youngster is limbed like saint george

perhaps more to be pitied than i am now had i indeed met with that fortune which like others i have sought in my greener days  nay understand me friend said the baron if thou art satisfied with thy buckram gown and long staff i also am well content thou shouldst be as poor and contemptible as is good for the health of thy body and soulall i care to know of thee is the cause which hath brought thee to my castle where few crows of thy kind care to settle thou art i warrant thee some ejected monk of a suppressed convent paying in his old days the price of the luxurious idleness in which he spent his youthay or it may be some pilgrim with a budget of lies from saint james of compostella or our lady of loretto or thou mayest be some pardoner with his budget of relics from rome forgiving sins at a penny adozen and one to the taleay i guess why i find thee in this boys company and doubtless thou wouldst have such a strapping lad as he to carry thy wallet and relieve thy lazy shoulders but by the mass i will cross thy cunning i make my vow to sun and moon i will not see a proper lad so misleard as to run the country with an old knave like simmie and his brother footnote two quaestionarii or begging friars whose accoutrements and roguery make the subject of an old scottish satirical poem away with thee he added rising in wrath and speaking so fast as to give no opportunity of answer being probably determined to terrify the elder guest into an abrupt flightaway with thee with thy clouted coat scrip and scallopshell or by the name of avenel i will have them loose the hounds on thee  warden waited with the greatest patience until julian avenel astonished that the threats and violence of his language made no impression on him paused in a sort of wonder and said in a less imperious tone why the fiend dost thou not answer me  when you have done speaking said warden in the same composed manner it will be full time to reply  say on man in the devils namebut take heedbeg not herewere it but for the rinds of cheese the refuse of the rats or a morsel that my dogs would turn fromneither a grain of meal nor the nineteenth part of a gray groat will i give to any feigned limmer of thy coat  it may be answered warden that you would have less quarrel with my coat if you knew what it covers i am neither a friar nor mendicant and would be right glad to hear thy testimony against these foul deceivers of gods church and usurpers of his rights over the christian flock were it given in christian charity  and who or what art thou then said avenel that thou comest to this border land and art neither monk nor soldier nor broken man  i am an humble teacher of the holy word answered warden this letter from a most noble person will speak why i am here at this present time  he delivered the letter to the baron who regarded the seal with some surprise and then looked on the letter itself which seemed to excite still more he then fixed his eyes on the stranger and said in a menacing tone i think thou darest not betray me or deceive me  i am not the man to attempt either was the concise reply  julian avenel carried the letter to the window where he perused or at least attempted to peruse it more than once often looking from the paper and gazing on the stranger who had delivered it as if he meant to read the purport of the missive in the face of the messenger julian at length called to the femalecatherine bestir thee and fetch me presently that letter which i bade thee keep ready at hand in thy casket having no sure lockfast place of my own  catherine went with the readiness of one willing to be employed and as she walked the situation which requires a wider gown and a longer girdle and in which woman claims from man a double portion of the most anxious care was still more visible than before she soon returned with the paper and was rewarded with a coldi thank thee wench thou art a careful secretary  this second paper he also perused and reperused more than once and still as he read it bent from time to time a wary and observant eye upon henry warden this examination and reexamination though both the man and the place were dangerous the preacher endured with the most composed and steady countenance seeming under the eagle or rather the vulture eye of the baron as unmoved as under the gaze of an ordinary and peaceful peasant at length julian avenel folded both papers and having put them into the pocket of his cloak cleared his brow and coming forward addressed his female companion catherine said he i have done this good man injustice when i mistook him for one of the drones of rome  he is a preacher catherinea preacher of thethe new doctrine of the lords of the congregation  the doctrine of the blessed scriptures said the preacher purified from the devices of men  sayest thou said julian avenelwell thou mayest call it what thou lists but to me it is recommended because it flings off all those sottish dreams about saints and angels and devils and unhorses lazy monks that have ridden us so long and spurgalled us so hard no more masses and corpsegiftsno more tithes and offerings to make men poorno more prayers or psalms to make men cowardsno more christenings and penances and confessions and marriages  so please you said henry warden it is against the corruptions not against the fundamental doctrines of the church which we desire to renovate and not to abolish  prithee peace man said the baron we of the laity care not what you set up so you pull merrily down what stands in our way specially it suits well with us of the southland fells for it is our profession to turn the world upside down and we live ever the blithest life when the downer side is uppermost  warden would have replied but the baron allowed him not time striking the table with the hilt of his dagger and crying outha you loitering knaves bring our suppermeal quickly see you not this holy man is exhausted for lack of food heard ye ever of priest or preacher that devoured not his five meals aday  the attendants bustled to and fro and speedily brought in several large smoking platters filled with huge pieces of beef boiled and roasted but without any variety whatsoever without vegetables and almost without bread though there was at the upper end a few oatcakes in a basket julian avenel made a sort of apology to warden  you have been commended to our care sir preacher since that is your style by a person whom we highly honour  i am assured said warden that the most noble lord  prithee peace man said avenel what need of naming names so we understand each other i meant but to speak in reference to your safety and comfort of which he desires us to be chary now for your safety look at my walls and water but touching your comfort we have no corn of our own and the mealgirnels of the south are less easily transported than their beeves seeing they have no legs to walk upon but what though a stoup of wine thou shalt have and of the bestthou shalt sit betwixt catherine and me at the boardendand christie do thou look to the young springald and call to the cellarer for a flagon of the best  the baron took his wonted place at the upper end of the board his catherine sate down and courteously pointed to a seat betwixt them for their reverend guest but notwithstanding the influence both of hunger and fatigue henry warden retained his standing posture     chapter the twentyfifth     when lovely woman stoops to folly   and finds too late that men betray  julian avenel saw with surprise the demeanour of the reverend stranger beshrew me he said these newfashioned religioners have fastdays i warrant methe old ones used to confer these blessings chiefly on the laity  we acknowledge no such rule said the preacherwe hold that our faith consists not in using or abstaining from special meats on special days and in fasting we rend our hearts and not our garments  the betterthe better for yourselves and the worse for tom tailor said the baron but come sit down or if thou needs must een give us a cast of thy office mutter thy charm  sir baron said the preacher i am in a strange land where neither mine office nor my doctrine are known and where it would seem both are greatly misunderstood it is my duty so to bear me that in my person however unworthy my masters dignity may be respected and that sin may take not confidence from relaxation of the bonds of discipline  ho la halt there said the baron thou wert sent hither for thy safety but not i think to preach to me or control me what is it thou wouldst have sir preacher remember thou speakest to one somewhat short of patience who loves a short health and a long draught  in a word then said henry warden that lady  how said the baron startingwhat of herwhat hast thou to say of that dame  is she thy housedame said the preacher after a moments pause in which he seemed to seek for the best mode of expressing what he had to sayis she in brief thy wife  the unfortunate young woman pressed both her hands on her face as if to hide it but the deep blush which crimsoned her brow and neck showed that her cheeks were also glowing and the bursting tears which found their way betwixt her slender fingers bore witness to her sorrow as well as to her shame  now by my fathers ashes said the baron rising and spurning from him his footstool with such violence that it hit the wall on the opposite side of the apartmentthen instantly constraining himself he muttered what need to run myself into trouble for a fools wordthen resuming his seat he answered coldly and scornfullyno sir priest or sir preacher catherine is not my wifecease thy whimpering thou foolish wenchshe is not my wife but she is handfasted with me and that makes her as honest a woman  handfastedrepeated warden  knowest thou not that rite holy man said avenel in the same tone of derision then i will tell thee we bordermen are more wary than your inland clowns of fife and lothianno jump in the dark for usno clenching the fetters around our wrists till we know how they will wear with uswe take our wives like our horses upon trial when we are handfasted as we term it we are man and wife for a year and daythat space gone by each may choose another mate or at their pleasure may call the priest to marry them for lifeand this we call handfasting footnote this custom of handfasting actually prevailed in the upland days it arose partly from the want of priests while the convents subsisted monks were detached on regular circuits through the wilder districts to marry those who had lived in this species of connexion a practice of the same kind existed in the isle of portland  then said the preacher i tell thee noble baron in brotherly love to thy soul it is a custom licentious gross and corrupted and if persisted in dangerous yea damnable it binds thee to the frailer being while she is the object of desireit relieves thee when she is most the subject of pityit gives all to brutal sense and nothing to generous and gentle affection  i say to thee that he who can meditate the breach of such an engagement abandoning the deluded woman and the helpless offspring is worse than the birds of prey for of them the males remain with their mates until the nestlings can take wing above all i say it is contrary to the pure christian doctrine which assigns woman to man as the partner of his labour the soother of his evil his helpmate in peril his friend in affliction not as the toy of his looser hours or as a flower which once cropped he may throw aside at pleasure  now by the saints a most virtuous homily said the baron quaintly conceived and curiously pronounced and to a wellchosen congregation  hark ye sir gospeller trow ye to have a fool in hand know i not that your sect rose by bluff harry tudor merely because ye aided him to change his kate and wherefore should i not use the same christian liberty with mine tush man bless the good food and meddle not with what concerns thee notthou hast no gull in julian avenel  he hath gulled and cheated himself said the preacher should he even incline to do that poor sharer of his domestic cares the imperfect justice that remains to him can he now raise her to the rank of a pure and uncontaminated matroncan he deprive his child of the misery of owing birth to a mother who has erred he can indeed give them both the rank the state of married wife and of lawful son but in public opinion their names will be smirched and sullied with a stain which his tardy efforts cannot entirely efface yet render it to them baron of avenel render to them this late and imperfect justice bid me bind you together for ever and celebrate the day of your bridal not with feasting or wassail but with sorrow for past sin and the resolution to commence a better life  happy then will have the chance been that has drawn me to this castle though i come driven by calamity and unknowing where my course is bound like a leaf travelling on the north wind  the plain and even coarse features of the zealous speaker were warmed at once and ennobled by the dignity of his enthusiasm and the wild baron lawless as he was and accustomed to spurn at the control whether of religious or moral law felt for the first time perhaps in his life that he was under subjection to a mind superior to his own he sat mute and suspended in his deliberations hesitating betwixt anger and shame yet borne down by the weight of the just rebuke thus boldly fulminated against him  the unfortunate young woman conceiving hopes from her tyrants silence and apparent indecision forgot both her fear and shame in her timid expectation that avenel would relent and fixing upon him her anxious and beseeching eyes gradually drew near and nearer to his seat till at length laying a trembling hand on his cloak she ventured to utter o noble julian listen to the good man  the speech and the motion were illtimed and wrought on that proud and wayward spirit the reverse of her wishes  the fierce baron started up in a fury exclaiming what thou foolish callet art thou confederate with this strolling vagabond whom thou hast seen beard me in my own hall hence with thee and think that i ana proof both to male and female hypocrisy  the poor girl started back astounded at his voice of thunder and looks of fury and turning pale as death endeavoured to obey his orders and tottered towards the door her limbs failed in the attempt and she fell on the stone floor in a manner which her situation might have rendered fatalthe blood gushed from her facehalbert glendinning brooked not a sight so brutal but uttering a deep imprecation started from his seat and laid his hand on his sword under the strong impulse of passing it through the body of the cruel and hardhearted ruffian but christie of the clinthill guessing his intention threw his arms around him and prevented him from stirring to execute his purpose  the impulse to such an act of violence was indeed but momentary as it instantly appeared that avenel himself shocked at the effects of his violence was lifting up and endeavouring to soothe in his own way the terrified catherine  peace he said prithee peace thou silly minionwhy kate though i listen not to this tramping preacher i said not what might happen an thou dost bear me a stout boy theretheredry thy tearscall thy womenso howhere be these queanschristie rowleyhutcheondrag them hither by the hair of the head  a half dozen of startled wildlooking females rushed into the room and bore out her who might be either termed their mistress or their companion  she showed little sign of life except by groaning faintly and keeping her hand on her side  no sooner had this luckless female been conveyed from the apartment than the baron advancing to the table filled and drank a deep goblet of wine then putting an obvious restraint on his passions turned to the preacher who stood horrorstruck at the scene he had witnessed and said you have borne too hard on us sir preacherbut coming with the commendations which you have brought me i doubt not but your meaning was good but we are a wilder folk than you inland men of fife and lothian  be advised therefore by mespur not an unbroken horseput not your ploughshare too deep into new landpreach to us spiritual liberty and we will hearken to youbut we will give no way to spiritual bondagesit therefore down and pledge me in old sack and we will talk over these matters  it is from spiritual bondage said the preacher in the same tone of admonitory reproof that i came to deliver youit is from a bondage more fearful than than that of the heaviest earthly gyvesit is from your own evil passions  sit down said avenel fiercely sit down while the play is good else by my fathers crest and my mothers honour  now whispered christie of the clinthill to halbert if he refuse to sit down i would not give a gray groat for his head  lord baron said warden thou hast placed me in extremity but if the question be whether i am to hide the light which i am commanded to show forth or to lose the light of this world my choice is made i say to thee like the holy baptist to herod it is not lawful for thee to have this woman and i say it though bonds and death be the consequence counting my life as nothing in comparison of the ministry to which i am called  julian avenel enraged at the firmness of this reply flung from his right hand the cup in which he was about to drink to his guest and from the other cast off the hawk which flew wildly through the apartment his first motion was to lay hand upon his dagger but changing his resolution he exclaimed to the dungeon with this insolent strolleri will hear no man speak a word for himlook to the falcon christie thou foolan she escape i will despatch you after her every manaway with that hypocritical dreamerdrag him hence if he resist  he was obeyed in both points christie of the clinthill arrested the hawks flight by putting his foot on her jesses and so holding her fast while henry warden was led off without having shown the slightest symptoms of terror by two of the barons satellites julian avenel walked the apartment for a short time in sullen silence and despatching one of his attendants with a whispered message which probably related to the health of the unfortunate catherine he said aloud these rash and meddling priestsby heaven they make us worse than we would be without them  footnote if it were necessary to name a prototype for this brutal licentious and cruel border chief in an age which showed but too many such the laird of black ormiston might be selected for that purpose he was a friend and confidant of bothwell and an agent in henry darnleys murder at his last stage he was like other great offenders a seeming penitent and as his confession bears divers gentlemen and servants being in the chamber he said for gods sake sit down and pray for me for i have been a great sinner otherwise that is besides his share in darnleys death for the which god is this day punishing me for of all men on the earth i have been one of the proudest and most highminded and most unclean of my body  but specially i have shed the innocent blood of one michael hunter with my own hands alas therefore because the said michael having me lying on my back having a fork in his hand might have slain me if he had pleased and did it not which of all things grieves me most in conscience also in a rage i hanged a poor man for a horsewith many other wicked deeds for whilk i ask my god mercy it is not marvel i have been wicked considering the wicked company that ever i have been in but specially within the seven years bypast in which i never saw two good men or one good deed but all kind of wickedness and yet god would not suffer me to be lostsee the whole confession in the state trials  another worthy of the borders called geordy bourne of somewhat subordinate rank was a similar picture of profligacy he had fallen into the hands of sir robert carey then warden of the english east marches who gives the following account of his prisoners confession  when all things were quiet and the watch set at night after supper about ten of the clock i took one of my mens liveries and put it about me and took two other of my servants with me in their liveries and we three as the wardens men came to the provost marshals where bourne was and were let into his chamber we sate down by him and told him that we were desirous to see him because we heard he was stout and valiant and true to his friend and that we were sorry our master could not be moved to save his life he voluntarily of himself said that he had lived long enough to do so many villanies as he had done and withal told us that he had lain with above forty mens wives what in england what in scotland and that he had killed seven englishmen with his own hands cruelly murdering them and that he had spent his whole time in whoring drinking stealing and taking deep revenge for slight offences he seemed to be very penitent and much desired a minister for the comfort of his soul we promised him to let our master know his desire who we knew would promptly grant it we took leave of him and presently i took order that mr selby a very honest preacher should go to him and not stir from him till his execution the next morning for after i had heard his own confession i was resolved no conditions should save his life and so took order that at the gates opening the next morning he should be carried to execution which accordingly was performedmemoirs of sir robert carey earl of monmouth  the answer which he presently received seemed somewhat to pacify his angry mood and he took his place at the board commanding his retinue to the like all sat down in silence and began the repast  during the meal christie in vain attempted to engage his youthful companion in carousal or at least in conversation halbert glendinning pleaded fatigue and expressed himself unwilling to take any liquor stronger than the heather ale which was at that time frequently used at meals  thus every effort at jovialty died away until the baron striking his hand against the table as if impatient of the long unbroken silence cried out aloud what ho my mastersare ye borderriders and sit as mute over your meal as a mess of monks and friarssome one sing if no one list to speak much eaten without either mirth or music is ill of digestionlouis he added speaking to one of the youngest of his followers thou art ready enough to sing when no one bids thee  the young man looked first at his master then up to the arched roof of the hall then drank off the horn of ale or wine which stood beside him and with a rough yet not unmelodious voice sung the following ditty to the ancient air of blue bonnets over the border                   i    march march ettrick and teviotdale     why the deil dinna ye march forward in order   march march eskdale and liddesdale     all the blue bonnets are bound for the border         many a banner spread         flutters above your head     many a crest that is famous in story         mount and make ready then         sons of the mountain glen     fight for the queen and the old scottish glory                   ii    come from the hills where the hirsels are grazing     come from the glen of the buck and the roe   come to the crag where the beacon is blazing     come with the buckler the lance and the bow         trumpets are sounding         warsteeds are bounding     stand to your arms then and march in good order         england shall many a day         tell of the bloody fray     when the blue bonnets came over the border  the song rude as it was had in it that warlike character which at any other time would have roused halberts spirit but at present the charm of minstrelsy had no effect upon him he made it his request to christie to suffer him to retire to rest a request with which that worthy person seeing no chance of making a favourable impression on his intended proselyte in his present humour was at length pleased to comply but no sergeant kite who ever practised the profession of recruiting was more attentive that his object should not escape him than was christie of the clinthill  he indeed conducted halbert glendinning to a small apartment overlooking the lake which was accommodated with a truckle bed but before quitting him christie took special care to give a look to the bars which crossed the outside of the window and when he left the apartment he failed not to give the key a double turn circumstances which convinced young glendinning that there was no intention of suffering him to depart from the castle of avenel at his own time and pleasure he judged it however most prudent to let these alarming symptoms pass without observation  no sooner did he find himself in undisturbed solitude than he ran rapidly over the events of the day in his recollection and to his surprise found that his own precarious fate and even the death of piercie shafton made less impression on him than the singularly bold and determined conduct of his companion henry warden providence which suits its instruments to the end they are to achieve had awakened in the cause of reformation in scotland a body of preachers of more energy than refinement bold in spirit and strong in faith contemners of whatever stood betwixt them and their principal object and seeking the advancement of the great cause in which they laboured by the roughest road provided it were the shortest the soft breeze may wave the willow but it requires the voice of the tempest to agitate the boughs of the oak and accordingly to milder hearers and in a less rude age their manners would have been illadapted but they were singularly successful in their mission to the rude people to whom it was addressed  owing to these reasons halbert glendinning who had resisted and repelled the arguments of the preacher was forcibly struck by the firmness of his demeanour in the dispute with julian avenel it might be discourteous and most certainly it was incautious to choose such a place and such an audience for upbraiding with his transgressions a baron whom both manners and situation placed in full possession of independent power but the conduct of the preacher was uncompromising firm manly and obviously grounded upon the deepest conviction which duty and principle could afford and glendinning who had viewed the conduct of avenel with the deepest abhorrence was proportionally interested in the brave old man who had ventured life rather than withhold the censure due to guilt this pitch of virtue seemed to him to be in religion what was demanded by chivalry of her votaries in war an absolute surrender of all selfish feelings and a combination of every energy proper to the human mind to discharge the task which duty demanded  halbert was at the period when youth was most open to generous emotions and knows best how to appreciate them in others and he felt although he hardly knew why that whether catholic or heretic the safety of this man deeply interested him curiosity mingled with the feeling and led him to wonder what the nature of those doctrines could be which stole their votary so completely from himself and devoted him to chains or to death as their sworn champion he had indeed been told of saints and martyrs of former days who had braved for their religious faith the extremity of death and torture but their spirit of enthusiastic devotion had long slept in the ease and indolent habits of their successors and their adventures like those of knightserrant were rather read for amusement than for edification a new impulse had been necessary to rekindle the energies of religious zeal and that impulse was now operating in favour of a purer religion with one of whose steadiest votaries the youth had now met for the first time  the sense that he himself was a prisoner under the power of this savage chieftain by no means diminished halberts interest in the fate of his fellow sufferer while he determined at the same time so far to emulate his fortitude that neither threats nor suffering should compel him to enter into the service of such a master the possibility of escape next occurred to him and though with little hope of effecting it in that way glendinning proceeded to examine more particularly the window of the apartment the apartment was situated in the first story of the castle and was not so far from the rock on which it was founded but that an active and bold man might with little assistance descend to a shelf of rock which was immediately below the window and from thence either leap or drop himself down into the lake which lay before his eye clear and blue in the placid light of a full summers moonwere i once placed on that ledge thought glendinning julian avenel and christie had seen the last of me the size of the window favoured such an attempt but the stanchions or iron bars seemed to form an insurmountable obstacle  while halbert glendinning gazed from the window with that eagerness of hope which was prompted by the energy of his character and his determination not to yield to circumstances his ear caught some sounds from below and listening with more attention he could distinguish the voice of the preacher engaged in his solitary devotions to open a correspondence with him became immediately his object and failing to do so by less marked sounds he at length ventured to speak and was answered from beneathis it thou my son the voice of the prisoner now sounded more distinctly than when it was first heard for warden had approached the small aperture which serving his prison for a window opened just betwixt the wall and the rock and admitted a scanty portion of light through a wall of immense thickness this soupirait being placed exactly under halberts window the contiguity permitted the prisoners to converse in a low tone when halbert declared his intention to escape and the possibility he saw of achieving his purpose but for the iron stanchions of the windowprove thy strength my son in the name of god said the preacher  halbert obeyed him more in despair than hope but to his great astonishment and somewhat to his terror the bar parted asunder near the bottom and the longer part being easily bent outwards and not secured with lead in the upper socket dropt out into halberts hand he immediately whispered but as energetically as a whisper could be expressedby heaven the bar has given way in my hand  thank heaven my son instead of swearing by it answered warden from his dungeon  with little effort halbert glendinning forced himself through the opening thus wonderfully effected and using his leathern swordbelt as a rope to assist him let himself safely drop on the shelf of rock upon which the preachers window opened but through this no passage could be effected being scarce larger than a loophole for musketry and apparently constructed for that purpose  are there no means by which i can assist your escape my father said halbert  there are none my son answered the preacher but if thou wilt ensure my safety that may be in thy power  i will labour earnestly for it said the youth  take then a letter which i will presently write for i have the means of light and writing materials in my scriphasten towards edinburgh and on the way thou wilt meet a body of horse marching southwardsgive this to their leader and acquaint him of the state in which thou hast left me it may hap that thy doing so will advantage thyself  in a minute or two the light of a taper gleamed through the shothole and very shortly after the preacher with the assistance of his staff pushed a billet to glendinning through the window  god bless thee my son said the old man and complete the marvellous work which he has begun  amen answered halbert with solemnity and proceeded on his enterprise  he hesitated a moment whether he should attempt to descend to the edge of the water but the steepness of the rock and darkness of the night rendered the enterprise too dangerous he clasped his hands above his head and boldly sprung from the precipice shooting himself forward into the air as far as he could for fear of sunken rocks and alighted on the lake head foremost with such force as sunk him for a minute below the surface but strong longbreathed and accustomed to such exercise halbert even though encumbered with his sword dived and rose like a seafowl and swam across the lake in the northern direction when he landed and looked back on the castle he could observe that the alarm had been given for lights glanced from window to window and he heard the drawbridge lowered and the tread of horses feet upon the causeway but little alarmed for the consequence of a pursuit during the darkness he wrung the water from his dress and plunging into the moors directed his course to the northeast by the assistance of the polar star                                           chapter the twentysixth     why what an intricate impeach is this   i think you all have drank of circes cup   if here you housed him here he would have been   if he were mad he would not plead so coldly                                   comedy of errors  the course of our story leaving for the present halbert glendinning to the guidance of his courage and his fortune returns to the tower of glendearg where matters in the meanwhile fell out with which it is most fitting that the reader should be acquainted  the meal was prepared at noontide with all the care which elspeth and tibb assisted by the various accommodations which had been supplied from the monastery could bestow on it their dialogue ran on as usual in the intervals of their labour partly as between mistress and servant partly as maintained by gossips of nearly equal quality  look to the minced meat tibb said elspeth and turn the broach even thou goodfornothing simmiethy wits are harrying birds nests childweel tibb this is a fasheous job this sir piercie lying leaguer with us up here and wha kens for how lang  a fasheous job indeed answered her faithful attendant and little good did the name ever bring to fair scotland ye may have your hands fuller of them than they are yet mony a sair heart have the piercies given to scots wife and bairns with their pricking on the borders there was hotspur and many more of that bloody kindred have sate in our skirts since malcolms time as martin says  martin should keep a wellscrapit tongue in his head said elspeth and not slander the kin of any body that quarters at glendearg forby that sir piercie shafton is much respected with the holy fathers of the community and they will make up to us ony fasherie that we may have with him either by good word or good deed ise warrant them he is a considerate lord the lord abbot  and weel he likes a saft seat to his hinder end said tibb i have seen a belted baron sit on a bare bench and find nae fault but an ye are pleased mistress i am pleased  now in good time here comes mysie of the milland where hae ye been lass for as gane wrang without you said elspeth  i just gaed a blink up the burn said mysie for the young lady has been down on her bed and is no just that weelso i gaed a gliff up the burn  to see the young lads come hame frae the sport i will warrant you said elspeth ay ay tibb thats

elspeth  not the least tokening said mysie though i got to the head of a knowe and though the english knights beautiful white feather could have been seen over all the bushes in the shaw  the knights white feather said dame glendinning ye are a silly hempiemy halberts high head will be seen farther than his feather let it be as white as it like i trow  mysie made no answer but began to knead dough for wastelcake with all despatch observing that sir piercie had partaken of that dainty and commended it upon the preceding day and presently in order to place on the fire the girdle or iron plate on which these cates were to be baked she displaced a stewpan in which one of tibbs delicacies were submitted to the action of the kitchen fire tibb muttered betwixt her teethand it is the broth for my sick bairn that maun make room for the dainty southrons wastelbread it was a blithe time in wight wallaces day or good king roberts when the pockpuddings gat naething here but hard straiks and bloody crowns but we will see how it will a end  elspeth did not think it proper to notice these discontented expressions of tibbie but they sunk into her mind for she was apt to consider her as a sort of authority in matters of war and policy with which her former experience as bowerwoman at avenel castle made her better acquainted than were the peaceful inhabitants of halidome she only spoke however to express her surprise that the hunters did not return  an they come not back the sooner said tibb they will fare the waur for the meat will be roasted to a cinderand there is poor simmie that can turn the spit nae langer the bairn is melting like an icicle in warm watergang awa bairn and take a mouthful of the caller air and i will turn the broach till ye come back  rin up to the bartizan at the towerhead callant said dame glendinning the air will be callerer there than ony gate else and bring us word if our halbert and the gentleman are coming down the glen  the boy lingered long enough to allow his substitute tibb tacket heartily to tire of her own generosity and of his cricketstool by the side of a huge fire he at length returned with the news that he had seen nobody  the matter was not so remarkable as far as halbert glendinning was concerned for patient alike of want and of fatigue it was no uncommon circumstance for him to remain in the wilds till curfew time but nobody had given sir piercie shafton credit for being so keen a sportsman and the idea of an englishman preferring the chase to his dinner was altogether inconsistent with their preconceptions of the national character amidst wondering and conjecturing the usual dinnerhour passed long away and the inmates of the tower taking a hasty meal themselves adjourned their more solemn preparations until the hunters return at night since it seemed now certain that their sport had either carried them to a greater distance or engaged them for a longer time than had been expected  about four hours after noon arrived not the expected sportsmen but an unlooked for visitant the subprior from the monastery the scene of the preceding day had dwelt on the mind of father eustace who was of that keen and penetrating cast of mind which loves not to leave unascertained whatever of mysterious is subjected to its inquiry his kindness was interested in the family of glendearg which he had now known for a long time and besides the community was interested in the preservation of the peace betwixt sir piercie shafton and his youthful host since whatever might draw public attention on the former could not fail to be prejudicial to the monastery which was already threatened by the hand of power he found the family assembled all but mary avenel and was informed that halbert glendinning had accompanied the stranger on a days sport so far was well they had not returned but when did youth and sport conceive themselves bound by set hours and the circumstance excited no alarm in his mind  while he was conversing with edward glendinning touching his progress in the studies he had pointed out to him they were startled by a shriek from mary avenels apartment which drew the whole family thither in headlong haste they found her in a swoon in the arms of old martin who was bitterly accusing himself of having killed her so indeed it seemed for her pale features and closed eyes argued rather a dead corpse than a living person  the whole family were instantly in tumult snatching her from martins arms with the eagerness of affectionate terror edward bore her to the casement that she might receive the influence of the open air the subprior who like many of his profession had some knowledge of medicine hastened to prescribe the readiest remedies which occurred to him and the terrified females contended with and impeded each other in their rival efforts to be useful  it has been ane of her weary ghaists said dame glendinning  its just a trembling on her spirits as her blessed mother used to have said tibb  its some ill news has come ower her said the millers maiden while burnt feathers cold water and all the usual means of restoring suspended animation were employed alternately and with little effect  at length a new assistant who had joined the group unobserved tendered his aid in the following termshow is this my most fair discretion what cause hath moved the ruby current of life to rush back to the citadel of the heart leaving pale those features in which it should have delighted to meander for everlet me approach her he saidwith this sovereign essence distilled by the fair hands of the divine urania and powerful to recall fugitive life even if it were trembling on the verge of departure  thus speaking sir piercie shafton knelt down and most gracefully presented to the nostrils of mary avenel a silver pouncetbox exquisitely chased containing a sponge dipt in the essence which he recommmended so highly yes gentle reader it was sir piercie shafton himself who thus unexpectedly proffered his good offices his cheeks indeed very pale and some part of his dress stained with blood but not otherwise appearing different from what he was on the preceding evening but no sooner had mary avenel opened her eyes and fixed them on the figure of the officious courtier than she screamed faintly and exclaimedsecure the murderer  those present stood aghast with astonishment and none more so than the euphuist who found himself so suddenly and so strangely accused by the patient whom he was endeavouring to succour and who repelled his attempts to yield her assistance with all the energy of abhorrence take him away she exclaimedtake away the murderer  now by my knighthood answered sir piercie your lovely faculties either of mind or body are o my most fair discretion obnubilated by some strange hallucination for either your eyes do not discern that it is piercie shafton your most devoted affability who now stands before you or else your eyes discerning truly your mind hath most erroneously concluded that he hath been guilty of some delict or violence to which his hand is a stranger no murder o most scornful discretion hath been this day done saving but that which your angry glances are now performing on your most devoted captive  he was here interrupted by the subprior who had in the meantime been speaking with martin apart and had received from him an account of the circumstances which suddenly communicated to mary avenel had thrown her into this state sir knight said the subprior in a very solemn tone yet with some hesitation circumstances have been communicated to us of a nature so extraordinary that reluctant as i am to exercise such authority over a guest of our venerable community i am constrained to request from you an explanation of them you left this tower early in the morning accompanied by a youth halbert glendinning the eldest son of this good dame and you return hither without him where and at what hour did you part company from him  the english knight paused for a moment and then repliedi marvel that your reverence employs so grave a tone to enforce so light a question  i parted with the villagio whom you call halbert glendinning some hour or twain after sunrise  and at what place i pray you said the monk  in a deep ravine where a fountain rises at the base of a huge rock an earthborn titan which heaveth up its gray head even as  spare us farther description said the subprior we know the spot but that youth hath not since been heard of and it will fall on you to account for him  my bairn my bairn exclaimed dame glendinning yes holy father make the villain account for my bairn  i swear good woman by bread and by waterwhich are the props of our life  swear by wine and wastelbread for these are the props of thy life thou greedy southron said dame glendinninga base bellygod to come here to eat the best and practise on our lives that give it to him  i tell thee woman said sir piercie shafton i did but go with thy son to the hunting  a black hunting it has been to him poor bairn replied tibb and sae i said it wad prove since i first saw the false southron snout of thee  little good comes of a piercies hunting from chevy chase till now  be silent woman said the subprior and rail not upon the english knight we do not yet know of any thing beyond suspicion  we will have his hearts blood said dame glendinning and seconded by the faithful tibbie she made such a sudden onslaught on the unlucky euphuist as must have terminated in something serious had not the monk aided by mysie happer interposed to protect him from their fury edward had left the apartment the instant the disturbance broke out and now entered sword in hand followed by martin and jasper the one having a hunting spear in his hand the other a crossbow  keep the door he said to his two attendants shoot him or stab him without mercy should he attempt to break forth if he offers an escape by heaven he shall die  how now edward said the subprior how is this that you so far forget yourself meditating violence to a guest and in my presence who represent your liege lord  edward stepped forward with his drawn sword in his hand pardon me reverend father he said but in this matter the voice of nature speaks louder and stronger than yours i turn my swords point against this proud man and i demand of him the blood of my brotherthe blood of my fathers sonof the heir of our name if he denies to give me a true account of him he shall not deny me vengeance  embarrassed as he was sir piercie shafton showed no personal fear put up thy sword he said young man not in the same day does piercie shafton contend with two peasants  hear him he confesses the deed holy father said edward  be patient my son said the subprior endeavouring to soothe the feelings which he could not otherwise control be patientthou wilt attain the ends of justice better through my means than thine own violenceand you women be silenttibb remove your mistress and mary avenel  while tibb with the assistance of the other females of the household bore the poor mother and mary avenel into separate apartments and while edward still keeping his sword in his hand hastily traversed the room as if to prevent the possibility of sir piercie shaftons escape the subprior insisted upon knowing from the perplexed knight the particulars which he knew respecting halbert glendinning his situation became extremely embarrassing for what he might with safety have told of the issue of their combat was so revolting to his pride that he could not bring himself to enter into the detail and of halberts actual fate he knew as the reader is well aware absolutely nothing  the father in the meanwhile pressed him with remonstrances and prayed him to observe he would greatly prejudice himself by declining to give a full account of the transactions of the day you cannot deny he said that yesterday you seemed to take the most violent offence at this unfortunate youth and that you suppressed your resentment so suddenly as to impress us all with surprise last night you proposed to him this days hunting party and you set out together by break of day you parted you said at the fountain near the rock about an hour or twain after sunrise and it appears that before you parted you had been at strife together  i said not so replied the knight here is a coil indeed about the absence of a rustical bondsman who i dare say hath gone off if he be gone to join the next rascally band of freebooters ye ask me a knight of the piercies lineage to account for such an insignificant fugitive and i answerlet me know the price of his head and i will pay it to your convent treasurer  you admit then that you have slain my brother said edward interfering once more i will presently show you at what price we scots rate the lives of our friends  peace edward peacei entreati command thee said the subprior and you sir knight think better of us than to suppose you may spend scottish blood and reckon for it as for wine spilt in a drunken revel  this youth was no bondsmanthou well knowest that in thine own land thou hadst not dared to lift thy sword against the meanest subject of england but her laws would have called thee to answer for the deed do not hope it will be otherwise here for you will but deceive yourself  you drive me beyond my patience said the euphuist even as the overdriven ox is urged into madnesswhat can i tell you of a young fellow whom i have not seen since the second hour after sunrise  but can you explain in what circumstances you parted with him said the monk  what are the circumstances in the devils name which you desire should be explainedfor although i protest against this constraint as alike unworthy and inhospitable yet would i willingly end this fray provided that by words it may be ended said the knight  if these end it not said edward blows shall and that full speedily  peace impatient boy said the subprior and do you sir piercie shafton acquaint me why the ground is bloody by the verge of the fountain in corrinanshian where as you say yourself you parted from halbert glendinning  resolute not to avow his defeat if possibly he could avoid it the knight answered in a haughty tone that he supposed it was no unusual thing to find the turf bloody where hunters had slain a deer  and did you bury your game as well as kill it said the monk we must know from you who is the tenant of that grave that newlymade grave beside the very fountain whose margin is so deeply crimsoned with bloodthou seest thou canst not evade me therefore be ingenuous and tell us the fate of this unhappy youth whose body is doubtless lying under that bloody turf  if it be said sir piercie they must have buried him alive for i swear to thee reverend father that this rustic juvenal parted from me in perfect health let the grave be searched and if his body be found then deal with me as ye list  it is not my sphere to determine thy fate sir knight but that of the lord abbot and the right reverend chapter it is but my duty to collect such information as may best possess their wisdom with the matters which have chanced  might i presume so far reverend father said the knight i should wish to know the author and evidence of all these suspicions so unfoundedly urged against me  it is soon told said the subprior nor do i wish to disguise it if it can avail you in your defence this maiden mary avenel apprehending that you nourished malice against her fosterbrother under a friendly brow did advisedly send up the old man martin tacket to follow your footsteps and to prevent mischief but it seems that your evil passions had outrun precaution for when he came to the spot guided by your footsteps upon the dew he found but the bloody turf and the new covered grave and after long and vain search through the wilds after halbert and yourself he brought back the sorrowful news to her who had sent him  saw he not my doublet i pray you said sir piercie for when i came to myself i found that i was wrapped in my cloak but without my under garment as your reverence may observe  so saying he opened his cloak forgetting with his characteristical inconsistency that he showed his shirt stained with blood  how cruel man said the monk when he observed this confirmation of his suspicions wilt thou deny the guilt even while thou bearest on thy person the blood thou hast shedwilt thou longer deny that thy rash hand has robbed a mother of a son our community of a vassal the queen of scotland of a liege subject and what canst thou expect but that at the least we deliver thee up to england as undeserving our farther protection  by the saints said the knight now driven to extremity if this blood be the witness against me it is but rebel blood since this morning at sunrise it flowed within my own veins  how were that possible sir piercie shafton said the monk since i see no wound from whence it can have flowed  that said the knight is the most mysterious part of the transaction see here  so saying he undid his shirt collar and opening his bosom showed the spot throughwhich halberts sword had passed but already cicatrized and bearing the appearance of a wound lately healed  this exhausts my patience sir knight said the subprior and is adding insult to violence and injury do you hold me for a child or an idiot that you pretend to make me believe that the fresh blood with which your shirt is stained flowed from a wound which has been healed for weeks or months unhappy mocker thinkest thou thus to blind us too well do we know that it is the blood of your victim wrestling with you in the desperate and mortal struggle which has thus dyed your apparel  the knight after a moments recollection said in reply i will be open with you my fatherbid these men stand out of earshot and i will tell you all i know of this mysterious business and muse not good father though it may pass thy wit to expound it for i avouch to you it is too dark for mine own  the monk commanded edward and the two men to withdraw assuring the former that his conference with the prisoner should be brief and giving him permission to keep watch at the door of the apartment without which allowance he might perhaps have had some difficulty in procuring his absence edward had no sooner left the chamber than he despatched messengers to one or two families of the halidome with whose sons his brother and he sometimes associated to tell them that halbert glendinning had been murdered by an englishman and to require them to repair to the tower of glendearg without delay the duty of revenge in such cases was held so sacred that he had no reason to doubt they would instantly come with such assistance as would ensure the detention of the prisoner  he then locked the doors of the tower both inner and outer and also the gate of the courtyard having taken these precautions he made a hasty visit to the females of the family exhausting himself in efforts to console them and in protestations that he would have vengeance for his murdered brother     chapter the twentyseventh     now by our lady sherifftis hard reckoning   that i with every odds of birth and barony   should be detaind here for the casual death   of a wild forester whose utmost having   is but the brazen buckle of the belt   in which he sticks his hedgeknife                                         old play  while edward was making preparations for securing and punishing the supposed murderer of his brother with an intense thirst for vengeance which had not hitherto shown itself as part of his character sir piercie shafton made such communications as it pleased him to the subprior who listened with great attention though the knights narrative was none of the clearest especially as his selfconceit led him to conceal or abridge the details which were necessary to render it intelligible  you are to know he said reverend father that this rustical juvenal having chosen to offer me in the presence of your venerable superior yourself and other excellent and worthy persons besides the damsel mary avenel whom i term my discretion in all honour and kindness a gross insult rendered yet more intolerable by the time and place my just resentment did so gain the mastery over my discretion that i resolved to allow him the privileges of an equal and to indulge him with the combat  but sir knight said the subprior you still leave two matters very obscure first why the token he presented to you gave you so much offence as i with others witnessed and then again how the youth whom you then met for the first or at least the second time knew so much of your history as enabled him so greatly to move you  the knight coloured very deeply  for your first query he said most reverend father we will if you please pretermit it as nothing essential to the matter in hand and for the secondi protest to you that i know as little of his means of knowledge as you do and that i am wellnigh persuaded he deals with sathanas of which more anonwell sirin the evening i failed not to veil my purpose with a pleasant brow as is the custom amongst us martialists who never display the bloody colours of defiance in our countenance until our hand is armed to fight under them i amused the fair discretion with some canzonettes and other toys which could not but be ravishing to her inexperienced ears i arose in the morning and met my antagonist who to say truth for an inexperienced villagio comported himself as stoutly as i could have desiredso coming to the encounter reverend sir i did try his mettle with some halfadozen of downright passes with any one of which i could have been through his body only that i was loth to take so fatal an advantage but rather mixing mercy with my just indignation studied to inflict upon him some fleshwound of no very fatal quality but sir in the midst of my clemency he being instigated i think by the devil did follow up his first offence with some insult of the same nature whereupon being eager to punish him i made an estramazone and my foot slipping at the same timenot from any fault of fence on my part or any advantage of skill on his but the devil having as i said taken up the matter in hand and the grass being slipperyere i recovered my position i encountered his sword which he had advanced with my undefended person so that as i think i was in some sort run through the body my juvenal being beyond measure appalled at his own unexpected and unmerited success in this strange encounter takes the flight and leaves me there and i fall into a dead swoon for the lack of the blood i had lost so foolishlyand when i awake as from a sound sleep i find myself lying an it like you wrapt up in my cloak at the foot of one of the birchtrees which stand together in a clump near to this place  i feel my limbs and experience little pain but much weaknessi put my hand to the woundit was whole and skinned over as you now see iti rise and come hither and in these words you have my whole days story  i can only reply to so strange a tale answered the monk that it is scarce possible that sir piercie shafton can expect me to credit it here is a quarrel the cause of which you conceala wound received in the morning of which there is no recent appearance at sunseta grave filled up in which no body is depositedthe vanquished found alive and wellthe victor departed no man knows whither these things sir knight hang not so well together that i should receive them as gospel  reverend father answered sir piercie shafton i pray you in the first place to observe that if i offer peaceful and civil justification of that which i have already averred to be true i do so only in devout deference to your dress and to your order protesting that to any other opposite saving a man of religion a lady or my liege prince i would not deign to support that which i had once attested otherwise than with the point of my good sword and so much being premised i have to add that i can but gage my honour as a gentleman and my faith as a catholic christian that the things which i have described to you have happened to me as i have described them and not otherwise  it is a deep assertion sir knight answered the subprior yet bethink you it is only an assertion and that no reason can be alleged why things should be believed which are so contrary to reason let me pray you to say whether the grave which has been seen at your place of combat was open or closed when your encounter took place  reverend father said the knight i will veil from you nothing but show you each secret of my bosom even as the pure fountain revealeth the smallest pebble which graces the sand at the bottom of its crystal mirror and as  speak in plain terms for the love of heaven said the monk these holiday phrases belong not to solemn affairswas the grave open when the conflict began  it was answered the knight i acknowledge it even as he that acknowledgeth  nay i pray you fair son forbear these similitudes and observe me on yesterday at even no grave was found in that place for old martin chanced contrary to his wont to go thither in quest of a strayed sheep at break of day by your own confession a grave was opened in that spot and there a combat was foughtonly one of the combatants appears and he is covered with blood and to all appearance woundlesshere the knight made a gesture of impatiencenay fair son hear me but one momentthe grave is closed and covered by the sodwhat can we believe but that it conceals the bloody corpse of the fallen duellist  by heaven it cannot said the knight unless the juvenal hath slain himself and buried himself in order to place me in the predicament of his murderer  the grave shall doubtless be explored and that by tomorrows dawn said the monk i will see it done with mine own eyes  but said the prisoner i protest against all evidence which may arise from its contents and do insist beforehand that whatever may be found in that grave shall not prejudice me in my defence i have been so haunted by diabolical deceptions in this matter that what do i know but that the devil may assume the form of this rustical juvenal in order to procure me farther vexationi protest to you holy father it is my very thought that there is witchcraft in all that hath befallen me since i entered into this northern land in which men say that sorceries do abound i who am held in awe and regard even by the prime gallants in the court of feliciana have been here bearded and taunted by a clodtreading clown i whom vincentio saviola termed his nimblest and most agile disciple was to speak briefly foiled by a cowboy who knew no more of fence than is used at every country wake i am run as it seemed to me through the body with a very sufficient stoccata and faint on the spot and yet when i recover i find myself without either wem or wound and lacking nothing of my apparel saving my murreycoloured doublet slashed with satin which i will pray may be inquired after lest the devil who transported me should have dropped it in his passage among some of the trees or bushesit being a choice and most fanciful piece of raiment which i wore for the first time at the queens pageant in southwark  sir knight said the monk you do again go astray from this matter i inquire of you respecting that which concerns the life of another man and it may be touches your own also and you answer me with the tale of an old doublet  old exclaimed the knight now by the gods and saints if there be a gallant at the british court more fancifully considerate and more considerately fanciful but quaintly curious and more curiously quaint in frequent changes of all rich articles of vesture becoming one who may be accounted pointdevice a courtier i will give you leave to term me a slave and a liar  the monk thought but did not say that he had already acquired right to doubt the veracity of the euphuist considering the marvellous tale which he had told yet his own strange adventure and that of father philip rushed on his mind and forbade his coming to any conclusion he contented himself therefore with observing that these were certainly strange incidents and requested to know if sir piercie shafton had any other reason for suspecting himself to be in a manner so particularly selected for the sport of sorcery and witchcraft  sir subprior said the euphuist the most extraordinary circumstance remains behind which alone had i neither been bearded in dispute nor foiled in combat nor wounded and cured in the space of a few hours would nevertheless of itself and without any other corroborative have compelled me to believe myself the subject of some malevolent fascination  reverend sir it is not to your ears that men should tell tales of love and gallantry nor is sir piercie shafton one who to any ears whatsoever is wont to boast of his fair acceptance with the choice and prime beauties of the court insomuch that a lady none of the least resplendent constellations which revolve in that hemisphere of honour pleasure and beauty but whose name i here pretermit was wont to call me her taciturnity nevertheless truth must be spoken and i cannot but allow as the general report of the court allowed in camps and echoed back by city and country that in the alacrity of the accost the tender delicacy of the regard the facetiousness of the address the adopting and pursuing of the fancy the solemn close and the graceful falloff piercie shafton was accounted the only gallant of the time and so well accepted among the choicer beauties of the age that no silkhosed reveller of the presencechamber or plumed jouster of the tiltyard approached him by a bows length in the ladies regard being the mark at which every wellborn and generous juvenal aimeth his shaft  nevertheless reverend sir having found in this rude place something which by blood and birth might be termed a lady and being desirous to keep my gallant humour in exercise as well as to show my sworn devotion to the sex in general i did shoot off some arrows of compliment at this mary avenel terming her my discretion with other quaint and wellimagined courtesies rather bestowed out of my bounty than warranted by her merit or perchance like unto the boyish fowler who rather than not exercise his birdpiece will shoot at crows or magpies for lack of better game  mary avenel is much obliged by your notice answered the monk but to what does all this detail of past and present gallantry conduct us  marry to this conclusion answered the knight that either this my discretion or i myself am little less than bewitched for instead of receiving my accost with a gratifying bow answering my regard with a suppressed smile accompanying my falling off or departure with a slight sighhonours with which i protest to you the noblest dancers and proudest beauties in feliciana have graced my poor servicesshe hath paid me as little and as cold regard as if i had been some hobnailed clown of these bleak mountains nay this very day while i was in the act of kneeling at her feet to render her the succours of this pungent quintessence of purest spirit distilled by the fairest hands of the court of feliciana she pushed me from her with looks which savoured of repugnance and as i think thrust at me with her foot as if to spurn me from her presence these things reverend father are strange portentous unnatural and befall not in the current of mortal affairs but are symptomatic of sorcery and fascination  so that having given to your reverence a perfect simple and plain account of all that i know concerning this matter i leave it to your wisdom to solve what may be found soluble in the same it being my purpose tomorrow with the peep of dawn to set forward towards edinburgh  i grieve to be an interruption to your designs sir knight said the monk but that purpose of thine may hardly be fulfilled  how reverend father said the knight with an air of the utmost surprise if what you say respects my departure understand that it must be for i have so resolved it  sir knight reiterated the subprior i must once more repeat this cannot be until the abbots pleasure be known in the matter  reverend sir said the knight drawing himself up with great dignity i desire my hearty and thankful commendations to the abbot but in this matter i have nothing to do with his reverend pleasure designing only to consult my own  pardon me said the subprior the lord abbot hath in this matter a voice potential  sir piercie shaftons colour began to risei marvel he said to hear your reverence talk thuswhat will you for the imagined death of a rude lowborn frampler and wrangler venture to impinge upon the liberty of the kinsman of the house of piercie  sir knight returned the subprior civilly your high lineage and your kindling anger will avail you nothing in this matteryou shall not come here to seek a shelter and then spill our blood as if it were water  i tell you said the knight once more as i have told you already that there was no blood spilled but mine own  that remains to be proved replied the subprior we of the community of saint marys of kennaquhair use not to take fairy tales in exchange for the lives of our liege vassals  we of the house of piercie answered shafton brook neither threats nor restrainti say i will travel tomorrow happen what may  and i answered the subprior in the same tone of determination say that i will break your journey come what may  who shall gainsay me said the knight if i make my way by force  you will judge wisely to think ere you make such an attempt answered the monk with composure there are men enough in the halidome to vindicate its rights over those who dare infringe them  my cousin of northumberland will know how to revenge this usage to a beloved kinsman so near to his blood said the englishman  the lord abbot will know how to protect the rights of his territory both with the temporal and spiritual sword said the monk besides consider were we to send you to your kinsman at alnwick or warkworth tomorrow he dare do nothing but transmit you in fetters to the queen of england bethink sir knight that you stand on slippery ground and will act most wisely in reconciling yourself to be a prisoner in this place until the abbot shall decide the matter there are armed men enow to countervail all your efforts at escape let patience and resignation therefore arm you to a necessary submission  so saying he clapped his hands and called aloud edward entered accompanied by two young men who had already joined him and were well armed  edward said the subprior you will supply the english knight here in this spence with suitable food and accommodation for the night treating him with as much kindness as if nothing had happened between you but you will place a sufficient guard and look carefully that he make not his escape should he attempt to break forth resist him to the death but in no other case harm a hair of his head as you shall be answerable  edward glendinning repliedthat i may obey your commands reverend sir i will not again offer myself to this persons presence for shame it were to me to break the peace of the halidome but not less shame to leave my brothers death unavenged  as he spoke his lips grew livid the blood forsook his cheek and he was about to leave the apartment when the subprior recalled him and said in a solemn toneedward i have known you from infancyi have done what lay within my reach to be of use to youi say nothing of what you owe to me as the representative of your spiritual superiori say nothing of the duty from the vassal to the subpriorbut father eustace expects from the pupil whom he has nurturedhe expects from edward glendinning that he will not by any deed of sudden violence however justified in his own mind by the provocation break through the respect due to public justice or that which he has an especial right to claim from him  fear nothing my reverend father for so in an hundred senses may i well term you said the young man fear not i would say that i will in any thing diminish the respect i owe to the venerable community by whom we have so long been protected far less that i will do aught which can be personally less than respectful to you but the blood of my brother must not cry for vengeance in vainyour reverence knows our border creed  vengeance is mine saith the lord and i will requite it answered the monk the heathenish custom of deadly feud which prevails in this land through which each man seeks vengeance at his own hand when the death of a friend or kinsman has chanced hath already deluged our vales with the blood of scottish men spilled by the hands of countrymen and kindred it were endless to count up the fatal results on the eastern border the homes are at feud with the swintons and cockburns in our middle marches the scotts and kerrs have spilled as much brave blood in domestic feud as might have fought a pitched field in england could they have but forgiven and forgotten a casual rencounter that placed their names in opposition to each other on the west frontier the johnstones are at war with the maxwells the jardines with the bells drawing with them the flower of the country which should place their breasts as a bulwark against england into private and bloody warfare of which it is the only end to waste and impair the forces of the country already divided in itself do not my dear son edward permit this bloody prejudice to master your mind i cannot ask you to think of the crime supposed as if the blood spilled had been less dear to youalas i know that is impossible but i do require you in proportion to your interest in the supposed sufferer for as yet the whole is matter of supposition to bear on your mind the evidence on which the guilt of the accused person must be tried he hath spoken with me and i confess his tale is so extraordinary that i should have without a moments hesitation rejected it as incredible but that an affair which chanced to myself in this very glenmore of that another timesuffice it for the present to say that from what i have myself experienced i deem it possible that extraordinary as sir piercie shaftons story may seem i hold it not utterly impossible  father said edward glendinning when he saw that his preceptor paused unwilling farther to explain upon what grounds he was inclined to give a certain degree of credit to sir piercie shaftons story while he admitted it as improbablefather to me you have been in every sense  you know that my hand grasped more readily to the book than to the sword and that i lacked utterly the ready and bold spirit which distinguished here his voice faltered and he paused for a moment and then went on with resolution and rapidityi would say that i was unequal to halbert in promptitude of heart and of hand but halbert is gone and i stand his representative and that of my fatherhis successor in all his rights while he said this his eyes shot fire and bound to assert and maintain them as he would have donetherefore i am a changed man increased in courage as in my rights and pretensions and reverend father respectfully but plainly and firmly do i say his blood if it has been shed by this man shall be atonedhalbert shall not sleep neglected in his lonely grave as if with him the spirit of my father had ceased forever his blood flows in my veins and while his has been poured forth unrequited mine will permit me no rest my poverty and meanness of rank shall not avail the lordly murderer my calm nature and peaceful studies shall not be his protection  even the obligations holy father which i acknowledge to you shall not be his protection i wait with patience the judgment of the abbot and chapter for the slaughter of one of their most anciently descended vassals if they do right to my brothers memory it is well but mark me father if they shall fail in rendering me that justice i bear a heart and a hand which though i love not such extremities are capable of remedying such an error  he who takes up my brothers succession must avenge his death  the monk perceived with surprise that edward with his extreme diffidence humility and obedient assiduity for such were his general characteristics had still boiling in his veins the wild principles of those from whom he was descended and by whom he was surrounded his eyes sparkled his frame was agitated and the extremity of his desire for vengeance seemed to give a vehemence to his manner resembling the restlessness of joy  may god help us said father eustace for frail wretches as we are we cannot help ourselves under sudden and strong temptationedward i will rely on your word that you do nothing rashly  that will i not said edwardthat my better than father i surely will not but the blood of my brotherthe tears of my motherandandand of mary avenel shall not be shed in vain i will not deceive you fatherif this piercie shafton hath slain my brother he dies if the whole blood of the whole house of piercie were in his veins  there was a deep and solemn determination in the utterance of edward glendinning expressive of a rooted resolution the subprior sighed deeply and for the moment yielded to circumstances and urged the acquiescence of his pupil no farther he commanded lights to be placed in the lower chamber which for a time he paced in silence  a thousand ideas and even differing principles debated with each other in his bosom he greatly doubted the english knights account of the duel and of what had followed it yet the extraordinary and supernatural circumstances which had befallen the sacristan and himself in that very glen prevented him from being absolutely incredulous on the score of the wonderful wound and recovery of sir piercie shafton and prevented him from at once condemning as impossible that which was altogether improbable then he was at a loss how to control the fraternal affections of edward with respect to whom he felt something like the keeper of a wild animal a lions whelp or tigers cub which he has held under his command from infancy but which when grown to maturity on some sudden provocation displays his fangs and talons erects his crest resumes his savage nature and bids defiance at once to his keeper and to all mankind  how to restrain and mitigate an ire which the universal example of the times rendered deadly and inveterate was sufficient cause of anxiety to father eustace but he had also to consider the situation of his community dishonoured and degraded by submitting to suffer the slaughter of a vassal to pass unavenged a circumstance which of itself might in those times have afforded pretext for a revolt among their wavering adherents or on the other hand exposed the community to imminent danger should they proceed against a subject of england of high degree connected with the house of northumberland and other northern families of high rank who as they possessed the means could not be supposed to lack inclination to wreak upon the patrimony of saint mary of kennaquhair any violence which might be offered to their kinsman  in either case the subprior well knew that the ostensible cause of feud insurrection or incursion being once afforded the case would not be ruled either by reason or by evidence and he groaned in spirit when upon counting up the chances which arose in this ambiguous dilemma he found he had only a choice of difficulties he was a monk but he felt also as a man indignant at the supposed slaughter of young glendinning by one skilful in all the practice of arms in which the vassal of the monastery was most likely to be deficient and to aid the resentment which he felt for the loss of a youth whom he had known from infancy came in full force the sense of dishonour arising to his community from passing over so gross an insult unavenged then the light in which it might be viewed by those who at present presided in the stormy court of scotland attached as they were to the reformation and allied by common faith and common interest with queen elizabeth was a formidable subject of apprehension the subprior well knew how they lusted after the revenues of the church to express it in the ordinary phrase of the religious of the time and how readily they would grasp at such a pretext for encroaching on those of saint marys as would be afforded by the suffering to pass unpunished the death of a native scottishman by a catholic englishman a rebel to queen elizabeth  on the other hand to deliver up to england or which was nearly the same thing the scottish administration an english knight leagued with the piercie by kindred and political intrigue a faithful follower of the catholic church who had fled to the halidome for protection was in the estimation of the subprior an act most unworthy in itself and meriting the malediction of heaven besides being moreover fraught with great temporal risk  if the government of scotland was now almost entirely in the hands of the protestant party the queen was still a catholic and there was no knowing when amid the sudden changes which agitated that tumultuous country she might find herself at the head of her own affairs and able to protect those of her own faith then if the court of england and its queen were zealously protestant the northern counties whose friendship or enmity were of most consequence in the first instance to the community of saint marys contained many catholics the heads of whom were able and must be supposed willing to avenge any injury suffered by sir piercie shafton  on either side the subprior thinking according to his sense of duty most anxiously for the safety and welfare of his monastery saw the greatest risk of damage blame inroad and confiscation the only course on which he could determine was to stand by the helm like a resolute pilot watch every contingence do his best to weather each reef and shoal and commit the rest to heaven and his patroness  as he left the apartment the knight called after him beseeching he would order his trunkmails to be sent into his apartment understanding he was to be guarded there for the night as he wished to make some alteration in his apparel  footnote sir piercie shaftons extreme love of dress was an attribute of the coxcombs of this period the display made by their forefathers was in the numbers of their retinue but as the actual influence of the nobility began to be restrained both in france and england by the increasing power of the crown the indulgence of vanity in personal display became more inordinate there are many allusions to this change of custom in shakspeare and other dramatic writers where the reader may find mention made of    bonds enterd into   for gay apparel against the triumph day  jonson informs us that for the first entrance of a gallant twere good you turned four or five hundred acres of your best land into two or three trunks of apparelevery man out of his humour  in the memorie of the somerville family a curious instance occurs of this fashionable species of extravagance  in the year 1537 when james v brought over his shortlived bride from france the lord somerville of the day was so profuse in the expense of his apparel that the money which he borrowed on the occasion was compensated by a perpetual annuity of threescore pounds scottish payable out of the barony of carnwarth till doomsday which was assigned by the creditor to saint magdalens chapel by this deep expense the lord somerville had rendered himself so glorious in apparel that the king who saw so brave a gallant enter the gate of holyrood followed by only two pages called upon several of the courtiers to ascertain who it could be who was so richly dressed and so slightly attended and he was not recognised until he entered the presencechamber you are very brave my lord said the king as he received his homage but where are all your men and attendants the lord somerville readily answered if it please your majesty here they are pointing to the lace that was on his own and his pages clothes whereat the king laughed heartily and having surveyed the finery more nearly bade him have away with it all and let him have his stout band of spears again  there is a scene in jonsons every man out of his humour act iv scene 6 in which a euphuist of the time gives an account of the effects of a duel on the clothes of himself and his opponent and never departs a syllable from the catalogue of his wardrobe we shall insert it in evidence

with a laced jerkin and a cap and bellsi must now to the melancholy work of consoling that which is wellnigh inconsolable a mother weeping for her firstborn  advancing after a gentle knock into the apartment of the women he found that mary avenel had retired to bed extremely indisposed and that dame glendinning and tibb were indulging their sorrows by the side of a decaying fire and by the light of a small iron lamp or cruize as it was termed poor elspeths apron was thrown over her head and bitterly did she sob and weep for her beautiful her bravethe very image of her dear simon glendinning the stay of her widowhood and the support of her old age  the faithful tibb echoed her complaints and more violently clamorous made deep promises of revenge on sir piercie shafton if there were a man left in the south who could draw a whinger or a woman that could thraw a rape the presence of the subprior imposed silence on these clamours he sate down by the unfortunate mother and essayed by such topics as his religion and reason suggested to interrupt the current of dame glendinnings feelings but the attempt was in vain she listened indeed with some little interest while he pledged his word and his influence with the abbot that the family which had lost their eldestborn by means of a guest received at his command should experience particular protection at the hands of the community and that the fief which belonged to simon glendinning should with extended bounds and added privileges be conferred on edward  but it was only for a very brief space that the mothers sobs were apparently softer and her grief more mild she soon blamed herself for casting a moments thought upon worlds gear while poor halbert was lying stretched in his bloody shirt the subprior was not more fortunate when he promised that halberts body should be removed to hallowed ground and his soul secured by the prayers of the church in his behalf grief would have its natural course and the voice of the comforter was wasted in vain     chapter the twentyeighth     he is at liberty i have ventured for him   if the law   find and condemn me fort some living wenches   some honesthearted maids will sing my dirge   and tell to memory my death was noble   dying almost a martyr                             the two noble kinsmen  the subprior of saint marys in taking his departure from the spence which sir piercie shafton was confined and in which some preparations were made for his passing the night as the room which might be most conveniently guarded left more than one perplexed person behind him there was connected with this chamber and opening into it a small outshot or projecting part of the building occupied by a sleeping apartment which upon ordinary occasions was that of mary avenel and which in the unusual number of guests who had come to the tower on the former evening had also accommodated mysie happer the millers daughter for anciently as well as in the present day a scottish house was always rather too narrow and limited for the extent of the owners hospitality and some shift and contrivance was necessary upon any unusual occasion to ensure the accommodation of all the guests  the fatal news of halbert glendinnings death had thrown all former arrangements into confusion mary avenel whose case required immediate attention had been transported into the apartment hitherto occupied by halbert and his brother as the latter proposed to watch all night in order to prevent the escape of the prisoner poor mysie had been altogether overlooked and had naturally enough betaken herself to the little apartment which she had hitherto occupied ignorant that the spence through which lay the only access to it was to be the sleeping chamber of sir piercie shafton the measures taken for securing him there had been so sudden that she was not aware of it until she found that the other females had been removed from the spence by the subpriors direction and having once missed the opportunity of retreating along with them bashfulness and the high respect which she was taught to bear to the monks prevented her venturing forth alone and intruding herself on the presence of father eustace while in secret conference with the southron there appeared no remedy but to wait till their interview was over and as the door was thin and did not shut very closely she could hear every word that passed betwixt them  it thus happened that without any intended intrusion on her part she became privy to the whole conversation of the subprior and the english knight and could also observe from the window of her little retreat that more than one of the young men summoned by edward arrived successively at the tower these circumstances led her to entertain most serious apprehension that the life of sir piercie shafton was in great and instant peril  woman is naturally compassionate and not less willingly so when youth and fair features are on the side of him who claims her sympathy the handsome presence elaborate dress and address of sir piercie shafton which had failed to make any favorable impression on the grave and lofty character of mary avenel had completely dazzled and bewildered the poor maid of the mill the knight had perceived this result and flattered by seeing that his merit was not universally underrated he had bestowed on mysie a good deal more of his courtesy than in his opinion her rank warranted it was not cast away but received with a devout sense of his condescension and with gratitude for his personal notice which joined to her fears for his safety and the natural tenderness of her disposition began to make wild work in her heart  to be sure it was very wrong in him to slay halbert glendinning it was thus she argued the case with herself but then he was a gentleman born and a soldier and so gentle and courteous withal that she was sure the quarrel had been all of young glendinnings own seeking for it was well known that both these lads were so taken up with that mary avenel that they never looked at another lass in the halidome more than if they were of a different degree and then halberts dress was as clownish as his manners were haughty and this poor young gentleman who was habited like any prince banished from his own land was first drawn into a quarrel by a rude brangler and then persecuted and like to be put to death by his kin and allies  mysie wept bitterly at the thought and then her heart rising against such cruelty and oppression to a defenceless stranger who dressed with so much skill and spoke with so much grace she began to consider whether she could not render him some assistance in this extremity  her mind was now entirely altered from its original purpose at first her only anxiety had been to find the means of escaping from the interior apartment without being noticed by any one but now she began to think that heaven had placed her there for the safety and protection of the persecuted stranger she was of a simple and affectionate but at the same time an alert and enterprising character possessing more than female strength of body and more than female courage though with feelings as capable of being bewildered with gallantry of dress and language as a fine gentleman of any generation would have desired to exercise his talents upon i will save him she thought that is the first thing to be resolvedand then i wonder what he will say to the poor millers maiden that has done for him what all the dainty dames in london or holyrood would have been afraid to venture upon  prudence began to pull her sleeve as she indulged speculations so hazardous and hinted to her that the warmer sir piercie shaftons gratitude might prove it was the more likely to be fraught with danger to his benefactress  alas poor prudence thou mayest say with our moral teacher    i preach for ever but i preach in vain  the millers maiden while you pour your warning into her unwilling bosom has glanced her eye on the small mirror by which she has placed her little lamp and it returns to her a countenance and eyes pretty and sparkling at all times but ennobled at present with the energy of expression proper to those who have dared to form and stand prepared to execute deeds of generous audacity will these featureswill these eyes joined to the benefit i am about to confer upon sir piercie shafton do nothing towards removing the distance of rank between us  such was the question which female vanity asked of fancy and though even fancy dared not answer in a ready affirmative a middle conclusion was adoptedlet me first succour the gallant youth and trust to fortune for the rest  banishing therefore from her mind every thing that was personal to herself the rash but generous girl turned her whole thoughts to the means of executing this enterprise  the difficulties which interposed were of no ordinary nature the vengeance of the men of that country in cases of deadly feud that is in cases of a quarrel excited by the slaughter of any of their relations was one of their most marked characteristics and edward however gentle in other respects was so fond of his brother that there could be no doubt that he would be as signal in his revenge as the customs of the country authorized  there were to be passed the inner door of the apartment the two gates of the tower itself and the gate of the courtyard ere the prisoner was at liberty and then a guide and means of flight were to be provided otherwise ultimate escape was impossible but where the will of woman is strongly bent on the accomplishment of such a purpose her wit is seldom baffled by difficulties however embarrassing  the subprior had not long left the apartment ere mysie had devised a scheme for sir piercie shaftons freedom daring indeed but likely to be successful if dexterously conducted it was necessary however that she should remain where she was till so late an hour that all in the tower should have betaken themselves to repose excepting those whose duty made them watchers the interval she employed in observing the movements of the person in whose service she was thus boldly a volunteer  she could hear sir piercie shafton pace the floor to and fro in reflection doubtless on his own untoward fate and precarious situation by and by she heard him making a rustling among his trunks which agreeable to the order of the subprior had been placed in the apartment to which he was confined and which he was probably amusing more melancholy thoughts by examining and arranging then she could hear him resume his walk through the room and as if his spirits had been somewhat relieved and elevated by the survey of his wardrobe she could distinguish that at one turn he half recited a sonnet at another half whistled a galliard and at the third hummed a saraband at length she could understand that he extended himself on the temporary couch which had been allotted to him after muttering his prayers hastily and in a short time she concluded he must be fast asleep  she employed the moment which intervened in considering her enterprise under every different aspect and dangerous as it was the steady review which she took of the various perils accompanying her purpose furnished her with plausible devices for obviating them love and generous compassion which give singly such powerful impulse to the female heart were in this case united and championed her to the last extremity of hazard  it was an hour past midnight all in the tower slept sound but those who had undertaken to guard the english prisoner or if sorrow and suffering drove sleep from the bed of dame glendinning and her fosterdaughter they were too much wrapt in their own griefs to attend to external sounds  the means of striking light were at hand in the small apartment and thus the millers maiden was enabled to light and trim a small lamp with a trembling step and throbbing heart she undid the door which separated her from the apartment in which the southron knight was confined and almost flinched from her fixed purpose when she found herself in the same room with the sleeping prisoner she scarcely trusted herself to look upon him as he lay wrapped in his cloak and fast asleep upon the pallet bed but turned her eyes away while she gently pulled his mantle with no more force than was just equal to awaken him he moved not until she had twitched his cloak a second and a third time and then at length looking up was about to make an exclamation in the suddenness of his surprise  mysies bashfulness was conquered by her fear she placed her fingers on her lips in token that he must observe the most strict silence and then pointed to the door to intimate that it was watched  sir piercie shafton now collected himself and sat upright on his couch  he gazed with surprise on the graceful figure of the young woman who stood before him her wellformed person her flowing hair and the outline of her features showed dimly and yet to advantage by the partial and feeble light which she held in her hand the romantic imagination of the gallant would soon have coined some compliment proper for the occasion but mysie left him not time  i come she said to save your life which is else in great perilif you answer me speak as low as you can for they have sentinelled your door with armed men  comeliest of millers daughters answered sir piercie who by this time was sitting upright on his couch dread nothing for my safety credit me that as in very truth i have not spilled the red puddle which these villagios call the blood of their most uncivil relation so i am under no apprehension whatever for the issue of this restraint seeing that it cannot but be harmless to me natheless to thee o most molendinar beauty i return the thanks which thy courtesy may justly claim  nay but sir knight answered the maiden in a whisper as low as it was tremulous i deserve no thanks unless you will act by my counsel edward glendinning hath sent for dan of the howlethirst and young adie of aikenshaw and they are come with three men more and with bow and jack and spear and i heard them say to each other and to edward as they alighted in the court that they would have amends for the death of their kinsman if the monks cowl should smoke for itand the vassals are so wilful now that the abbot himself dare not control them for fear they turn heretics and refuse to pay their feuduties  in faith said sir piercie shafton it may be a shrewd temptation and perchance the monks may rid themselves of trouble and cumber by handing me over the march to sir john foster or lord hundson the english wardens and so make peace with their vassals and with england at once  fairest molinara i will for once walk by thy rede and if thou dost contrive to extricate me from this vile kennel i will so celebrate thy wit and beauty that the bakers nymph of raphael durbino shall seem but a gipsey in comparison of my molinara  i pray you then be silent said the millers daughter for if your speech betrays that you are awake my scheme fails utterly and it is heavens mercy and our ladys that we are not already overheard and discovered  i am silent replied the southron even as the starless nightbut yetif this contrivance of thine should endanger thy safety fair and no less kind than fair damsel it were utterly unworthy of me to accept it at thy hand  do not think of me said mysie hastily i am safei will take thought for myself if i once saw you out of this dangerous dwellingif you would provide yourself with any part of your apparel or goods lose no time  the knight did however lose some time ere he could settle in his own mind what to take and what to abandon of his wardrobe each article of which seemed endeared to him by recollection of the feasts and revels at which it had been exhibited for some little while mysie left him to make his selections at leisure for she herself had also some preparations to make for flight but when returning from the chamber into which she had retired with a small bundle in her hand she found him still indecisive she insisted in plain terms that he should either make up his baggage for the enterprise or give it up entirely thus urged the disconsolate knight hastily made up a few clothes into a bundle regarded his trunkmails with a mute expression of parting sorrow and intimated his readiness to wait upon his kind guide  she led the way to the door of the apartment having first carefully extinguished her lamp and motioning to the knight to stand close behind her tapped once or twice at the door she was at length answered by edward glendinning who demanded to know who knocked within and what was desired  speak low said mysie happer or you will awaken the english knight it is i mysie happer who knocki wish to get outyou have locked me upand i was obliged to wait till the southron slept  locked you up replied edward in surprise  yes answered the millers daughter you have locked me up into this roomi was in mary avenels sleeping apartment  and can you not remain there till morning replied edward since it has so chanced  what said the millers daughter in a tone of offended delicacy i remain here a moment longer than i can get out without discoveryi would not for all the halidome of st marys remain a minute longer in the neighbourhood of a mans apartment than i can help itfor whom or for what do you hold me i promise you my fathers daughter has been better brought up than to put in peril her good name  come forth then and get to thy chamber in silence said edward  so saying he undid the bolt the staircase without was in utter darkness as mysie had before ascertained so soon as she stept out she took hold of edward as if to support herself thus interposing her person betwixt him and sir piercie shaffcon by whom she was closely followed thus screened from observation the englishman slipped past on tiptoe unshod and in silence while the damsel complained to edward that she wanted a light  i cannot get you a light said he for i cannot leave this post but there is a fire below  i will sit below till morning said the maid of the mill and tripping down stairs heard edward bolt and bar the door of the now tenantless apartment with vain caution  at the foot of the stair which she descended she found the object of her care waiting her farther directions she recommended to him the most absolute silence which for once in his life he seemed not unwilling to observe conducted him with as much caution as if he were walking on cracked ice to a dark recess used for depositing wood and instructed him to ensconce himself behind the fagots she herself lighted her lamp once more at the kitchen fire and took her distaff and spindle that she might not seem to be unemployed in case any one came into the apartment  from time to time however she stole towards the window on tiptoe to catch the first glance of the dawn for the farther prosecution of her adventurous project at length she saw to her great joy the first peep of the morning brighten upon the gray clouds of the east and clasping her hands together thanked our lady for the sight and implored protection during the remainder of her enterprise ere she had finished her prayer she started at feeling a mans arm across her shoulder while a rough voice spoke in her earwhat menseful mysie of the mill so soon at her prayersnow benison on the bonny eyes that open so earlyill have a kiss for good morrows sake  dan of the howlethirst for he was the gallant who paid mysie this compliment suited the action with the word and the action as is usual in such cases of rustic gallantry was rewarded with a cuff which dan received as a fine gentleman receives a tap with a fan but which delivered by the energetic arm of the millers maiden would have certainly astonished a less robust gallant  how now sir coxcomb said she and must you be away from your guard over the english knight to plague quiet folks with your horsetricks  truly you are mistaken pretty mysie said the clown for i have not yet relieved edward at his post and were it not a shame to let him stay any longer by my faith i could find it in my heart not to quit you these two hours  oh you have hours and hours enough to see any one said mysie but you must think of the distress of the household even now and get edward to sleep for a while for he has kept watch this whole night  i will have another kiss first answered dan of the howlethirst  but mysie was now on her guard and conscious of the vicinity of the woodhole offered such strenuous resistance that the swain cursed the nymphs bad humour with very unpastoral phrase and emphasis and ran up stairs to relieve the guard of his comrade stealing to the door she heard the new sentinel hold a brief conversation with edward after which the latter withdrew and the former entered upon the duties of his watch  mysie suffered him to walk there a little while undisturbed until the dawning became more general by which time she supposed he might have digested her coyness and then presenting herself before the watchful sentinel demanded of him the keys of the outer tower and of the courtyard gate  and for what purpose answered the warder  to milk the cows and drive them out to their pasture said mysie you would not have the poor beasts kept in the byre a morning and the family in such distress that there is na ane fit to do a turn but the byrewoman and myself  and where is the byrewoman said dan  sitting with me in the kitchen in case these distressed folks want any thing  there are the keys then mysie dorts said the sentinel  many thanks dan neerdoweel answered the maid of the mill and escaped down stairs in a moment  to hasten to the woodhole and there to robe the english knight in a short gown and petticoat which she had provided for the purpose was the work of another moment she then undid the gates of the tower and made towards the byre or cowhouse which stood in one corner of the courtyard  sir piercie shafton remonstrated against the delay which this would occasion  fair and generous molinara he said had we not better undo the outward gate and make the best of our way hence even like a pair of seamews who make towards shelter of the rocks as the storm waxes high  we must drive out the cows first said mysie for a sin it were to spoil the poor widows cattle both for her sake and the poor beasts own and i have no mind any one shall leave the tower in a hurry to follow us  besides you must have your horse for you will need a fleet one ere all be done  so saying she locked and doublelocked both the inward and outward door of the tower proceeded to the cowhouse turned out the cattle and giving the knight his own horse to lead drove them before her out at the courtyard gate intending to return for her own palfrey but the noise attending the first operation caught the wakeful attention of edward who starting to the bartizan called to know what the matter was  mysie answered with great readiness that she was driving out the cows for that they would be spoiled for want of looking to  i thank thee kind maiden said edwardand yet he added after a moments pause what damsel is that thou hast with thee  mysie was about to answer when sir piercie shafton who apparently did not desire that the great work of his liberation should be executed without the interposition of his own ingenuity exclaimed from beneath i am she o most bucolical juvenal under whose charge are placed the milky mothers of the herd  hell and darkness exclaimed edward in a transport of fury and astonishment it is piercie shaftonwhat treason treasonhodanjaspermartinthe villain escapes  to horse to horse cried mysie and in an instant mounted behind the knight who was already in the saddle  edward caught up a crossbow and let fly a bolt which whistled so near mysies ear that she called to her companionspurspur sir knightthe next will not miss ushad it been halbert instead of edward who bent that bow we had been dead  the knight pressed his horse which dashed past the cows and down the knoll on which the tower was situated then taking the road down the valley the gallant animal reckless of its double burden soon conveyed them out of hearing of the tumult and alarm with which their departure filled the tower of glendearg  thus it strangely happened that two men were flying in different directions at the same time each accused of being the others murderer     chapter the twentyninth     sure he cannot   be so unmanly as to leave me here   if he do maids will not so easily   trust men again                   the two noble kinsmen  the knight continued to keep the good horse at a pace as quick as the road permitted until they had cleared the valley of glendearg and entered upon the broad dale of the tweed which now rolled before them in crystal beauty displaying on its opposite bank the huge gray monastery of st  marys whose towers and pinnacles were scarce yet touched by the newlyrisen sun so deeply the edifice lies shrouded under the mountains which rise to the southward  turning to the left the knight continued his road down to the northern bank of the river until they arrived nearly opposite to the weir or damdike where father philip concluded his extraordinary aquatic excursion  sir piercie shafton whose brain seldom admitted more than one idea at a time had hitherto pushed forward without very distinctly considering where he was going but the sight of the monastery so near to him reminded him that he was still on dangerous ground and that he must necessarily provide for his safety by choosing some settled plan of escape the situation of his guide and deliverer also occurred to him for he was far from being either selfish or ungrateful he listened and discovered that the millers daughter was sobbing and weeping bitterly as she rested her head on his shoulder  what ails thee he said my generous molinarais there aught that piercie shafton can do which may show his gratitude to his deliverer mysie pointed with her finger across the river but ventured not to turn her eyes in that direction nay but speak plain most generous damsel said the knight who for once was puzzled as much as his own elegance of speech was wont to puzzle others for i swear to you that i comprehend nought by the extension of thy fair digit  yonder is my fathers house said mysie in a voice interrupted by the increased burst of her sorrow  and i was carrying thee discourteously to a distance from thy habitation said shafton imagining he had found out the source of her grief  wo worth the hour that piercie shafton in attention to his own safety neglected the accommodation of any female far less of his most beneficent liberatrice dismount then o lovely molinara unless thou wouldst rather that i should transport thee on horseback to the house of thy molendinary father which if thou sayest the word i am prompt to do defying all dangers which may arise to me personally whether by monk or miller  mysie suppressed her sobs and with considerable difficulty muttered her desire to alight and take her fortune by herself sir piercie shafton too devoted a squire of dames to consider the most lowly as exempted from a respectful attention independent of the claims which the millers maiden possessed over him dismounted instantly from his horse and received in his arms the poor girl who still wept bitterly and when placed on the ground seemed scarce able to support herself or at least still clung though as it appeared unconsciously to the support he had afforded he carried her to a weeping birch tree which grew on the greensward bank around which the road winded and placing her on the ground beneath it exhorted her to compose herself a strong touch of natural feeling struggled with and half overcame his acquired affectation while he said credit me most generous damsel the service you have done to piercie shafton he would have deemed too dearly bought had he foreseen it was to cost you these tears and singults show me the cause of your grief and if i can do aught to remove it believe that the rights you have acquired over me will make your commands sacred as those of an empress speak then fair molinara and command him whom fortune hath rendered at once your debtor and your champion what are your orders  only that you will fly and save yourself said mysie mustering up her utmost efforts to utter these few words  yet said the knight let me not leave you without some token of remembrance mysie would have said there needed none and most truly would she have spoken could she have spoken for weeping piercie shafton is poor he continued but let this chain testify he is not ungrateful to his deliverer  he took from his neck the rich chain and medallion we have formerly mentioned and put it into the powerless hand of the poor maiden who neither received nor rejected it but occupied with more intense feelings seemed scarce aware of what he was doing  we shall meet again said sir piercie shafton at least i trust so meanwhile weep no more fair molinara an thou lovest me  the phrase of conjuration was but used as an ordinary commonplace expression of the time but bore a deeper sense to poor mysies ear she dried her tears and when the knight in all kind and chivalrous courtesy stooped to embrace her at their parting she rose humbly up to receive the proffered honour in a posture of more deference and meekly and gratefully accepted the offered salute sir piercie shafton mounted his horse and began to ride off but curiosity or perhaps a stronger feeling soon induced him to look back when he beheld the millers daughter standing still motionless on the spot where they had parted her eyes turned after him and the unheeded chain hanging from her hand  it was at this moment that a glimpse of the real state of mysies affections and of the motive from which she had acted in the whole matter glanced on sir piercie shaftons mind the gallants of that age disinterested aspiring and loftyminded even in their coxcombry were strangers to those degrading and mischievous pursuits which are usually termed low amours they did not chase the humble maidens of the plain or degrade their own rank to deprive rural innocence of peace and virtue it followed of course that as conquests in this class were no part of their ambition they were in most cases totally overlooked and unsuspected left unimproved as a modern would call it where as on the present occasion they were casually made the companion of astrophel and flower of the tiltyard of feliciana had no more idea that his graces and good parts could attach the love of mysie happer than a firstrate beauty in the boxes dreams of the fatal wound which her charms may inflict on some attorneys romantic apprentice in the pit i suppose in any ordinary case the pride of rank and distinction would have pronounced on the humble admirer the doom which beau fielding denounced against the whole female world let them look and die but the obligations under which he lay to the enamoured maiden millers daughter as she was precluded the possibility of sir piercies treating the matter en cavalier and much embarrassed yet a little flattered at the same time he rode back to try what could be done for the damsels relief  the innate modesty of poor mysie could not prevent her showing too obvious signs of joy at sir piercie shaftons return she was betrayed by the sparkle of the rekindling eye and a caress which however timidly bestowed she could not help giving to the neck of the horse which brought back the beloved rider  what farther can i do for you kind molinara said sir piercie shafton himself hesitating and blushing for to the grace of queen besss age be it spoken her courtiers wore more iron on their breasts than brass on their foreheads and even amid their vanities preserved still the decaying spirit of chivalry which inspired of yore the very gentle knight of chaucer       who in his port was modest as a maid  mysie blushed deeply with her eyes fixed on the ground and sir piercie proceeded in the same tone of embarrassed kindness are you afraid to return home alone my kind molinarawould you that i should accompany you  alas said mysie looking up and her cheek changing from scarlet to pale i have no home left  how no home said shafton says my generous molinara she hath no home when yonder stands the house of her father and but a crystal stream between   alas answered the millers maiden i have no longer either home or father he is a devoted servant to the abbeyi have offended the abbot and if i return home my father will kill me  he dare not injure thee by heaven said sir piercie i swear to thee by my honour and knighthood that the forces of my cousin of northumberland shall lay the monastery so flat that a horse shall not stumble as he rides over it if they should dare to injure a hair of your head therefore be hopeful and content kind mysinda and know you have obliged one who can and will avenge the slightest wrong offered to you  he sprung from his horse as he spoke and in the animation of his argument grasped the willing hand of mysie or mysinda as he had now christened her he gazed too upon full black eyes fixed upon his own with an expression which however subdued by maidenly shame it was impossible to mistake on cheeks where something like hope began to restore the natural colour and on two lips which like double rosebuds were kept a little apart by expectation and showed within a line of teeth as white as pearl all this was dangerous to look upon and sir piercie shafton after repeating with less and less force his request that the fair mysinda would allow him to carry her to her fathers ended by asking the fair mysinda to go along with himat least he added until i shall be able to conduct you to a place of safety  mysie happer made no answer but blushing scarlet betwixt joy and shame mutely expressed her willingness to accompany the southron knight by knitting her bundle closer and preparing to resume her seat en croupe and what is your pleasure that i should do with this she said holding up the chain as if she had been for the first time aware that it was in her hand  keep it fairest mysinda for my sake said the knight  not so sir answered mysie gravely the maidens of my country take no such gifts from their superiors and i need no token to remind me of this morning  most earnestly and courteously did the knight urge her acceptance of the proposed guerdon but on this point mysie was resolute feeling perhaps that to accept of any thing bearing the appearance of reward would be to place the service she had rendered him on a mercenary footing in short she would only agree to conceal the chain lest it might prove the means of detecting the owner until sir piercie should be placed in perfect safety  they mounted and resumed their journey of which mysie as bold and sharpwitted in some points as she was simple and susceptible in others now took in some degree the direction having only inquired its general destination and learned that sir piercie shafton desired to go to edinburgh where he hoped to find friends and protection possessed of this information mysie availed herself of her local knowledge to get as soon as possible out of the bounds of the halidome and into those of a temporal baron supposed to be addicted to the reformed doctrines and upon whose limits at least she thought their pursuers would not attempt to hazard any violence  she was not indeed very apprehensive of a pursuit reckoning with some confidence that the inhabitants of the tower of glendearg would find it a matter of difficulty to surmount the obstacles arising from their own bolts and bars with which she had carefully secured them before setting forth on the retreat  they journeyed on therefore in tolerable security and sir piercie shafton found leisure to amuse the time in highflown speeches and long anecdotes of the court of feliciana to which mysie bent an ear not a whit less attentive that she did not understand one word out of three which was uttered by her fellowtraveller she listened however and admired upon trust as many a wise man has been contented to treat the conversation of a handsome but silly mistress as for sir piercie he was in his element and well assured of the interest and full approbation of his auditor he went on spouting euphuism of more than usual obscurity and at more than usual length thus passed the morning and noon brought them within sight of a winding stream on the side of which arose an ancient baronial castle surrounded by some large trees at a small distance from the gate of the mansion extended as in those days was usual a straggling hamlet having a church in the centre  there are two hostelries in this kirktown said mysie but the worst is best for our purpose for it stands apart from the other houses and i ken the man weel for he has dealt with my father for malt  this causa scientiae to use a lawyers phrase was ill chosen for mysies purpose for sir piercie shafton had by dint of his own loquacity been talking himself all this while into a high esteem for his fellowtraveller and pleased with the gracious reception which she afforded to his powers of conversation had wellnigh forgotten that she was not herself one of those highborn beauties of whom he was recounting so many stories when this unlucky speech at once placed the most disadvantageous circumstances attending her lineage under his immediate recollection he said nothing however what indeed could he say nothing was so natural as that a millers daughter should be acquainted with publicans who dealt with her father for malt and all that was to be wondered at was the concurrence of events which had rendered such a female the companion and guide of sir piercie shafton of wilverton kinsman of the great earl of northumberland whom princes and sovereigns themselves termed cousin because of the piercie blood footnote froissart tells us somewhere the readers of romances are indifferent to accurate reference that the king of france called one of the piercies cousin because of the blood of northumberland he felt the disgrace of strolling through the country with a millers maiden on the crupper behind him and was even ungrateful enough to feel some emotions of shame when he halted his horse at the door of the little inn  but the alert intelligence of mysie happer spared him farther sense of derogation by instantly springing from his horse and cramming the ears of mine host who came out with his mouth agape to receive a guest of the knights appearance with an imagined tale in which circumstance on circumstance were huddled so fast as to astonish sir piercie shafton whose own invention was none of the most brilliant she explained to the publican that this was a great english knight travelling from the monastery to the court of scotland after having paid his vows to saint mary and that she had been directed to conduct him so far on the road and that ball her palfrey had fallen by the way because he had been overwrought with carrying home the last melder of meal to the portioner of langhope and that she had turned in ball to graze in the taskers park near cripplecross for he had stood as still as lots wife with very weariness and that the knight had courteously insisted she should ride behind him and that she had brought him to her kend friends hostelry rather than to proud peter peddies who got his malt at the mellerstane mills and that he must get the best that the house afforded and that he must get it ready in a moment of time and that she was ready to help in the kitchen  all this ran glibly off the tongue without pause on the part of mysie happer or doubt on that of the landlord the guests horse was conducted to the stable and he himself installed in the cleanest corner and best seat which the place afforded mysie ever active and officious was at once engaged in preparing food in spreading the table and in making all the better arrangements which her experience could suggest for the honour and comfort of her companion he would fain have resisted this for while it was impossible not to be gratified with the eager and alert kindness which was so active in his service he felt an undefinable pain in seeing mysinda engaged in these menial services and discharging them moreover as one to whom they were but too familiar yet this jarring feeling was mixed with and perhaps balanced by the extreme grace with which the neathanded maiden executed these tasks however mean in themselves and gave to the wretched corner of a miserable inn of the period the air of a bower in which an enamoured fairy or at least a shepherdess of arcadia was displaying with unavailing solicitude her designs on the heart of some knight destined by fortune to higher thoughts and a more splendid union  the lightness and grace with which mysie covered the little round table with a snowwhite cloth and arranged upon it the hastilyroasted capon with its accompanying stoup of bourdeaux were but plebeian graces in themselves but yet there were very flattering ideas excited by each glance  she was so very well made agile at once and graceful with her hand and arm as white as snow and her face in which a smile contended with a blush and her eyes which looked ever at shafton when he looked elsewhere and were dropped at once when they encountered his that she was irresistible  in fine the affectionate delicacy of her whole demeanour joined to the promptitude and boldness she had so lately evinced tended to ennoble the services she had rendered as if some    sweet engaging grace   put on some clothes to come abroad     and took a waiters place  but on the other hand came the damning reflection that these duties were not taught her by love to serve the beloved only but arose from the ordinary and natural habits of a millers daughter accustomed doubtless to render the same service to every wealthier churl who frequented her fathers mill this stopped the mouth of vanity and of the love which vanity had been hatching as effectually as a peck of literal flour would have done  amidst this variety of emotions sir piercie shafton forgot not to ask the object of them to sit down and partake the good cheer which she had been so anxious to provide and to place in order he expected that this invitation would have been bashfully perhaps but certainly most thankfully accepted but he was partly flattered and partly piqued by the mixture of deference and resolution with which mysie declined his invitation immediately after she vanished from the apartment leaving the euphuist to consider whether he was most gratified or displeased by her disappearance  in fact this was a point on which he would have found it difficult to make up his mind had there been any necessity for it as there was none he drank a few cups of claret and sang to himself a strophe or two of the canzonettes of the divine astrophel but in spite both of wine and of sir philip sidney the connexion in which he now stood and that which he was in future to hold with the lovely molinara or mysinda as he had been pleased to denominate mysie happer recurred to his mind the fashion of the times as we have already noticed fortunately coincided with his own natural generosity of disposition which indeed amounted almost to extravagance in prohibiting as a deadly sin alike against gallantry chivalry and morality his rewarding the good offices he had received from this poor maiden by abusing any of the advantages which her confidence in his honour had afforded to do sir piercie justice it was an idea which never entered into his head and he would probably have dealt the most scientific imbroccata stoccata or punto reverso which the school of vincent saviola had taught him to any man who had dared to suggest to him such selfish and ungrateful meanness on the other hand he was a man and foresaw various circumstances which might render their journey together in this intimate fashion a scandal and a snare moreover he was a coxcomb and a courtier and felt there was something ridiculous in travelling the land with a millers daughter behind his saddle giving rise to suspicions not very creditable to either and to ludicrous constructions so far as he himself was concerned  i would he said half aloud that if such might be done without harm or discredit to the tooambitious yet toowelldistinguishing molinara she and i were fairly severed and bound on our different courses even as we see the goodly vessel bound for the distant seas hoist sails and bear away into the deep while the humble flyboat carries to shore those friends who with wounded hearts and watery eyes have committed to their higher destinies the more daring adventurers by whom the fair frigate is manned  he had scarce uttered the wish when it was gratified for the host entered to say that his worshipful knighthoods horse was ready to be brought forth as he had desired and on his inquiry for thethe damselthat isthe young woman  mysie happer said the landlord has returned to her fathers but she bade me say you could not miss the road for edinburgh in respect it was neither far way nor foul gate  it is seldom we are exactly blessed with the precise fulfilment of our wishes at the moment when we utter them perhaps because heaven wisely withholds what if granted would be often received with ingratitude  so at least it chanced in the present instance for when mine host said that mysie was returned homeward the knight was tempted to reply with an ejaculation of surprise and vexation and a hasty demand whither and when she had departed the first emotions his prudence suppressed the second found utterance  where is she gane said the host gazing on him and repeating his questionshe is gane hame to her fathers it is likeand she gaed just when she gave orders about your worships horse and saw it well fed she might have trusted me but millers and millers kin think a body as thieflike as themselves an shes three miles on the gate by this time  is she gone then muttered sir piercie making two or three hasty strides through the narrow apartmentis she gonewell then let her go she could have had but disgrace by abiding by me and i little credit by her society that i should have thought there was such difficulty in shaking her off i warrant she is by this time laughing with some clown she has encountered and my rich chain will prove a good dowryand ought it not to prove so and has she not deserved it were it ten times more valuablepiercie shafton piercie shafton dost thou grudge thy deliverer the guerdon she hath so dearly won the selfish air of this northern land hath infected thee piercie shafton and blighted the blossoms of thy generosity even as it is said to shrivel the flowers of the mulberryyet i thought he added after a moments pause that she would not so easily and voluntarily have parted from me but it skills not thinking of itcast my reckoning mine host and let your groom lead forth my nag  the good host seemed also to have some mental point to discuss for he answered not instantly debating perhaps whether his conscience would bear a double charge for the same guests apparently his conscience replied in the negative though not without hesitation for he at length repliedits daffing to lee it winna deny that the lawing is clean paid neertheless if your worshipful knighthood pleases to give aught for increase of trouble  how said the knight the reckoning paid and by whom i pray you  een by mysie happer if truth maun be spoken as i said before answered the honest landlord with as many compunctious visitings for telling the verity as another might have felt for making a lie in the circumstancesand out of the moneys supplied for your honours journey by the abbot as she tauld to me and laith were i to surcharge any gentleman that darkens my doors he added in the confidence of honesty which his frank avowal entitled him to entertain nevertheless as i said before if it pleases your knighthood of free goodwill to consider extraordinary trouble  the knight cut short his argument by throwing the landlord a rosenoble which probably doubled the value of a scottish reckoning though it would have defrayed but a half one at the three cranes or the vintry the bounty so much delighted mine host that he ran to fill the stirrupcup for which no charge was ever made from a butt yet charier than that which he had pierced for the former stoup the knight paced slowly to horse partook of his courtesy and thanked him with the stiff condescension of the court of elizabeth then mounted and followed the northern path which was pointed out as the nearest to edinburgh and which though very unlike a modern highway bore yet so distinct a resemblance to a public and frequented road as not to be easily mistaken  i shall not need her guidance it seems said he to himself as he rode slowly onward and i suppose that was one reason of her abrupt departure so different from what one might have expectedwell i am well rid of her do we not pray to be liberated from temptation yet that she should have erred so much in estimation of her own situation and mine as to think of defraying the reckoning i would i saw her once more but to explain to her the solecism of which her inexperience hath rendered her guilty and i fear he added as he emerged from some straggling trees and looked out upon a wild moorish country composed of a succession of swelling lumpish hills i fear i shall soon want the aid of this ariadne who might afford me a clew through the recesses of yonder mountainous labyrinth  as the knight thus communed with himself his attention was caught by the sound of a horses footsteps and a lad mounted on a little gray scottish nag about fourteen hands high coming along a path which led from behind the trees joined him on the highroad if it could be termed such  the dress of the lad was completely in village fashion yet neat and handsome in appearance he had a jerkin of gray cloth slashed and trimmed with black hose of the same with deerskin rullions or sandals and handsome silver spurs a cloak of a dark mulberry colour was closely drawn round the upper part of his person and the cape in part muffled his face which was also obscured by his bonnet of black velvet cloth and its little plume of feathers  sir piercie shafton fond of society desirous also to have a guide and moreover prepossessed in favour of so handsome a youth failed not to ask him whence he came and whither he was going the youth looked another way as he answered that he was going to edinburgh to seek service in some noblemans family  i fear me you have run away from your last master said sir piercie since you dare not look me in the face while you answer my question  indeed sir i have not answered the lad bashfully while as if with reluctance he turned round his face and instantly withdrew it it was a glance but the discovery was complete there was no mistaking the dark full eye the cheek in which much embarrassment could not altogether disguise an expression of comic humour and the whole figure at once betrayed under her metamorphosis the maid of the mill the recognition was joyful and sir piercie shafton was too much pleased to have regained his companion to remember the very good reasons which had consoled him for losing her  to his questions respecting her dress she answered that she had obtained it in the kirktown from a friend it was the holiday suit of a son of hers who had taken the field with his liegelord the baron of the land  she had borrowed the suit under pretence she meant to play in some mumming or rural masquerade she had left she said her own apparel in exchange which was better worth ten crowns than this was worth four  and the nag my ingenious molinara said sir piercie whence comes the nag  i borrowed him from our host at the gledsnest she replied and added half stifling a laugh he has sent to get instead of it our ball which i left in the taskers park at cripplecross he will be lucky if he find it there  but then the poor man will lose his horse most argute mysinda said sir piercie shafton whose english notions of property were a little startled at a mode of acquisition more congenial to the ideas of a millers daughter and he a border miller to boot than with those of an english person of quality  and if he does lose his horse said mysie laughing surely he is not the first man on the marches who has had such a mischance but he will be no loser for i warrant he will stop the value out of moneys which he has owed my father this many a day  but then your father will be the loser objected yet again the pertinacious uprightness of sir piercie shafton  what signifies it now to talk of my father said the damsel pettishly then instantly changing to a tone of deep feeling she added my father has this day lost that which will make him hold light the loss of all the gear he has left  struck with the accents of remorseful sorrow in which his companion uttered these few words the english knight felt himself bound both in honour and conscience to expostulate with her as strongly as he could on the risk of the step which she had now taken and on the propriety of her returning to her fathers house the matter of his discourse though adorned with many unnecessary flourishes was honourable both to his head and heart  the maid of the mill listened to his flowing periods with her head sunk on her bosom as she rode like one in deep thought or deeper sorrow when he had finished she raised up her countenance looked full on the knight and replied with great firmnessif you are weary of my company sir piercie shafton you have but to say so and the millers daughter will be no farther cumber to you and do not think i will be a burden to you if we travel together to edinburgh i have wit enough and pride enough to be a willing burden to no man but if you reject not my company at present and fear not it will be burdensome to you hereafter speak no more to me of returning back all that you can say to me i have said to myself and that i am now here is a sign that i have said it to no purpose let this subject therefore be forever ended betwixt us i have already in some small fashion been useful to you and the time may come i may be more so for this is not your land of england where men say justice is done with little fear or favour to great and to small but it is a land where men do by the strong hand and defend by the ready wit and i know better than you the perils you are exposed to  sir piercie shafton was somewhat mortified to find that the damsel conceived her presence useful to him as a protectress as well as guide and said something of seeking protection of nought save his own arm and his good sword mysie answered very quietly that she nothing doubted his bravery but it was that very quality of bravery which was most likely to involve him in danger sir piercie shafton whose head never kept very long in any continued train of thinking acquiesced without much reply resolving in his own mind that the maiden only used this apology to disguise her real motive of affection to his person the romance of the situation flattered his vanity and elevated his imagination as placing him in the situation of one of those romantic heroes of whom he had read the histories where similar transformations made a distinguished figure  he took many a sidelong glance at his page whose habits of country sport and country exercise had rendered her quite adequate to sustain the character she had assumed she managed the little nag with dexterity and even with grace nor did any thing appear that could have betrayed her disguise except when a bashful consciousness of her companions eye being fixed on her gave her an appearance of temporary embarrassment which greatly added to her beauty  the couple rode forward as in the morning pleased with themselves and with each other until they arrived at the village where they were to repose for the night and where all the inhabitants of the little inn both male and female joined in extolling the good grace and handsome countenance of the english knight and the uncommon beauty of his youthful attendant  it was here that mysie happer first made sir piercie shafton sensible of the reserved manner in which she proposed to live with him she announced him as her master and waiting upon him with the reverent demeanour of an actual domestic permitted not the least approach to familiarity not even such as the knight might with the utmost innocence have ventured upon  for example sir piercie who as we know was a great connoisseur in dress was detailing to her the advantageous change which he proposed to make in her attire as soon as they should reach edinburgh by arraying her in his own colours of pink and carnation mysie happer listened with great complacency to the unction with which he dilated upon welts laces slashes and trimmings until carried away by the enthusiasm with which he was asserting the superiority of the falling band over the spanish ruff he approached his hand in the way of illustration towards the collar of his pages doublet she instantly stepped back and gravely reminded him that she was alone and under his protection  you cannot but remember the cause which has brought me here she continued make the least approach to any familiarity which you would not offer to a princess surrounded by her court and you have seen the last of the millers daughtershe will vanish as the chaff disappears from the shielinghill footnote the place where corn was winnowed while that operation was performed by the hand was called in scotland the shielinghill when the west wind blows  i do protest fair molinara said sir piercie shaftonbut the fair molinara had disappeared before his protest could be uttered a most singular wench said he to himself and by this hand as discreet as she is fairfeaturedcertes shame it were to offer her scathe or dishonour  she makes similes too though somewhat savouring of her condition had she but read euphues and forgotten that accursed mill and shielinghill it is my thought that her converse would be broidered with as many and as choice pearls of compliment as that of the most rhetorical lady in the court of feliciana i trust she means to return to bear me company  but that was no part of mysies prudential scheme it was then drawing to dusk and he saw her not again until the next morning when the horses were brought to the door that they might prosecute their journey  but our story here necessarily leaves the english knight and his page to return to the tower of glendearg     chapter the thirtieth     you call it an ill angel it may be so   but sure i am among the ranks which fell   tis the first fiend eer counselld man to rise   and win the bliss the sprite himself had forfeited                              old play  we must resume our narrative at the period when mary avenel was conveyed to the apartment which had been formerly occupied by the two glendinnings and when her faithful attendant tibbie had exhausted herself in useless attempts to compose and to comfort her father eustace also dealt forth with wellmeant kindness those apophthegms and dogmata of consolation which friendship almost always offers to grief though they are uniformly offered in vain she was at length left to indulge in the desolation of her own sorrowful feelings she felt as those who loving for the first time have lost what they loved before time and repeated calamity have taught them that every loss is to a certain extent reparable or endurable  such grief may be conceived better than it can be described as is well known to those who have experienced it but mary avenel had been taught by the peculiarity of her situation to regard herself as the child of destiny and the melancholy and reflecting turn of her disposition gave to her sorrows a depth and breadth peculiar to her character the graveand it was a bloody gravehad closed as she believed over the youth to whom she was secretly but most warmly attached the force and ardour of halberts character bearing a singular correspondence to the energy of which her own was capable her sorrow did not exhaust itself in sighs and tears but when the first shock had passed away concentrated itself with deep and steady meditation to collect and calculate like a bankrupt debtor the full amount of her loss it seemed as if all that connected her with earth had vanished with this broken tie she had never dared to anticipate the probability of an ultimate union with halbert yet now his supposed fall seemed that of the only tree which was to shelter her from the storm she respected the more gentle character and more peaceful attainments of the younger glendinning but it had not escaped her what never indeed escaped woman in such circumstances that he was disposed to place himself in competition with what she the daughter of a proud and warlike race deemed the more manly qualities of his elder brother and there is no time when a woman does so little justice to the character of a surviving lover as when comparing him with the preferred rival of whom she has been recently deprived  the motherly but coarse kindness of dame glendinning and the doating fondness of her old domestic seemed now the only kind feeling of which she formed the object and she could not but reflect how little these were to be compared with the devoted attachment of a highsouled youth whom the least glance of her eye could command as the highmettled steed is governed by the bridle of the rider it was when plunged among these desolating reflections that mary avenel felt the void of mind arising from the narrow and bigoted ignorance in which rome then educated the children of her church their whole religion was a ritual and their prayers were the formal iteration of unknown words which in the hour of affliction could yield but little consolation to those who from habit resorted to them unused to the practice of mental devotion and of personal approach to the divine presence by prayer she could not help exclaiming in her distress there is no aid for me on earth and i know not how to ask it from heaven  as she spoke thus in an agony of sorrow she cast her eyes into the apartment and saw the mysterious spirit which waited upon the fortunes of her house standing in the moonlight in the midst of the room the same form as the reader knows had more than once offered itself to her sight and either her native boldness of mind or some peculiarity attached to her from her birth made her now look upon it without shrinking but the white lady of avenel was now more distinctly visible and more closely present than she had ever before seemed to be and mary was appalled by her presence she would however have spoken but there ran a tradition that though others who had seen the white lady had asked questions and received answers yet those of the house of avenel who had ventured to speak to her had never long survived the colloquy the figure besides as sitting up in her bed mary avenel gazed on it intently seemed by its gestures to caution her to keep silence and at the same time to bespeak attention  the white lady then seemed to press one of the planks of the floor with her foot while in her usual low melancholy and musical chant she repeated the following verses    maiden whose sorrows wail the living dead     whose eyes shall commune with the dead alive   maiden attend beneath my foot lies hid     the word the law the path which thou dost strive   to find and canst not findcould spirits shed     tears for their lot it were my lot to weep   showing the road which i shall never tread     though my foot points itsleep eternal sleep   dark long and cold forgetfulness my lot     but do not thou at human ills repine   secure there lies full guerdon in this spot     for all the woes that wait frail adams line   stoop then and make it yoursi may not make it mine  the phantom stooped towards the floor as she concluded as if with the intention of laying her hand on the board on which she stood but ere she had completed that gesture her form became indistinct was presently only like the shade of a fleecy cloud which passed betwixt earth and the moon and was soon altogether invisible  a strong impression of fear the first which she had experienced in her life to any agitating extent seized upon the mind of mary avenel and for a minute she felt a disposition to faint she repelled it however mustered her courage and addressed herself to saints and angels as her church recommended broken slumbers at length stole on her exhausted mind and frame and she slept until the dawn was about to rise when she was awakened by the cry of treason treason follow follow which arose in the tower when it was found that piercie shafton had made his escape  apprehensive of some new misfortune mary avenel hastily arranged the dress which she had not laid aside and venturing to quit her chamber learned from tibb who with her gray hairs dishevelled like those of a sibyl was flying from room to room that the bloody southron villain had made his escape and that halbert glendinning poor bairn would sleep unrevenged and unquiet in his bloody grave in the lower apartments the young men were roaring like thunder and venting in oaths and exclamations against the fugitives the rage which they experienced in finding themselves locked up within the tower and debarred from their vindictive pursuit by the wily precautions of mysie happer the authoritative voice of the subprior commanding silence was next heard upon which mary avenel whose tone of feeling did not lead her to enter into counsel or society with the rest of the party again retired to her solitary chamber  the rest of the family held counsel in the spence edward almost beside himself with rage and the subprior in no small degree offended at the effrontery of mysie happer in attempting such a scheme as well as at the mingled boldness and dexterity with which it had been executed but neither surprise nor anger availed aught the windows well secured with iron bars for keeping assailants out proved now as effectual for detaining the inhabitants within the battlements were open indeed but without ladder or ropes to act as a substitute for wings there was no possibility of descending from them they easily succeeded in alarming the inhabitants of the cottages beyond the precincts of the court but the men had been called in to strengthen the guard for the night and only women and children remained who could contribute nothing in the emergency except their useless exclamations of surprise and there were no neighbours for miles around dame elspeth however though drowned in tears was not so unmindful of external affairs but that she could find voice enough to tell the women and children without to leave their skirling and look after the cows that she couldna get minded what wi the awfu distraction of her mind what wi that fause slut having locked them up in their ain tower as fast as if they had been in the jeddart tolbooth  meanwhile the men finding other modes of exit impossible unanimously concluded to force the doors with such tools as the house afforded for the purpose these were not very proper for the occasion and the strength of the doors was great the interior one formed of oak occupied them for three mortal hours and there was little prospect of the iron door being forced in double the time  while they were engaged in this ungrateful toil mary avenel had with much less labour acquired exact knowledge of what the spirit had intimated in her mystic rhyme on examining the spot which the phantom had indicated by her gestures it was not difficult to discover that a board had been loosened which might be raised at pleasure on removing this piece of plank mary avenel was astonished to find the black book well remembered by her as her mothers favourite study of which she immediately took possession with as much joy as her present situation rendered her capable of feeling  ignorant in a great measure of its contents mary avenel had been taught from her infancy to hold this volume in sacred veneration it is probable that the deceased lady of walter avenel only postponed initiating her daughter into the mysteries of the divine word until she should be better able to comprehend both the lessons which it taught and the risk at which in those times they were studied death interposed and removed her before the times became favourable to the reformers and before her daughter was so far advanced in age as to be fit to receive religious instruction of this deep import but the affectionate mother had made preparations for the earthly work which she had most at heart there were slips of paper inserted in the volume in which by an appeal to and a comparison of various passages in holy writ the errors and human inventions with which the church of rome had defaced the simple edifice of christianity as erected by its divine architect were pointed out these controversial topics were treated with a spirit of calmness and christian charity which might have been an example to the theologians of the period but they were clearly fairly and plainly argued and supported by the necessary proofs and references other papers there were which had no reference whatever to polemics but were the simple effusions of a devout mind communing with itself among these was one frequently used as it seemed from the state of the manuscript on which the mother of mary had transcribed and placed together those affecting texts to which the heart has recourse in affliction and which assures us at once of the sympathy and protection afforded to the children of the promise in mary avenels state of mind these attracted her above all the other lessons which coming from a hand so dear had reached her at a time so critical and in a manner so touching  she read the affecting promise i will never leave thee nor forsake thee and the consoling exhortation call upon me in the day of trouble and i will deliver thee she read them and her heart acquiesced in the conclusion surely this is the word of god  there are those to whom a sense of religion has come in storm and tempest there are those whom it has summoned amid scenes of revelry and idle vanity there are those too who have heard its still small voice amid rural leisure and placid contentment but perhaps the knowledge which causeth not to err is most frequently impressed upon the mind during seasons of affliction and tears are the softened showers which cause the seed of heaven to spring and take root in the human breast at least it was thus with mary avenel she was insensible to the discordant noise which rang below the clang of bars and the jarring symphony of the levers which they used to force them the measured shouts of the labouring inmates as they combined their strength for each heave and gave time with their voices to the exertion of their arms and their deeply muttered vows of revenge on the fugitives who had bequeathed them at their departure a task so toilsome and difficult not all this din combined in hideous concert and expressive of aught but peace love and forgiveness could divert mary avenel from the new course of study on which she had so singularly entered the serenity of heaven she said is above me the sounds which are around are but those of earth and earthly passion  meanwhile the noon was passed and little impression was made on the iron grate when they who laboured at it received a sudden reinforcement by the unexpected arrival of christie of the clinthill he came at the head of a small party consisting of four horsemen who bore in their caps the sprig of holly which was the badge of avenel  what ho my masters he said i bring you a prisoner  you had better have brought us liberty said dan of the howlethirst  christie looked at the state of affairs with great surprise an i were to be hanged for it he said as i may for as little a matter i could not forbear laughing at seeing men peeping through their own bars like so many rats in a rattrap and he with the beard behind like the oldest rat in the cellar  hush thou unmannered knave said edward it is the subprior and this is neither time place nor company for your ruffian jests  what ho is my young master malapert said christie why man were he my own carnal father instead of being father to half the world i would have my laugh out and now it is over i must assist you i reckon for you are setting very greenly about this gearput the pinch nearer the staple man and hand me an iron crow through the grate for thats the fowl to fly away with a wicket on its shoulders i have broke into as many grates as you have teeth in your young headay and broke out of them too as the captain of the castle of lochmaben knows full well  christie did not boast more skill than he really possessed for applying their combined strength under the direction of that experienced engineer bolt and staple gave way before them and in less than half an hour the grate which had so long repelled their force stood open before them  and now said edward to horse my mates and pursue the villain shafton  halt there said christie of the clinthill pursue your guest my masters friend and my ownthere go two words to that bargain what the foul fiend would you pursue him for  let me pass said edward vehemently i will be staid by no manthe villain has murdered my brother  what says he said christie turning to the others murdered who is murdered and by whom  the englishman sir piercie shafton said dan of the howlethirst has murdered young halbert glendinning yesterday morning and we have all risen to the fray  it is a bedlam business i think said christie first i find you all locked up in your own tower and next i am come to prevent you revenging a murder that was never committed  i tell you said edward that my brother was slain and buried yesterday morning by this false englishman  and i tell you answered christie that i saw him alive and well last night i would i knew his trick of getting out of the grave most men find it more hard to break through a green sod than a grated door  every body now paused and looked on christie in astonishment until the subprior who had hitherto avoided communication with him came up and required earnestly to know whether he meant really to maintain that halbert glendinning lived  father he said with more respect than he usually showed to any one save his master i confess i may sometimes jest with those of your coat but not with you because as you may partly recollect i owe you a life  it is certain as the sun is in heaven that halbert glendinning supped at the house of my master the baron of avenel last night and that he came thither in company with an old man of whom more anon  and where is he now  the devil only can answer that question replied christie for the devil has possessed the whole family i think he took fright the foolish lad at something or other which our baron did in his moody humour and so he jumped into the lake and swam ashore like a wildduck robin of redcastle spoiled a good gelding in chasing him this morning  and why did he chase the youth said the subprior what harm had he done  none that i know of said christie but such was the barons order being in his mood and all the world having gone mad as i have said before  whither away so fast edward said the monk  to corrinanshian father answered the youthmartin and dan take pickaxe and mattock and follow me if you be men  right said the monk and fail not to give us instant notice what you find  if you find aught there like halbert glendinning said christie hallooing after edward i will be bound to eat him unsaltedt is a sight to see how that fellow takes the bentit is in the time of action men see what lads are made of halbert was aye skipping up and down like a roo and his brother used to sit in the chimney nook with his book and siclike trashbut the lad was like a loaded hackbut which will stand in the corner as quiet as an old crutch until ye draw the trigger and then there is nothing but flash and smokebut here comes my prisoner and setting other matters aside i must pray a word with you sir subprior respecting him i came on before to treat about him but i was interrupted with this fasherie  as he spoke two more of avenels troopers rode into the courtyard leading betwixt them a horse on which with his hands bound to his side sate the reformed preacher henry warden     chapter the thirtyfirst     at school i knew hima sharpwitted youth   grave thoughtful and reserved among his mates   turning the hours of sport and food to labour   starving his body to inform his mind                                            old play  the subprior at the borderers request had not failed to return to the tower into which he was followed by christie of the clinthill who shutting the door of the apartment drew near and began his discourse with great confidence and familiarity  my master he said sends me with his commendations to you sir subprior above all the community of saint marys and more specially than even to the abbot himself for though he be termed my lord and so forth all the world knows that you are the tongue of the trump  if you have aught to say to me concerning the community said the subprior it were well you proceeded in it without farther delay time presses and the fate of young glendinnning dwells on my mind  i will be caution for him body for body said christie i do protest to you as sure as i am a living man so surely is he one  should i not tell his unhappy mother the joyful tidings said father eustaceand yet better wait till they return from searching the grave well sir jackman your message to me from your master  my lord and master said christie hath good reason to believe that from the information of certain back friends whom he will reward at more leisure your reverend community hath been led to deem him ill attached to holy church allied with heretics and those who favour heresy and a hungerer after the spoils of your abbey  be brief good henchman said the subprior for the devil is ever most to be feared when he preacheth  briefly thenmy master desires your friendship and to excuse himself from the maligners calumnies he sends to your abbot that henry warden whose sermons have turned the world upside down to be dealt with as holy church directs and as the abbots pleasure may determine  the subpriors eyes sparkled at the intelligence for it had been accounted a matter of great importance that this man should be arrested possessed as he was known to be of so much zeal and popularity that scarcely the preaching of knox himself had been more awakening to the people and more formidable to the church of rome  in fact that ancient system which so well accommodated its doctrines to the wants and wishes of a barbarous age had since the art of printing and the gradual diffusion of knowledge lain floating like some huge leviathan into which ten thousand reforming fishers were darting their harpoons the roman church of scotland in particular was at her last gasp actually blowing blood and water yet still with unremitted though animal exertions maintaining the conflict with the assailants who on every side were plunging their weapons into her bulky body in many large towns the monasteries had been suppressed by the fury of the populace in other places their possessions had been usurped by the power of the reformed nobles but still the hierarchy made a part of the common law of the realm and might claim both its property and its privileges wherever it had the means of asserting them the community of saint marys of kennaquhair was considered as being particularly in this situation they had retained undiminished their territorial power and influence and the great barons in the neighbourhood partly from their attachment to the party in the state who still upheld the old system of religion partly because each grudged the share of the prey which the others must necessarily claim had as yet abstained from despoiling the halidome the community was also understood to be protected by the powerful earls of northumberland and westmoreland whose zealous attachment to the catholic faith caused at a later period the great rebellion of the tenth of elizabeth  thus happily placed it was supposed by the friends of the decaying cause of the roman catholic faith that some determined example of courage and resolution exercised where the franchises of the church were yet entire and her jurisdiction undisputed might awe the progress of the new opinions into activity and protected by the laws which still existed and by the favour of the sovereign might be the means of securing the territory which rome yet preserved in scotland and perhaps of recovering that which she had lost  the matter had been considered more than once by the northern catholics of scotland and they had held communication with those of the south  father eustace devoted by his public and private vows had caught the flame and had eagerly advised that they should execute the doom of heresy on the first reformed preacher or according to his sense on the first heretic of eminence who should venture within the precincts of the halidome a heart naturally kind and noble was in this instance as it has been in many more deceived by its own generosity father eustace would have been a bad administrator of the inquisitorial power of spain where that power was omnipotent and where judgment was exercised without danger to those who inflicted it in such a situation his rigour might have relented in favour of the criminal whom it was at his pleasure to crush or to place at freedom but in scotland during this crisis the case was entirely different the question was whether one of the spirituality dared at the hazard of his own life to step forward to assert and exercise the rights of the church was there any who would venture to wield the thunder in her cause or must it remain like that in the hand of a painted jupiter the object of derision instead of terror the crisis was calculated to awake the soul of eustace for it comprised the question whether he dared at all hazards to himself to execute with stoical severity a measure which according to the general opinion was to be advantageous to the church and according to ancient law and to his firm belief was not only justifiable but meritorious  while such resolutions were agitated amongst the catholics chance placed a victim within their grasp henry warden had with the animation proper to the enthusiastic reformers of the age transgressed in the vehemence of his zeal the bounds of the discretional liberty allowed to his sect so far that it was thought the queens personal dignity was concerned in bringing him to justice he fled from edinburgh with recommendations however from lord james stewart afterwards the celebrated earl of murray to some of the border chieftains of inferior rank who were privately conjured to procure him safe passage into england one of the principal persons to whom such recommendation was addressed was julian avenel for as yet and for a considerable time afterwards the correspondence and interest of lord james lay rather with the subordinate leaders than with the chiefs of great power and men of distinguished influence upon the border julian avenel had intrigued without scruple with both partiesyet bad as he was he certainly would not have practised aught against the guest whom lord james had recommended to his hospitality had it not been for what he termed the preachers officious intermeddling in his family affairs but when he had determined to make warden rue the lecture he had read him and the scene of public scandal which he had caused in his hall julian resolved with the constitutional shrewdness of his disposition to combine his vengeance with his interest  and therefore instead of doing violence on the person of henry warden within his own castle he determined to deliver him up to the community of saint marys and at once make them the instruments of his own revenge and found a claim of personal recompense either in money or in a grant of abbey lands at a low quitrent which last began now to be the established form in which the temporal nobles plundered the spirituality  the subprior therefore of saint marys unexpectedly saw the steadfast active and inflexible enemy of the church delivered into his hand and felt himself called upon to make good his promises to the friends of the catholic faith by quenching heresy in the blood of one of its most zealous professors  to the honour more of father eustaces heart than of his consistency the communication that henry warden was placed within his power struck him with more sorrow than triumph but his next feelings were those of exultation it is sad he said to himself to cause human suffering it is awful to cause human blood to be spilled but the judge to whom the sword of saint paul as well as the keys of saint peter are confided must not flinch from his task our weapon returns into our own bosom if not wielded with a steady and unrelenting hand against the irreconcilable enemies of the holy church pereat iste it is the doom he has incurred and were all the heretics in scotland armed and at his back they should not prevent its being pronounced and if possible enforcedbring the heretic before me he said issuing his commands aloud and in a tone of authority  henry warden was led in his hands still bound but his feet at liberty  clear the apartment said the subprior of all but the necessary guard on the prisoner  all retired except christie of the clinthill who having dismissed the inferior troopers whom he commanded unsheathed his sword and placed himself beside the door as if taking upon him the character of sentinel  the judge and the accused met face to face and in that of both was enthroned the noble confidence of rectitude the monk was about at the utmost risk to himself and his community to exercise what in his ignorance he conceived to be his duty the preacher actuated by a betterinformed yet not a more ardent zeal was prompt to submit to execution for gods sake and to seal were it necessary his mission with his blood placed at such a distance of time as better enables us to appreciate the tendency of the principles on which they severally acted we cannot doubt to which the palm ought to be awarded but the zeal of father eustace was as free from passion and personal views as if it had been exerted in a better cause  they approached each other armed each and prepared for intellectual conflict and each intently regarding his opponent as if either hoped to spy out some defect some chasm in the armour of his antagonist as they gazed on each other old recollections began to awake in either bosom at the sight of features long unseen and much altered but not forgotten  the brow of the subprior dismissed by degrees its frown of command the look of calm yet stern defiance gradually vanished from that of warden and both lost for an instant that of gloomy solemnity they had been ancient and intimate friends in youth at a foreign university but had been long separated from each other and the change of name which the preacher had adopted from motives of safety and the monk from the common custom of the convent had prevented the possibility of their hitherto recognizing each other in the opposite parts which they had been playing in the great polemical and political drama but now the subprior exclaimed henry wellwood and the preacher replied william allanand stirred by the old familiar names and nevertobeforgotten recollections of college studies and college intimacy their hands were for a moment locked in each other  remove his bonds said the subprior and assisted christie in performing that office with his own hands although the prisoner scarcely would consent to be unbound repeating with emphasis that he rejoiced in the cause for which he suffered shame when his hands were at liberty however he showed his sense of the kindness by again exchanging a grasp and a look of affection with the subprior  the salute was frank and generous on either side yet it was but the friendly recognition and greeting which are wont to take place betwixt adverse champions who do nothing in hate but all in honour as each felt the pressure of the situation in which they stood he quitted the grasp of the others hand and fell back confronting each other with looks more calm and sorrowful than expressive of any other passion the subprior was the first to speak  and is this then the end of that restless activity of mind that bold and indefatigable love of truth that urged investigation to its utmost limits and seemed to take heaven itself by stormis this the termination of wellwoods careerand having known and loved him during the best years of our youth do we meet in our old age as judge and criminal  not as judge and criminal said henry wardenfor to avoid confusion we describe him by his later and best known namenot as judge and criminal do we meet but as a misguided oppressor and his ready and devoted victim i too may ask are these the harvest of the rich hopes excited by the classical learning acute logical powers and varied knowledge of william allan that he should sink to be the solitary drone of a cell graced only above the swarm with the high commission of executing roman malice on all who oppose roman imposture  not to thee answered the subprior be assurednot unto thee nor unto mortal man will i render an account of the power with which the church may have invested me it was granted but as a deposit for her welfarefor her welfare it shall at every risk be exercised without fear and without favour  i expected no less from your misguided zeal answered the preacher and in me have you met one on whom you may fearlessly exercise your authority secure that his mind at least will defy your influence as the snows of that mont blanc which we saw together shrink not under the heat of the hottest summer sun  i do believe thee said the subprior i do believe that thine is indeed metal unmalleable by force let it yield then to persuasion let us debate these matters of faith as we once were wont to conduct our scholastic disputes when hours nay days glided past in the mutual exercise of our intellectual powers it may be thou mayest yet hear the voice of the shepherd and return to the universal fold  no allan replied the prisoner this is no vain question devised by dreaming scholiasts on which they may whet their intellectual faculties until the very metal be wasted away the errors which i combat are like those fiends which are only cast out by fasting and prayer alas not many wise not many learned are chosen the cottage and the hamlet shall in our days bear witness against the schools and their disciples thy very wisdom which is foolishness hath made thee as the greeks of old hold as foolishness that which is the only true wisdom  this said the subprior sternly is the mere cant of ignorant enthusiasm which appealeth from learning and from authority from the sure guidance of that lamp which god hath afforded us in the councils and in the fathers of the church to a rash selfwilled and arbitrary interpretation of the scriptures wrested according to the private opinion of each speculating heretic  i disdain to reply to the charge replied warden the question at issue between your church and mine is whether we will be judged by the holy scriptures or by the devices and decisions of men not less subject to error than ourselves and who have defaced our holy religion with vain devices reared up idols of stone and wood in form of those who when they lived were but sinful creatures to share the worship due only to the creatorestablished a tollhouse betwixt heaven and hell that profitable purgatory of which the pope keeps the keys like an iniquitous judge commutes punishment for bribes and  silence blasphemer said the subprior sternly or i will have thy blatant obloquy stopped with a gag  ay replied warden such is the freedom of the christian conference to which romes priests so kindly invite usthe gagthe rackthe axeis the ratio ultima romae but know thou mine ancient friend that the character of thy former companion is not so changed by age but that he still dares to endure for the cause of truth all that thy proud hierarchy shall dare to inflict  of that said the monk i nothing doubtthou wert ever a lion to turn against the spear of the hunter not a stag to be dismayed at the sound of his buglehe walked through the room in silence wellwood he said at length we can no longer be friends our faith our hope our anchor on futurity is no longer the same  deep is my sorrow that thou speakest truth may god so judge me said the reformer as i would buy the conversion of a soul like thine with my dearest hearts blood  to thee and with better reason do i return the wish replied the subprior it is such an arm as thine that should defend the bulwarks of the church and it is now directing the batteringram against them and rendering practicable the breach through which all that is greedy and all that is base and all that is mutable and hotheaded in this innovating age already hope to advance to destruction and to spoil but since such is our fate that we can no longer fight side by side as friends let us at least act as generous enemies you cannot have forgotten    o gran bonta dei caralieri antiqui   erano nemici eran de fede diversa  although perhaps he added stopping short in his quotation your new faith forbids you to reserve a place in your memory even for what high poets have recorded of loyal faith and generous sentiment  the faith of buchanan replied the preacher the faith of buchanan and of beza cannot be unfriendly to literature but the poet you have quoted affords strains fitter for a dissolute court than for a convent  i might retort on your theodore beza said the subprior smiling but i hate the judgment that like the fleshfly skims over whatever is sound to detect and settle upon some spot which is tainted but to the purpose if i conduct thee or send thee a prisoner to st marys thou art tonight a tenant of the dungeon tomorrow a burden to the gibbettree if i were to let thee go hence at large i were thereby wronging the holy church and breaking mine own solemn vow other resolutions may be adopted in the capital or better times may speedily ensue wilt thou remain a true prisoner upon thy parole rescue or no rescue as is the phrase amongst the warriors of this country wilt thou solemnly promise that thou wilt do so and at my summons thou wilt present thyself before the abbot and chapter at saint marys and that thou wilt not stir from this house above a quarter of a mile in any direction wilt thou i say engage me thy word for this and such is the sure trust which i repose in thy good faith that thou shalt remain here unharmed and unsecured a prisoner at large subject only to appear before our court when called upon  the preacher pausedi am unwilling he said to fetter my native liberty by any selfadopted engagement but i am already in your power and you may bind me to my answer by such promise to abide within a certain limit and to appear when called upon i renounce not any liberty which i at present possess and am free to exercise but on the contrary being in bonds and at your mercy i acquire thereby a liberty which i at present possess not i will therefore accept of thy proffer as what is courteously offered on thy part and may be honourably accepted on mine  stay yet said the subprior one important part of thy engagement is forgottenthou art farther to promise that while thus left at liberty thou wilt not preach or teach directly or indirectly any of those pestilent heresies by which so many souls have been in this our day won over from the kingdom of light to the kingdom of darkness  there we break off our treaty said warden firmlywo unto me if i preach not the gospel  the subpriors countenance became clouded and he again paced the apartment and muttered a plague upon the selfwilled fool then stopped short in his walk and proceeded in his argumentwhy by thine own reasoning henry thy refusal here is but peevish obstinacy it is in my power to place you where your preaching can reach no human ear in promising therefore to abstain from it you grant nothing which you have it in your power to refuse  i know not that replied henry warden thou mayest indeed cast me into a dungeon but can i foretell that my master hath not taskwork for me to perform even in that dreary mansion the chains of saints have ere now been the means of breaking the bonds of satan in a prison holy paul found the jailor whom he brought to believe the word of salvation he and all his house  nay said the subprior in a tone betwixt anger and scorn if you match yourself with the blessed apostle it were time we had done prepare to endure what thy folly as well as thy heresy deservesbind him soldier  with proud submission to his fate and regarding the subprior with something which almost amounted to a smile of superiority the preacher placed his arms so that the bonds could be again fastened round him  spare me not he said to christie for even that ruffian hesitated to draw the cord straitly  the subprior meanwhile looked at him from under his cowl which he had drawn over his head and partly over his face as if he wished to shade his own emotions they were those of a huntsman within pointblank shot of a noble stag who is yet too much struck with his majesty of front and of antler to take aim at him they were those of a fowler who levelling his gun at a magnificent eagle is yet reluctant to use his advantage when he sees the noble sovereign of the birds pruning himself in proud defiance of whatever may be attempted against him the heart of the subprior bigoted as he was relented and he doubted if he ought to purchase by a rigorous discharge of what he deemed his duty the remorse he might afterwards feel for the death of one so nobly independent in thought and character the friend besides of his own happiest years during which they had side by side striven in the noble race of knowledge and indulged their intervals of repose in the lighter studies of classical and general letters  the subpriors hand pressed his halfoershadowed cheek and his eye more completely obscured was bent on the ground as if to hide the workings of his relenting nature  were but edward safe from the infection he thought to himselfedward whose eager and enthusiastic mind presses forward in the chase of all that hath even the shadow of knowledge i might trust this enthusiast with the women after due caution to them that they cannot without guilt attend to his reveries  as the subprior revolved these thoughts and delayed the definitive order which was to determine the fate of the prisoner a sudden noise at the entrance of the tower diverted his attention for an instant and his cheek and brow inflamed with all the glow of heat and determination edward glendinning rushed into the room                                         chapter the thirtysecond     then in my gown of sober gray     along the mountain path ill wander   and wind my solitary way     to the sad shrine that courts me yonder    there in the calm monastic shade     all injuries may be forgiven   and there for thee obdurate maid     my orisons shall rise to heaven           the cruel lady of the mountains  the first words which edward uttered weremy brother is safe reverend fatherhe is safe thank god and livesthere is not in corrinanshian a grave nor a vestige of a grave the turf around the fountain has neither been disturbed by pickaxe spade nor mattock since the deershair first sprang there he lives as surely as i live  the earnestness of the youththe vivacity with which he looked and movedthe springy step outstretched hand and ardent eye reminded henry warden of halbert so lately his guide the brothers had indeed a strong family resemblance though halbert was far more athletic and active in his person taller and better knit in the limbs and though edward had on ordinary occasions a look of more habitual acuteness and more profound reflection the preacher was interested as well as the subprior  of whom do you speak my son he said in a tone as unconcerned as if his own fate had not been at the same instant trembling in the balance and as if a dungeon and death did not appear to be his instant doomof whom i say speak you if of a youth somewhat older than you seem to bebrownhaired openfeatured taller and stronger than you appear yet having much of the same air and of the same tone of voiceif such a one is the brother whom you seek it may be i can tell you news of him  speak then for heavens sake said edwardlife or death lies on thy tongue  the subprior joined eagerly in the same request and without waiting to be urged the preacher gave so minute an account of the circumstances under which he met the elder glendinning with so exact a description of his person that there remained no doubt as to his identity when he mentioned that halbert glendinning had conducted him to a dell in which they found the grass bloody and a grave newly closed and told how the youth accused himself of the slaughter of sir piercie shafton the subprior looked on edward with astonishment  didst thou not say even now he said that there was no vestige of a grave in that spot  no more vestige of the earth having been removed than if the turf had grown there since the days of adam replied edward glendinning it is true he added that the adjacent grass was trampled and bloody  these are delusions of the enemy said the subprior crossing himselfchristian men may no longer doubt of it  but an it be so said warden christian men might better guard themselves by the sword of prayer than by the idle form of a cabalistical spell  the badge of our salvation said the subprior cannot be so termedthe sign of the cross disarmeth all evil spirits  ay answered henry warden apt and armed for controversy but it should be borne in the heart not scored with the fingers in the air that very impassive air through which your hand passes shall as soon bear the imprint of your action as the external action shall avail the fond bigot who substitutes vain motions of the body idle genuflections and signs of the cross for the living and heartborn duties of faith and good works  i pity thee said the subprior as actively ready for polemics as himselfi pity thee henry and reply not to thee thou mayest as well winnow forth and measure the ocean with a sieve as mete out the power of holy words deeds and signs by the erring gauge of thine own reason  not by mine own reason would i mete them said warden but by his holy word that unfading and unerring lamp of our paths compared to which human reason is but as a glimmering and fading taper and your boasted tradition only a misleading wildfire show me your scripture warrant for ascribing virtue to such vain signs and motions  i offered thee a fair field of debate said the subprior which thou didst refuse i will not at present resume the controversy  were these my last accents said the reformer and were they uttered at the stake halfchoked with smoke and as the fagots kindled into a blaze around me with that last utterance i would testify against the superstitious devices of rome  the subprior suppressed with pain the controversial answer which arose to his lips and turning to edward glendinning he said there could be now no doubt that his mother ought presently to be informed that her son lived  i told you that two hours since said christie of the clinthill an you would have believed me but it seems you are more willing to take the word of an old gray sorner whose life has been spent in pattering heresy than mine though i never rode a foray in my life without duly saying my paternoster  go then said father eustace to edward let thy sorrowing mother know that her son is restored to her from the grave like the child of the widow of zarephath at the intercession he added looking at henry warden of the blessed saint whom i invoked in his behalf  deceived thyself said warden instantly thou art a deceiver of others it was no dead man no creature of clay whom the blessed tishbite invoked when stung by the reproach of the shunamite woman he prayed that her sons soul might come into him again  it was by his intercession however repeated the subprior for what says the vulgate thus it is written et exaudivit dominus vocem helie et reversa est anima pueri intra cum et revixitand thinkest thou the intercession of a glorified saint is more feeble than when he walks on earth shrouded in a tabernacle of clay and seeing but with the eye of flesh  during this controversy edward glendinning appeared restless and impatient agitated by some internal feeling but whether of joy grief or expectation his countenance did not expressly declare he took now the unusual freedom to break in upon the discourse of the subprior who notwithstanding his resolution to the contrary was obviously kindling in the spirit of controversy which edward diverted by conjuring his reverence to allow him to speak a few words with him in private  remove the prisoner said the subprior to christie look to him carefully that he escape not but for thy life do him no injury  his commands being obeyed edward and the monk were left alone when the subprior thus addressed him  what hath come over thee edward that thy eye kindles so wildly and thy cheek is thus changing from scarlet to pale why didst thou break in so hastily and unadvisedly upon the argument with which i was prostrating yonder heretic and wherefore dost thou not tell thy mother that her son is restored to her by the intercession as holy church well warrants us to believe of blessed saint benedict the patron of our order for if ever my prayers were put forth to him with zeal it hath been in behalf of this house and thine eyes have seen the resultgo tell it to thy mother  i must tell her then said edward that if she has regained one son another is lost to her  what meanest thou edward what language is this said the subprior  father said the youth kneeling down to him my sin and my shame shall be told thee and thou shalt witness my penance with thine own eyes  i comprehend thee not said the subprior what canst thou have done to deserve such selfaccusationhast thou too listened he added knitting his brows to the demon of heresy ever most effectual tempter of those who like yonder unhappy man are distinguished by their love of knowledge  i am guiltless in that matter answered glendinning nor have presumed to think otherwise than thou my kind father hast taught me and than the church allows  and what is it then my son said the subprior kindly which thus afflicts thy conscience speak it to me that i may answer thee in the words of comfort for the churchs mercy is great to those obedient children who doubt not her power  my confession will require her mercy replied edward my brother halbertso kind so brave so gentle who spoke not thought not acted not but in love to me whose hand had aided me in every difficulty whose eye watched over me like the eagles over her nestlings when they prove their first flight from the eyrythis brother so kind so gently affectionatei heard of his sudden his bloody his violent death and i rejoicedi heard of his unexpected restoration and i sorrowed  edward said the father thou art beside thyselfwhat could urge thee to such odious ingratitudein your hurry of spirits you have mistaken the confused tenor of your feelingsgo my son pray and compose thy mindwe will speak of this another time  no father no said edward vehemently now or neveri will find the means to tame this rebellious heart of mine or i will tear it out of my bosommistake its passionsno father grief can ill be mistaken for joyall wept all shrieked around memy motherthe menialsshe too the cause of my crimeall weptand ii could hardly disguise my brutal and insane joy under the appearance of revengebrother i said i cannot give thee tears but i will give thee bloodyes father as i counted hour after hour while i kept watch upon the english prisoner and said i am an hour nearer to hope and to happiness  i understand thee not edward said the monk nor can i conceive in what way thy brothers supposed murder should have affected thee with such unnatural joysurely the sordid desire to succeed him in his small possessions  perish the paltry trash said edward with the same emotion no father it was rivalryit was jealous rageit was the love of mary avenel that rendered me the unnatural wretch i confess myself  of mary avenel said the priestof a lady so high above either of you in name and in rank how dared halberthow dared you to presume to lift your eye to her but in honour and respect as a superior of another degree from yours  when did love wait for the sanction of heraldry replied edward and in what but a line of dead ancestors was mary our mothers guest and fosterchild different from us with whom she was brought up enough we lovedwe both loved her but the passion of halbert was requited he knew it not he saw it notbut i was sharpereyed i saw that even when i was more approved halbert was more beloved with me she would sit for hours at our common task with the cold simplicity and indifference of a sister but with halbert she trusted not herself she changed colour she was fluttered when he approached her and when he left her she was sad pensive and solitary i bore all thisi saw my rivals advancing progress in her affectionsi bore it father and yet i hated him noti could not hate him  and well for thee that thou didst not said the father wild and headstrong as thou art wouldst thou hate thy brother for partaking in thine own folly  father replied edward the world esteems thee wise and holds thy knowledge of mankind high but thy question shows that thou hast never loved it was by an effort that i saved myself from hating my kind and affectionate brother who all unsuspicious of my rivalry was perpetually loading me with kindness nay there were moods of my mind in which i could return that kindness for a time with energetic enthusiasm never did i feel this so strongly as on the night which parted us but i could not help rejoicing when he was swept from my pathcould not help sorrowing when he was again restored to be a stumblingblock in my paths  may god be gracious to thee my son said the monk this is an awful state of mind even in such evil mood did the first murderer rise up against his brother because abels was the more acceptable sacrifice  i will wrestle with the demon which has haunted me father replied the youth firmlyi will wrestle with him and i will subdue him but first i must remove from the scenes which are to follow here i cannot endure that i should see mary avenels eyes again flash with joy at the restoration of her lover it were a sight to make indeed a second cain of me  my fierce turbid and transitory joy discharged itself in a thirst to commit homicide and how can i estimate the frenzy of my despair  madman said the subprior at what dreadful crime does thy fury drive  my lot is determined father said edward in a resolute tone i will embrace the spiritual state which you have so oft recommended it is my purpose to return with you to saint marys and with the permission of the holy virgin and of saint benedict to offer my profession to the abbot  not now my son said the subprior not in this distemperature of mind the wise and good accept not gifts which are made in heat of blood and which may be after repented of and shall we make our offerings to wisdom and to goodness itself with less of solemn resolution and deep devotion of mind than is necessary to make them acceptable to our own frail companions in this valley of darkness this i say to thee my son not as meaning to deter thee from the good path thou art now inclined to prefer but that thou mayst make thy vocation and thine election sure  there are actions father returned edward which brook no delay and this is one it must be done this very now or it may never be done let me go with you let me not behold the return of halbert into this house  shame and the sense of the injustice i have already done him will join with these dreadful passions which urge me to do him yet farther wrong  let me then go with you  with me my son said the subprior thou shalt surely go but our rule as well as reason and good order require that you should dwell a space with us as a probationer or novice before taking upon thee those final vows which sequestering thee for ever from the world dedicate thee to the service of heaven  and when shall we set forth father said the youth as eagerly as if the journey which he was now undertaking led to the pleasures of a summer holiday  even now if thou wilt said the subprior yielding to his impetuositygo then and command them to prepare for our departureyet stay he said as edward with all the awakened enthusiasm of his character hastened from his presence come hither my son and kneel down  edward obeyed and kneeled down before him notwithstanding his slight figure and thin features the subprior could from the energy of his tone and the earnestness of his devotional manner impress his pupils and his penitents with no ordinary feelings of personal reverence his heart always was as well as seemed to be in the duty which he was immediately performing and the spiritual guide who thus shows a deep conviction of the importance of his office seldom fails to impress a similar feeling upon his hearers upon such occasions as the present his puny body seemed to assume more majestic staturehis spare and emaciated countenance bore a bolder loftier and more commanding porthis voice always beautiful trembled as labouring under the immediate impulse of the divinityand his whole demeanour seemed to bespeak not the mere ordinary man but the organ of the church in which she had vested her high power for delivering sinners from their load of iniquity  hast thou my fair son said he faithfully recounted the circumstances which have thus suddenly determined thee to a religious life  the sins i have confessed my father answered edward but i have not yet told of a strange appearance which acting in my mind hath i think aided to determine my resolution  tell it then now returned the subprior it is thy duty to leave me uninstructed in nought so that thereby i may understand the temptation that besets thee  i tell it with unwillingness said edward for although god wot i speak but the mere truth yet even while my tongue speaks it as truth my own ears receive it as fable  yet say the whole said father eustace neither fear rebuke from me seeing i may know reasons for receiving as true that which others might regard as fabulous  know then father replied edward that betwixt hope and despairand heavens what a hopethe hope to find the corpse mangled and crushed hastily in amongst the bloody clay which the foot of the scornful victor had trod down upon my good my gentle my courageous brotheri sped to the glen called corrinanshian but as your reverence has been already informed neither the grave which my unhallowed wishes had in spite of my better self longed to see nor any appearance of the earth having been opened was visible in the solitary spot where martin had at morning yesterday seen the fatal hillock you know your dalesmen father the place hath an evil name and this deception of the sight inclined them to leave it my companions became affrighted and hastened down the glen as men caught in trespass my hopes were too much blighted my mind too much agitated to fear either the living or the dead i descended the glen more slowly than they often looking back and not ill pleased with the poltroonery of my companions which left me to my own perplexed and moody humour and induced them to hasten into the broader dale they were already out of sight and lost amongst the windings of the glen when looking back i saw a female form standing beside the fountain  how my fair son said the subprior beware you jest not with your present situation  i jest not father answered the youth it may be i shall never jest againsurely not for many a day i saw i say the form of a female clad in white such as the spirit which haunts the house of avenel is supposed to be believe me my father for by heaven and earth i say nought but what i saw with these eyes  i believe thee my son said the monk proceed in thy strange story  the apparition said edward glendinning sung and thus ran her lay for strange as it may seem to you her words abide by my remembrance as if they had been sung to me from infancy upward    thou who seekst my fountain lone   with thoughts and hopes thou darst not own   whose heart within leapd wildly glad   when most his brow seemd dark and sad   hie thee back thou findst not here   corpse or coffin grave or bier   the dead alive is gone and fled   go thou and join the living dead    the living dead whose sober brow   oft shrouds such thoughts as thou hast now   whose hearts within are seldom cured   of passions by their vows abjured   where under sad and solemn show   vain hopes are nursed wild wishes glow   seek the convents vaulted room   prayer and vigil be thy doom   doff the green and don the gray   to the cloister hence away  tis a wild lay said the subprior and chanted i fear me with no good end but we have power to turn the machinations of satan to his shame edward thou shalt go with me as thou desirest thou shalt prove the life for which i have long thought thee best fittedthou shalt aid my son this trembling hand of mine to sustain the holy ark which bold unhallowed men press rashly forward to touch and to profanewilt thou not first see thy mother  i will see no one said edward hastily i will risk nothing that may shake the purpose of my heart from saint marys they shall learn my destinationall of them shall learn it my mothermary avenelmy restored and happy brotherthey shall all know that edward lives no longer to the world to be a clog on their happiness mary shall no longer need to constrain her looks and expressions to coldness because i am nigh  she shall no longer  my son said the subprior interrupting him it is not by looking back on the vanities and vexations of this world that we fit ourselves for the discharge of duties which are not of it go get our horses ready and as we descend the glen together i will teach thee the truths through which the fathers and wise men of old had that precious alchemy which can convert suffering into happiness     chapter the thirtythird     now on my faith this gear is all entangled   like to the yarnclew of the drowsy knitter   draggd by the frolic kitten through the cabin   while the good dame sits nodding oer the fire   masters attend twill crave some skill to clear it                                        old play  edward with the speed of one who doubts the steadiness of his own resolution hastened to prepare the horses for their departure and at the same time thanked and dismissed the neighbours who had come to his assistance and who were not a little surprised both at the suddenness of his proposed departure and at the turn affairs had taken  heres cold hospitality quoth dan of the howlethirst to his comrades i trow the glendinnings may die and come alive right oft ere i put foot in stirrup again for the matter  martin soothed them by placing food and liquor before them they ate sullenly however and departed in bad humour  the joyful news that halbert glendinning lived was quickly communicated through the sorrowing family the mother wept and thanked heaven alternately until her habits of domestic economy awakening as her feelings became calmer she observed it would be an unco task to mend the yetts and what were they to do while they were broken in that fashion at open doors dogs come in  tibb remarked she aye thought halbert was ower gleg at his weapon to be killed sae easily by ony sir piercie of them a they might say of these southrons as they liked but they had not the pith and wind of a canny scot when it came to close grips  on mary avenel the impression was inconceivably deeper she had but newly learned to pray and it seemed to her that her prayers had been instantly answeredthat the compassion of heaven which she had learned to implore in the words of scripture had descended upon her after a manner almost miraculous and recalled the dead from the grave at the sound of her lamentations there was a dangerous degree of enthusiasm in this strain of feeling but it originated in the purest devotion  a silken and embroidered muffler one of the few articles of more costly attire which she possessed was devoted to the purpose of wrapping up and concealing the sacred volume which henceforth she was to regard as her chiefest treasure lamenting only that for want of a fitting interpreter much must remain to her a book closed and a fountain sealed she was unaware of the yet greater danger she incurred of putting an imperfect or even false sense upon some of the doctrines which appeared most comprehensible but heaven had provided against both these hazards  while edward was preparing the horses christie of the clinthill again solicited his orders respecting the reformed preacher henry warden and again the worthy monk laboured to reconcile in his own mind the compassion and esteem which almost in spite of him he could not help feeling for his former companion with the duty which he owed to the church the unexpected resolution of edward had removed he thought the chief objection to his being left at glendearg  if i carry this wellwood or warden to the monastery he thought he must diedie in his heresyperish body and soul and though such a measure was once thought advisable to strike terror into the heretics yet such is now their daily increasing strength that it may rather rouse them to fury and to revenge true he refuses to pledge himself to abstain from sowing his tares among the wheat but the ground here is too barren to receive them i fear not his making impression on these poor women the vassals of the church and bred up in due obedience to her behests the keen searching inquiring and bold disposition of edward might have afforded fuel to the fire but that is removed and there is nothing left which the flame may catch tothus shall he have no power to spread his evil doctrines abroad and yet his life shall be preserved and it may be his soul rescued as a prey from the fowlers net i will myself contend with him in argument for when we studied in common i yielded not to him and surely the cause for which i struggle will support me were i yet more weak than i deem myself were this man reclaimed from his errors an hundredfold more advantage would arise to the church from his spiritual regeneration than from his temporal death  having finished these meditations in which there was at once goodness of disposition and narrowness of principle a considerable portion of selfopinion and no small degree of selfdelusion the subprior commanded the prisoner to be brought into his presence  henry he said whatever a rigid sense of duty may demand of me ancient friendship and christian compassion forbid me to lead thee to assured death thou wert wont to be generous though stern and stubborn in thy resolves let not thy sense of what thine own thoughts term duty draw thee farther than mine have done remember that every sheep whom thou shalt here lead astray from the fold will be demanded in time and through eternity of him who hath left thee the liberty of doing such evil i ask no engagement of thee save that thou remain a prisoner on thy word at this tower and wilt appear when summoned  thou hast found an invention to bind my hands replied the preacher more sure than would have been the heaviest shackles in the prison of thy convent i will not rashly do what may endanger thee with thy unhappy superiors and i will be the more cautious because if we had farther opportunity of conference i trust thine own soul may yet be rescued as a brand from the burning and that casting from thee the livery of antichrist that trader in human sins and human souls i may yet assist thee to lay hold on the rock of ages  the subprior heard the sentiment so similar to that which had occurred to himself with the same kindly feelings with which the gamecock hears and replies to the challenge of his rival  i bless god and our lady said he drawing himself up that my faith is already anchored on that rock on which saint peter founded his church  it is a perversion of the text said the eager henry warden grounded on a vain play upon wordsa most idle paronomasia  the controversy would have been rekindled and in all probabilityfor what can insure the good temper and moderation of polemicsmight have ended in the preachers being transported a captive to the monastery had not christie of the clinthill observed that it was growing late and that he having to descend the glen which had no good reputation cared not greatly for travelling there after sunset the subprior therefore stifled his desire of argument and again telling the preacher that he trusted to his gratitude and generosity he bade him farewell  be assured my old friend replied warden that no willing act of mine shall be to thy prejudice but if my master shall place work before me i must obey god rather than man  these two men both excellent from natural disposition and acquired knowledge had more points of similarity than they themselves would have admitted in truth the chief distinction betwixt them was that the catholic defending a religion which afforded little interest to the feelings had in his devotion to the cause he espoused more of the head than of the heart and was politic cautious and artful while the protestant acting under the strong impulse of more latelyadopted conviction and feeling as he justly might a more animated confidence in his cause was enthusiastic eager and precipitate in his desire to advance it the priest would have been contented to defend the preacher aspired to conquer and of course the impulse by which the latter was governed was more active and more decisive they could not part from each other without a second pressure of hands and each looked in the face of his old companion as he bade him adieu with a countenance strongly expressive of sorrow affection and pity  father eustace then explained briefly to dame glendinning that this person was to be her guest for some days forbidding her and her whole household under high spiritual censures to hold any conversation with him on religious subjects but commanding her to attend to his wants in all other particulars  may our lady forgive me reverend father said dame glendinning somewhat dismayed at this intelligence but i must needs say that ower mony guests have been the ruin of mony a house and i trow they will bring down glendearg first came the lady of avenelher soul be at restshe meant nae illbut she brought with her as mony bogles and fairies as hae kept the house in care ever since sae that we have been living as it were in a dream and then came that english knight if it please you and if he hasna killed my son outright he has chased him aff the gate and it may be lang eneugh ere i see him againforby the damage done to outer door and inner door and now your reverence has given me the charge of a heretic who it is like may bring the great horned devil himself down upon us all and they say that it is neither door nor window will serve him but he will take away the side of the auld tower along with him nevertheless reverend father your pleasure is doubtless to be done to our power  go to woman said the subprior send for workmen from the clachan and let them charge the expense of their repairs to the community and i will give the treasurer warrant to allow them moreover in settling the rental mails and feuduties thou shalt have allowance for the trouble and charges to which thou art now put and i will cause strict search to be made after thy son  the dame curtsied deep and low at each favourable expression and when the subprior had done speaking she added her farther hope that the subprior would hold some communing with her gossip the miller concerning the fate of his daughter and expound to him that the chance had by no means happened through any negligence on her part  i sair doubt me father she said whether mysie finds her way back to the mill in a hurry but it was all her fathers own fault that let her run lamping about the country riding on barebacked naigs and never settling to do a turn of wark within doors unless it were to dress dainties at dinnertime for his ain kyte  you remind me dame of another matter of urgency said father eustace and god knows too many of them press on me at this moment this english knight must be sought out and explanation given to him of these most strange chances the giddy girl must also be recovered if she hath suffered in reputation by this unhappy mistake i will not hold myself innocent of the disgrace yet how to find them out i know not  so please you said christie of the clinthill i am willing to take the chase and bring them back by fair means or foul for though you have always looked as black as night at me whenever we have forgathered yet i have not forgotten that had it not been for you my neck would have kend the weight of my four quarters if any man can track the tread of them i will say in the face of both merse and teviotdale and take the forest to boot i am that man but first i have matters to treat of on my masters score if you will permit me to ride down the glen with you  nay but my friend said the subprior thou shouldst remember i have but slender cause to trust thee for a companion through a place so solitary  tush tush said the jackman fear me not i had the worst too surely to begin that sport again besides have i not said a dozen of times i owe you a life and when i owe a man either a good turn or a bad i never fail to pay it sooner or later moreover beshrew me if i care to go alone down the glen or even with my troopers who are every loon of them as much devils bairns as myself whereas if your reverence since that is the word take beads and psalter and i come along with jack and spear you will make the devils take the air and i will make all human enemies take the earth  edward here entered and told his reverence that his horse was prepared at this instant his eye caught his mothers and the resolution which he had so strongly formed was staggered when he recollected the necessity of bidding her farewell the subprior saw his embarrassment and came to his relief  dame said he i forgot to mention that your son edward goes with me to saint marys and will not return for two or three days  youll be wishing to help him to recover his brother may the saints reward your kindness  the subprior returned the benediction which in this instance he had not very well deserved and he and edward set forth on their route they were presently followed by christie who came up with his followers at such a speedy pace as intimated sufficiently that his wish to obtain spiritual convoy through the glen was extremely sincere he had however other matters to stimulate his speed for he was desirous to communicate to the subprior a message from his master julian connected with the delivery of the prisoner warden and having requested the subprior to ride with him a few yards before edward and the troopers of his own party he thus addressed him sometimes interrupting his discourse in a manner testifying that his fear of supernatural beings was not altogether lulled to rest by his confidence in the sanctity of his fellowtraveller  my master said the rider deemed he had sent you an acceptable gift in that old heretic preacher but it seems from the slight care you have taken of him that you make small account of the boon  nay said the subprior do not thus judge of it the community must account highly of the service and will reward it to thy master in goodly fashion but this man and i are old friends and i trust to bring him back from the paths of perdition  nay said the mosstrooper when i saw you shake hands at the beginning i counted that you would fight it all out in love and honour and that there would be no extreme dealings betwixt ye however it is all one to my mastersaint mary what call you yon sir monk  the branch of a willow streaming across the path betwixt us and the sky  beshrew me said christie if it looked not like a mans hand holding a swordbut touching my master he like a prudent man hath kept himself aloof in these broken times until he could see with precision what footing he was to stand upon right tempting offers he hath had from the lords of congregation whom you call heretics and at one time he was minded to be plain with you to have taken their wayfor he was assured that the lord james footnote lord james stewart afterwards the regent murray was coming this road at the head of a round body of cavalry and accordingly lord james did so far reckon upon him that he sent this man warden or whatsoever be his name to my masters protection as an assured friend and moreover with tidings that he himself was marching hitherward at the head of a strong body of horse  now our lady forfend said the subprior  amen answered christie in some trepidation did your reverence see aught  nothing whatever replied the monk it was thy tale which wrested from me that exclamation  and it was some cause replied he of the clinthill for if lord james should come hither your halidome would smoke for it but be of good cheerthat expedition is ended before it was begun the baron of avenel had sure news that lord james has been fain to march westward with his merrymen to protect lord semple against cassilis and the kennedies  by my faith it will cost him a brush for wot ye what they say of that name    twixt wigton and the town of ayr     portpatrick and the cruives of cree   no man need think for to bide there     unless he court saint kennedie  then said the subprior the lord jamess purpose of coming southwards being broken cost this person henry warden a cold reception at avenel castle  it would not have been altogether so rough a one said the mosstrooper for my master was in heavy thought what to do in these unsettled times and would scarce have hazarded misusing a man sent to him by so terrible a leader as the lord james but to speak the truth some busy devil tempted the old man to meddle with my masters christian liberty of handfasting with catherine of newport so that broke the wand of peace between them and now ye may have my master and all the force he can make at your devotion for lord james never forgave wrong done to him and if he come by the upper hand he will have julians head if there were never another of the name as it is like there is not excepting the bit slip of a lassie yonder and now i have told you more of my masters affairs than he would thank me for but you have done me a frank turn once and i may need one at your hands again  thy frankness said the subprior shall surely advantage thee for much it concerns the church in these broken times to know the purposes and motives of those around us but what is it that thy master expects from us in reward of good service for i esteem him one of those who are not willing to work without their hire  nay that i can tell you flatly for lord james had promised him in case he would be of his faction in these parts an easy tack of the teindsheaves of his own barony of avenel together with the lands of cranberrymoor which lie intersected with his own and he will look for no less at your hand  but there is old gilbert of cranberrymoor said the subprior what are we to make of him the heretic lord james may take on him to dispone upon the goods and lands of the halidome at his pleasure because doubtless but for the protection of god and the baronage which yet remain faithful to their creed he may despoil us of them by force but while they are the property of the community we may not take steadings from ancient and faithful vassals to gratify the covetousness of those who serve god only from the lucre of gain  by the mass said christie it is well talking sir priest but when ye consider that gilbert has but two halfstarved cowardly peasants to follow him and only an auld jaded aver to ride upon fitter for the plough than for manly service and that the baron of avenel never rides with fewer than  ten jackmen at his back and oftener with fifty bodin in all that effeirs to war as if they were to do battle for a kingdom and mounted on nags that nicker at the clash of the sword as if it were the clank of the lid of a cornchesti say when ye have computed all this ye may guess what course will best serve your monastery  friend said the monk i would willingly purchase thy masters assistance on his own terms since times leave us no better means of defence against sacrilegious spoliation of heresy but to take from a poor man his patrimony  for that matter said the rider his seat would scarce be a soft one if my master thought that gilberts interest stood betwixt him and what he wishes the halidome has land enough and gilbert may be quartered elsewhere  we will consider the possibility of so disposing the matter said the monk and will expect in consequence your masters most active assistance with all the followers he can make to join in the defence of the halidome against any force by which it may be threatened  a mans hand and a mailed glove on that said the jackman they  footnote as some atonement for their laxity of morals on most occasions the borderers were severe observers of the faith which they had pledged even to an enemy if any person broke his word so plighted the individual to whom faith had not been observed used to bring to the next bordermeeting a glove hung on the point of a spear and proclaim to scots and english the name of the defaulter this was accounted so great a disgrace to all connected with him that his own clansmen sometimes destroyed him to escape the infamy he had brought on them  constable a spy engaged by sir ralph sadler talks of two border thieves whom he used as his guidesthat they would not care to steal and yet that they would not betray any man that trusts in them for all the gold in scotland or in france they are my guides and outlaws if they would betray me they might get their pardons and cause me to be hanged but i have tried them ere thissadlers letters during the northern insurrection  call us marauders thieves and what not but the side we take we hold byand i will be blithe when my baron comes to a point which side he will take for the castle is a kind of hell our lady forgive me for naming such a word in this place while he is in his mood studying how he may best advantage himself and now heaven be praised we are in the open valley and i may swear a round oath should aught happen to provoke it  my friend said the subprior thou hast little merit in abstaining from oaths or blasphemy if it be only out of fear of evil spirits  nay i am not quite a church vassal yet said the jackman and if you link the curb too tight on a young horse i promise you he will rearwhy it is much for me to forbear old customs on any account whatever  the night being fine they forded the river at the spot where the sacristan met with his unhappy encounter with the spirit as soon as they arrived at the gate of the monastery the porter in waiting eagerly exclaimed reverend father the lord abbot is most anxious for your presence  let these strangers be carried to the great hall said the subprior and be treated with the best by the cellarer reminding them however of that modesty and decency of conduct which becometh guests in a house like this  but the lord abbot demands you instantly my venerable brother said father philip arriving in great haste i have not seen him more discouraged or desolate of counsel since the field of pinkiecleugh was stricken  i come my good brother i come said father eustace i pray thee good brother let this youth edward glendinning be conveyed to the chamber of the novices and placed under their instructor god hath touched his heart and he proposeth laying aside the vanities of the world to become a brother of our holy order which if his good parts be matched with fitting docility and humility he may one day live to adorn  my very venerable brother exclaimed old father nicholas who came hobbling with a third summons to the subprior i pray thee to hasten to our worshipful lord abbot the holy patroness be with us never saw i abbot of the house of st marys in such consternation and yet i remember me well when father ingelram had the news of floddenfield  i come i come venerable brother said father eustaceand having repeatedly ejaculated i come he at last went to the abbot in good earnest     chapter the thirtyfourth     it is not texts will do itchurch artillery   are silenced soon by real ordnance   and canons are but vain opposed to cannon   go coin your crosier melt your church plate down   bid the starved soldier banquet in your halls   and quaff your longsaved

eagerness of welcome which announced to the subprior an extreme agitation of spirits and the utmost need of good counsel there was neither mazerdish nor standingcup upon the little table at the elbow of his huge chair of state his beads alone lay there and it seemed as if he had been telling them in his extremity of distress beside the beads was placed the mitre of the abbot of an antique form and blazing with precious stones and the rich and highlyembossed crosier rested against the same table  the sacristan and old father nicholas had followed the subprior into the abbots apartment perhaps with the hope of learning something of the important matter which seemed to be in handthey were not mistaken for after having ushered in the subprior and being themselves in the act of retiring the abbot made them a signal to remain  my brethren he said it is well known to you with what painful zeal we have overseen the weighty affairs of this house committed to our unworthy handyour bread hath been given to you and your water hath been surei have not wasted the revenues of the convent on vain pleasures as hunting or hawking or in change of rich cope or alb or in feasting idle bards and jesters saving those who according to old wont were received in time of christmas and easter neither have i enriched either mine own relations nor strange women at the expense of the patrimony  there hath not been such a lord abbot said father nicholas to my knowledge since the days of abbot ingelram who  at that portentous word which always preluded a long story the abbot broke in  may god have mercy on his soulwe talk not of him nowwhat i would know of ye my brethren is whether i have in your mind faithfully discharged the duties of mine office  there has never been subject of complaint answered the subprior  the sacristan more diffuse enumerated the various acts of indulgence and kindness which the mild government of abbot boniface had conferred on the brotherhood of saint marysthe indulgentiaethe gratiasthe biberesthe weekly mess of boiled almondsthe enlarged accommodation of the refectorythe better arrangement of the cellaragethe improvement of the revenue of the monasterythe diminution of the privations of the brethren  you might have added my brother said the abbot listening with melancholy acquiescence to the detail of his own merits that i caused to be built that curious screen which secureth the cloisters from the northeast windbut all these things avail nothingas we read in holy maccabee capta est civitas per voluntatem dei it hath cost me no little thought no common toil to keep these weighty matters in such order as you have seen themthere was both barn and binn to be kept fullinfirmary dormitory guesthall and refectory to be looked toprocessions to be made confessions to be heard strangers to be entertained veniae to be granted or refused and i warrant me when every one of you was asleep in your cell the abbot hath lain awake for a full hour by the bell thinking how these matters might be ordered seemly and suitably  may we ask reverend my lord said the subprior what additional care has now been thrown upon you since your discourse seems to point that way  marry this it is said the abbot the talk is not now of biberes  footnote the biberes caritas and boiled almonds of which abbot boniface speaks were special occasions for enjoying luxuries afforded to the monks by grants from different sovereigns or from other benefactors to the convent there is one of these charters called de pitancia centum librarum by this charter which is very curious our robert bruce on the 10th january and in the twelfth year of his reign assigns out of the customs of berwick and failing them out of the customs of edinburgh or haddington the sum of one hundred pounds at the halfyearly terms of pentecost and saint martins in winter to the abbot and community of the monks of melrose the precise purpose of this annuity is to furnish to each of the monks of the said monastery while placed at food in the refectory an extra mess of rice boiled with milk or of almonds or peas or other pulse of that kind which could be procured in the country this addition to their commons is to be entitled the kings mess and it is declared that although any monk should from some honest apology want appetite or inclination to eat of the kings mess his share should nevertheless be placed on the table with those of his brethren and afterwards carried to the gate and given to the poor neither is it our pleasure continues the bountiful sovereign that the dinner which is or ought to be served up to the said monks according to their ancient rule should be diminished in quantity or rendered inferior in quality on account of this our mess so furnished as aforesaid it is moreover provided that the abbot with the consent of the most sage of his brethren shall name a prudent and decent monk for receiving directing and expending all matters concerning this annuity for the benefit of the community agreeably to the royal desire and intention rendering a faithful account thereof to the abbot and superiors of the same convent and the same charter declares the kings farther pleasure that the said men of religion should be bound yearly and for ever in acknowledgment of the above donation to clothe fifteen poor men at the feast of saint martin in winter and to feed them on the same day delivering to each of them four ells of large or broad or six ells of narrow cloth and to each also a new pair of shoes or sandals according to their order and if the said monks shall fail in their engagements or any of them it is the kings will that the fault shall be redeemed by a double performance of what has been omitted to be executed at the sight of the chief forester of ettrick for the time being and before the return of saint martins day succeeding that on which the omission has taken place  of this charter respecting the pittance of 100l assigned to furnish the monks of melrose with a daily mess of boiled rice almonds or other pulse to mend their commons the antiquarian reader will be pleased doubtless to see the original  carta regis

foster nor is it of the screening us from the east wind but how to escape lord james stewart who cometh to lay waste and destroy with his heretic soldiers  i thought that purpose had been broken by the feud between semple and the kennedies said the subprior hastily  they have accorded that matter at the expense of the church as usual said the abbot the earl of cassilis is to have the teindsheaves of his lands which were given to the house of crossraguel and he has stricken hands with stewart who is now called murrayprincipes convenerunt unum adversus dominumthere are the letters  the subprior took the letters which had come by an express messenger from the primate of scotland who still laboured to uphold the tottering fabric of the system under which he was at length buried and stepping towards the lamp read them with an air of deep and settled attentionthe sacristan and father nicholas looked as helplessly at each other as the denizens of the poultryyard when the hawk soars over it the abbot seemed bowed down with the extremity of sorrowful apprehension but kept his eye timorously fixed on the subprior as if striving to catch some comfort from the expression of his countenance when at length he beheld that after a second intent perusal of the letters he remained still silent and full of thought he asked him in an anxious tone what is to be done  our duty must be done answered the subprior and the rest is in the hands of god  our dutyour duty answered the abbot impatiently doubtless we are to do our duty but what is that duty or how will it serve uswill bell book and candle drive back the english heretics or will murray care for psalms and antiphonars or can i fight for the halidome like judas maccabeus against those profane nicanors or send the sacristan against this new holofernes to bring back his head in a basket  true my lord abbot said the subprior we cannot fight with carnal weapons it is alike contrary to our habit and vow but we can die for our convent and for our order besides we can arm those who will and can fight the english are but few in number trusting as it would seem that they will be joined by murray whose march has been interrupted if foster with his cumberland and hexham bandits ventures to march into scotland to pillage and despoil our house we will levy our vassals and i trust shall be found strong enough to give him battle  in the blessed name of our lady said the abbot think you that i am petrus eremita to go forth the leader of an host  nay said the subprior let some man skilled in war lead our peoplethere is julian avenel an approved soldier  but a scoffer a debauched person and in brief a man of belial quoth the abbot  still said the monk we must use his ministry in that to which he has been brought up we can guerdon him richly and indeed i already know the price of his service the english it is expected will presently set forth hoping here to seize upon piercie shafton whose refuge being taken with us they make the pretext of this unheardof inroad  is it even so said the abbot i never judged that his body of satin and his brain of feathers boded us much good  yet we must have his assistance if possible said the subprior he may interest in our behalf the great piercie of whose friendship he boasts and that good and faithful lord may break fosters purpose i will despatch the jackman after him with all speedchiefly however i trust to the military spirit of the land which will not suffer peace to be easily broken on the frontier credit me my lord it will bring to our side the hands of many whose hearts may have gone astray after strange doctrines  the great chiefs and barons will be ashamed to let the vassals of peaceful monks fight unaided against the old enemies of scotland  it may be said the abbot that foster will wait for murray whose purpose hitherward is but delayed for a short space  by the rood he will not said the subprior we know this sir john fostera pestilent heretic he will long to destroy the churchborn a borderer he will thirst to plunder her of her wealtha borderwarden he will be eager to ride in scotland there are too many causes to urge him on if he joins with murray he will have at best but an auxiliarys share of the spoilif he comes hither before him he will reckon on the whole harvest of depredation as his own julian avenel also has as i have heard some spite against sir john foster they will fight when they meet with double determination sacristan send for our bailiffwhere is the roll of fencible men liable to do suit and service to the halidomesend off to the baron of meigallot he can raise threescore horse and bettersay to him the monastery will compound with him for the customs of his bridge which have been in controversy if he will show himself a friend at such a pointand now my lord let us compute our possible numbers and those of the enemy that human blood be not spilled in vainlet us therefore calculate  my brain is dizzied with the emergency said the poor abboti am not i think more a coward than others so far as my own person is concerned but speak to me of marching and collecting soldiers and calculating forces and you may as well tell of it to the youngest novice of a nunnery but my resolution is takenbrethren he said rising up and coming forward with that dignity which his comely person enabled him to assume hear for the last time the voice of your abbot boniface i have done for you the best that i could in quieter times i had perhaps done better for it was for quiet that i sought the cloister which has been to me a place of turmoil as much as if i had sate in the receipt of custom or ridden forth as leader of an armed host but now matters turn worse and worse and i as i grow old am less able to struggle with them also it becomes me not to hold a place whereof the duties through my default or misfortune may be but imperfectly filled by me wherefore i have resolved to demit this mine high office so that the order of these matters may presently devolve upon father eustatius here present our wellbeloved subprior and i now rejoice that he hath not been provided according to his merits elsewhere seeing that i well hope he will succeed to the mitre and staff which it is my present purpose to lay down  in the name of our lady do nothing hastily my lord said father nicholasi do remember that when the worthy abbot ingelram being in his ninetieth yearfor i warrant you he could remember when benedict the thirteenth was deposedand being ill at ease and bedrid the brethren rounded in his ear that he were better resign his office and what said he being a pleasant man marry that while he could crook his little finger he would keep hold of the crosier with it  the sacristan also strongly remonstrated against the resolution of his superior and set down the insufficiency he pleaded to the native modesty of his disposition the abbot listened in downcast silence even flattery could not win his ear  father eustace took a nobler tone with his disconcerted and dejected superior my lord abbot he said if i have been silent concerning the virtues with which you have governed this house do not think that i am unaware of them i know that no man ever brought to your high office a more sincere wish to do well to all mankind and if your rule has not been marked with the bold lines which sometimes distinguished your spiritual predecessors their faults have equally been strangers to your character  i did not believe said the abbot turning his looks to father eustace with some surprise that you father of all men would have done me this justice  in your absence said the subprior i have even done it more fully  do not lose the good opinion which all men entertain of you by renouncing your office when your care is most needed  but my brother said the abbot i leave a more able in my place  that you do not said eustace because it is not necessary you should resign in order to possess the use of whatever experience or talent i may be accounted master of i have been long enough in this profession to know that the individual qualities which any of us may have are not his own but the property of the community and only so far useful when they promote the general advantage if you care not in person my lord to deal with this troublesome matter let me implore you to go instantly to edinburgh and make what friends you can in our behalf while i in your absence will as subprior do my duty in defence of the halidome if i succeed may the honour and praise be yours and if i fail let the disgrace and shame be mine own  the abbot mused for a space and then repliedno father eustatius you shall not conquer me by your generosity in times like these this house must have a stronger pilotage than my weak hands afford and he who steers the vessel must be chief of the crew shame were it to accept the praise of other mens labours and in my poor mind all the praise which can be bestowed on him who undertakes a task so perilous and perplexing is a meed beneath his merits misfortune to him would deprive him of an iota of it assume therefore your authority tonight and proceed in the preparations you judge necessary let the chapter be summoned tomorrow after we have heard mass and all shall be ordered as i have told you benedicite my brethrenpeace be with you may the new abbotexpectant sleep as sound as he who is about to resign his mitre  they retired affected even to tears the good abbot had shown a point of his character to which they were strangers even father eustace had held his spiritual superior hitherto as a goodhumoured indolent selfindulgent man whose chief merit was the absence of gross faults so that this sacrifice of power to a sense of duty even if a little alloyed by the meaner motives of fear and apprehended difficulties raised him considerably in the subpriors estimation he even felt an aversion to profit by the resignation of the abbot boniface and in a manner to rise on his ruins but this sentiment did not long contend with those which led him to recollect higher considerations it could not be denied that boniface was entirely unfit for his situation in the present crisis and the subprior felt that he himself acting merely as a delegate could not well take the decisive measures which the time required the weal of the community therefore demanded his elevation if besides there crept in a feeling of a high dignity obtained and the native exultation of a haughty spirit called to contend with the imminent dangers attached to a post of such distinction these sentiments were so cunningly blended and amalgamated with others of a more disinterested nature that as the subprior himself was unconscious of their agency we who have a regard for him are not solicitous to detect it  the abbot elect carried himself with more dignity than formerly when giving such directions as the pressing circumstances of the times required and those who approached him could perceive an unusual kindling of his falcon eye and an unusual flush upon his pale and faded cheek with briefness and precision he wrote and dictated various letters to different barons acquainting them with the meditated invasion of the halidome by the english and conjuring them to lend aid and assistance as in a common cause the temptation of advantage was held out to those whom he judged less sensible of the cause of honour and all were urged by the motives of patriotism and ancient animosity to the english the time had been when no such exhortations would have been necessary but so essential was elizabeths aid to the reformed party in scotland and so strong was that party almost every where that there was reason to believe a great many would observe neutrality on the present occasion even if they did not go the length of uniting with the english against the catholics  when father eustace considered the number of the immediate vassals of the church whose aid he might legally command his heart sunk at the thoughts of ranking them under the banner of the fierce and profligate julian avenel  were the young enthusiast halbert glendinning to be found thought father eustace in his anxiety i would have risked the battle under his leading young as he is and with better hope of gods blessing but the bailiff is now too infirm nor know i a chief of name whom i might trust in this important matter better than this avenelhe touched a bell which stood on the table and commanded christie of the clinthill to be brought before himthou owest me a life said he to that person on his entrance and i may do thee another good turn if thou best sincere with me  christie had already drained two standingcups of wine which would on another occasion have added to the insolence of his familiarity but at present there was something in the augmented dignity of manner of father eustace which imposed a restraint on him yet his answers partook of his usual character of undaunted assurance he professed himself willing to return a true answer to all inquiries  has the baron so styled of avenel any friendship with sir john foster warden of the west marches of england  such friendship as is between the wildcat and the terrier replied the rider  will he do battle with him should they meet  as surely answered christie as ever cock fought on shrovetideeven  and would he fight with foster in the churchs quarrel  on any quarrel or upon no quarrel whatever replied the jackman  we will then write to him letting him know that if upon occasion of an apprehended incursion by sir john foster he will join his force with ours he shall lead our men and be gratified for doing so to the extent of his wishyet one word morethou didst say thou couldst find out where the english knight piercie shafton has this day fled to  that i can and bring him back too by fair means or force as best likes your reverence  no force must be used upon him within what time wilt thou find him out  within thirty hours so he have not crossed the lothian firthif it is to do you a pleasure i will set off directly and wind him as a sleuthdog tracks the mosstrooper answered christie  bring him hither then and thou wilt deserve good at our hands which i may soon have free means of bestowing on thee  thanks to your reverence i put myself in your reverences hands we of the spear and snaffle walk something recklessly through life but if a man were worse than he is your reverence knows he must live and thats not to be done without shifting i trow  peace sir and begone on thine errandthou shalt have a letter from us to sir piercie  christie made two steps towards the door then turning back and hesitating like one who would make an impertinent pleasantry if he dared he asked what he was to do with the wench mysie happer whom the southron knight had carried off with him  am i to bring her hither please your reverence  hither you malapert knave said the churchman remember you to whom you speak  no offence meant replied christie but if such is not your will i would carry her to avenel castle where a wellfavoured wench was never unwelcome  bring the unfortunate girl to her fathers and break no scurril jests here said the subpriorsee that thou guide her in all safety and honour  in safety surely said the rider and in such honour as her outbreak has left heri bid your reverence farewell i must be on horse before cockcrow  what in the darkhow knowest thou which way to go  i tracked the knights horsetread as far as near to the ford as we rode along together said christie and i observed the track turn to the northward  he is for edinburgh i will warrant youso soon as daylight comes i will be on the road again it is a kenspeckle hoofmark for the shoe was made by old eckie of cannobiei would swear to the curve of the caulker so saying he departed  hateful necessity said father eustace looking after him that obliges us to use such implements as these but assailed as we are on all sides and by all conditions of men what alternative is left usbut now let me to my most needful task  the abbot elect accordingly sate down to write letters arrange orders and take upon him the whole charge of an institution which tottered to its fall with the same spirit of proud and devoted fortitude wherewith the commander of a fortress reduced nearly to the last extremity calculates what means remain to him to protract the fatal hour of successful storm in the meanwhile abbot boniface having given a few natural sighs to the downfall of the preeminence he had so long enjoyed amongst his brethren fell fast asleep leaving the whole cares and toils of office to his assistant and chapter ending is missing in the original     chapter the thirtyfifth     and when he came to broken briggs     he slacked his bow and swam   and when he came to grass growing     set down his feet and ran                          gil morrice  we return to halbert glendinning who as our readers may remember took the high road to edinburgh his intercourse with the preacher henry warden from whom he received a letter at the moment of his deliverance had been so brief that he had not even learned the name of the nobleman to whose care he was recommended something like a name had been spoken indeed but he had only comprehended that he was to meet the chief advancing towards the south at the head of a party of horse when day dawned on his journey he was in the same uncertainty a better scholar would have been informed by the address of the letter but halbert had not so far profited by father eustaces lessons as to be able to decipher it his motherwit taught him that he must not in such uncertain times be too hasty in asking information of any one and when after a long days journey night surprised him near a little village he began to be dubious and anxious concerning the issue of his journey  in a poor country hospitality is generally exercised freely and halbert when he requested a nights quarters did nothing either degrading or extraordinary  the old woman to whom he made this request granted it the more readily that she thought she saw some resemblance between halbert and her son saunders who had been killed in one of the frays so common in the time it is true saunders was a short squaremade fellow with red hair and a freckled face and somewhat bandylegged whereas the stranger was of a brown complexion tall and remarkably wellmade nevertheless the widow was clear that there existed a general resemblance betwixt her guest and saunders and kindly pressed him to share of her evening cheer  a pedlar a man of about forty years old was also her guest who talked with great feeling of the misery of pursuing such a profession as his in the time of war and tumult  we think much of knights and soldiers said he but the peddercoffe who travels the land has need of more courage than them all i am sure he maun face mair risk god help him here have i come this length trusting the godly earl of murray would be on his march to the borders for he was to have guestened with the baron of avenel and instead of that comes news that he has gone westlandways about some tuilzie in ayrshire  and what to do i wot not for if i go to the south without a safeguard the next bonny rider i meet might ease me of sack and pack and maybe of my life to boot and then if i try to strike across the moors i may be as ill off before i can join myself to that good lords company  no one was quicker at catching a hint than halbert glendinning he said he himself had a desire to go westward the pedlar looked at him with a very doubtful air when the old dame who perhaps thought her young guest resembled the umquhile saunders not only in his looks but in a certain pretty turn to sleightofhand which the defunct was supposed to have possessed tipped him the wink and assured the pedlar he need have no doubt that her young cousin was a true man  cousin said the pedlar i thought you said this youth had been a stranger  ill hearing makes ill rehearsing said the landlady he is a stranger to me by eyesight but that does not make him a stranger to me by blood more especially seeing his likeness to my son saunders poor bairn  the pedlars scruples and jealousies being thus removed or at least silenced the travellers agreed that they would proceed in company together the next morning by daybreak the pedlar acting as a guide to glendinning and the youth as a guard to the pedlar until they should fall in with murrays detachment of horse it would appear that the lady never doubted what was to be the event of this compact for taking glendinning aside she charged him to be moderate with the puir body but at all events not to forget to take a piece of black say to make the auld wife a new rokelay halbert laughed and took his leave  it did not a little appal the pedlar when in the midst of a black heath the young man told him the nature of the commission with which their hostess had charged him he took heart however upon seeing the open frank and friendly demeanor of the youth and vented his exclamations on the ungrateful old traitress i gave her he said yesterdayeen nae farther gane a yard of that very black say to make her a couvrechef but i see it is ill done to teach the cat the way to the kirn  thus set at ease on the intentions of his companion for in those happy days the worst was always to be expected from a stranger the pedlar acted as halberts guide over moss and moor over hill and many a dale in such a direction as might best lead them towards the route of murrays party at length they arrived upon the side of an eminence which commanded a distant prospect over a tract of savage and desolate moorland marshy and wastean alternate change of shingly hill and level morass only varied by blue stagnant pools of water a road scarcely marked winded like a serpent through the wilderness and the pedlar pointing to it saidthe road from edinburgh to glasgow here we must wait and if murray and his train be not already passed by we shall soon see trace of them unless some new purpose shall have altered their resolution for in these blessed days no man were he the nearest the throne as the earl of murray may be knows when he lays his head on his pillow at night where it is to lie upon the following even  they paused accordingly and sat down the pedlar cautiously using for a seat the box which contained his treasures and not concealing from his companion that he wore under his cloak a pistolet hanging at his belt in case of need he was courteous however and offered halbert a share of the provisions which he carried about him for refreshment they were of the coarsest kindoatbread baked in cakes oatmeal slaked with cold water an onion or two and a morsel of smoked ham completed the feast but such as it was no scotsman of the time had his rank been much higher than that of glendinning would have refused to share in it especially as the pedlar produced with a mysterious air a tups horn which he carried slung from his shoulders and which when its contents were examined produced to each party a clamshellfull of excellent usquebaugha liquor strange to halbert for the strong waters known in the south of scotland came from france and in fact such were but rarely used the pedlar recommended it as excellent said he had procured it in his last visit to the braes of doune where he had securely traded under the safeconduct of the laird of buchanan he also set an example to halbert by devoutly emptying the cup to the speedy downfall of antichrist  their conviviality was scarce ended ere a rising dust was seen on the road of which they commanded the prospect and half a score of horsemen were dimly descried advancing at considerable speed their casques glancing and the points of their spears twinkling as they caught a glimpse of the sun  these said the pedlar must be the outscourers of murrays party let us lie down in the peathag and keep ourselves out of sight  and why so said halbert let us rather go down and make a signal to them  god forbid replied the pedlar do you ken so ill the customs of our scottish nation that plump of spears that are spurring on so fast are doubtless commanded by some wild kinsman of morton or some such daring fearnothing as neither regards god nor man it is their business if they meet with any enemies to pick quarrels and clear the way of them and the chief knows nothing of what happens coming up with his more discreet and moderate friends it may be a full mile in the rear were we to go near these lads of the lairds belt your letter would do you little good and my pack would do me muckle black ill they would tirl every steek of claithes from our back fling us into a mosshag with a stone at our heels naked as the hour that brought us into this cumbered and sinful world and neither murray nor any other man ever the wiser but if he did come to ken of it what might he help itit would be accounted a mere mistake and there were all the moan made o credit me youth that when men draw cold steel on each other in their native country they neither can nor may dwell deeply on the offences of those whose swords are useful to them  they suffered therefore the vanguard as it might be termed of the earl of murrays host to pass forward and it was not long until a denser cloud of dust began to arise to the northward  now said the pedlar let us hurry down the hill for to tell the truth said he dragging halbert along earnestly a scottish nobles march is like a serpentthe head is furnished with fangs and the tail hath its sting the only harmless point of access is the main body  i will hasten as fast as you said the youth but tell me why the rearward of such an army should be as dangerous as the van  because as the vanguard consists of their picked wild desperates resolute for mischief such as neither fear god nor regard their fellowcreatures but understand themselves bound to hurry from the road whatever is displeasing to themselves so the rearguard consists of misproud servingmen who being in charge of the baggage take care to amend by their exactions upon travellingmerchants and others their own thefts on their masters property you will hear the advanced enfans perdus as the french call them and so they are indeed namely children of the fall singing unclean and fulsome ballads of sin and harlotrie and then will come on the middleward when you will hear the canticles and psalms sung by the reforming nobles and the gentry and honest and pious clergy by whom they are accompanied and last of all you will find in the rear a legend of godless lackies palfreniers and horseboys talking of nothing but dicing drinking and drabbing  as the pedlar spoke they had reached the side of the highroad and murrays main body was in sight consisting of about three hundred horse marching with great regularity and in a closely compacted body some of the troopers wore the liveries of their masters but this was not common most of them were dressed in such colours as chance dictated but the majority being clad in blue cloth and the whole armed with cuirass and backplate with sleeves of mail gauntlets and poldroons and either mailed hose or strong jackboots they had something of a uniform appearance  many of the leaders were clad in complete armour and all in a certain halfmilitary dress which no man of quality in those disturbed times ever felt himself sufficiently safe to abandon  the foremost of this party immediately rode up to the pedlar and to halbert glendinning and demanded of them who they were the pedlar told his story the young glendinning exhibited his letter which a gentleman carried to murray in an instant after the word halt was given through the squadron and at once the onward heavy tramp which seemed the most distinctive attribute of the body ceased and was heard no more the command was announced that the troop should halt here for an hour to refresh themselves and their horses the pedlar was assured of safe protection and accommodated with the use of a baggage horse but at the same time he was ordered into the rear a command which he reluctantly obeyed and not without wringing pathetically the hand of halbert as he separated from him  the young heir of glendearg was in the meanwhile conducted to a plot of ground more raised and therefore drier than the rest of the moor here a carpet was flung on the ground by way of tablecloth and around it sat the leaders of the party partaking of an entertainment as coarse with relation to their rank as that which glendinning had so lately shared  murray himself rose as he came forward and advanced a step to meet him  this celebrated person had in his appearance as well as in his mind much of the admirable qualities of james v his father had not the stain of illegitimacy rested upon his birth he would have filled the scottish throne with as much honour as any of the stewart race but history while she acknowledges his high talents and much that was princely nay royal in his conduct cannot forget that ambition led him farther than honour or loyalty warranted brave amongst the bravest fair in presence and in favour skilful to manage the most intricate affairs to attach to himself those who were doubtful to stun and overwhelm by the suddenness and intrepidity of his enterprises those who were resolute in resistance he attained and as to personal merit certainly deserved the highest place in the kingdom but he abused under the influence of strong temptation the opportunities which his sister marys misfortunes and imprudence threw in his way he supplanted his sovereign and benefactress in her power and his history affords us one of those mixed characters in which principle was so often sacrificed to policy that we must condemn the statesman while we pity and regret the individual many events in his life gave likelihood to the charge that he himself aimed at the crown and it is too true that he countenanced the fatal expedient of establishing an english that is a foreign and a hostile interest in the councils of scotland but his death may be received as an atonement for his offences and may serve to show how much more safe is the person of a real patriot than that of the mere head of a faction who is accounted answerable for the offences of his meanest attendants  when murray approached the young rustic was naturally abashed at the dignity of his presence the commanding form and the countenance to which high and important thoughts were familiar the features which bore the resemblance of scotlands long line of kings were well calculated to impress awe and reverence his dress had little to distinguish him from the highborn nobles and barons by whom he was attended a buffcoat richly embroidered with silken lace supplied the place of armour and a massive gold chain with its medal hung round his neck his black velvet bonnet was decorated with a string of large and fair pearls and with a small tufted feather a long heavy sword was girt to his side as the familiar companion of his hand he wore gilded spurs on his boots and these completed his equipment  this letter he said is from the godly preacher of the word henry warden young man is it not so halbert answered in the affirmative and he writes to us it would seem in some strait and refers us to you for the circumstances let us know i pray you how things stand with him  in some perturbation halbert glendinning gave an account of the circumstances which had accompanied the preachers imprisonment when he came to the discussion of the handfasting engagement he was struck with the ominous and displeased expression of murrays brows and contrary to all prudential and politic rule seeing something was wrong yet not well aware what that something was had almost stopped short in his narrative  what ails the fool said the earl drawing his darkred eyebrows together while the same dusky glow kindled on his browhast thou not learned to tell a true tale without stammering  so please you answered halbert with considerable address i have never before spoken in such a presence  he seems a modest youth said murray turning to his next attendant and yet one who in a good cause will neither fear friend nor foespeak on friend and speak freely  halbert then gave an account of the quarrel betwixt julian avenel and the preacher which the earl biting his lip the while compelled himself to listen to as a thing of indifference at first he appeared even to take the part of the baron  henry warden he said is too hot in his zeal the law both of god and man maketh allowance for certain alliances though not strictly formal and the issue of such may succeed  this general declaration he expressed accompanying it with a glance around upon the few followers who were present at this interview the most of them answeredthere is no contravening that but one or two looked on the ground and were silent murray then turned again to glendinning commanding him to say what next chanced and not to omit any particular when he mentioned the manner in which julian had cast from him his concubine murray drew a deep breath set his teeth hard and laid his hand on the hilt of his dagger casting his eyes once more around the circle which was now augmented by one or two of the reformed preachers he seemed to devour his rage in silence and again commanded halbert to proceed when he came to describe how warden had been dragged to a dungeon the earl seemed to have found the point at which he might give vent to his own resentment secure of the sympathy and approbation of all who were present judge you he said looking to those around him judge you my peers and noble gentlemen of scotland betwixt me and this julian avenelhe hath broken his own word and hath violated my safeconductand judge you also my reverend brethren he hath put his hand forth upon a preacher of the gospel and perchance may sell his blood to the worshippers of antichrist  let him die the death of a traitor said the secular chiefs and let his tongue be struck through with the hangmans fiery iron to avenge his perjury  let him go down to his place with baals priests said the preachers and be his ashes cast into tophet  murray heard them with the smile of expected revenge yet it is probable that the brutal treatment of the female whose circumstances somewhat resembled those of the earls own mother had its share in the grim smile which curled his sunburnt cheek and its haughty lip to halbert glendinning when his narrative was finished he spoke with great kindness  he is a bold and gallant youth said he to those around and formed of the stuff which becomes a bustling time there are periods when mens spirits shine bravely through them i will know something more of him  he questioned him more particularly concerning the baron of avenels probable forcesthe strength of his castlethe dispositions of his next heir and this brought necessarily forward the sad history of his brothers daughter mary avenel which was told with an embarrassment that did not escape murray  ha julian avenel he said and do you provoke my resentment when you have so much more reason to deprecate my justice i knew walter avenel a true scotsman and a good soldier our sister the queen must right his daughter and were her land restored she would be a fitting bride to some brave man who may better merit our favour than the traitor julianthen looking at halbert he said art thou of gentle blood young man  halbert with a faltering and uncertain voice began to speak of his distant pretensions to claim a descent from the ancient glendonwynes of galloway when murray interrupted him with a smile  naynayleave pedigrees to bards and heralds in our days each man is the son of his own deeds the glorious light of reformation hath shone alike on prince and peasant and peasant as well as prince may be illustrated by fighting in its defence it is a stirring world where all may advance themselves who have stout hearts and strong arms tell me frankly why thou hast left thy fathers house  halbert glendinning made a frank confession of his duel with piercie shafton and mentioned his supposed death  by my hand said murray thou art a bold sparrowhawk to match thee so early with such a kite as piercie shafton queen elizabeth would give her glove filled with gold crowns to know that meddling coxcomb to be under the sodwould she not morton  ay by my word and esteem her glove a better gift than the crowns replied morton which few border lads like this fellow will esteem just valuation  but what shall we do with this young homicide said murray what will our preachers say  tell them of moses and of benaiah said morton it is but the smiting of an egyptian when all is said out  let it be so said murray laughing but we will bury the tale as the prophet did the body in the sand i will take care of this swankiebe near to us glendinning since that is thy name we retain thee as a squire of our household the master of our horse will see thee fully equipped and armed  during the expedition which he was now engaged in murray found several opportunities of putting glendinnings courage and presence of mind to the test and he began to rise so rapidly in his esteem that those who knew the earl considered the youths fortune as certain one step only was wanting to raise him to a still higher degree of confidence and favourit was the abjuration of the popish religion the ministers who attended upon murray and formed his chief support amongst the people found an easy convert in halbert glendinning who from his earliest days had never felt much devotion towards the catholic faith and who listened eagerly to more reasonable views of religion by thus adopting the faith of his master he rose higher in his favour and was constantly about his person during his prolonged stay in the west of scotland which the intractability of those whom the earl had to deal with protracted from day to day and week to week     chapter the thirtysixth     faint the din of battle brayd     distant down the hollow wind   war and terror fled before     wounds and death were left behind                       penrose  the autumn of the year was well advanced when the earl of morton one morning rather unexpectedly entered the antechamber of murray in which halbert glendinning was in waiting  call your master halbert said the earl i have news for him from teviotdale and for you too glendinningnews news my lord of murray he exclaimed at the door of the earls bedroom come forth instantly the earl appeared and greeted his ally demanding eagerly his tidings  i have had a sure friend with me from the south said morton he has been at saint marys monastery and brings important tidings of what complexion said murray and can you trust the bearer he is faithful on my life said morton i wish all around your lordship may prove equally so  at what and whom do you point demanded murray  here is the egyptian of trusty halbert glendinning our southland moses come alive again and flourishing gay and bright as ever in that teviotdale goshen the halidome of kennaquhair  what mean you my lord said murray  only that your new henchman has put a false tale upon you piercie shafton is alive and well by the same token that the gull is thought to be detained there by love to a millers daughter who roamed the country with him in disguise  glendinning said murray bending his brow into his darkest frown thou hast not i trust dared to bring me a lie in thy mouth in order to win my confidence  my lord said halbert i am incapable of a lie i should choke on one were my life to require that i pronounced it i say that this sword of my father was through the bodythe point came out behind his backthe hilt pressed upon his breastbone and i will plunge it as deep in the body of any one who shall dare to charge me with falsehood  how fellow said morton wouldst thou beard a nobleman  be silent halbert said murray and you my lord of morton forbear him i see truth written on his brow  i wish the inside of the manuscript may correspond with the superscription replied his more suspicious ally look to it my lord you will one day lose your life by too much confidence  and you will lose your friends by being too readily suspicious answered murray enough of thislet me hear thy tidings  sir john foster said morton is about to send a party into scotland to waste the halidome  how without waiting my presence and permission said murrayhe is madwill he come as an enemy into the queens country  he has elizabeths express orders answered morton and they are not to be trifled with indeed his march has been more than once projected and laid aside during the time we have been here and has caused much alarm at kennaquhair boniface the old abbot has resigned and whom think you they have chosen in his place  no one surely said murray they would presume to hold no election until the queens pleasure and mine were known  morton shrugged his shouldersthey have chosen the pupil of old cardinal beatoun that wily determined champion of rome the bosomfriend of our busy primate of saint andrews eustace late the subprior of kennaquhair is now its abbot and like a second pope julius is levying men and making musters to fight with foster if he comes forward  we must prevent that meeting said murray hastily whichever party wins the day it were a fatal encounter for uswho commands the troop of the abbot  our faithful old friend julian avenel nothing less answered morton  glendinning said murray sound trumpets to horse directly and let all who love us get on horseback without delayyes my lord this were indeed a fatal dilemma if we take part with our english friends the country will cry shame on usthe very old wives will attack us with their rocks and spindlesthe very stones of the street will rise up against uswe cannot set our face to such a deed of infamy and my sister whose confidence i already have such difficulty in preserving will altogether withdraw it from me then were we to oppose the english warden elizabeth would call it a protecting of her enemies and what not and we should lose her  the shedragon said morton is the best card in our pack and yet i would not willingly stand still and see english blades carve scots fleshwhat say you to loitering by the way marching far and easy for fear of spoiling our horses they might then fight dog fight bull fight abbot fight archer and no one could blame us for what chanced when we were not present  all would blame us james douglas replied murray we should lose both sideswe had better advance with the utmost celerity and do what we can to keep the peace betwixt themi would the nag that brought piercie shafton hither had broken his neck over the highest heuch in northumberlandhe is a proper coxcomb to make all this bustle about and to occasion perhaps a national war  had we known in time said douglas we might have had him privily waited upon as he entered the borders there are strapping lads enough would have rid us of him for the lucre of his spurwhang  footnote spurwhangspurleather but to the saddle james stewart since so the phrase goes i hear your trumpets bound to horse and awaywe shall soon see which nag is best breathed  followed by a train of about three hundred wellmounted menatarms these two powerful barons directed their course to dumfries and from thence eastward to teviotdale marching at a rate which as morton had foretold soon disabled a good many of their horses so that when they approached the scene of expected action there were not above two hundred of their train remaining in a body and of these most were mounted on steeds which had been sorely jaded  they had hitherto been amused and agitated by various reports concerning the advance of the english soldiers and the degree of resistance which the abbot was able to oppose to them but when they were six or seven miles from saint marys of kennaquhair a gentleman of the country whom murray had summoned to attend him and on whose intelligence he knew he could rely arrived at the head of two or three servants bloody with spurring fiery red with haste according to his report sir john foster after several times announcing and as often delaying his intended incursion had at last been so stung with the news that piercie shafton was openly residing within the halidome that he determined to execute the commands of his mistress which directed him at every risk to make himself master of the euphuists person the abbots unceasing exertions had collected a body of men almost equal in number to those of the english warden but less practised in arms they were united under the command of julian avenel and it was apprehended they would join battle upon the banks of a small stream which forms the verge of the halidome  who knows the place said murray  i do my lord answered glendinning  tis well said the earl take a score of the bestmounted horsemake what haste thou canst and announce to them that i am coming up instantly with a strong power and will cut to pieces without mercy whichever party strikes the first blowdavidson said he to the gentleman who brought the intelligence thou shalt be my guidehie thee on glendinningsay to foster i conjure him as he respects his mistresss service that he will leave the matter in my hands say to the abbot i will burn the monastery over his head if he strikes a stroke till i cometell the dog julian avenel that he hath already one deep score to settle with mei will set his head on the top of the highest pinnacle of saint marys if he presume to open another make haste and spare not the spur for fear of spoiling horseflesh  your bidding shall be obeyed my lord said glendinning and choosing those whose horses were in best plight to be his attendants he went off as fast as the jaded state of their cavalry permitted hill and hollow vanished from under the feet of the chargers  they had not ridden half the way when they met stragglers coming off from the field whose appearance announced that the conflict was begun  two supported in their arms a third their elder brother who was pierced with an arrow through the body halbert who knew them to belong to the halidome called them by their names and questioned them of the state of the affray but just then in spite of their efforts to retain him in the saddle their brother dropped from the horse and they dismounted in haste to receive his last breath from men thus engaged no information was to be obtained glendinning therefore pushed on with his little troop the more anxiously as he perceived other stragglers bearing saint andrews cross upon their caps and corslets flying apparently from the field of battle  most of these when they were aware of a body of horsemen approaching on the road held to the one hand or the other at such a distance as precluded coming to speech of them others whose fear was more intense kept the onward road galloping wildly as fast as their horses could carry them and when questioned only glared without reply on those who spoke to them and rode on without drawing bridle several of these were also known to halbert who had therefore no doubt from the circumstances in which he met them that the men of the halidome were defeated he became now unspeakably anxious concerning the fate of his brother who he could not doubt must have been engaged in the affray he therefore increased the speed of his horse so that not above five or six of his followers could keep up with him at length he reached a little hill at the descent of which surrounded by a semicircular sweep of a small stream lay the plain which had been the scene of the skirmish  it was a melancholy spectacle war and terror to use the expression of the poet had rushed on to the field and left only wounds and death behind them the battle had been stoutly contested as was almost always the case with these border skirmishes where ancient hatred and mutual injuries made men stubborn in maintaining the cause of their conflict  towards the middle of the plain there lay the bodies of several men who had fallen in the very act of grappling with the enemy and there were seen countenances which still bore the stern expression of unextinguishable hate and defiance hands which clasped the hilt of the broken falchion or strove in vain to pluck the deadly arrow from the wound some were wounded and cowed of the courage they had lately shown were begging aid and craving water in a tone of melancholy depression while others tried to teach the faltering tongue to pronounce some halfforgotten prayer which even when first learned they had but half understood halbert uncertain what course he was next to pursue rode through the plain to see if among the dead or wounded he could discover any traces of his brother edward he experienced no interruption from the english a distant cloud of dust announced that they were still pursuing the scattered fugitives and he guessed that to approach them with his followers until they were again under some command would be to throw away his own life and that of his men whom the victors would instantly confound with the scots against whom they had been successful he resolved therefore to pause until murray came up with his forces to which he was the more readily moved as he heard the trumpets of the english warden sounding the retreat and recalling from the pursuit he drew his men together and made a stand in an advantageous spot of ground which had been occupied by the scots in the beginning of the action and most fiercely disputed while the skirmish lasted  while he stood here halberts ear was assailed by the feeble moan of a woman which he had not expected to hear amid that scene until the retreat of the foes had permitted the relations of the slain to approach for the purpose of paying them the last duties he looked with anxiety and at length observed that by the body of a knignt in bright armour whose crest though soiled and broken still showed the marks of rank and birth there sat a female wrapped in a horsemans cloak and holding something pressed against her bosom which he soon discovered to be a child he glanced towards the english they advanced not and the continued and prolonged sound of their trumpets with the shouts of the leaders announced that their powers would not be instantly reassembled he had therefore a moment to look after this unfortunate woman he gave his horse to a spearman as he dismounted and approaching the unhappy female asked her in the most soothing tone he could assume whether he could assist her in her distress the mourner made him no direct answer but endeavouring with a trembling and unskilful hand to undo the springs of the visor and gorget said in a tone of impatient grief oh he would recover instantly could i but give him airland and living life and honour would i give for the power of undoing these cruel iron platings that suffocate him he that would soothe sorrow must not argue on the vanity of the most deceitful hopes the body lay as that of one whose last draught of vital air had been drawn and who must never more have concern with the nether sky but halbert glendinning failed not to raise the visor and cast loose the gorget when to his great surprise he recognized the pale face of julian avenel his last fight was over the fierce and turbid spirit had departed in the strife in which it had so long delighted  alas he is gone said halbert speaking to the young woman in whom he had now no difficulty of knowing the unhappy catherine  oh no no no she reiterated do not say sohe is not deadhe is but in a swoon i have lain as long in one myselfand then his voice would arouse me when he spoke kindly and said catherine look up for my sakeand look up julian for mine she said addressing the senseless corpse i know you do but counterfeit to frighten me but i am not frightened she added with an hysterical attempt to laugh and then instantly changing her tone entreated him to speak were it but to curse my folly  oh the rudest word you ever said to me would now sound like the dearest you wasted on me before i gave you all lift him up she said lift him up for gods sakehave you no compassion he promised to wed me if i bore him a boy and this child is so like to its fatherhow shall he keep his word if you do not help me to awaken himchristie of the clinthill rowley hutcheon ye were constant at his feast but ye fled from him at the fray false villains as ye are  not i by heaven said a dying man who made some shift to raise himself on his elbow and discovered to halbert the wellknown features of christie i fled not a foot and a man can but fight while his breath lastsmine is going fastso youngster said he looking at glendinning and seeing his military dress thou hast taen the basnet at last it is a better cap to live in than die in i would chance had sent thy brother here insteadthere was good in himbut thou art as wild and wilt soon be as wicked as myself  god forbid said halbert hastily  marry and amen with all my heart said the wounded man there will be company enow without thee where i am going but god be praised i had no hand in that wickedness said he looking to poor catherine and with some exclamation in his mouth that sounded betwixt a prayer and a curse the soul of christie of the clinthill took wing to the last account  deeply wrapt in the painful interest which these shocking events had excited glendinning forgot for a moment his own situation and duties and was first recalled to them by a trampling of horse and the cry of saint george for england which the english soldiers still continued to use his handful of men for most of the stragglers had waited for murrays coming up remained on horseback holding their lances upright having no command either to submit or resist  there stands our captain said one of them as a strong party of english came up the vanguard of fosters troop  your captain with his sword sheathed and on foot in the presence of his enemy a raw soldier i warrant him said the english leader so ho young man is your dream out and will you now answer me if you will fight or fly  neither answered halbert glendinning with great tranquillity  then throw down thy sword and yield thee answered the englishman  not till i can help myself no otherwise said halbert with the same moderation of tone and manner  art thou for thine own hand friend or to whom dost thou owe service demanded the english captain  to the noble earl of murray  then thou servest said the southron the most disloyal nobleman who breathesfalse both to england and scotland  thou liest said glendinning regardless of all consequences  ha art thou so hot how and wert so cold but a minute since i lie do i wilt thou do battle with me on that quarrel  with one to oneone to twoor two to five as you list said halbert glendinning grant me but a fair field  that thou shalt havestand back my mates said the brave englishman if i fall give him fair play and let him go off free with his people  long life to the noble captain cried the soldiers as impatient to see the duel as if it had been a bullbaiting  he will have a short life of it though said the sergeant if he an old man of sixty is to fight for any reason or for no reason with every man he meets and especially the young fellows he might be father toand here comes the warden besides to see the swordplay  in fact sir john foster came up with a considerable body of his horsemen just as his captain whose age rendered him unequal to the combat with so strong and active a youth as glendinning was deprived of his sword  take it up for shame old stawarth bolton said the english warden and thou young man tell me who and what thou art  a follower of the earl of murray who bore his will to your honour answered glendinningbut here he comes to say it himself i see the van of his horsemen come over the hills  get into order my masters said sir john foster to his followers you that have broken your spears draw your swords we are something unprovided for a second field but if yonder dark cloud on the hill edge bring us foul weather we must bear as bravely as our broken cloaks will bide it  meanwhile stawarth we have got the deer we have hunted forhere is piercie shafton hard and fast betwixt two troopers  who that lad said bolton he is no more piercie shafton than i am he hath his gay cloak indeedbut piercie shafton is a round dozen of years older than that slip of roguery i have known him since he was thus high did you never see him in the tiltyard or in the presence  to the devil with such vanities said sir john foster when had i leisure for them or any thing else during my whole life has she kept me to this hangmans office chasing thieves one day and traitors another in daily fear of my life the lance never hung up in the hall the foot never out of the stirrup the saddles never off my nags backs and now because i have been mistaken in the person of a man i never saw i warrant me the next letters from the privy council will rate me as i were a doga man were better dead than thus slaved and harassed  a trumpet interrupted fosters complaints and a scottish pursuivant who attended declared that the noble earl of murray desired in all honour and safety a personal conference with sir john foster midway between their parties with six of company in each and ten free minutes to come and go  and now said the englishman comes another plague i must go speak with yonder false scot and he knows how to frame his devices to cast dust in the eyes of a plain man as well as ever a knave in the north i am no match for him in words and for hard blows we are but too ill providedpursuivant we grant the conferenceand you sir swordsman speaking to young glendinning draw off with your troopers to your own partymarchattend your earls trumpetstawarth bolton put our troop in order and be ready to move forward at the wagging of a fingerget you gone to your own friends i tell you sir squire and loiter not here  notwithstanding this peremptory order halbert glendinning could not help stopping to cast a look upon the unfortunate catherine who lay insensible of the danger and of the trampling of so many horses around her insensible as the second glance assured him of all and forever glendinning almost rejoiced when he saw that the last misery of life was over and that the hoofs of the warhorses amongst which he was compelled to leave her could only injure and deface a senseless corpse he caught the infant from her arms half ashamed of the shout of laughter which rose on all sides at seeing an armed man in such a situation assume such an unwonted and inconvenient burden  shoulder your infant cried a harquebusier  port your infant said a pikeman  peace ye brutes said stawarth bolton and respect humanity in others if you have none yourselves i pardon the lad having done some discredit to my gray hairs when i see him take care of that helpless creature which ye would have trampled upon as if ye had been littered of bitchwolves not born of women  while this passed the leaders on either side met in the neutral space betwixt the forces of either and the earl accosted the english warden  is this fair or honest usage sir john or for whom do you hold the earl of morton and myself that you ride in scotland with arrayed banner fight slay and make prisoners at your own pleasure is it well done think you to spoil our land and shed our blood after the many proofs we have given to your mistress of our devotion due to her will saving always the allegiance due to our own sovereign  my lord of murray answered foster all the world knows you to be a man of quick ingine and deep wisdom and these several weeks you have held me in hand with promising to arrest my sovereign mistresss rebel this piercie shafton of wilverton and you have never kept your word alleging turmoils in the west and i wot not what other causes of hinderance now since he has had the insolence to return hither and live openly within ten miles of england i could no longer in plain duty to my mistress and queen tarry upon your successive delays and therefore i have used her force to take her rebel by the strong hand wherever i can find him  and is piercie shafton in your hands then said the earl of murray be aware that i may not without my own great shame suffer you to remove him hence without doing battle  will you lord earl after all the advantages you have received at the hands of the queen of england do battle in the cause of her rebel said sir john foster  not so sir john answered the earl but i will fight to the death in defence of the liberties of our free kingdom of scotland  by my faith said sir john foster i am well contentmy sword is not blunted with all it has done yet this day  by my honour sir john said sir george heron of chipchase there is but little reason we should fight these scottish lords een now for i hold opinion with old stawarth bolton and believe yonder prisoner to be no more piercie shafton than he is the earl of northumberland and you were but ill advised to break the peace betwixt the countries for a prisoner of less consequence than that gay mischiefmaker  sir george replied foster i have often heard you herons are afraid of hawksnay lay not hand on sword mani did but jest and for this prisoner let him be brought up hither that we may see who or what he isalways under assurance my lords he continued addressing the scots  upon our word and honour said morton we will offer no violence  the laugh turned against sir john foster considerably when the prisoner being brought up proved not only a different person from sir piercie shafton but a female in mans attire  pluck the mantle from the queans face and cast her to the horseboys said foster she has kept such company ere now i warrant  even murray was moved to laughter no common thing with him at the disappointment of the english warden but he would not permit any violence to be offered to the fair molinara who had thus a second time rescued sir piercie shafton at her own personal risk  you have already done more mischief than you can well answer said the earl to the english warden and it were dishonour to me should i permit you to harm a hair of this young womans head  my lord said morton if sir john will ride apart with me but for one moment i will show him such reasons as shall make him content to depart and to refer this unhappy days work to the judgment of the commissioners nominated to try offences on the border  he then led sir john foster aside and spoke to him in this mannersir john foster i much marvel that a man who knows your queen elizabeth as you do should not know that if you hope any thing from her it must be for doing her useful service not for involving her in quarrels with her neighbours without any advantage sir knight i will speak frankly what i know to be true had you seized the true piercie shafton by this illadvised inroad and had your deed threatened as most likely it might a breach betwixt the countries your politic princess and her politic council would rather have disgraced sir john foster than entered into war in his behalf but now that you have stricken short of your aim you may rely on it you will have little thanks for carrying the matter farther i will work thus far on the earl of murray that he will undertake to dismiss sir piercie shafton from the realm of scotlandbe well advised and let the matter now pass offyou will gain nothing by farther violence for if we fight you as the fewer and the weaker through your former action will needs have the worse  sir john foster listened with his head declining on his breastplate  it is a cursed chance he said and i shall have little thanks for my days work  he then rode up to murray and said that in deference to his lordships presence and that of my lord of morton he had come to the resolution of withdrawing himself with his power without farther proceedings  stop there sir john foster said murray i cannot permit you to retire in safety unless you leave some one who may be surety to scotland that the injuries you have at present done us may be fully accounted foryou will reflect that by permitting your retreat i become accountable to my sovereign who will demand a reckoning of me for the blood of her subjects if i suffer those who shed it to depart so easily  it shall never be told in england said the warden that john foster gave pledges like a subdued man and that on the very field on which he stands victoriousbut he added after a moments pause if stawarth bolton wills to abide with you on his own free choice i will say nothing against it and as i bethink me it were better he should stay to see the dismissal of this same piercie shafton  i receive him as your hostage nevertheless and shall treat him as such said the earl of murray but foster turning away as if to give directions to bolton and his men affected not to hear this observation  there rides a faithful servant of his most beautiful and sovereign lady said murray aside to morton happy man he knows not whether the execution of her commands may not cost him his head and yet he is most certain that to leave them unexecuted will bring disgrace and death without reprieve happy are they who are not only subjected to the caprices of dame fortune but held bound to account and be responsible for them and that to a sovereign as moody and fickle as her humorous ladyship herself  we also have a female sovereign my lord said morton  we have so douglas said the earlwith a suppressed sigh but it remains to be seen how long a female hand can hold the reins of power in a realm so wild as ours we will now go on to saint marys and see ourselves after the state of that houseglendinning look to that woman and protect herwhat the fiend man hast thou got in thine armsan infant as i livewhere couldst thou find such a charge at such a place and moment  halbert glendinning briefly told the story the earl rode forward to the place where the body of julian avenel lay with his unhappy companions arms wrapped around him like the trunk of an uprooted oak borne down by the tempest with all its ivy garlands both were cold dead murray was touched in an unwonted degree remembering perhaps his own birth what have they to answer for douglas he said who thus abuse the sweetest gifts of affection  the earl of morton unhappy in his marriage was a libertine in his amours  you must ask that question of henry warden my lord or of john knoxi am but a wild counsellor in womens matters  forward to saint marys said the earl pass the word onglendinning give the infant to this same female cavalier and let it be taken charge of let no dishonour be done to the dead bodies and call on the country to bury or remove themforward i say my masters     chapter the thirtyseventh     gone to be marriedgone to swear a peace  king john  the news of the lost battle so quickly carried by the fugitives to the village and convent had spread the greatest alarm among the inhabitants  the sacristan and other monks counselled flight the treasurer recommended that the church plate should be offered as a tribute to bribe the english officer the abbot alone was unmoved and undaunted  my brethren he said since god has not given our people victory in the combat it must be because he requires of us his spiritual soldiers to fight the good fight of martyrdom a conflict in which nothing but our own fainthearted cowardice can make us fail of victory let us assume then the armour of faith and prepare if it be necessary to die under the ruin of these shrines to the service of which we have devoted ourselves highly honoured are we all in this distinguished summons from our dear brother nicholas whose gray hairs have been preserved until they should be surrounded by the crown of martyrdom down to my beloved son edward who arriving at the vineyard at the latest hour of the day is yet permitted to share its toils with those who have laboured from the morning be of good courage my children i dare not like my sainted predecessors promise to you that you shall be preserved by miraclei and you are alike unworthy of that especial interposition which in earlier times turned the sword of sacrilege against the bosom of tyrants by whom it was wielded daunted the hardened hearts of heretics with prodigies and called down hosts of angels to defend the shrine of god and of the virgin yet by heavenly aid you shall this day see that your father and abbot will not disgrace the mitre which sits upon his brow go to your cells my children and exercise your private devotions array yourselves also in alb and cope as for our most solemn festivals and be ready when the tolling of the largest bell announces the approach of the enemy to march forth to meet them in solemn procession let the church be opened to afford such refuge as may be to those of our vassals who from their exertion in this days unhappy battle or the cause are particularly apprehensive of the rage of the enemy  tell sir piercie shafton if he has escaped the fight  i am here most venerable abbot replied sir piercie and if it so seemeth meet to you i will presently assemble such of the men as have escaped this escaramouche and will renew the resistance even unto the death certes you will learn from all that i did my part in this unhappy matter had it pleased julian avenel to have attended to my counsel specially in somewhat withdrawing of his main battle even as you may have marked the heron eschew the stoop of the falcon receiving him rather upon his beak than upon his wing affairs as i do conceive might have had a different face and we might then in a more bellacose manner have maintained that affray nevertheless i would not be understood to speak any thing in disregard of julian avenel whom i saw fall fighting manfully with his face to his enemy which hath banished from my memory the unseemly term of meddling coxcomb with which it pleased him something rashly to qualify my advice and for which had it pleased heaven and the saints to have prolonged the life of that excellent person i had it bound upon my soul to have put him to death with my own hand  sir piercie said the abbot at length interrupting him our time allows brief leisure to speak what might have been  you are right most venerable lord and father replied the incorrigible euphuist the preterite as grammarians have it concerns frail mortality less than the future mood and indeed our cogitations respect chiefly the present in a word i am willing to head all who will follow me and offer such opposition as manhood and mortality may permit to the advance of the english though they be my own countrymen and be assured piercie shafton will measure his length being five feet ten inches on the ground as he stands rather than give two yards in retreat according to the usual motion in which we retrograde  i thank you sir knight said the abbot and i doubt not that you would make your words good but it is not the will of heaven that carnal weapons should rescue us we are called to endure not to resist and may not waste the blood of our innocent commons in vainfruitless opposition becomes not men of our profession they have my commands to resign the sword and the speargod and our lady have not blessed our banner  bethink you reverend lord said piercie shafton very eagerly ere you resign the defence that is in your powerthere are many posts near the entry of this village where brave men might live or die to the advantage and i have this additional motive to make defencethe safety namely of a fair friend who i hope hath escaped the hands of the heretics  i understand you sir piercie said the abbotyou mean the daughter of our convents miller  reverend my lord said sir piercie not without hesitation the fair mysinda is as may be in some sort alleged the daughter of one who mechanically prepareth corn to be manipulated into bread without which we could not exist and which is therefore an employment in itself honourable nay necessary nevertheless if the purest sentiments of a generous mind streaming forth like the rays of the sun reflected by a diamond may ennoble one who is in some sort the daughter of a molendinary mechanic  i have no time for all this sir knight said the abbot be it enough to answer that with our will we war no longer with carnal weapons we of the spirituality will teach you of the temporality how to die in cold blood our hands not clenched for resistance but folded for prayerour minds not filled with jealous hatred but with christian meekness and forgivenessour ears not deafened nor our senses confused by the sound of clamorous instruments of war but on the contrary our voices composed to halleluiah kyrieeleison and salve regina and our blood temperate and cold as those who think upon reconciling themselves with god not of avenging themselves of their fellowmortals  lord abbot said sir piercie this is nothing to the fate of my molinara whom i beseech you to observe i will not abandon while golden hilt and steel blade bide together on my falchion i commanded her not to follow us to the field and yet methought i saw her in her pages attire amongst the rear of the combatants  you must seek elsewhere for the person in whose fate you are so deeply interested said the abbot and at present i will pray of your knighthood to inquire concerning her at the church in which all our more defenceless vassals have taken refuge it is my advice to you that you also abide by the horns of the altar and sir piercie shafton he added be of one thing secure that if you come to harm it will involve the whole of this brotherhood for never i trust will the meanest of us buy safety at the expense of surrendering a friend or a guest leave us my son and may god be your aid  when sir piercie shafton had departed and the abbot was about to betake himself to his own cell he was surprised by an unknown person anxiously requiring a conference who being admitted proved to be no other than henry warden the abbot started as he entered and exclaimed angrilyha are the few hours that fate allows him who may last wear the mitre of this house not to be excused from the intrusion of heresy  dost thou come he said to enjoy the hopes which fete holds out to thy demented and accursed sect to see the bosom of destruction sweep away the pride of old religionto deface our shrinesto mutilate and lay waste the bodies of our benefactors as well as their sepulchresto destroy the pinnacles and carved work of gods house and our ladys  peace william allan said the protestant preacher with dignified composure for none of these purposes do i come i would have these stately shrines deprived of the idols which no longer simply regarded as the effigies of the good and of the wise have become the objects of foul idolatry  i would otherwise have its ornaments subsist unless as they are or may be a snare to the souls of men and especially do i condemn those ravages which have been made by the heady fury of the people stung into zeal against willworship by bloody persecution against such wanton devastations i lift my testimony  idle distinguisher that thou art said the abbot eustace interrupting him what signifies the pretext under which thou dost despoil the house of god and why at this present emergence will thou insult the master of it by thy illomened presence  thou art unjust william allan said warden but i am not the less settled in my resolution thou hast protected me some time since at the hazard of thy rank and what i know thou holdest still dearer at the risk of thy reputation with thine own sect our party is now uppermost and believe me i have come down the valley in which thou didst quarter me for sequestrations sake simply with the wish to keep my engagements to thee  ay answered the abbot and it may be that my listening to that worldly and infirm compassion which pleaded with me for thy life is now avenged by this impending judgment heaven hath smitten it may be the erring shepherd and scattered the flock  think better of the divine judgments said warden not for thy sins which are those of thy blended education and circumstances not for thine own sins william allan art thou stricken but for the accumulated guilt which thy misnamed church hath accumulated on her head and those of her votaries by the errors and corruption of ages  now by my sure belief in the rock of peter said the abbot thou dost rekindle the last spark of human indignation for which my bosom has fueli thought i might not again have felt the impulse of earthly passion and it is thy voice which once more calls me to the expression of human anger yes it is thy voice that comest to insult me in my hour of sorrow with these blasphemous accusations of that church which hath kept the light of christianity alive from the times of the apostles till now  from the times of the apostles said the preacher eagerly negatur gulielme allanthe primitive church differed as much from that of rome as did light from darkness which did time permit i should speedily prove and worse dost thou judge in saying i come to insult thee in thy hour of affliction being here god wot with the christian wish of fulfilling an engagement i had made to my host and of rendering myself to thy will while it had yet power to exercise aught upon me and if it might so be to mitigate in thy behalf the rage of the victors whom god hath sent as a scourge to thy obstinacy  i will none of thy intercession said the abbot sternly the dignity to which the church has exalted me never should have swelled my bosom more proudly in the time of the highest prosperity than it doth at this crisisi ask nothing of thee but the assurance that my lenity to thee hath been the means of perverting no soul to satan that i have not given to the wolf any of the stray lambs whom the great shepherd of souls had intrusted to my charge  william allan answered the protestant i will be sincere with thee  what i promised i have kepti have withheld my voice from speaking even good things but it has pleased heaven to call the maiden mary avenel to a better sense of faith than thou and all the disciples of rome can teach her i have aided with my humble poweri have extricated her from the machinations of evil spirits to which she and her house were exposed during the blindness of their romish superstition and praise be to my master i have not reason to fear she will again be caught in thy snares  wretched man said the abbot unable to suppress his rising indignation is it to the abbot of st marys that you boast having misled the soul of a dweller in our ladys halidome into the paths of foul error and damning heresythou dost urge me wellwood beyond what it becomes me to bear and movest me to employ the few moments of power i may yet possess in removing from the face of the earth one whose qualities given by god have been so utterly perverted as thine to the service of satan  do thy pleasure said the preacher thy vain wrath shall not prevent my doing my duty to advantage thee where it may be done without neglecting my higher call i go to the earl of murray  their conference which was advancing fast into bitter disputation was here interrupted by the deep and sullen toll of the largest and heaviest bell of the convent a sound famous in the chronicles of the community for dispelling of tempests and putting to flight demons but which now only announced danger without affording any means of warding against it  hastily repeating his orders that all the brethren should attend in the choir arrayed for solemn procession the abbot ascended to the battlements of the lofty monastery by his own private staircase and there met the sacristan who had been in the act of directing the tolling of the huge bell which fell under his charge  it is the last time i shall discharge mine office most venerable father and lord said he to the abbot for yonder come the philistines but i would not that the large bell of saint marys should sound for the last time otherwise than in true and full tonei have been a sinful man for one of our holy profession added he looking upward yet may i presume to say not a bell hath sounded out of tune from the tower of the house while father philip had the superintendence of the chime and the belfry  the abbot without reply cast his eyes towards the path which winding around the mountain descends upon kennaquhair from the southeast he beheld at a distance a cloud of dust and heard the neighing of many horses while the occasional sparkle of the long line of spears as they came downwards into the valley announced that the band came thither in arms  shame on my weakness said abbot eustace dashing the tears from his eyes my sight is too much dimmed to observe their motionslook my son edward for his favourite novice had again joined him and tell me what ensigns they bear  they are scottish men when all is done exclaimed edwardi see the white crossesit may be the western borderers or fernieherst and his clan  look at the banner said the abbot tell me what are the blazonries  the arms of scotland said edward the lion and its tressure quartered as i think with three cushionscan it be the royal standard  alas no said the abbot it is that of the earl of murray he hath assumed with his new conquest the badge of the valiant randolph and hath dropt from his hereditary coat the bend which indicates his own base birthwould to god he may not have blotted it also from his memory and aim as well at possessing the name as the power of a king  at least my father said edward he will secure us from the violence of the southron  ay my son as the shepherd secures a silly lamb from the wolf which he destines in due time to his own banquet oh my son evil days are on us a breach has been made in the walls of our sanctuarythy brother hath fallen from the faith such news brought my last secret intelligencemurray hath already spoken of rewarding his services with the hand of mary avenel  of mary avenel said the novice tottering towards and grasping hold of one of the carved pinnacles which adorned the proud battlement  ay of mary avenel my son who has also abjured the faith of her fathers weep not my edward weep not my beloved son or weep for their apostasy and not for their unionbless god who hath called thee to himself out of the tents of wickedness but for the grace of our lady and saint benedict thou also hadst been a castaway  i endeavour my father said edward i endeavour to forget but what i would now blot from my memory has been the thought of all my former lifemurray dare not forward a match so unequal in birth  he dares do what suits his purposethe castle of avenel is strong and needs a good castellan devoted to his service as for the difference of their birth he will mind it no more than he would mind defacing the natural regularity of the ground were it necessary he should erect upon it military lines and intrenchments but do not droop for thatawaken thy soul within thee my son think you part with a vain vision an idle dream nursed in solitude and inactioni weep not yet what am i now like to loselook at these towers where saints dwelt and where heroes have been buriedthink that i so briefly called to preside over the pious flock which has dwelt here since the first light of christianity may be this day written down the last father of this holy communitycome let us descend and meet our fate i see them approach near to the village  the abbot descended the novice cast a glance around him yet the sense of the danger impending over the stately structure with which he was now united was unable to banish the recollection of mary ayenelhis brothers bride he pulled the cowl over his face and followed his superior  the whole bells of the abbey now added their peal to the deathtoll of the largest which had so long sounded the monks wept and prayed as they got themselves into the order of their procession for the last time as seemed but too probable  it is well our father boniface hath retired to the inland said father philip he could never have put over this dayit would have broken his heart  god be with the soul of abbot ingelram said old father nicholas there were no such doings in his daysthey say we are to be put forth of the cloisters and how i am to live any where else than where i have lived for these seventy years i wot notthe best is that i have not long to live any where  a few moments after this the great gate of the abbey was flung open and the procession moved slowly forward from beneath its huge and richlyadorned gateway cross and banner pix and chalice shrines containing relics and censers steaming with incense preceded and were intermingled with the long and solemn array of the brotherhood in their long black gowns and cowls with their white scapularies hanging over them the various officers of the convent each displaying his proper badge of office in the centre of the procession came the abbot surrounded and supported by his chief assistants he was dressed in his habit of high solemnity and appeared as much unconcerned as if he had been taking his usual part in some ordinary ceremony after him came the inferior persons of the convent the novices in their albs or white dresses and the lay brethren distinguished by their beards which were seldom worn by the fathers women and children mixed with a few men came in the rear bewailing the apprehended desolation of their ancient sanctuary they moved however in order and restrained the marks of their sorrow to a low wailing sound which rather mingled with than interrupted the measured chant of the monks  in this order the procession entered the marketplace of the village of kennaquhair which was then as now distinguished by an ancient cross of curious workmanship the gift of some former monarch of scotland close by the cross of much greater antiquity and scarcely less honoured was an immensely large oaktree which perhaps had witnessed the worship of the druids ere the stately monastery to which it adjoined had raised its spires in honour of the christian faith like the bentangtree of the african villages or the plaistowoak mentioned in whites natural history of selborne this tree was the rendezvous of the villagers and regarded with peculiar veneration a feeling common to most nations and which perhaps may be traced up to the remote period when the patriarch feasted the angels under the oak at mamre footnote it is scarcely necessary to say that in melrose the prototype of kennaquhair no such oak ever existed  the monks formed themselves each in their due place around the cross while under the ruins of the aged tree crowded the old and the feeble with others who felt the common alarm when they had thus arranged themselves there was a deep and solemn pause the monks stilled their chant the lay populace hushed their lamentations and all awaited in terror and silence the arrival of those heretical forces whom they had been so long taught to regard with fear and trembling  a distant trampling was at length heard and the glance of spears was seen to shine through the trees above the village the sounds increased and became more thick one close continuous rushing sound in which the tread of hoofs was mingled with the ringing of armour the horsemen soon appeared at the principal entrance which leads into the irregular square or marketplace which forms the centre of the village they entered two by two slowly and in the greatest order the van continued to move on riding round the open spaoe until they had attained the utmost point and then turning their horses heads to the street stood fast their companions followed in the same order until the whole marketplace was closely surrounded with soldiers and the files who followed making the same manoeuvre formed an inner line within those who had first arrived until the place was begirt with a quadruple file of horsemen closely drawn up there was now a pause of which the abbot availed himself by commanding the brotherhood to raise the solemn chant de profundis clamavi he looked around the armed ranks to see what impression the solemn sounds made on them all were silent but the brows of some had an expression of contempt and almost all the rest bore a look of indifference their course had been too long decided to permit past feelings of enthusiasm to be anew awakened by a procession or by a hymn   their hearts are hardened said the abbot to himself in dejection but not in despair it remains to see whether those of their leaders are equally obdurate  the leaders in the meanwhile were advancing slowly and murray with morton rode in deep conversation before a chosen band of their most distinguished followers amongst whom came halbert glendinning but the preacher henry warden who upon leaving the monastery had instantly joined them was the only person admitted to their conference  you are determined then said morton to murray to give the heiress of avenel with all her pretensions to this nameless and obscure young man  hath not warden told you said murray that they have been bred together and are lovers from their youth upward  and that they are both said warden by means which may be almost termed miraculous rescued from the delusions of rome and brought within the pale of the true church my residence at glendearg hath made me well acquainted with these things ill would it beseem my habit and my calling to thrust myself into matchmaking and giving in marriage but worse were it in me to see your lordships do needless wrong to the feelings which are proper to our nature and which being indulged honestly and under the restraints of religion become a pledge of domestic quiet here and future happiness in a better world i say that you will do ill to rend those ties asunder and to give this maiden to the kinsman of lord morton though lord mortons kinsman he be  these are fair reasons my lord of murray said morton why you should refuse me so simple a boon as to bestow this silly damsel upon young bennygask speak out plainly my lord say you would rather see the castle of avenel in the hands of one who owes his name and existence solely to your favour than in the power of a douglas and of my kinsman  my lord of morton said murray i have done nothing in this matter which should aggrieve you this young man glendinning has done me good service and may do me more my promise was in some degree passed to him and that while julian avenel was alive when aught beside the maidens lily hand would have been hard to come by whereas you never thought of such an alliance for your kinsman till you saw julian lie dead yonder on the field and knew his land to be a waif free to the first who could seize it come come my lord you do less than justice to your gallant kinsman in wishing him a bride bred up under the milkpail for this girl is a peasant wench in all but the accident of birth i thought you had more deep respect for the honour of the douglasses  the honour of the douglasses is safe in my keeping answered morton haughtily that of other ancient families may suffer as well as the name of avenel if rustics are to be matched with the blood of our ancient barons  this is but idle talking answered lord murray in times like these we must look to men and not to pedigrees hay was but a rustic before the battle of loncartythe bloody yoke actually dragged the plough ere it was emblazoned on a crest by the herald times of action make princes into peasants and boors into barons all families have sprung from one mean man and it is well if they have never degenerated from his virtue who raised them first from obscurity  my lord of murray will please to except the house of douglas said morton haughtily men have seen it in the tree but never in the saplinghave seen it in the stream but never in the fountain  footnote the late excellent and laborious antiquary mr george chalmers has rebuked the vaunt of the house of douglas or rather of hume of godscroft their historian but with less than his wonted accuracy in the first volume of his caledonia he quotes the passage in godscroft for the purpose of confuting it  the historian of the douglasses cries out we do not know them in the fountain but in the stream not in the root but in the stem for we know not which is the mean man that did rise above the vulgar this assumption mr chalmers conceives illtimed and alleges that if the historian had attended more to research than to declamation he might easily have seen the first mean man of this renowned family this he alleges to have been one theobaldus flammaticus or theobald the fleming to whom arnold abbot of kelso between the year 1147 and 1160 granted certain lands on douglas water by a deed which mr chalmers conceives to be the first link of the chain of titledeeds to douglasdale hence he says the family must renounce their family domain or acknowledge this obscure fleming as their ancestor theobald the fleming it is acknowledged did not himself assume the name of douglas but says the antiquary his son william who inherited his estate called himself and was named by others de duglas and he refers to the deeds in which he is so designed mr chalmers full argument may be found in the first volume of his caledonia p 579  this proposition is one which a scotsman will admit unwillingly and only upon undeniable testimony and as it is liable to strong grounds of challenge the present author with all the respect to mr chalmers which his zealous and effectual researches merit is not unwilling to take this opportunity to state some plausible grounds for doubting that theobaldus flammaticus was either the father of the first william de douglas or in the slightest degree connected with the douglas family  it must first be observed that there is no reason whatever for concluding theobaldus flammaticus to be the father of william de douglas except that they both held lands upon the small river of douglas and that there are two strong presumptions to the contrary for first the father being named fleming there seems no good reason why the son should have assumed a different designation secondly there does not occur a single instance of the name of theobald during the long line of the douglas pedigree an omission very unlikely to take place had the original father of the race been so called these are secondary considerations indeed but they are important in so far as they exclude any support of mr chalmers system except from the point which he has rather assumed than proved namely that the lands granted to theobald the fleming were the same which were granted to william de douglas and which constituted the original domain of which we find this powerful family lords  now it happens singularly enough that the lands granted by the abbot of kelso to theobaldus flammaticus are not the same of which william de douglas was in possession nay it would appear from comparing the charter granted to theobaldus flammaticus that though situated on the water of douglas they never made a part of the barony of that name and therefore cannot be the same with those held by william de douglas in the succeeding generation but if william de douglas did not succeed theobaldus flammaticus there is no more reason for holding these two persons to be father and son than if they had lived in different provinces and we are still as far from having discovered the first mean man of the douglas family as hume of godscroft was in the 16th century we leave the question to antiquaries and genealogists  in the earliest of our scottish annals the black douglas was powerful and distinguished as now  i bend to the honours of the house of douglas said murray somewhat ironically i am conscious we of the royal house have little right to compete with them in dignitywhat though we have worn crowns and carried sceptres for a few generations if our genealogy moves no farther back than to the humble alanus dapifer  footnote to atone to the memory of the learned and indefatigable chalmers for having ventured to impeach his genealogical proposition concerning the descent of the douglasses we are bound to render him our grateful thanks for the felicitous light which he has thrown on that of the house of stewart still more important to scottish history  the acute pen of lord hailes which like the spear of ithuriel conjured so many shadows from scottish history had dismissed among the rest those of banquo and fleance the rejection of which fables left the illustrious family of stewart without an ancestor beyond walter the son of allan who is alluded to in the text the researches of our late learned antiquary detected in this walter the descendant of allan the son of flaald who obtained from william the conqueror the castle of oswestry in shropshire and was the father of an illustrious line of english nobles by his first son william and by his second son walter the progenitor of the royal family of stewart  mortons cheek reddened as he was about to reply but henry warden availed himself of the liberty which the protestant clergy long possessed and exerted it to interrupt a discussion which was becoming too eager and personal to be friendly  my lords he said i must be bold in discharging the duty of my master it is a shame and scandal to hear two nobles whose hands have been so forward in the work of reformation fall into discord about such vain follies as now occupy your thoughts bethink you how long you have thought with one mind seen with one eye heard with one ear confirmed by your union the congregation of the church appalled by your joint authority the congregation of antichrist and will you now fall into discord about an old decayed castle and a few barren hills about the loves and likings of an humble spearman and a damsel bred in the same obscurity or about the still vainer questions of idle genealogy  the good man hath spoken right noble douglas said murray reaching him his hand our union is too essential to the good cause to be broken off upon such idle terms of dissension i am fixed to gratify glendinning in this mattermy promise is passed the wars in which i have had my share have made many a family miserable i will at least try if i may not make one happy there are maids and manors enow in scotlandi promise you my noble ally that young bennygask shall be richly wived  my lord said warden you speak nobly and like a christian alas this is a land of hatred and bloodshedlet us not chase from thence the few traces that remain of gentle and domestic loveand be not too eager for wealth to thy noble kinsman my lord of morton seeing contentment in the marriage state no way depends on it  if you allude to my family misfortune said morton whose countess wedded by him for her estate and honours was insane in her mind the habit you wear and the liberty or rather license of your profession protect you from my resentment  alas my lord replied warden how quick and sensitive is our selflove when pressing forward in our high calling we point out the errors of the sovereign who praises our boldness more than the noble morton  but touch we upon his own sore which most needs lancing and he shrinks from the faithful chirurgeon in fear and impatient anger  enough of this good and reverend sir said murray you transgress the prudence yourself recommended even nowwe are now close upon the village and the proud abbot is come forth at the head of his hive thou hast pleaded well for him warden otherwise i had taken this occasion to pull down the nest and chase away the rooks  nay but do not so said warden this william allan whom they call the abbot eustatius is a man whose misfortunes would more prejudice our cause than his prosperity you cannot inflict more than he will endure and the more that he is made to bear the higher will be the influence of his talents and his courage in his conventual throne he will be but coldly looked ondisliked it may be and envied but turn his crucifix of gold into a crucifix of woodlet him travel through the land an oppressed and impoverished man and his patience his eloquence and learning will win more hearts from the good cause than all the mitred abbots of scotland have been able to make prey of during the last hundred years  tush tush man said morton the revenues of the halidome will bring more men spears and horses into the field in one day than his preaching in a whole lifetime these are not the days of peter the hermit when monks could march armies from england to jerusalem but gold and good deeds will still do as much or more than ever had julian avenel had but a score or two more men this morning sir john foster had not missed a worse welcome i say confiscating the monks revenues is drawing his fangteeth  we will surely lay him under contribution said murray and moreover if he desires to remain in his abbey he will do well to produce piercie shafton  as he thus spoke they entered the marketplace distinguished by their complete armour and their lofty plumes as well as by the number of followers bearing their colours and badges both these powerful nobles but more especially murray so nearly allied to the crown had at that time a retinue and household not much inferior to that of scottish royalty as they advanced into the marketplace a pursuivant pressing forward from their train addressed the monks in these wordsthe abbot of saint marys is commanded to appear before the earl of murray  the abbot of saint marys said eustace is in the patrimony of his convent superior to every temporal lord let the earl of murray if he seeks him come himself to his presence  on receiving this answer murray smiled scornfully and dismounting from his lofty saddle he advanced accompanied by morton and followed by others to the body of monks assembled around the cross there was an appearance of shrinking among them at the approach of the heretic lord so dreaded and so powerful but the abbot casting on them a glance of rebuke and encouragement stepped forth from their ranks like a courageous leader when he sees that his personal valour must be displayed to revive the drooping courage of his followers lord james stewart he said or earl of murray if that be thy title i eustatius abbot of saint marys demand by what right you have filled our peaceful village and surrounded our brethren with these bands of armed men if hospitality is sought we have never refused it to courteous askingif violence be meant against peaceful churchmen let us know at once the pretext and the object  sir abbot said murray your language would better have become another age and a presence inferior to ours we come not here to reply to your interrogations but to demand of you why you have broken the peace collecting your vassals in arms and convocating the queens lieges whereby many men have been slain and much trouble perchance breach of amity with england is likely to arise  lupus in fabula answered the abbot scornfully the wolf accused the sheep of muddying the stream when he drank in it above herbut it served as a pretext for devouring her convocate the queens lieges i did so to defend the queens land against foreigners i did but my duty and i regret i had not the means to do it more effectually  and was it also a part of your duty to receive and harbour the queen of englands rebel and traitor and to inflame a war betwixt england and scotland said murray  in my younger days my lord answered the abbot with the same intrepidity a war with england was no such dreaded matter and not merely a mitred abbot bound by his rule to show hospitality and afford sanctuary to all but the poorest scottish peasant would have been ashamed to have pleaded fear of england as the reason for shutting his door against a persecuted exile but in those olden days the english seldom saw the face of a scottish nobleman save through the bars of his visor  monk said the earl of morton sternly this insolence will little avail thee the days are gone by when romes priests were permitted to brave noblemen with impunity give us up this piercie shafton or by my fathers crest i will set thy abbey in a bright flame  and if thou dost lord of morton its ruins will tumble above the tombs of thine own ancestors be the issue as god wills the abbot of saint marys gives up no one whom he hath promised to protect  abbot said murray bethink thee ere we are driven to deal roughly the hands of these men he said pointing to the soldiers will make wild work among shrines and cells if we are compelled to undertake a search for this englishman  ye shall not need said a voice from the crowd and advancing gracefully before the earls the euphuist flung from him the mantle in which he was muffled via the cloud that shadowed shafton said he behold my lords the knight of wilverton who spares you the guilt of violence and sacrilege  i protest before god and man against any infraction of the privileges of this house said the abbot by an attempt to impose violent hands upon the person of this noble knight if there be yet spirit in a scottish parliament we will make you hear of this elsewhere my lords  spare your threats said murray it may be my purpose with sir piercie shafton is not such as thou dost supposeattach him pursuivant as our prisoner rescue or no rescue  i yield myself said the euphuist reserving my right to defy my lord of murray and my lord of morton to single duel even as one gentleman may demand satisfaction of another  you shall not want those who will answer your challenge sir knight replied morton without aspiring to men above thine own degree  and where am i to find these superlative champions said the english knight whose blood runs more pure than that of piercie shafton  here is a flight for you my lord said murray  as ever was flown by a wildgoose said stawarth bolton who had now approached to the front of the party  who dared to say that word said the euphuist his face crimson with rage  tut man said bolton make the best of it thy mothers father was but a tailor old overstitch of holdernesswhy what because thou art a misproud bird and despiseth thine own natural lineage and rufflest in unpaid silks and velvets and keepest company with gallants and cutters must we lose our memory for that thy mother moll overstitch was the prettiest wench in those partsshe was wedded by wild shafton of wilverton who men say was akin to the piercie on the wrong side of the blanket  help the knight to some strong waters said morton he hath fallen from such a height that he is stunned with the tumble  in fact sir piercie shafton looked like a man stricken by a thunderbolt while notwithstanding the seriousness of the scene hitherto no one of those present not even the abbot himself could refrain from laughing at the rueful and mortified expression of his face  laugh on he said at length laugh on my masters shrugging his shoulders it is not for me to be offendedyet would i know full fain from that squire who is laughing with the loudest how he had discovered this unhappy blot in an otherwise spotless lineage and for what purpose he hath made it known  i make it known said halbert glendinning in astonishmentfor to him this pathetic appeal was madei never heard the thing till this moment  footnote the contrivance of provoking the irritable vanity of sir piercie shafton by presenting him with a bodkin indicative of his descent from a tailor is borrowed from a german romance by the celebrated tieck called das peter manchem i e the dwarf peter the being who gives name to the tale is the burggeist or castle spectre of a german family whom he aids with his counsel as he defends their castle by his supernatural power but the dwarf peter is so unfortunate an adviser that all his counsels though producing success in the immediate results are in the issue attended with mishap and with guilt the youthful baron the owner of the haunted castle falls in love with a maiden the daughter of a neighbouring count a man of great pride who refuses him the hand of the young lady on account of his own superiority of descent the lover repulsed and affronted returns to take counsel with the dwarf peter how he may silence the count and obtain the victory in the argument the next time they enter on the topic of pedigree  the dwarf gives his patron or pupil a horseshoe instructing him to give it to the count when he is next giving himself superior airs on the subject of his family it has the effect accordingly the count understanding it as an allusion to a misalliance of one of his ancestors with the daughter of a blacksmith is thrown into a dreadful passion with the young lover the consequences of which are the seduction of the young lady and the slaughter of her father  if we suppose the dwarf to represent the corrupt part of human naturethat law in our members which wars against the law of our mindsthe work forms an ingenious allegory  why did not that old rude soldier learn it from thee said the knight in increasing amazement  not i by heaven said bolton i never saw the youth in my life before  but you have seen him ere now my worthy master said dame glendinning bursting in her turn from the crowd my son this is stawarth bolton he to whom we owe life and the means of preserving itif he be a prisoner as seems most likely use thine interest with these noble lords to be kind to the widows friend  what my dame of the glen said bolton thy brow is more withered as well as mine since we met last but thy tongue holds the touch better than my arm this boy of thine gave me the foil sorely this morning  the brown varlet has turned as stout a trooper as i prophesied and where is white head  alas said the mother looking down edward has taken orders and become a monk of this abbey  a monk and a soldierevil trades both my good dame better have made one a good master fashioner like old overstitch of holderness i sighed when i envied you the two bonny children but i sigh not now to call either the monk or the soldier mine own the soldier dies in the field the monk scarce lives in the cloister  my dearest mother said halbert where is edwardcan i not speak with him  he has just left us for the present said father philip upon a message from the lord abbot  and mary my dearest mother said halbertmary avenel was not far distant and the three were soon withdrawn from the crowd to hear and relate their various chances of fortune  while the subordinate personages thus disposed of themselves the abbot held serious discussion with the two earls and partly yielding to their demands partly defending himself with skill and eloquence was enabled to make a composition for his convent which left it provisionally in no worse situation than before the earls were the more reluctant to drive matters to extremity since he protested that if urged beyond what his conscience would comply with he would throw the whole lands of the monastery into the queen of scotlands hands to be disposed of at her pleasure this would not have answered the views of the earls who were contented for the time with a moderate sacrifice of money and lands  matters being so far settled the abbot became anxious for the fate of sir piercie shafton and implored mercy in his behalf  he is a coxcomb he said my lords but he is a generous though a vain fool and it is my firm belief you have this day done him more pain than if you had run a poniard into him  run a needle into him you mean abbot said the earl of morton by mine honour i thought this grandson of a fashioner of doublets was descended from a crowned head at least  i hold with the abbot said murray there were little honour in surrendering him to elizabeth but he shall be sent where he can do her no injury our pursuivant and bolton shall escort him to dunbar and ship him off for flandersbut soft here he comes and leading a female as i think  lords and others said the english knight with great solemnity make way for the lady of piercie shaftona secret which i listed not to make known till fate which hath betrayed what i vainly strove to conceal makes me less desirous to hide that which i now announce to you  it is mysie happer the millers daughter on my life said tibb tacket i thought the pride of these piercies would have a fa  it is indeed the lovely mysinda said the knight whose merits towards her devoted servant deserved higher rank than he had to bestow  i suspect though said murray that we should not have heard of the millers daughter being made a lady had not the knight proved to be the grandson of a tailor  my lord said piercie shafton it is poor valour to strike him that cannot smite again and i hope you will consider what is due to a prisoner by the law of arms and say nothing more on this odious subject when i am once more mine own man i will find a new road to dignity  shape one i presume said the earl of morton  nay douglas you will drive him madsaid murray besides we have other matter in handi must see warden wed glendinning with mary avenel and put him in possession of his wifes castle without delay it will be best done ere our forces leave these parts  and i said the miller have the like grist to grind for i hope some one of the good fathers will wed my wench with her gay bridegroom  it needs not said shafton the ceremonial hath been solemnly performed  it will not be the worse of another bolting said the miller it is always best to be sure as i say when i chance to take multure twice from the same mealsack  stave the miller off him said murray or he will worry him dead the abbot my lord offers us the hospitality of the convent i move we should repair hither sir piercie and all of us i must learn to know the maid of aveneltomorrow i must act as her fatherall scotland shall see how murray can reward a faithful servant  mary avenel and her lover avoided meeting the abbot and took up their temporary abode in a house of the village where next day their hands were united by the protestant preacher in presence of the two earls on the same day piercie shafton and his bride departed under an escort which was to conduct him to the seaside and see him embark for the low countries  early on the following morning the bands of the earls were under march to the castle of avenel to invest the young bridegroom with the property of his wife which was surrendered to them without opposition  but not without those omens which seemed to mark every remarkable event which befell the fated family did mary take possession of the ancient castle of her forefathers the same warlike form which had appeared more than once at glendearg was seen by tibb tacket and martin who returned with their young mistress to partake her altered fortunes it glided before the cavalcade as they advanced upon the long causeway paused at each drawbridge and flourished its hand as in triumph as it disappeared under the gloomy archway which was surmounted by the insignia of the house of avenel the two trusty servants made their vision only known to dame glendinning who with much pride of heart had accompanied her son to see him take his rank among the barons of the land oh my dear bairn she exclaimed when she heard the tale the castle is a grand place to be sure but i wish ye dinna a desire to be back in the quiet braes of glendearg before the play be played out but this natural reflection springing from maternal anxiety was soon forgotten amid the busy and pleasing task of examining and admiring the new habitation of her son  while these affairs were passing edward had hidden himself and his sorrows in the paternal tower of glendearg where every object was full of matter for bitter reflection the abbots kindness had despatched him thither upon pretence of placing some papers belonging to the abbey in safety and secrecy but in reality to prevent his witnessing the triumph of his brother through the deserted apartments the scene of so many bitter reflections the unhappy youth stalked like a discontented ghost conjuring up around him at every step new subjects for sorrow and for selftorment  impatient at length of the state of irritation and agonized recollection in which he found himself he rushed out and walked hastily up the glen as if to shake off the load which hung upon his mind the sun was setting when he reached the entrance of corrinanshian and the recollection of what he had seen when he last visited that haunted ravine burst on his mind he was in a humour however rather to seek out danger than to avoid it  i will face this mystic being he said she foretold the fate which has wrapt me in this dressi will know whether she has aught else to tell me of a life which cannot but be miserable  he failed not to see the white spirit seated by her accustomed haunt and singing in her usual low and sweet tone while she sung she seemed to look with sorrow on her golden zone which was now diminished to the fineness of a silken thread    fare thee well thou holly green   thou shall seldom now be seen   with all thy glittering garlands bending   as to greet my slow descending   startling the bewilderd hind   who sees thee wave without a wind    farewell fountain now not long   shalt thou murmur to my song   while thy crystal bubbles glancing   keep the time in mystic dancing   rise and swell are burst and lost   like mortal schemes by fortune crost    the knot of fate at length is tied   the churl is lord the maid is bride   vainly did my magic sleight   send the lover from her sight   wither bush and perish well   falln is lofty avenel  the vision seemed to weep while she sung and the words impressed on edward a melancholy belief that the alliance of mary with his brother might be fatal to them both                                       here terminates the first part of the benedictines manuscript i have in vain endeavoured to ascertain the precise period of the story as the dates cannot be exactly reconciled with those of the most accredited histories  but it is astonishing how careless the writers of utopia are upon these important subjects i observe that the learned mr laurence templeton in his late publication entitled ivanhoe has not only blessed the bed of edward the confessor with an offspring unknown to history with sundry other solecisms of the same kind but has inverted the order of nature and feasted his swine with acorns in the midst of summer all that can be alleged by the warmest admirer of this author amounts to thisthat the circumstances objected to are just as true as the rest of the story which appears to me more especially in the matter of the acorns to be a very imperfect defence and that the author will do well to profit by captain absolutes advice to his servant and never tell him more lies than are indispensably necessary                  end of the monastery
