38216792	the crew of the water wagtail by rm ballantyne    chapter one  a rough beginning  it is well that mankind cannot pry into the secrets of futurity  at all events it is certain that if the crew of the water wagtail had known what was in store for them when they set sail from bristol one fine spring morning at the beginning of the sixteenth century most of them would have remained at homethough it is not improbable that even with full knowledge of coming events some of the romantic among them and a few of the reckless might have decided to go on  undoubtedly paul burns would have scorned to draw back for he was a hero of romance an enthusiast of the deepest dye with an inquiring mind a sanguine disposition and a fervent belief in all things great and good and grand  he was also a sixfooter in his socks a horse in constitution a hercules in frame with a hook nose and a hawk eye and a strong jawand all the rest of it  paul had a good brain too and was well educatedas education went in those days  yes there can be little doubt that even though paul burns had been able to see into the future he would have deliberately chosen to go on that voyage  so would oliver trench for oliver worshipped paul  he loved him as if he had been an elder brother  he admired him afar off as a rare specimen of human perfection  he looked up to him physically as well as mentally for oliver was at that time little more than a boy of medium size but bold as a bulldog and active as a weasel  yes we are safe to say that a revelation of the disasters dangers sufferings etcetera in store would not have deterred oliver trench  he would have gone on that voyage simply because paul burns went  that was reason enough for him  the devotion of ruth to naomi was mild compared with that of oliver to paulif words are a test of feelingsfor ruths beautiful language could not compare with the forcible expressions with which oliver assured his friend that he would stick to him neck or nothing through thick and thin to the latest hour of life  as for the rest of the crewbig swinton little stubbs george blazer squill and the likeit was well as we have said that they could not see into the future  there were forty of them all told including the cook and the cabinboy  we do not include paul burns or oliver trench because the former was naturalist to the expeditiona sort of semiscientific freelance and the latter besides being the masters or skippers son was a freeandeasy lance so to speak whose duties were too numerous to mention and too indefinite to understand  most of the men were what is expressed by the phrase no better than they should be some of them indeed were even worse than that  the wars of the period had rendered it difficult to obtain good seamen at that particular time so that merchant skippers had to content themselves with whatever they could get  the crew of the water wagtail was unusually bad including as it did several burglars and a few pickpockets besides loafers and idlers so that before leaving bristol a friend of the skipper whose imagination was lively styled it a crew of forty thieves  the coast of norway was the destination of the water wagtail  she never reached the coast ofbut we must not anticipate  what her object was in reference to norway we cannot tell  ancient records are silent on the point  the object of paul burns was to gather general information  at that period the world was not rich in general information  to discover to dare to doif need were to diewas the intention of our big hero to be similarly circumstanced in a small way was our little heros ambition  goin to blow remarked skipper trench on the evening of the day on which he sailed as he paced the deck with his hands in his pockets and as his son oliver said his weathereye open  it seemed as though the weather having overheard the prophecy was eager to fulfil it for a squall could be seen bearing down on the ship even while the words were being uttered  close reef tooopsls roared master trench with the energy of a man who means what he says  we are not sure of the precise nautical terms used but the result was a sudden and extensive reduction of canvas and not a moment too soon for the operation had scarcely been completed when the squall struck the ship almost capsized her and sent her careering over the billows like a thing of life  this was the first of a succession of squalls or gales which blew the water wagtail far out upon the atlantic ocean stove in her bulwarks carried away her bowsprit and foretopmast damaged her skylights strained her rudder and cleared her decks of loose hamper  after many days the weather moderated a little and cleared up enabling master trench to repair damages and shape his course for norway  but the easterly gales returned with increased violence undid all the repairs carried away the compass and compelled these ancient mariners to run westward under bare poleslittle better than a wreck for winds and waves to play with  in these adverse circumstances the skipper did what too many men are apt to do in their day of sorrowhe sought comfort in the bottle  love of strong drink was master trenchs weakest point  it was one of the few points on which he and his friend burns disagreed  now my dear man said paul seating himself one evening at the cabin table and laying his hand impressively on his friends arm do let me lock up this bottle  you cant navigate the ship you know when youve got so much of that stuff under your belt  o yes i can said the skipper with an imbecile smile for his friend had a winning way with him that conciliated even while he rebuked dont you fear paul iim all right  the halfoffended idiotic expression of the mans face was intensely ludicrous but paul could not see the ludicrous at that time  he only saw his usually sedate manly generous friend reduced to a state of imbecility  come now master trench he said persuasively taking hold of the casebottle let me put it away  nno i wont said the captain sharply for he was short of temper  the persuasive look on pauls face suddenly vanished  he rose grasped the bottle firmly went to the open hatch and sent it whizzing up into the air with such force that it went far over the stern of the ship and dropped into the sea to the unutterable amazement of the man at the helm who observed the bottles unaccountable flight with an expression of visage all his own  there is no accounting for the rapid transitions of thought and feeling in drunken men  the skipper sprang up clenched his right hand and gazed in fierce astonishment at his friend who advanced towards him with a benignant smile quite regardless of consequences  even in the act of striking the captain restrained his arm and opened his hand paul met it with a friendly grasp while the faces of both men expanded in smiling goodwill  yyoure a trump ppaul said the captain  iiwont drink aanother dop  and master trench kept his word  from that day forth till circumstances rendered drinking impossible he drank nothing stronger than water  soon after this event the weather improved damages were again repaired and the skipperin whom there was much of the spirit of the old vikingsonce more laid his course for norway resolving to steer as the said vikings were wont to do by the stars  but a spirit of mutiny was abroad in the forecastle by that time  if hard work hard fare and hard fortune are trying even to good men and true what must they be to bad men and false  heres how it lays men said big swinton in a subdued voice to a knot of friends around him  blowin hard as it has bin ever since we left england it stands to reason that we must have pretty nigh got across the western sea to that noo land discovered by that man wi the queer namei cant remember rightly  columbus you mean cried george blazer  why my father sailed with columbus on his first voyage  no it wasnt columbus returned swinton in a sharp tone an you neednt speak as if we was all deaf blazer  it was john cabot i was thinkin of who with his son sebastian discovered land a long way to the norard o columbuss track  they called it newfoundland  well as i was sayin we must be a long way nearer to that land than to norway an it will be far easier to reach it  moreover the cabots said that the natives there are friendly and peaceable so its my opinion that we should carry on as we go till we reach newfoundland an see whether we cant lead a jollier life there than we did in old england  but its my opinion suggested little stubbs that the skippers opinion on that point will have to be found out first swinton for its of more importance than yours  you aint skipper yet you know  thats so stubbs said squill with a nod  let your tongues lie still retorted swinton in an undertoned growl of course i know im not skipper yet but if you men have the courage of rabbits ill be skipper before another sun risesor whoever you choose to appoint  a sudden silence ensued for a few moments for although there had been mutinous whisperings before no one had up to that time ventured to make a distinct proposal that action should be taken  what steal the ship exclaimed a huge blackbearded fellow named grummidge  nayill have no hand in that  of course not we have no intention to steal the ship retorted swinton before any one else had time to express an opinion we are all upright honourable men here  we only mean to take the loan of her after all we have suffered we are entitled surely to a pleasuretrip and when thats over we can return the ship to the ownersif so disposed  youll join us in that grummidge wont you  and well make you skipperor first mate if youre too modest to take command  this sally was received with a subdued laugh and with marks of such decided approval that grummidge was carried with the currentat all events he held his tongue after that  an earnest undertoned discussion followed and it was finally arranged that big swinton should sound master trench about the propriety of running to newfoundland instead of returning on their track to norway the seaman was not slow to act  that afternoon while at the helm he made the suggestion to the skipper but met with a sharp rebuke and an order to attend to his duty  no word did big swinton reply but that very night he entered the cabin with a dozen men and seized the skipper his son and paul burns while they slept  of course being greatly outnumbered they were overcome and bound  the two officers of the vessel were also seized by another party on deck and all the five were imprisoned in the hold  next morning they were brought on deck and made to stand in a row before big swinton who had in the meantime been appointed by the mutineers to the command of the ship  now master trench said swinton we are no pirates  we have no desire to kill you so that whether you are killed or not will depend on yourself  if you agree to navigate this ship to newfoundlandgood if not we will heave you overboard  heave away then growled the skipper his nature being such that the more he was defied the more defiant he became  well master trench you shall have your way  get the plank ready boys said swinton turning to the men  now stand aside and let the first mate choose  the same question being put to the two mates they returned similar answers and were ordered to prepare to walk the plank  you dont understand navigation i fancy master burns said swinton to paul but as you can set broken bones and things of that sort we will spare you if you agree to serve us  thank you replied paul with quiet urbanity  i prefer to accompany master trench if you have no objection  there was a slight laugh at the coolness of this reply which enraged the new skipper  say you so he exclaimed jumping up  come then shove out the plank lads and bring them on one at a time  stop cried little oliver at this point  youve forgot me  no my little man i havent returned swinton with a cynical smile you shall accompany your amiable father but first ill give you a fair chance he added in a bantering tone will you navigate the ship  yes i will answered oliver promptly  indeed exclaimed the new skipper taken aback by the boys boldness and at a loss for a reply  yes indeed retorted oliver only put me in command with an auger and ill navigate the ship to the bottom of the sea with you and all your cowardly crew on board of her  well said little master cried grummidge while a general laugh of approval went round  seeing that there was a symptom of better feeling among some of the men master trench was about to make an appeal to them when  land ho was shouted by the lookout in stentorian tones    chapter two  the adventurers land on the island  the excitement caused by the sight of land was tremendous  nearly every one ran to the bow or leaped on the bulwarks and the prisoners were left unguarded  seeing this grummidge quietly cut their bonds unobserved and then hurried forward to gaze with the rest  even the man at the tiller left his post for a moment to get a better view of the land  on returning he found master trench occupying his place and paul burns standing beside him with a handspike in his grasp  oliver had also armed himself with a marlinespike in default of a better weapon  go forard my man said the skipper in a quiet voice an tell your mates to get ready the anchor and stand by the cable  haste ye if you value life  the man slunk away without a word  we seem far from land yet master trench why such haste asked paul  look over the stern was the skippers curt reply  paul and oliver both did so and saw that another squall was bearing down on them  is it newfoundland asked paul  ay and an ugly coast to make in a squall  hallo thereif ye would not be food for fishes lay aloft and take in all sail  the skipper as his wont was gave the order in a stern tone of command and resigned the tiller to grummidge who came aft at the moment  the men saw with surprise that a heavy squall was bearing down on them from the eastward  mutiny flew as it were out at the hawseholes while discipline reentered by the cabin windows  even big swinton was cowed for the moment  it may be that the peculiar way in which paul burns eyed him and toyed with the handspike had some effect on him  possibly he was keenly alive to the danger which threatened them  at all events he went to work like the rest  and there was occasion for haste  before the sails were properly secured the squall struck them the foremast was snapped off close to the deck for a time the ship became unmanageable and drifted rapidly towards the land  is that a small island that i see on the weather bow olly said the skipper to his son  look your eyes are better than mine  yes father  it looks like a small one  steer for that grummidge  well take shelter in its lee  the sails were braced and the direction of the vessel was changed while the wreck of the foremast was being cleared away but just as they were drawing near to the island the wind chopped round and the hopedfor shelter they were approaching became suddenly a lee shore  nothing can save us now muttered grummidge the water wagtail is going to her doom  youre right my man  before another hour goes by she will have wagged her tail for the last time said master trench somewhat bitterly  they were both right  in less than an hour after that the ship was hurled upon the outlying rocks of a low island  shaken and strained as she had been during her disastrous voyage it took but a short time to break her up but the bow had been thrust high between two rocks and remained fast  circumstances do not change character but they often bring it to the front  heroes and poltroons may remain unknown until a sudden incident or change of condition reveals them  as the crew of the wrecked ship clustered on the fragment of the bow and gazed on the tumultuous flood of foaming water that seethed between them and the shore their hearts failed them for fear  some sternly compressed their lips and looked like men who had made up their minds to die game  a few even looked defiant as if daring fate to do her worst though the pallor of their countenances gave the lie to the expression of their features but many of them in the terror of the moment cried aloud for mercy and wildly promised amendment if their lives should be spared  a few were composed and grave  brave men though bad  possibly some of these prayed  if so they had the sense to do it silently to him who knows the secrets of all hearts  no man can cross that and live said the skipper in a low sad tone  it is my intention to try master trench said paul burns grasping the end of a light line and tying it round his waist  little oliver looked quickly and anxiously at his friend  his heart sank for he saw at a glance that it was not possible to follow him the deed if done at all must be done by his friend alone  great therefore was the rebound of joy in the boys heart when paul said  now olly attend to me  my life under god may depend on close attention to my signals and the management of the line  i can trust your father and the men to haul me back to the ship if need be but i will trust only you to pay out and read my signals  observe now let there be no slack to the line keep it just taut but without any pull on it so that you may feel the signals at once  one pull means pay out faster two pulls mean haul me aboard three pulls is all right and fix the big hawser to the line so that i may haul it ashore  now olly i trust to you to read my signals and act promptly  olivers heart was too full to speak  he looked at his friend with swimming eyes and nodded his head  men said paul to the crew let me beg you to obey the boys orders smartly  if god wills it so we shall all be saved  he leaped over the side as he concluded  another moment and he was seen to rise and buffet the plunging waters manfully  great as was the muscular strength of the young man it seemed absolute feebleness to those who looked on nevertheless he made headway towards the shore which was strewn with great boulders with a low cliff behind them  it was among these boulders that his chief danger and difficulty lay for his strong frame would have been as nothing if dashed against them  quickly he was lost to view in the hurlyburly of foam and spray  with the utmost care did oliver trench perform his duty  it required both vigour of hand and delicacy of touch to keep the line right but it was manipulated by hands whose vigour and touch were intensified by love  ease off he cried looking back impatiently at the strong fellows who held the slack of the line  the men obeyed so readily that the line ran out too fast and the boy had much ado to check it  just as he got it sufficiently taut he felt what seemed to him like two pullshaul me in  could it be  he was not certain  in an agony of anxiety he held on and was about to give the signal to haul in when his father who watched his every movement instantly said give him another second or two olly  just then there was a strong single pull at the line  pay outfaster shouted oliver and at the same moment he eased off his own feelings in a tremendous sigh of relief  after that the line ran steadily for a few seconds and no signals came then it ceased to run and poor olivers fears began to rush in upon him again but he was speedily relieved by feeling three distinct and vigorous pulls  thank god hes safe cried the boy  now then pass along the hawserquick  this was done the light line was attached to a threeinch rope and the party on the wreck waited anxiously  give it a pull olly by way of signal suggested master trench  he did not tell me to do that father returned the boy hesitating  no doubt he forgot it in the hurrytry it anyhow  a hearty pull on the line was accordingly given and they soon had the satisfaction of seeing the hawser move over the side and run towards the shore  when it ceased to run out they knew that paul must have got hold of the end of it so making their end fast to the heel of the bowsprit they waited for as yet the rope lay deep in the heaving waters and quite useless as a means of escape  presently the rope began to jerk then it tightened soon the bight of it rose out of the sea and remained thererigid  well done paul exclaimed the skipper when this was accomplished now olly you go first youre light  but the boy hesitated  no father you first he said  obey orders olly returned the skipper sternly  without another word oliver got upon the rope and proceeded to clamber along it  the operation was by no means easy but the boy was strong and active and the water not very cold  it leaped up and drenched him however as he passed the lowest point of the bight and thereafter the weight of his wet garments delayed him so that on nearing the shore he was pretty well exhausted  there however he found paul up to the waist in the sea waiting for him and the last few yards of the journey were traversed in his friends arms  by means of this rope was every man of the water wagtails crew saved from a watery grave  they found that the island on which they had been cast was sufficiently large to afford them shelter and a brief survey of it proved that there was both wood and water enough to serve them but nothing of animal or vegetable life was to be found  this was serious because all their provisions were lost with the wrecked portion of the ship so that starvation stared them in the face  if only the rumkegs had been saved said one of the men when they assembled after searching the island to discuss their prospects we might at least have led a merry life while it lasted  humph  much good that would do you when you came to think over it in the next world said grummidge contemptuously  i dont believe in the next world returned the first speaker gruffly  a blind man says he doesnt see the sun and dont believe in it rejoined grummidge does that prove that theres no sun  here master trench interposed  my lads he said dont you think that instead of talking rubbish it would be wise to scatter yourselves along the coast and see what you can pick up from the wreck  depend ont some of the provisions have been stranded among the rocks and as they will be smashed to pieces before long the sooner we go about it the better  the truth is that while you have been wastin your time running about the island master burns and i have been doin this an weve saved some things alreadyamong them a barrel of pork  come rouse up and go to worksome to the shore others to make a camp in the bush  this advice seemed so good that the men acted on it at once with the result that before dark they had rescued two more barrels of pork and a barrel of flour from the grasp of the sea besides some cases of goods which they had not taken time to examine  returning from the shore together laden with various rescued articles paul and oliver halted and sat down on a rock to rest for a few minutes  olly said the former what was that i saw you wrapping up in a bit of tarred canvas and stuffing so carefully under the breast of your coat soon after the ship struck  mothers last letter to me said the boy with a flush of pleasure as he tapped his breast  i have it safe here and scarcely damaged at all  strange remarked paul as he pulled a wellcovered packet from his own breastpocket strange that your mind and mine should have been running on the same subject  see here this is my mothers last gift to me before she dieda letter too but it is gods letter to fallen man  with great care the young man unrolled the packet and displayed a wellworn manuscript copy of a portion of the gospel of john  this is copied he said from the translation of gods word by the great wycliffe  it was given to my mother by an old friend and was as i have said her parting gift to me  the friends were interrupted in their examination of this interesting ms by the arrival of one of the sailors with whom they returned to the encampment in the bush    chapter three  first experiences on the island  a wonderfully picturesque appearance did these shipwrecked mariners present that night when under the shelter of the shrubbery that crowned their small island they kindled several campfires and busied themselves in preparing supper  as there was no law in the islandand our skipper having lost his ship forbore to assert any right to commandevery one naturally did what seemed right in his own eyes  as yet there had arisen no bone of contention among them  of food they had secured enough for at least a few days  fire they had procured by means of flint steel and tinder  a clear spring furnished them with water and ships buckets washed ashore enabled them to convey the same to their encampment  fortunately no rumkegs had been found so that evil passions were not stirred up and on the whole the first night on the island was spent in a fair degree of harmonyconsidering the character of the men  those who had been kindred souls on board ship naturally drew together on shore and kindled their several fires apart  thus it came to pass that the skipper and his son the two mates and paul burns found themselves assembled round the same fire  but the two mates it is right to add were only sympathetic in a small degree because of their former position as officers and their recent imprisonment together  in reality they were men of no principle and of weak character whose tendency was always to throw in their lot with the winning side  being a little uncertain as to which was the winning side that night they had the wisdom to keep their own counsel  oliver presided over the culinary department  you see im rather fond of cookin he said apologetically thats why i take it in hand  ah that comes of his bein a good boy to his mother said master trench in explanation and with a nod of approval  olly was always ready to lend her a helpin hand in the house at anything that had to be done which has made him a jackofalltradescookin among the rest as you see  a pity that the means of displaying his powers are so limited said paul who busied himself in levelling the ground beside the fire for their beds  limited exclaimed trench you are hard to please master paul i have lived on worse food than salt pork and pancakes  if so father said oliver as he deftly tossed one of the cakes into the air and neatly caught it on its other side in the pan you must either have had the pork without the pancakes or the pancakes without the pork  nay master shallowpate i had neither  what did you live on nothing  on nothing better than boiled sheepskinand it was uncommon tough as well as tasteless but it is wonderful what men will eat when theyre starving  i think father returned the boy as he tossed and deftly caught the cake again that it is more wonderful what men will eat when theyre not starving  of all the abominations that mortal man ever put between his grinders i think the worst is that vile stuff  he was interrupted by a sudden outbreak of wrath at the fire next to theirs where big swinton grummidge and several others were engaged like themselves in preparing supper  there will be trouble in the camp before long i see plainly enough remarked paul looking in the direction of the disputants  these two men swinton and grummidge are too wellmatched in body and mind and selfwill to live at peace and i foresee that they will dispute your right to command  they wont do that paul returned trench quietly for i have already given up a right which i no longer possess  when the water wagtail went on the rocks my reign came to an end  for the future we have no need to concern ourselves  the man with the most powerful will and the strongest mind will naturally come to the topand thats how it should be  i think that all the troubles of mankind arise from our interfering with the laws of nature  agreed heartily replied paul only i would prefer to call them the laws of god  by the way master trench i have not yet told you that i have in my possession some of these same laws in a book  have you indeedin a book  thats a rare and not altogether a safe possession nowadays  you speak the sober truth master trench returned paul putting his hand into a breastpocket and drawing forth the packet which contained the fragment of the gospel of john  persecution because of our beliefs is waxing hotter and hotter just now in unfortunate england  however we run no risk of being roasted alive in newfoundland for reading gods blessed wordsee there it is  a portion of the gospel of john in manuscript copied from the english translation of good master wycliffe  a good and true man ive heard say responded the skipper as he turned over the leaves of the precious document with a species of solemn wonder for it was the first time he had either seen or handled a portion of the bible  pity that such a friend of the people should not have lived to the age o that ancient fellowwhats his namethoosle something or other  methuselah said paul youre right there master trench  what might not a good man like wycliffe have accomplished if he had been permitted to live and teach and fight for the truth for nine hundred and sixtynine years  you dont mean to say he lived as long as that exclaimed the boy looking up from his pots and pans  indeed i do  well well he must have been little better than a live mummy by the end of that time replied oliver resuming his interest in his pots and pans  but how came you to know about all that master paul if this is all the scripture youve had asked trench  my mother was deeply learned in the scriptures answered paul and she taught me diligently from my boyhood  the way she came to be so learned is curious  i will tell you how it came about while we are doing justice to olivers cookery  you must know master trench continued paul after the first demands of appetite had been appeased that my dear mother was a true christian from her youth  her father was converted to christ by one of that noble band of missionaries who were trained by the great wycliffe and whom he sent throughout england to preach the gospel to the poor carrying in their hands manuscript portions of that gospel translated by wycliffe into plain english  you see that curious invention of the german john gutenbergi mean printing by movable typeswas not known at that time and even now although half a century has passed since the bible was printed abroad in latin no one with means and the power to do it has yet arisen to print an english bible but the day is not far distant when that work shall be done i venture to prophesy though i make no pretence to be among the prophets  well as i was going to say the missionary was a hoary old man when he preached the sermon that turned my grandfather from darkness to light my grandfather was just fifteen years old at that time  ten years later the same missionary came to grandfathers house worn out with years and labours and died there leaving all his treasure to his host  that treasure was a small portion of the new testament in english copied from wycliffes own translation  you may be sure that my grandfather valued the legacy very highly  when he died he left it to my mother about that time my mother married and went to live on the banks of the severn  not far from our farm there dwelt a family of the name of hutchins  the father had changed his name and taken refuge there during the recent civil wars  this family possessed a latin bible and the head of it was well acquainted with its contents  it was through him that my mother became well acquainted with the old as well as the new testament and thus it was that i also came in course of time to know about methuselah and a good many more characters about whom i may perhaps tell you one of these days  so then this is the manuscript the old missionary carried about is it said trench fingering the fragment tenderly  ay and a good translation it is i have been told by one whom most people would think too young to be a judge  you must know that this mr hutchins has a son named william who is considerably younger than i am but he is such a clever precocious fellow that before he left home for college i used to find him a most interesting companion  indeed i owe to him much of what little i have learned for he is a wonderful linguist being able to read hebrew and greek about as easily as latin or english  he is at oxford nowat least he was there when i last heard of him  moreover it was through the hutchins family in a roundabout way that your mother olly came to learn to write such letters as you have got so carefully stowed away there in your breastpocket  good luck to the hutchins family then say i returned olly for im glad to be able to read though on account of the scarcity and dearness of manuscripts i dont have the chance of makin much use of my knowledge  but you puzzle me paul  it was poor lucy wentworth who used to live with us and who died only last year that taught me to read and i never heard her mention the name of hutchins  did you father  no i never did olly  she said she had lived with a family named tyndale before she came to us poor thing  she was an amazin clever girl to teach and made your mother good at it in a wonderful short time  she tried me too but it was of no use i was too tough an old  just so master trench rejoined paul  hutchins real name was tyndale and he had resumed the name before lucy wentworth went to live with the family  so you see olly you are indebted in a roundabout way as i said to the tyndales for your mothers letter  william will make his mark pretty deeply on the generation i think if god spares him  little did paul burns think when he made this prophetic speech by the campfire on that distant isle of the sea that even while he spoke william tyndale was laying the foundation of that minute knowledge of the greek and hebrew languages which afterwards enabled him to give the bible to england in her own tongue and that so ably translated that after numerous revisions by the most capable of scholars large portions of his work remain unaltered at the present day  the night was far spent and the other members of the camp had been long buried in slumber before paul and trench and oliver could tear themselves away from the manuscript gospel of john  the latter two who knew comparatively little of its contents were at first impressed chiefly with the fact that they were examining that rare and costly articlea book and a forbidden book too for the reading of which many a man and woman had been burned to death in times pastbut they became still more deeply impressed as paul went on reading and commenting and pointing out the value of the book as gods own word to fallen man  here is a promise to rest upon said paul as he finally closed the book and repeated the verse from memory jesus said if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free  ay thats it paulfree  were all slaves more or less to something or other  what we all want is to be free said master trench as he drew his blanket round him pillowed his head on his cloak and went to sleep  silently paul and oliver followed his example the fires died out and in a few minutes the slumbering camp was shrouded in the mantle of night  energetic action was the order of the next day for those shipwrecked mariners knew well enough that nothing but hard and steady labour could enable them to live on an apparently desolate island  by daybreak most of the crew had scattered themselves along the shores or over the interior to spy out the land  about two hours later they began to drop into camp as hungry as hawks each carrying the result of his researches in his arms or on his shoulders  well done squill said paul who chanced to be first back in camp with a huge sail bundled up on his shoulder and who just then was busy blowing up his fire got another barrel of pork eh  its myself as doesnt know sur answered squill and it wasnt me as found it but jim heron there  i only helped to sling it on the pole and shoulder an end  its aither pork or gunpowther so if it aint good for a blow out itll be good for a blow up anyhow  did you see little oliver anywhere asked paul  ay sur i saw him on the shore bringing up what seemed to me the ships bowspritanyhow a spar o some sort about as big as he could haul along  just so returned paul with a laugh a ridgepole for our tent hes a smart boy little olly  sure hes all that sur and more  here he comes blowin like a porpoise  sure enough oliver appeared at the moment dragging a heavy spar behind him  several of the men appeared at the same time staggering through the bushes with various loads of wreckage which they flung down and noisily began discussing their experiences as they lighted the fires and prepared breakfast  here comes little stubbs cried jim heron  what fortune comrade  good fortune though my load is the lightest yet brought in  he flung down a small piece of wood with an air of satisfaction  why its only a boats rudder said oliver  ay so it is and the boat lies where i picked it up but it was too heavy to bring into camp without your assistance boy  and the best of it is that its not much damaged  very little repair will make her fit for sea again  this was indeed a find of immense importance and the assembled party discussed the event in all its bearings till their mouths were partially stopped by pork and pancakes  in the midst of this they were interrupted by the arrival of big swinton george blazer and grummidge with another find which afterwards cost them much trouble and regretnamely a couple of young lads natives whom they led into camp with their wrists tightly bound behind their backs    chapter four  strange visitorsdark plotsand evil purposes  the youths who had been captured were simple savages with very little clothing and with an expression of considerable alarm on their faces as was afterwards learned they had been coasting along the shore of the large neighbouring island in a canoe had observed the strange fires in the nighttime and had crossed over the channel to see what could be the cause thereof  on reaching the highest part of the island they discovered some of the sailors and turned to fly to their canoe but blazer had observed them their retreat was cut off and they were capturednot without a severe struggle however in which they were very roughly handled  big swinton still smarting under the bruises and bites he had received in the scuffle dragged them forward and demanded angrily what was to be done to them  what have they done asked trench  donewhy they have kicked and bitten like wildcats and i doubt not have come over here to see what they can steal  in my opinion a thief deserves keelhauling at the very least  master trenchs mouth expanded into a very broad smile as he looked round the group of men  dye hear that lads what master swinton thinks ought to be done to thieves  the men broke into a loud laugh for even the most obtuse among them could not fail to perceive the humour of the skippers look and question  you have nothing more to do wi the matter trench than any one else has returned swinton  i claim these lads as my prisoners and ill do with them what i please  no man is master now  might is right on this island  the words had scarcely been uttered when big swinton felt his right shoulder grasped as if in a vice and next moment he was flung violently to the ground while paul burns stood over him with a huge piece of wood in his hand and a halfstern halfsmiling look on his countenance  the men were taken completely by surprise for paul had up to this time shown such a gentle unwarlike spirit that the crew had come to regard him as a soft lump of a fellow  big swinton he said in the mildest of voices as you have laid down the law that might is right you cannot of course object to my acting on it  in virtue of that law i claim these prisoners as mine so you may get up and go about your business  you see lads he added turning to the men while swinton rose and retired though i have no wish to domineer over you or to usurp authority  i have a right to claim that my voice shall be heard and my reasons weighed  as swinton truly remarked no man is master now but as he followed this remark by making himself master and laying down a law for us i thought it might be complimentary to him just to act for once under his law and show him how well it works  now let me have a word with you  it is evident that the land over there is peopled with savages who probably never saw white men before  if we treat these young fellows kindly and send them away with gifts in their hands we shall no doubt make friends of the savages  if we treat them ill or kill them their relations will come over mayhap in swarms and drive us into the sea  i drop the swinton law of might being right and ask you who are now the lawmakerswhich is it to bekindness or cruelty  kindness shouted by far the greater number of the audience for even bad men are ready enough to see and admit the beauty of truth and justice when they are not themselves unpleasantly affected by these principles  the decision being thus made paul took the arm of one of the young indians and led him gently towards his fire while the men scattered to their several camps  master trench led the other youth in the same kindly way and little oliver motioning to them to sit down set before them two platters of pork and pancakes  this he did with such a benignant smile that the poor youths were obviously relieved from the dread of immediate and personal violence  after some glances of timid uncertainty they began to eat  thats right said oliver patting the bigger of the two on the shoulder youll find the victuals pretty good though youre not much used to em mayhap  of course the youths did not understand the words but they understood and fully appreciated the feeling with which they were expressed  they also appreciated most powerfully the viands  at first they were greatly perplexed by the offer of knives and forks but after looking at these implements gravely for a few moments they laid them gently down and went to work in the natural way with fingers and teeth  after they had finished the food and licked the platters clean they were presented with several bright brass buttons an old claspknife a comb and a kerchief or two with which inestimable gifts they embarked in their canoe and returned to the opposite shore  that day a most important discovery was made among the wreckage namely a case containing fishhooks of various sizes and a number of lines with these and the boat repaired master trench saw his way to prolonged existence on the island  to tell ye the plain truth he remarked to little stubbs with whom he fell in while searching on the shore before this case of tackle was found i had no hope at all of surviving here for a few barrels of pork and flour could not last long among so many and our end would have bin something awful but now with gods blessing we may do well enough until we have time to think and plan for our escape  but dye think master said stubbs that we shall find fish in them waters  find em  ay i make no doubt o that but we shall soon put it to the test for the boat will be ready by tomorrow or next day at furthest and then we shall see what the fish hereabouts think o salt pork  if they take to it as kindly as the indians did we shall soon have grub enough and to spare  the natural tendency of man to bow to the best leader was shown immediately after the incident of the capture of the indians for paul burns was thenceforward quietly appealed to by most of the crew in all circumstances which required much consideration  paul being a lawrespecting man naturally turned to the skipper whose decision was usually final and thus master trench dropped by general consent into his old position of commander  but it must not be supposed that all the party acquiesced in this arrangement  there were men among that crewsuch as swinton blazer garnet and otherswho either from false training bad example or warped spirits had come to the condition of believing that the world was made for their special behoof that they possessed that divine right to rule which is sometimes claimed by kings and that whoever chanced to differ from them was guilty of arrogance and required to be put down  these men were not only bad like most of the others but revengeful and resolute  they submitted in the meantime to the might of paul burns backed as he was by numbers but they nursed their wrath to keep it warm and under the leadership of big swinton plotted the downfall of their rivals  meanwhile being unquestionably in power master trench paul oliver grummidge stubbs and several of the wellaffected took possession of the boat when ready and inviting swinton to join themas a stroke of policypushed off with hooks and lines to make the first essay in the way of fishing on the now famous banks of newfoundland  anchoring the boat in what they deemed a suitable spot they went to work  i wonder if theyll take to pork remarked stubbs as he baited a large hook  if they take to it as you do we shall soon run short o that article said swinton dropping his hook into the water  i have brought off some shellfish remarked master trench  they may prefer that  so have i father said oliver whose bait was already at the bottom and ifhallo hold on hi  oh  i say  while the boy was thus ejaculating in a state of blazing excitement his arms and indeed his body to say nothing of his spirit were being jerked violently by his line in a way that suggested something awful at the other end  have a care olly  gently lad  hold on boy  let im run were among the contradictory pieces of advice given in various tones of warning remonstrance or simple recommendation but oliver heeded them not  acting on his own judgment he drew his fish or whatever it might be gradually and carefully from the deep  a mermaid it must be to tug so hard muttered stubbs as he and the others looked on with eager interest  a merman if its anything said squill sure there was never a maid in the say or out of it as would tug like that  that depends said grummidge  ive had em tuggin at my heartstrings worse than that many a time  look out  here it comes cried oliver as something huge and white was seen to flash wildly in the green depths  have the cleek ready  all ready my boy said his father in a low voice leaning over the side with a stick at the end of which was a large iron hook  now then father  quick  missed it  no  hurrah  for a moment it seemed as if master trench had got neptune himself on his cleek so severely did his stout frame quiver  then he gave a tremendous heaveyahoy and up came a magnificent codthe first of a grand hecatomb of codfish which have since that day enriched the world nauseated the sick with liver oil and placed newfoundland among the most important islands of the british empire  well done olly exclaimed the delighted father but he had barely time to open his mouth for the next remark when squill uttered an irish yell and was seen holding on to his line with desperate resolve stamped on every feature  thats the merman this time cried stubbs  his granmother no less muttered squill in a strongly suppressed voice while he anxiously hauled in the line  a shout from the other side of the boat here diverted attention  attacked front and rear cried paul with a hilarious laugh i shouldnt wonder ifhallo  nno it was only a nibha there he is  and truly there he was in a few minutes another splendid cod in the bottom of the boat  to make a long story short the boat was nearly filled with cod before the sun set and that night was spent in general rejoicing and feasting on fishwith a second course of pork and pancakes for those who were insatiable  but the state of contentment did not last long  the very next day there was quarrelling as to who should go in the boat  to allay the contention trench and paul volunteered to stay in camp and help the party that should be left to split and clean the fish and erect tents and booths  again the fishing was successful but dissensions about the use of the boat soon became more violent than ever  of course in all this master trench and his friend paul took a prominent part in trying to smooth matters to the intense jealousy of big swinton and his sympathisers  in short the camp ere long was divided into two hostile bandsthe moderately bad and the immoderately wicked if we may so put it  the first who were few in number sided with trench and his friends the second declared for swinton  but the resolute bearing of paul and the skipper and the fact that the whole party was destitute of weapons except clubs cut out of the bush and a few claspknives kept the larger and more vicious party in check  swinton and his friends therefore had recourse to secret plotting but plot as they would they had not sufficient brainpower among them to devise a method by which to free themselves of the men they envied  at last circumstances favoured them  it was found necessary to send men to the other side of the island to cut and fetch over some small trees that grew there in order to make stages on which to dry their fish  as the operation would require part of two days it was proposed to spend the night there  swinton was to command the party and master trench said jestingly that he and master burns with olly would stay to guard the camp  the woodcutting party was to start early the next day  then a plan of revenge flashed into big swintons mind  that night he revealed it to those of his friends whom he could trust and who were necessary to his purpose  the night followingwhile the men around them should be sleeping at the other side of the island and their enemies were alone in the campwas fixed on for the execution of their purpose    chapter five  turned adrift in a foreign land  it was a calm but very dark night when swinton blazer garnet heron taylor and several other men of kindred spirit rose from their couches at the further end of the island and stealthily quitting the place hastened back to their original camp  they reached it about midnight and as they had expected found all quiet for the socalled guard of the camp had been hard at work all day and were at that moment fast asleep  paul and the captain with oliver lay side by side under a tent which they had constructed out of broken spars and a piece of sailcloth  their foes drew together not far from the spot  now men said swinton this is a tough job we have in hand for they are strong men and the boy albeit not big is a very tigercat to fight  you see if our plan was murder we could easily settle their business while they slept but thats not our plan  we are not murderersby no means  certainly not growled blazer with virtuous solemnity  well that bein so we must take them alive  i will creep into the tent with you jim heron for youre big and strong enough  you will fall on trench and hold im down  ill do the same to burns  garnet will manage the boy  the moment the rest of you hear the row begin you will jump in and lend a hand wi the ropes  after weve got em all safe into the boat we will pull to the big islandland them there an bid them a tender farewell  but surely you wont land them without a morsel to eat said taylor  why not  theyre sure to fall in wi their dear friends the savages who will doubtless be very grateful to em an supply grub gratis now lads you understand what youve got to do  ay ay was the response in a low tone as they moved cautiously away like evil spirits to carry out their wicked plans  fortune it is said favours the brave but in this case she did not thus bestow her favours for the cowardly plan was successfully carried out  before the sleepers were well awake they were overwhelmed by numbers secured and bound  they were not gagged however as no one was near to hear even if they shouted their loudest which they knew it was useless to do  in a few minutes the three prisoners were hurried into the boat and rowed across the wide channel that separated the islet from the opposite shore  at that time it was not supposed either by the original discoverers or those who immediately followed them that newfoundland was one large islandconsiderably larger than ireland  not till many a year afterwards did explorers ascertain that it was an island of about three hundred and seventeen miles in length by about the same in breadth but so cut up by deep bays inlets and fords as to have much the appearance of a group of islands  during their passage across the channel both trench and paul attempted to reason with swinton but that hardened villain refused to utter a word till their prisoners were marched up the shingly beach and told to sit down on a ledge of rock under the steep cliffs where innumerable seabirds were screaming a clamorous welcome or perchance a noisy remonstrance  now my friends said their foe as you are fond of commanding you may take command o them there seabirdsthey wont objectand if ye fall in wi your friends the savages you may give them my love an good wishes  but surely you dont mean to leave us here without food and with our hands tied behind us fiercely exclaimed master trench whose wrath at any thing like injustice was always prone to get the better of his wisdom  as to grub answered swinton theres plenty of that around if you only exert yourself to find it  i wont cut your lashins however till we are fairly in the boat for we cant trust you  come along lads and garnet you bring the boy with ye  under the impression that he was to be separated from his father and friend and taken back again to the islet poor oliver whom they had not thought it worth while to bind struggled with a ferocity that would have done credit to the wildcats with which he had been compared but garnet was a strong man and held him fast  take it easy my boy said paul who being helpless could only look on with intense pity  submit to gods willwe will pray for you  but ollys spirit could by no means reach the submitting point until he was fairly exhausted  while they dragged him towards the boat taylor turned back and flung a small canvas bag at the captains feet  there master trench he said youll find a lump o pork in that bag to keep you goin till ye get hold o somethin else  an dont take on about the boy  we dont want im bless you  why we only want to prevent him settin you free before we gets fairly away  this was true  when the boat was reached and the men were on board ready to shove off garnet still holding olly fast by the arm said keep still will you and hear what master swinton has got to say  now you fiery polecat said swinton you may go and cut their lashins and take that as a parting gift  the gift was a sounding box on the ear but olly minded it not for while garnet was speaking as he stood kneedeep in the water close to the boat he had observed an axe lying on one of the thwarts near to him  the instant he was set free therefore he seized the axe and flourishing it close past garnets nose with a cheer of defiance he sprang towards the beach  garnet leaped after him but he was no match for the agile boy who in another minute had severed pauls bonds and placed the weapon in his hands  hallo hi youve forgot me  cut myho  but there was no occasion for master trench to cry out and struggle with the cords that bound him  a furious rush of paul with the axe caused garnet to double with the neatness of a hunted hare  he bounded into the boat which was immediately shoved off and the sailors rowed away leaving paul to return and liberate the captain at leisure  silently the trio stood and watched the receding boat until it was lost in the darkness of the night  then they looked at each other solemnly their case was certainly a grave one  cast away on an unknown shore murmured the captain in a low tone as if he communed with his own spirit rather than with his companions without food without a ship or boatwithout hope  nay master trench said paul not without hope for god is our refuge and our strength a very present help in trouble so says his own word as my mother has often read to me  it is well for you paul returned the captain that you can find comfort in such wordsi can find none  stern realities and facts are too strong for me  how can i take comfort in unfulfilled promises here we are in trouble enough surely  in what sense is god a refuge to usor strength or a present help  why we are left absolutely destitute here without so much as a bite of food to keep our bodies and souls together  he spoke with some bitterness for he was still chafing under the sense of the wrong which he had suffered at the hands of men to whom he had been invariably kind and forbearing  as he turned from paul with a gesture of impatience his foot struck against the canvas bag of pork which the man taylor had flung to him on leaving and which had been forgotten  he stopped suddenly and gazed at it so did paul  looks like as if god had already helped usat least to fooddoes it not said the latter  it was taylor helped us to that objected trench  and who put it into taylors heart to help us asked paul  he is one of the worst men of our crew so we can hardly say it was his own tenderness and certainly it was not the devil who moved him to it  am i wrong in holding that it was our father  i believe you are right paul  anyhow i have neither the capacity nor the inclination to dispute the point now  pick up the bag olly and come along  we must try to find some sort of shelter in which to spend the rest o the night and consider our future plans  with a lighter heart and firmer faith paul burns followed his leader silently thanking god as he went along for thus far and so opportunely demonstrating his own faithfulness  they had to wander some time before a suitable camping spot was found for that part of the newfoundland coast on which they had been landed was almost inaccessible  the cliffs in many places rose sheer out of the water to a height of full three hundred feet  only in a few places little strips of shingly beach lay between the base of the cliffs and the sea so that the finding of an opening in those stupendous ramparts of rock was no easy matter in a dark night  at last they came to a place where the cliffs appeared to rise less precipitously  after careful clambering for some minutes they discovered a sort of gap in the rampart up which they climbed amid rugged and broken masses until they reached a somewhat level plateau or shelf covered with small bushes  here they resolved to encamp  whether its the top o the cliffs or not theres no findin out remarked trench as he tried to survey the ground but whether or not dont matter for it looks level enough to lie on an were as like as not to break our necks if we try to go further  agreed said paul but now it occurs to me that our pork may be raw and that we shall want fire to cook it  have you got flint and steel in your pocket master trench  aynever travel without it but by illluck ive got no tinder  flint and steel are useless you know without that  if illluck troubles you returned paul good luck favours me for i have got a bit of tinder and  the porks raw exclaimed oliver who had been hastily investigating the contents of the canvas bag but i say theres more than pork here  theres a lot o the little flourcakes our cook was so fond of makin  good  now then let us have a search for wood said paul  if we find that we shall get along well enough till morning  but have a care olly keep from the edge of the cliff  the ledge is not broad  have an eye too or rather an ear for water as you go along  success attended their search for in a few minutes paul and the captain returned with loads of dry branches and olly came back reporting water close at hand trickling from a crevice in the cliffs  your shirtfront tells the tale olly  youve been drinking said paul who was busy striking a light at the time  indeed i have and we shall all be obliged to drink under difficulties for we have neither cup nor mug with us  neither is wanted boy as ill soon show you said paul  why a bit of birchbark even a piece of paper forms a good drinking vessel if you only know how to use it  ha caught at last he added referring to some dry grasses and twigs which burst into flame as he spoke  another moment and a ruddy glare lit up the spot giving to things near at hand a cosy redhot appearance and to more distant objects a spectral aspect while strangely enough it seemed to deepen to profounder darkness all else around  heaping on fresh fuel and pressing it down for it consisted chiefly of small branches they soon had a glowing furnace in front of which the pork ere long sputtered pleasantly sending up a smell that might have charmed a gourmand  now then while this is getting ready let us examine our possessions said the captain for we shall greatly need all that we have  it is quite clear that we could not return to our shipmates even if we would  no and i would not even if i could interrupted oliver while busy with the pork chops  and continued his father regardless of the interruption it is equally clear that we shall have to earn our own livelihood somehow  upon careful examination it was found that their entire possessions consisted of two large claspknives a sheath huntingknife flint steel and tinder the captains watch a small axe a large notebook belonging to paul three pencils bit of indiarubber several fishhooks a long piece of twine and three brass buttons the property of oliver besides the manuscript gospel of john and ollys treasured letter from his mother  these articles with the garments in which they stood constituted the small fortune of our wanderers and it became a matter of profound speculation during the progress of the supper as to whether it was possible to exist in an unknown wilderness on such very slender means  olly thought it wasas a matter of course  master trench doubted and shook his head with an air of much sagacity a method of expressing an opinion which is eminently unassailable  paul burns condescended on reasons for his beliefwhich like ollys was favourable  you see he said wiping his uncommonly greasy fingers on the grass we have enough of pork and cakes here for several dayson short allowance  then it is likely that we shall find some wild fruits and manage to kill something or other with stones and it cannot be long till we fall in with natives who will be sure to be friendlyif not we will make them soand where they can live we can live  so i am going to turn in and dream about it  luckily the weather is warm goodnight  thus did our three adventurers turning in on that giddy ledge spend their first night in newfoundland    chapter six  difficulties met and overcome  the position in which the trio found themselves next morning when daylight revealed it was we might almost say tremendously romantic  the ledge on which they had passed the night was much narrower than they had supposed it to be and their beds if we may so call them had been dangerously near to the edge of a frightful precipice which descended sheer down to a strip of sand that looked like a yellow thread two hundred feet below  the cliff behind them rose almost perpendicularly another hundred feet or more and the narrow path or gully by which they had gained their eyrie was so steep and rugged that their reaching the spot at all in safety seemed little short of a miracle  the sun was brightening with its first beams an absolutely tranquil sea when the sleepers opened their eyes and beheld what seemed to them a great universe of liquid light  their ears at the same time drank in the soft sound of murmuring ripples far below and the occasional cry of sportive seabirds  grand glorious exclaimed trench as he sat up and gazed with enthusiasm on the scene  paul did not speak  his thoughts were too deep for utterance but his mind reverted irresistibly to some of the verses in that manuscript gospel which he carried so carefully in his bosom  as for oliver his flushed young face and glittering eyes told their own tale  at first he felt inclined to shout for joy but his feelings choked him so he too remained speechless  the silence was broken at last by a commonplace remark from paul as he pointed to the horizonthe home of our shipmates is further off than i thought it was  the rascals exclaimed the captain thinking of the shipmates not of the home the place is too good for em  but all of them are not equally bad suggested paul gently  humph replied trench for kind and goodnatured though he was he always found it difficult to restrain his indignation at anything that savoured of injustice  in occasionally giving way to this temper he failed to perceive at first that he was himself sometimes guilty of injustice  it is only fair to add however that in his cooler moments our captain freely condemned himself  humph is a very expressive word observed paul and in some sense satisfactory to those who utter it but it is ambiguous  do you mean to deny master trench that some of your late crew were very good fellows and dont you admit that little stubbs and squill and grummidge were firstrate specimens of  i dont admit or deny anything said the captain rising with a light laugh and i have no intention of engaging in a controversy with you before breakfast  come olly blow up the fire and go to work with your pork and cakes  ill fetch some more wood and paul will help me no doubt  with a good grace paul dropped the discussion and went to work  in a few minutes breakfast was not only ready but consumed for a certain measure of anxiety as to the probability of there being an available path to the top of the cliffs tended to hasten their proceedings  the question was soon settled for after ascending a few yards above their encampment they found an indentation or crevice in the cliff which led into an open spota sort of broader shelfwhich sloped upwards and finally conducted them to the summit  here to their surprise they discovered that their new home instead of being as they had supposed it one of a series of large islands was in truth a territory of vast apparently boundless extent covered with dense forests  far as the eye could reach interminable woods presented themselves merging in the far distance into what appeared to be a range of low hills  newfoundland is bigger than we have been led to believe said paul burns surveying the prospect with great satisfaction  ay is it responded trench  the fact is that discoverers of new lands bein naturally in ships have not much chance to go far inland in a country like this with such a wild seaboard its no wonder they have made mistakes  we will find out the truth about it now however for well undertake a land voyage of discovery  what without arms or provisions father asked oliver  what dye call the two things dangling from your shoulders boy returned the captain with some severity are these not arms and have not woodsgenerally got lakes in em and rivers which usually swarm with provisions  thats so father returned the lad somewhat abashed but i did not raise the question as a difficulty only ive heard you sometimes say that a ship is not fit for sea till she is wellarmed and provisioned so i thought that it might be the same with land expeditions  before the skipper could reply paul drew attention to an opening in the woods not far from them where an animal of some kind was seen to emerge into an open space gaze for a moment around it and then trot quietly away  some of our provisionsuncooked as yet remarked oliver  more of them returned his father pointing to a covey of birds resembling grouse which flashed past them at the moment on whirring wings  how we are to get hold of em however remains of course to be seen  there are many ways of getting hold of them and with some of these i am familiar said paul  for instance i can use the longbow with some skillat least i could do so when at school  and i have no doubt captain that you know how to use the crossbow  that i do returned trench with a broad grin  i was noted at school as bein out o sight the worst shot in the neighbourhood where i lived  indeed ive bin known to miss a barndoor at twenty yards  well well you must learn to shoot thats all said paul and you may perchance turn out better with the sling  that weapon did great execution as no doubt you know in the hands of king david  but where are we to get longbows and crossbows and slings asked oliver eagerly  why olly my boy excitement seems to have confused your brain or the air of newfoundland disagrees with you said paul  we shall make them of course  but come he added in a more serious tone we have reached a pointi may say a crisisin our lives for we must now decide definitely what we shall do and i pray god to direct us so that we may do only that which is right and wise  are you prepared captain to give up all hope of returning to our shipmates  of course i am returned trench firmly while a slight frown gathered on his brow  the few who are on our side could not make the rest friendly  they may now fight it out amongst themselves as best they can for all that i care  we did not forsake them  they sent us away  besides we could not return if we wished it ever so much  no a grand new country has been opened up to us and i mean to have a cruise of exploration  what say you olly  im with ee father answered the boy with a nod of the head that was even more emphatic than the tone of his voice  with a laugh at olivers enthusiasm paul declared himself to be of much the same mind and added that as they had no boxes to pack or friends to bid farewell to they should commence the journey there and then  i dont agree with that said the captain  why not master trench  because we have not yet made our weapons and it may be that we shall have some good chances of getting supplies at the very beginning of our travels  my opinion is that we should arm ourselves before starting for the pork and cakes cannot last long  this being at once recognised as sound advice they entered the forest which was not so thick at that place as it at first appeared to be they went just far enough to enable them to obtain a species of hardwood which the experienced eye of paul burns told them was suitable for bowmaking  here they pitched their camp  paul took the axe and cut down several small trees the captain gathered firewood and oliver set about the fabrication of a hut or booth with poles bark turf and leaves which was to shelter them from rain if it should fall though there was little chance of that the weather being fine and settled at the time  the work which they had undertaken was by no means as easy as they had anticipated  paul had indeed made bows and arrows in former years but then all the materials had been furnished in the rough to his hands whereas he had now not only to select the tree best adapted to his purpose but had to choose the best part of it and to reduce that portion from a massive trunk to suitably slender proportions  it was much the same with the arrows and crossbow bolts  however there was resolution and perseverance in each member of the party far more than sufficient to overcome such little difficulties only as we have said they were slower about it than had been expected and the work was far from completed when the descent of night obliged them to seek repose  not a bad little bower remarked paul as they sat down to supper in the primitive edifice which oliver had erected  the said bower was about four feet high eight wide and five deep of irregular form with three sides and a roof walls and roof being of the same materialbranchy leafy and turfy  the fourth side was an open space in which the inhabitants sat facing the fire  the latter being large enough to roast a sheep whole was built outside  why olly youre a selfish fellow said the captain during a pause in the meal youve thought only of yourself in building this bower just look at pauls feet  they are sticking out ten or twelve inches beyond our shelter  that comes of his being so tall daddy  but it does not matter much if it should come on to rain he can draw his feet inside theres room enough to double up  dont you think so paul  but paul replied not save by a gentle snore for he was a healthy man and childlike in many respects especially in the matter of going off to the land of nod the moment his head touched his pillow  possibly the fresh air the excitement the energy with which he had wrought and the relish with which he had supped intensified this tendency on the present occasion  oliver very soon followed his friends example and so captain trench was left to meditate beside the fire  he gazed into its glowing embers or sometimes glanced beyond it towards an open space where a tiny rivulet glittered in the moonlight and a little cascade sent its purling music into the still air  ere long he passed from the meditative to the blinking stage  then he turned his eyes on the sleepers smiled meekly once or twice and nodded to themquite inadvertently  after that he stretched his bulky frame beside them and resigned himself to repose  now it is probable that we should have had nothing more to record in reference to that first night in newfoundland if captain trench had been in the habit of taking his rest like ordinary mortals but such was not his habit  he bounced in his sleep  why he did so no one could ever find out  he himself denied the soft impeachment and in his waking moments was wont to express disbelief as well as profound ignorance in regard to the subject  several broken beds however had in the course of his career testified against him but like the man who blamed the salmon not the whisky for his headaches trench blamed the beds not the bouncing for his misfortunes  one might have counted him safe with the solid earth of newfoundland for his bed but danger often lurks where least expected  oliver trench was not an architect either by nature or training  his bower had been erected on several false principles  the bouncing of a big man inside was too much for its infirm constitution  its weak points were discovered by the captain  a bounce into one of its salient supports proved fatal and the structure finally collapsed burying its family in a compost of earth and herbage  with a roar that would have done credit to a native walrus the captain struggled to free himself under the impression that a band of savages had attacked them  all three quickly threw off the comparatively light material that covered them and stood in warlike attitudes for a few seconds glancing around for foes who did not exist  then the roar of alarm was transformed into shouts of laughter but these were quickly checked by a real foe who crept up insidiously and leaped on them unexpectedly  the halfextinguished fire having been replenished by the falling structuremuch of which was dry and inflammablecaught on the roof and flashed down into the interior  save the pork lad shouted the captain as he sprang out of the kindling mass  ay ay father replied the son  paul meanwhile grasped the halffinished bows and arrows in his arms and thus their little all was rescued from the flames  of course the bower was utterly consumed but that caused them little grief  having extinguished the flames they all lay down to finish off the night under a neighbouring tree and even its architect became so oblivious of what had occurred that he employed the remainder of his slumbering hours in dreaming of the home in old england and of that dear mother whose last letter was still carefully guarded in the pocket of the coat that covered his ardent little bosom    chapter seven  they begin their travels in earnest  when their weapons were complete our three travellers started on their journey of exploration in the newfound land  captain trench armed himself with a strong heavilymade crossbow and a birchbark quiver full of bolts  paul burns carried a bow as long as himself with a quiver full of the orthodox clothyard shafts  oliver provided himself with a bow and arrows more suited to his size and being naturally sanguine he had also made for himself a sling with the cord he chanced to possess and the leathern tongue of one of his shoes he likewise carried a heavy bludgeon somewhat like a policemans baton which was slung at his side  not content with this he sought and obtained permission to carry the axe in his belt  of course none of the bolts or arrows had metal points but that mattered little as the wood of which they were made was very hard and could be sharpened to a fine point and being feathered the missiles flew straight to the mark when pointed in the right direction  now captain said paul on the morning they set out lets see what you can do with your crossbow at the first bird you meet  i mean the first eatable bird for i have no heart to kill the little twitterers around us for the mere sake of practice  that will i right gladly said trench fixing his bow and string and inserting a bolt with a confident air  and theres a chance daddy  see a bird that seems to wish to be shot it sits so quietly on the tree  the seaman raised his weapon slowly to his shoulder shut the wrong eye glared at the bird with the other took a long unsteady aim and sent his bolt high over the creatures head as well as very much to one side  might have been worse said the captain  might have been better returned paul with equal truth  now its my turn  the bird all ignorant of the fate intended for it sat still apparently in surprise  paul drew his clothyard shaft to his ear and let fly  it went apparently in search of the captains bolt  now me cried the impatient olly in a hoarse whisper as he placed a stone in the sling and whirled it round his head  his companions drew off  there was a burring noise as the stone sped on its mission and struck the treestem with a sounding crack three yards from the bird which learning wisdom from experience at last took wing  in anticipation of their chance coming round again both paul and the captain had got ready their artillery and oliver hastily put another stone in his sling  a look and exclamation of disappointment were given by each as the bird vanished but just at that moment a large rabbit darted across their path  whiz twang burr went bolt and bow and stone and that rabbit pierced in head and heart and smitten on flank fell to rise no more  strange said trench in openmouthed surprise ive often heard of coincidences but i never did see or hear of the like of that  all three to hit it at once exclaimed paul  ay and all three of us doin our best to hit it too exclaimed oliver  just sothats the puzzle lad rejoined the captain  if we had been tryin to hit something else now there would have been nothing strange about it  but to hit what we all aimed at  apparently the captain failed to find words adequately to express his ideas for he did not finish the sentence meanwhile paul picked up the rabbit and attached it to his belt  after this advancing through the woods in a northwesterly direction they made for a somewhat elevated ridge hoping to obtain from that point a more extended view of the land  towards noon feeling hungry they began to look out for a suitable spot whereon to lunch or rather to dine for while travelling on foot in wild countries men usually find it convenient to take a very substantial meal about or soon after noon  to have water handy remarked paul as they stopped to look round is essential to comfort as well as cookery  look there away to the norwest o that bunch o trees said the captain pointing to a distant spot theres a depression in the ground there and from the lie o the land all round i should say we shall find a stream o some sort near it  i hope so said oliver for i shall want water to wash the rabbit with and i have a strong hope that we may find fish in the rivers of this land and although my hooks are big i think the fish may not be particular seein that they have never before been tempted in that way  thats true olly i hope you wont be disappointed  but what makes you want to wash the rabbit my boy asked the captain it is not dirty  perhaps not but i dont quite relish the dirty work of cleaning out a rabbit before cooking it so i want to try the plan of cutting it open holding it under water and scraping out the inside while in that position  my son you wont be so particular when youve been a few weeks huntin in the wild woods  but what about the hair  oh we can singe that off daddy  what singe off wet hair  and the skini doubt we might find that tough  the young cookfor such he became to the exploring expeditionlooked puzzled  i never skinned a rabbit he said but no doubt it is easy enough ill just cut it open at the heador tailand pull it off like a glove  not quite so easily done as that remarked paul with a laugh but i happen to know something about skinning birds and beasts olly so make your mind easy  i will show you how to do it  you happen to know something about almost everything i think said the captain  tell me now dye happen to know what sort o beast it is that i see starin at us over the bushes yonder  no master trench i do not but it looks marvellously like a deer of some sort said paul as he hastily fitted an arrow to his bow  but before he could discharge it the animal wisely retired into the shelter of its native wilds  by this time having walked smartly they had gained the crest of one of the lower ridges or plateaus that rose in gentle slopes from the rocky shore and there as had been anticipated they found a small rivulet such as americans would call a creek and scotsmen a burn  it flowed in a northeasterly direction and was broken by several small rapids and cascades  with a little shout of satisfaction oliver ran down to its banks getting his hooks out as he went  arriving at the margin of a deep pool he bent over it and gazed earnestly down  the water was as clear as crystal showing every stone at the bottom as if it had been covered merely with a sheet of glass and there apparently undisturbed by the intruder lay several large fish  what they were he knew notcared not  sufficient for him that they seemed large and fat  his first impulse was to turn and shout the discovery to his companions but seeing that they had already set to work to cut firewood a little higher up the stream he checked himself  ill catch a fish first maybe he muttered as he quickly adjusted to his piece of cord one of the smallest codhooks he possessed  a few minutes sufficed for this but when he was ready it occurred to him that he had no bait  he looked around him but nothing suitable was to be seen and he was about to attempt the all but hopeless task of tearing up the soil with his fingers in search of a worm when his eyes fell on a small bright feather that had been dropped by some passing bird  happy thoughts occurred to people in the days of which we write even as now though they were not recognised or classified as such  flyfishing was instantly suggested to the eager boy  he had often tried it in old england why not try it in newfoundland  a very brief period sufficed to unwind a thread from the cord and therewith to attach the feather to the hook  he had no rod and neither time nor patience to make one  gathering the cord into a coil such as wharfmen form when casting ropes to steamers he swung it round his head and hove his hook halfway across the glassy pool  the fish looked up at him apparently in calm surprisecertainly without alarm  then olly began to haul in the hook  it was a fearful fly to look at such as had never desecrated those waters since the days of adam yet those covetous fish rushed at it in a body  the biggest caught it and found himself caught  the boy held on tenderly while the fish in wild amazement darted from side to side or sprang high into the air  oliver was far too experienced a fisher not to know that the captive might be but slightly hooked so he played it skilfully casting a sidelong glance now and then at his busy comrades in the hope that they had not observed him  at last the fish became tired and the fisher drew it slowly to the banka four or fivepound trout at the very least  unfortunately the bank was steep and the boy found to his distress that the hook had only caught hold slightly of the fishs lip  to lift out the heavy creature with the line was therefore impossible to catch hold of it with the hand was almost equally so for when he lay down and stretched out his arm as far as possible he could scarcely touch it with the end of his finger  if it makes another dash itll escape muttered the anxious boy as he slid further and further down the banka hairbreadth at a time  just then the fish showed symptoms of revival  olly could stand this no longer  he made a desperate grasp and caught it by the gills just as the hook came away  the act destroyed what little balance he had retained and he went with a sharp short yell into the pool  paul looked up in time to see his friends legs disappear  he ran to the spot in considerable alarm supposing that the boy might have taken a fit and not knowing whether he could swim  he was relieved however to find that olly on reappearing struck out manfully with one hand for a shallow place at the lower end of the pool while with the other he pressed some object tightly to his bosom  you dont mean to say exclaimed paul as he assisted his friend out of the water that you went in for that splendid trout and caught it with your hands  you saw me dive replied the boy throwing the fish down with affected indifference and stooping to wring the water from his garments as well as to hide his face and you dont suppose surely that i caught it with my feet  come look at the depth i had to go down to catch him  seizing his prize olly led his friend to the spot where he had fallen in and pointed with a look of triumph to the clear deep pool  at the moment a smile of intelligence lit up pauls features and he pointed to the extemporised flyhook which still dangled from the bank  bursting into a hearty fit of laughter the successful fisher ran up to the encampment swinging the trout round his head to the surprise and great satisfaction of his father who had already got the fire alight and the rabbit skinned  need it be said that the meal which followed was a hearty one though there was no variety save roast rabbit roast trout and roast pork with the last of the cakes as pudding  a firstrate dinner exclaimed paul after swallowing a draft of sparkling water from the stream  not bad admitted captain trench if we only had something stronger than water to wash it down  paul made no reply to this remark but he secretly rejoiced in the necessity which delivered his friend from the only foe that had power to overcome him  now remarked paul when he had finished dinner i will strengthen my bow before starting for it does not send the arrows with sufficient force and the only way to do that that i can think of is to shorten it  and i will feather the last arrow i made said oliver drawing the shaft in question out of his quiver  well as my bow and bolts are all shipshape and in perfect order i will ramble to the top of the ridge before us and take a look out ahead  so saying the captain departed and the other two were soon so deeply absorbed in their work and in conversation about future plans that they had almost forgotten him when a loud shout caused them to start up  on looking towards the ridge they beheld captain trench tossing his arms wildly in the air and shouting and gesticulating violently  sees savages i think said paul  or gone mad cried olly  catching up their arms the two ran hastily to the top of the ridge where they arrived perspiring and panting to find that their excitable comrade had only gone into ecstasies about the magnificent scenery that had burst upon his sight    chapter eight  beautiful scenes and strange experiences  and truly the scene which met their gaze was of a nature calculated to arouse enthusiasm in a much less ardent bosom than that of captain trench  a wide undulating country studded with lakelets and rich with verdure stretched away from their feet to the horizon where a range of purple hills seemed to melt and mingle with cloudland so that the eye was carried as it were by imperceptible gradations from the rugged earth up into the soft blue sky indeed it was difficult to distinguish where the former ended and the latter began  the lakes and ponds were gay with yellow waterlilies and the air was musical with the sweet cries of wildfowl while the noontide sun bathed the whole in a golden glory  the effect of such a sight on our wanderers was at first too powerful for words and when words did burst forth they served to show how wonderfully diverse are the spirits of men  captain trench as we have seen was moved by this vision of beauty to shout almost to dance with delight while in thought he bounded over the length and breadth of the new land taking bearings and making notes and charts with the view of extending the geographical knowledge of mankind  his son oliver on the other hand allowed his imagination to revel freely through the forests and over the hills and across lakes and savannahs in powerful sympathy with the aspirations which must have animated nimrod while to paul burns whose temperament was sedate and earnest as well as cheerful and hearty the glorious vision at once suggested thoughts of that tranquil home in which mans lot was originally cast by the loving heart of god  now it is quite plain said trench as they slowly descended into this beautiful scene that this land is no collection of small islands as we have been led to suppose but a great land full of all that is needful to make it the happy abode of man  just so daddy exclaimed the enthusiastic oliver and we have been sent to explore it and carry home the newsperhaps to bring out the first settlers and show them the way  why olly you carry too much sail for so small a craft you look out rather too far ahead  and what mean ye by saying we are sent  nobody sent us on this journey that i know of unless you mean that swinton the big scoundrelsent us  whatever olly meant by the expression interposed paul i think he is right for all men are sent by the almighty no matter where they go  what dye mean that men are sent by the almighty whether they go to do good or evil  ay master trench that is what i mean they are sent by him though not sent to do evil  look here dont you admit that god created all men and sent them into this world  of course i do  and that he made you an englishman and so sent you to england and that he made you a seacaptain and among other places sent you to newfoundland  wellii suppose he did returned the captain with that puzzled expression of countenance which was wont to indicate that his mind was grappling difficulties  well then continued paul being good of course the almighty sent us to do good but he also gave us free wills which just means permission to do as we please so it remains to be seen whether we will use our free wills in working with him or in trying to work against him for strange to say we cannot really work against god we can only try to do it and in so trying we establish the fact of our own wickedness but his grand and good purposes shall be carried out in spite of us notwithstanding for he can bring good out of evil  now paul ive lost soundings altogether and its my opinion that you are foolishly talking about things that you dont understand  i never heard master trench that it was foolish to talk about what one does not understand  on the contrary it is by talking of things that we dont understand that we manage at last to understand them  you had a deal of talking about navigation had you not before you understood it  look ee here lad said trench stopping suddenly with his legs planted firmly apart as though on the quarterdeck of his ship in a cross sea while he drove his right fist into the palm of his left hand argumentatively  look ee here  how can it be possible thatthat pooh  come along well never get on with our survey of the land if we dispute at this rate  the stout mariner turned away with an air of exasperation and resumed his walk at a rapid pace closely followed by his amused friend and son  this irreverent mode of dismissing a grave and difficult subject was not peculiar to captain trench  it has probably been adopted by those who shrink from mental effort ever since the days of adam and eve  minds great and small have exercised themselves since the beginning of time on this perplexing subjectgods sovereignty and mans free willwith benefit probably to themselves  we recommend it in passing good reader to your attention and we will claim to be guiltless of presumption in thus advising so long as the writing stands prove all things and hold fast that which is good  before the sun went down that night our explorers had plunged into the very heart of the beautiful country which we have describednow pushing through tangled underwood or following the innumerable deertracks with which the country was seamed or breasting the hillsides or making detours to get round small lakes being guided in a westerly direction by a small pocketcompass which captain trench was fortunately in the habit of carrying with him wherever he went  no large lakes or broad rivers had yet been met with so that up to this point the divergencies from the direct line had not been great  thus they advanced for several days subsisting on game and fish chiefly the last however for their shooting powers were very defective and oliver was an ardenttoo ardentfisher  their inability to shoot became at last a serious matter for many arrows and bolts were lost as well as much game  look now theres another chance whispered paul pointing to a plump willowgrouse that sat in a bush in front of them  you try first master trench  an dont miss daddy said oliver entreatingly theres only the bones of a rabbit left from this mornings breakfast  the captain took a fervently careful aim but went far wide of the mark to his intense chagrin  paul then bent his bow but without success though his arrows stuck in a branch close under the bird which being very tame only glanced down inquiringly  olivers arrow went over it and the stone which he afterwards slang made such a rattling in the bush that the puzzled creature finally retired  this is becoming serious remarked the captain with a face so solemn that paul burst into a fit of laughter  ha you may laugh lad continued trench but if you were as hungry as i am youd be more inclined to cry  dye think a stout man like me can sup heartily on rabbit bones  youve forgot daddy the four big trout i caught today  so i have olly well come and lets have em cooked at once  the fish which were really more than sufficient without the rabbit bones were soon grilling over a huge fire under the canopy of a spreading birchtree  when the skipper had disposed of enough to allay the pangs of hunger he turned and said to his comrades in a tone of marked decision  now messmates ive been rummagin my brains a bit and the outcome of it is as followswhatever is worth doin is worth doin well as the old proverb puts it  if we are to explore this country we must set about learning to shoot for if we dont we are likely to starve in the midst of plenty and leave our bones to bleach in this beautiful wilderness  true master trench remarked paul for the seaman had paused at this point thus far you and i think alike  what more have you to say  this i have to say that i am resolved not to explore another fathom o this land until i can make sure of hittin the crown o my cap with a crossbow bolt at a reasonable distance and i would advise you both to make the same resolution for if you dont you will have to do your exploring without me  just so captain said paul putting the last morsel of fish into his mouth with a sigh of contentment you are commander of this expedition  i will obey orders  but what do you call a reasonable distance daddy asked oliver with that pert cock of the head peculiar to insolent youths a yard or a fathom  well now continued trench ignoring the question we will set about it tomorrow morning first thing after breakfast stick up a target retire to a reasonable distance and work away from morning till night and every day till we become perfect  agreed captain said paul but what about food  we will give olly leave of absence for an hour or two daily to go and fish said the captain that will keep us alive coupled with what birds or beasts may come accidentally in front of our arrows  this plan although proposed at first half in jest was carried into operation next day during the whole of which they practised shooting at a mark most diligently  at suppertime over a couple of fine trout it was admitted sadly by each that the progress made was very slight indeed scarcely perceptible  next night however the report was more favourable and the third night it was felt that the prospect ahead was becoming hopeful for besides the improvement in shooting two rabbits graced their supper one having been arrested by an almost miraculous bolt when bolting the other having been caught unintentionally by a stone similar to that which brought down the giant of gath  the fact that skill had nothing to do with the procuring of either did not in the least detract from the enjoyment with which they consumed both  nothing is denied they say to welldirected labour and nothing can be done without it  like most of the worlds maxims this is a partially erroneous statement for many things are denied to welldirected labour and sometimes amazing success is accorded to illdirected and blundering efforts  still what truth does exist in the saying was verified by our three friends for after two weeks of unremitting unwearied persistent labour each labourer succeeded in raising enormous blisters on two fingers of his right hand and in hitting objects the size of a swan six times out of ten at a reasonable distance  having arrived at this state of proficiency with their weapons they resumed their journey fortified with a hearty breakfast the foundation of which was fish the superstructure willowgrouse interspersed with rabbit and the apex plover  not long after that the first deer was shot  it occurred thus  they were walking one beautiful morning slowly along one of the numerous deertracks of which we have already made mention and were approaching the summit of a ridge at the very time that a herd of deer headed by a noble stag were ascending the same ridge from the opposite side  the little air that moved was blowing in the right directionfrom the deer towards the travellers  as they topped the ridge about the same instant the two parties stood suddenly face to face and it would be difficult to determine which party looked most amazed  facility in fitting arrows etcetera had been acquired by that time the hunters were ready in a couple of seconds  the deer recovering wheeled about but before they could take the first bound burr twang and whizz sounded in their ears  the stone struck an antler of the stag the arrow pierced his flank the bolt quivered in his heart and the monarch of the woods leaping wildly into the air fell dead upon the ground  well done master trench shouted paul with a hearty cheer  as for oliver he uttered a squeal of delight threw an uncontrollable somersault and landed sittingwise on a bed of soft moss  this was a tremendous triumph and source of jubilation and it soon became obvious to each that the other two had a hard struggle to keep their expressions of satisfaction within the limits of moderation for not only had they now obtained the crowning evidence of their skill but they were provided with a supply of meat which if properly dried would furnish them with food for many days to come  it was a striking and picturesque though perhaps not an agreeable sight to witness the party that night in the ruddy light of the campfire with sleeves rolled to the shoulders and bloody knives in hands operating on the carcase of the deer and it was several hours past their usual suppertime before they felt themselves at liberty to sit down on a bed of sprucefir branches and enjoy the luxury of rest and food  next day while proceeding slowly through the woods chatting merrily over the incidents of the previous day a sudden silence fell upon them for out of the thick shrubbery there stalked a tall noblelooking man of middle age  he was dressed in the garb of a hunter  long yellow curls hung on his shoulders and a heavy beard and moustache of the same colour concealed the lower part of a bronzed and handsome countenance his bright blue eyes seemed to sparkle with good humour as he gazed inquiringly yet sadly at the astonished faces of the three travellers    chapter nine  their new acquaintance becomes interested and practical  the tall stranger who had thus suddenly presented himself bore so strong a resemblance to the vikings of old that paul burns who was familiar with tales and legends about the ancient searovers felt stealing over him at the first glance a sensation somewhat akin to awe for it seemed as if one of the seakings had actually risen from his grave to visit them  this feeling was succeeded however by one of intense surprise when the stranger addressed them in the english tongue  i thought years ago he said that i had seen the last of white faces  it immediately occurred to oliver trench that as their faces were by that time deeply embrowned by the sun the stranger must be in a bantering mood but neither he nor his companions replied  they were too much astonished to speak or even move and waited for more  this is not a land where the men whose ruling ideas seem to be war and gold are likely to find what they want continued the stranger somewhat sternly  whence come ye  are you alone or only the advanceguard of the bloodthirsty race  there was something so commanding as well as courtly in the tone and bearing of this extraordinary man that paul half involuntarily removed his cap as he replied  forgive me sir if astonishment at your sudden appearance has made me appear rude  will you sit down beside us and share our meal while i answer your questions  with a quiet air and slight smile the stranger accepted the invitation and listened with profound interest to paul as he gave a brief outline of the wreck of the water wagtail the landing of the crew the mutinous conduct of big swinton and his comrades and the subsequent adventures and wanderings of himself master trench and oliver  your voices are like the echoes of an old old song said the stranger in a low sad voice when the narrative was concluded  it is many years since i heard my native tongue from english lips  i had forgotten it ere now if i had not taken special means to keep it in mind  and pray good sir said paul may i ask how it happens that we should find an englishman in this almost unheardof wilderness  to tell you the truth my first impression on seeing you was that you were the ghost of an ancient seaking  i am the ghost of my former self returned the stranger and you are not far wrong about the seakings for i am in very truth a descendant of those rovers who carried death and destruction round the world in ancient times  war and goldor what gold representswere their gods in those days  it seems to me said captain trench at last joining in the conversation that if you were in old england just now or any other part of europe youd say that war and gold are as much worshipped nowadays as they ever were in the days of old  if you add love and wine to the catalogue said paul you have pretty much the motive powers that have swayed the world since the fall of man but tell us friend how you came to be here all alone  not nownot now replied the stranger hurriedly and with a sudden gleam in his blue eyes that told of latent power and passion under his calm exterior  when we are better acquainted perhaps you shall know at present it is enough to say that i have been a wanderer on the face of the earth for many years  for the last ten years my home has been in this wilderness  my native land is one of those rugged isles which form the advanceguard of scotland in the northern ocean  but are you quite alone here asked captain trench with increasing interest  not quite alone  one woman has had pity on me and shares my solitude we dwell with our children on an island in a great lake to which i will conduct you if you will accept my hospitality  red men have often visited me there but i had thought that the face of a white man would never more grieve my sight  is then the face of the white man so distasteful to you asked paul  it was but some change must have come over me for while i hold converse with you the old hatred seems melting away  if i had met you eight or ten years ago i verily believe that i would have killed you all in cold blood but now  he stopped abruptly and gazed into the flames of the campfire with a grave almost tender air that seemed greatly at variance with his last murderous remark  however the feeling is past and goneit is dead he presently resumed with a toss of his head which sent the yellow curls back and appeared at the same time to cast unpleasant memories behind him and i am now glad to see and welcome you though i cannot help grieving that the white race has discovered my lonely island  they might have discovered it long ago if they had only kept their ears open  is it a big island thennot a cluster of islands asked trench eagerly  yes it is a large island and there is a great continent of unknown extent to the westward of it  but what do you mean stranger by saying that it might have been discovered long ago if people had kept their ears open asked paul it is well known that only a few years ago a seacaptain named columbus discovered the great continent of which you speak and that so recently as the year 1497 the bold mariner john cabot with his son sebastian discovered these islands which they have named newfoundland  the stranger listened with evident interest not unmingled with surprise to this  of columbus and cabot i have never heard he replied having had no intercourse with the civilised world for twenty years  i knew of this island and dwelt on it long before the time you say that cabot came but that reminds me that once on returning from a hunting expedition into the interior it was reported to me by indians that a giant canoe had been seen off the coast  that may have been cabots ship  as to columbus my forefathers discovered the great continent lying to the west of this about five hundred years before he could have been born when i was a boy my father whose memory was stored with innumerable scraps of the old viking sagas or stories used to tell me about the discovery of vinland by the norsemen which is just the land that seems to have been rediscovered by columbus and cabot  my father used to say that many of the written sagas were believed to exist among the colonists of iceland  i know not  it is long since my thoughts ceased to be troubled by such matters but what you tell me has opened up the floodgates of old memories that i had thought were dead and buried for ever  all that day the strange hunter accompanied them and encamped with them at night  next morning he resumed with everincreasing interest the conversation which had been interrupted by the necessity of taking rest it was evident that his heart was powerfully stirred not so much by the news which he received as by the old thoughts and feelings that had been revived  he was very sociable and among other things showed his new friends how to slice and dry their venison so as to keep it fresh and make it convenient for carriage  but you wont require to carry much with you he explained for the country swarms with living creatures at all timesespecially just now  on this head he gave them so much information particularly as to the habits and characteristics of birds beasts and fishes that pauls naturalhistoric enthusiasm was aroused and oliver who had hitherto concerned himself exclusively with the uses to which wild animals might be appliedin the way of bonepoints for arrows twisted sinews for bowstrings flesh for the pot and furs for garmentsbegan to feel considerable curiosity as to what the creatures did when at home and why they did it  if we could only find out what they think about he remarked to the hunter we might become quite sociable together  what it was in this not very remarkable speech that interested their new friend we cannot tell but certain it is that from the time it was uttered he took greater interest in the boy and addressed many of his remarks and explanations to him  there was a species of dignity about this strange being which prevented undue familiarity either with or by him hence he always addressed the boy by his full name and never condescended to olly  the name by which he himself chose to be called was hendrick but whether that was a real or assumed name of course they had no means of knowing  continuing to advance through a most beautiful country the party came at last to a river of considerable size and depth up the banks of which they travelled for several days  hendrick had by tacit agreement assumed the leadership of the party because being intimately acquainted with the land both as to its character form and resources he was naturally fitted to be their guide  it seems to me said captain trench as they sat down to rest one afternoon on a sunny bank by the river sideout of which olly had just pulled a magnificent troutthat the climate of this island has been grossly misrepresented  the report was brought to us that it was a wild barren land always enveloped in thick fogs whereas although i am bound to say we found fogs enough on the coast we have found nothing but beauty sunshine and fertility in the interior  does not this arise from the tendency of mankind to found and form opinions on insufficient knowledge said hendrick  even the indians among whom i dwell are prone to this error  if your discoverer cabot had dwelt as many years as i have in this great island he would have told you that it has a splendid climate and is admirably adapted for the abode of man  just look around youthe region which extends from your feet to the horizon in all directions is watered as you see by lakes and rivers which swarm with fish and are alive with wildfowl the woods which are largely composed of magnificent and useful trees give shelter to myriads of animals suitable for food to man the soil is excellent and the grazing lands would maintain thousands of cattle what more could man desire  nothing more answered paul save the opportunity to utilise it all and the blessing of god upon his efforts  the opportunity to utilise it wont be long of coming now that the facts about it are known or soon to be made known by us remarked trench  im not so sure about that said paul  it is wonderful how slow men are to believe and still more wonderful how slow they are to act  that the captains hopes were not well founded and that pauls doubts were justified is amply proved by the history of newfoundland  at first its character was misunderstood then when its unparalleled codfishing banks were discovered attention was entirely confined to its rugged shores  after that the trade fell into the hands of selfish and unprincipled monopolists who wilfully misrepresented the nature of this island and prevailed on the british government to enact repressive laws which effectually prevented colonisation  then prejudice privileges and error perpetuated the evil state of things so that the true character of the land was not known until the present century its grand interior was not systematically explored till only a few years ago and thus it comes to pass that even at the present day one of the finest islands belonging to the british crownas regards vast portions of its interiorstill remains a beautiful wilderness unused by man  but with this we have nothing at present to do  our business is in spirit to follow hendrick and his friends through that wilderness as it was at the beginning of the sixteenth century  deertracks as we have said were innumerable and along one of those tracks a herd of deer were seen trotting one day about two bowshots from the party  with characteristic eagerness oliver trench hastily let fly an arrow at them  he might as well have let it fly at the polestar  the only effect it had was to startle the deer and send them galloping into the shelter of the woods  what a pity exclaimed oliver  not so my boy remarked his father  experience they say teaches fools and if experience has now taught you that it is foolish to shoot at game out of range you are no fool which is not a pity but matter for congratulation  but what about practice daddy  did you not say only last night that there is nothing like practice to make perfect  true lad but i did not recommend practising at deer beyond range besides you can practise at stumps and stones  but stumps and stones dont afford running shots objected olly  yes they do boy  you can run past the stumps while you shoot and as to stones you can roll them down hill and let fly at them as they roll now clap the hatches on your mouth youre too fond of argument  im only a chip of the ancient tree father retorted the boy with a quiet laugh  how much further this little skirmish might have proceeded we cannot tell for it was brought to an abrupt close by the sudden appearance of a black bear  it was on turning a cliff which bordered the edge of a stream that they came upon the monsterso close to it that they had barely time to get ready their weapons when it rose on its hind legs to attack them  look out yelled oliver who being in advance was the first to see the bear  a stone from his sling was well though hastily aimed for it hit the animal fairly on the nose thereby rendering it particularly angry almost at the same moment a bolt and an arrow flew from the weapons of paul and trench but they flew wide of the mark and there is no saying what the result might have been had not hendrick bent his short but powerful bow and sent an arrow to the feather into the creatures breast  the modern bullet is no doubt more deadly than the ancient arrow nevertheless the latter had some advantages over the former  one of these was that as it transfixed several muscles it tended to hamper the movements of the victim shot  it also drew attention in some degree from the assailant  thus on the present occasion the bear with a savage growl seized the head of the arrow which projected from the wound and wrenched it off  this although little more than a momentary act gave the hunter time to fit and discharge a second arrow which entered the animals throat causing it to fall writhing on the ground while oliver who had gone almost mad with excitement grasped his axe bounded forward and brought it down on bruins skull  well was it for the reckless boy that hendricks arrows had done their work for although his young arm was stout and the axe sharp little impression was made on the hardheaded creature by the blow  hendricks knife however completed the work and despatched the bear  then they all sat down to rest while the hunter set to work to skin the animal    chapter ten  ollys first salmon and hendricks home  from this time forward the opportunities for hunting and fishing became so numerous that poor oliver was kept in a constantly bubblingover condition of excitement and his father had to restrain him a good deal in order to prevent the larder from being greatly overstocked  one afternoon they came to a river which their guide told them was one of the largest in the country  it flows out of the lake on one of the islands of which i have built my home  may i ask said paul with some hesitation if your wife came with you from the shetland isles  a profoundly sad expression flitted across the hunters countenance  no he replied  trueheart as she is named in the micmac tongue is a native of this islandat least her mother was but her father i have been told was a white mana wanderer like myselfwho came in an open boat from no one knows where and cast his lot among the indians one of whom he married  both parents are dead  i never saw them but my wife i think must resemble her white father in many respects  my children are like her  look now oliver he said as if desirous of changing the subject yonder is a pool in which it will be worth while to cast your hook  you will find something larger there than you have yet caught in the smaller streams  get ready  i will find bait for you  olly needed no urging  his codhook and line being always handy were arranged in a few minutes and his friend turning up the sod with a piece of wood soon procured several large worms which were duly impaled until they formed a bunch on the hook  with this the lad hurried eagerly to the edge of a magnificent pool where the oily ripples and curling eddies as well as the great depth effectually concealed the bottom from view  he was about to whirl the bunch of worms round his head preparatory to a grand heave when he was arrested by the guide  stay oliver you will need a rod for this river  without one you will be apt to lose your fish  i will cut one  so saying he went into the woods that bordered the pool and soon returned with what seemed to the boy to be a small tree about fourteen feet long  why hendrick do you take me for goliath who as paul burns tells us was brought down by a stone from the sling of david  ill never be able to fish with that  oliver returned the hunter gravely as he continued the peeling of the bark from the rod a lad with strong limbs and a stout heart should never use the words not able till he has tried  i have seen many promising and goodly young men come to wreck because i cant was too often on their lips  you never know what you can do till you try  the boy listened to this reproof with a slight feeling of displeasure for he felt in his heart that he was not one of those lazy fellows to whom his friend referred  however he wisely said nothing but hendrick observed with some amusement that his brow flushed and his lips were firmly compressed  there now he said in a cheery tone being anxious to remove the impression he had made you will find the rod is lighter than it looks and supple as you see  we will tie your line halfway down and run it through a loop at the endsoto prevent its being lost if the point should break  now try to cast your hook into the spot yonder where a curl in the water meets and battles with an eddy  do you see it  yes i see it replied olly advancing to the pool with the rod grasped in both hands  it would be better continued hendrick if you could cast out into the stream beyond but the line is too short for that unless you could jump on to that big rock in the rapid which is impossible with the river so high  oliver looked at the rock referred to  it stood up in the midst of foaming water full twenty feet from the bank  he knew that he might as well try to jump over the moon as attempt to leap upon that rock nevertheless without a moments hesitation he rushed down the bank sprang furiously off cleared considerably more than half the distance and disappeared in the foaming flood  hendrick was suddenly changed from a slow and sedate elephant into an agile panther  he sprang along the bank to a point lower down the stream and was up to the waist in the water before olly reached the pointstruggling to keep his head above the surface and at the same time to hold on to his rod  hendrick caught him by the collar and dragged him panting to land  paul and his father had each with a shout of surprise or alarm rushed for the same point but they would have been too late  olly my son said trench in a remonstrative tone have you gone mad  no father i knew that i could not jump it but ive been advised never to say so till i have tried  nay oliver be just said the guide with a laugh  i did truly advise you never to say i cant till you had tried but i never told you to try the impossible  however i am not sorry you did this for id rather see a boy try and fail than see him fail because of unwillingness to try  come now i will show you something else to try  he took oliver up the stream a few yards and pointed to a ledge of rock more than kneedeep under water which communicated with the rock he had failed to reach  the ledge is narrow he said and the current crossing it is strong but from what ive seen of you i think you will manage to wade out if you go cautiously and dont lose heart  i will go down stream again so that if you should slip ill be ready to rescue  boldly did oliver step out upon the ledge cautiously did he advance each foot until he was more than legdeep and wildly like an insane semaphore did he wave his arms as well as the heavy rod in his frantic efforts not to lose his balance  at last he planted his feet with a cheer of triumph on the rock  hush olly youll frighten the fish cried paul with feigned anxiety  youll tumble in again if you dont mind said his cautious father  but olly heard not  the whole of his little soul was centred on the oily pool into which he had just cast the bunch of worms  another moment and the stout rod was almost wrenched from his grasp  have a care  hold on  stand fast saluted him in various keys from the bank  a cod or a whale was the response from the rock  more likely a salmon remarked hendrick in an undertone while a sober smile lit up his features  at the moment a magnificent salmon not less than twenty pounds weight leapt like a bar of silver from the flood and fell back with a mighty splash  the leap caused a momentary and sudden removal of the strain on the rod oliver staggered slipped and fell with a yell that told of anxiety more than alarm but he got up smartly still holding on by both hands  in fishing with the tapering rods and rattling reels of modern days fishers never become fully aware of the strength of salmon unless indeed a hitch in their line occurs and everything snaps  it was otherwise about the beginning of the sixteenth century  it is otherwise still with primitive fishers everywhere  olivers line could not run his rod was rigid save at the point  the result was that it was all he could do to stand and hold on to his captive  the rod bent down into the water sprang up to the perpendicular flew hither and thither jerked and quivered causing the poor boy to jerk and quiver in irresistible sympathy  at last a mighty rush of the fish drew the fisher headlong into the flood  hell be drowned or killed on the boulders below gasped his father running wildly down the bank of the river  dont fear said hendrick as he ran beside him  there is a shallow just above the boulders  we will stop him there  paul burns was already abreast of the shallow in question and oliver was stranded on it but a deep rapid stream ran between it and the bank so that paul hesitated and looked eagerly about for the best spot to cross  follow me cried hendrick i know the ford  he led his comrade swiftly to a point where the river widened and became shallow enabling them to wade to the tail of the bank at the top of which oliver stood engaged in a double strugglewith the water that hissed and leaped around him and the fish that still surged wildly about in its vain efforts to escape  as the three men waded nearer to him they got into shallower water and then perceived that the boy had not lost his selfpossession but was still tightly grasping the butt of his rod  just as they came up the salmon in its blind terror ran straight against the boys legs  olly fell upon it let go the rod and embraced it  happily his friends reached him at the moment else the water that rushed over his head would have compelled him to let goor die  paul lifted him up  the great fish struggled in its captors arms  it was slippery as an eel and its strength tremendous  no digging of his ten nails into it was of any use  slowly but surely it was wriggling out of his tight embrace when hendrick inserted his great thumbs into its gills and grasped it round the throat  let go oliver he said ive got him safe  but olly would not let go  indeed in the state of his mind and body at the moment it is probable that he could not let go  his father having made some ineffectual attempts to clear the line with which and the rod they had got completely entangled was obliged to stand by and see that the entanglement became no worse  thus holding on each to the other and all together they staggered slowly and safely to land with their beautiful prize  are there many fish like that in these rivers asked paul as they all stood contemplating the salmon and recovering breath  ay thousands of them in all the rivers and the rivers are numerous some of them large replied hendrick  this will be a great country some day you take my word for it said the captain in a dogmatic manner which was peculiar to him when he attempted amateur prophecy  that prophecy however like many other prophecies has been only partly fulfilled  it has come true indeed that newfoundland now possesses the most valuable codfishery in the world and that her exports of salmon are considerable but as to her being a great countrywell that still remains unfulfilled prophecy for owing to no fault of her people but to the evils of monopoly and selfishness as we have already said her career has been severely checked  not many days after the catching of the salmonwhich remained a memorable point in the career of oliver trenchthe explorers were led by hendrick to the shores of a magnificent lake  it was so large that the captain at first doubted whether it was not the great ocean itself  it is not the sea said their guide as he surveyed the watery expanse with evident enthusiasm  it is a lake full fifty miles long yet it is not the largest lake in this island  taste its waters and you will find them sweet  here he added with a look of gratification is my home  god has given you a wide domain said paul gazing with pleasure on the verdant islets with which the bay before him was studded  yet i cannot help thinking that it is a waste of ones life to spend it in a solitude however beautiful when the sorrowing and the suffering world around us calls for the active energies of all good men  the hunter seemed to ponder pauls words  it appears to me he said at last that our creator meant us to serve him by making ourselves and those around us happy  i have to do so here and in some degree have succeeded  as he spoke he raised both hands to his mouth and gave vent to a prolonged halloo that swept out over the calm waters of the bay  it was quickly replied to by a shrill cry and in a few minutes a canoe emerging from one of the islets was seen paddling swiftly towards them    chapter eleven  the hunters home  the canoe which approached the shores of the lake where our explorers stood was a large one built after the fashion of the coracle of the ancient britons namely with a frame of wickerwork covered with deerskin  it was propelled with paddles by a woman seated in the stern and a little girl in the bow  my wife is a woman of forethought remarked hendrick with a pleased expression  seeing that we are a large party she has not only brought our largest canoe but has made oscar get out the small one  he pointed to the island from a creek in which a little canoe of a reddish colour was seen to issue  it was made of birchbark and was propelled by a small boy who seemed from his exertions to be in urgent haste to overtake the other craft  your son i suppose said paul  yes my eldest  his younger brother is but a babe yet  these with my daughter goodred and my wife trueheart who are now approaching constitute the family which god has given to me  a feeling of satisfaction filled the heart of paul burns as he listened to the last words for they proved that their new friend was not among those who deem it weakness or hypocrisy in men to openly acknowledge their maker as the giver of all that they possess  this feeling was merged in one of surprise when the canoe touched the shore and an exceedingly pretty child with fair complexion blue eyes and curling hair stepped lightly out and ran to her father who stooped to kiss her on the cheek  hendrick was not demonstrative that was evident neither was his wife nor his child  whatever depth of feeling they possessed the surface ran smooth  yet there was an air of quiet gladness about the meeting which enabled paul to understand what the hunter meant when in a former conversation he had said that he made those around him happy  is baby well he asked quickly  yes father quite well and i very sure wishing much that you come home soon  you been long time away  longer than i expected goodred  and i have brought friends with me he added turning to his wife  friends whom i have found in the forest trueheart  you friends be welcome said trueheart with a modest yet selfpossessed air  the woman who advanced and held out a small hand to be shaken in european fashion was obviously of indian extraction yet her brown hair refined cast of features and easy manner showed as obviously the characteristics of her white father  though not nearly so fair as her child she was still far removed from the deep colour of her mothers race  before more could be said on either side the enthusiastic youngster in the bark canoe leaped ashore burst into the midst of the group with a cheer and began wildly to embrace one of his fathers huge legs which was about as much of his person as he could conveniently grasp  he was a miniature hendrick clad in leather from top to toe  the whole party now entered the canoes skimmed over the lake and past the wooded islets towards the particular island which the hunter called home  it was as romantic a spot as one could desire for a residence  though only a quarter of a mile or so in diameter the island which was composed of granite was wonderfully diversified in form and character there was a little cove which formed a harbour for the hunters canoes bordering it was a patch of open ground backed by shrubs above which rose a miniature precipice  the ground in the centre of the isle was ruggedas the captain remarked quite mountainous in a small way hendrick had taught his children to call it the mountain and in the midst of its miniature fastnesses he had arranged a sort of citadel to which he and his family could retire in case of attack from savages one peak of this mountainette rose in naked grandeur to a height of about fifty feet above the lake  elsewhere the islet was wooded to the waters edge with spruce and birchtrees in some places fringed with willows  on a few open patches were multitudes of ripe berries which here and there seemed literally to cover the ground with a carpet of bright red  on the open ground or lawn beside the cove stood the hunters hut a small structure of rounded logs with a door on either side of which was a window  from those glassless windows there was a view of lake and isles and distant woods with purple mountains beyond which formed a scene of indescribable beauty  close to the door forming as it were a porch to it there stood a semicircular erection of poles covered with birchbark and deerskins in front of which blazed the household fire with a tripod over it and a bubbling earthen pot hanging therefrom  around the inner side of the fire under the semicircular tent were spread a number of deerskins to serve as couches  on one of these sat an indian woman with the family babe in her arms  it was a wonderful babe and obviously a wise one for it knew its own father directly stretched out its little arms and shouted for instant recognition  nor had it to shout long for hendrick being fond of it and regardless of appearances seized it in his arms and smothered it in his beard out of which retreat crows and squalls of satisfaction thereafter issued  excuse me friends said hendrick at last delivering the child to its mother  i have been absent on a visit to my wifes relations and have not seen little ian for a long time  sit down and we will see what cheer the pot contains  i dont ask you to enter the hut because while the weather is mild it is pleasanter outside  when winter comes we make more use of the house  my wife you see does not like it having been accustomed to tents all her life  but meilikes it when the snow fall said trueheart looking up with a bright smile from the pot into which she had previously been making investigations  truetrue  i think you like whatever i like at least you try to returned the hunter as he sat down and began to tie the feathers on the head of an arrow  you even try to speak good grammar for my sake  trueheart laughed and continued her culinary duties  you told us when we first met said captain trench who had made himself comfortable on a deerskin beside the baby that you had taken special means not to forget your native tongue  do i guess rightly in supposing that the teaching of it to your wife and children was the means  you are right captain  of course the language of the micmac indians is more familiar and agreeable to trueheart but she is obstinate though a good creature on the whole and insists on speaking english as you hear  another little laugh in the vicinity of the earthen pot showed that his wife appreciated the remark  meanwhile goodred busied herself in preparing venison steaks over the same fire and oscar undertook to roast marrow bones for the whole party as well as to instruct oliver trench in that delicate operation  while they were thus engaged the shades of evening gradually descended on the scene but that did not interfere with their enjoyment for by heaping fresh resinous logs on the fire they produced a ruddy light which seemed scarcely inferior to that of day a light which glowed on the pretty and pleasant features of the wife and daughter as they moved about placing plates of birchbark before the guests and ladling soup and viands into trenchers of the same  savoury smells floated on the air and gradually expelled the scent of shrub and flower from the banquetinghall  truly it was a right royal banquet fit for a kingif not too particular a kingto say nothing of its being spread before one who was monarch of all he surveyed and served by his queen and princess  there was first of all soup of excellent quality  then followed boiled salmon and roast seatrout  next came a course of boiled venison fat and juicy with an alternative of steaks and grilled ribs this was followed by what may be styled a haunch of beaver accompanied by the animals taila prime delicacyin regard to which captain trench with his mouth full of it said  this is excellent eatin master hendrick  what may it beif i may presume to ask  beavers tail replied the hunter  dear me exclaimed olly withdrawing a roast rib from his mouth for the purpose of speech beavers seem to have wonderfully broad and flat tails  they have oliver and if you will try a bit you will find that their tails are wonderfully good  oliver tried and admitted that it was good then observing that little oscar had just finished his fourth venison steak he politely handed him the trencher  the greasyfingered boy gravely helped himself to number five and assailed it as if he had only just begun to terminate a long fast  there were no vegetables at that feast and instead of bread they had cakes of hard deersfat with scraps of suet toasted brown intermixed a species of plumcake which was greatly relished by the visitors  at the last when repletion seemed imminent they finished off with marrow bones  with these they trifled far on into the night  of course as the demands of appetite abated the flow of soul began  i see neither nets hooks nor lines about the camp hendrick said paul burns after the queen and princess had retired into the hut for the night  how do you manage to catch salmon  the hunter replied by pointing to a spear somewhat resembling neptunes trident which stood against a neighbouring tree  we spear them by torchlight he said  oscar is a pretty good hand at it now  you live well master hendrick remarked trench raising a bark flagon to his lips and tossing off a pint of venison soup with the memory of pots of ale strong upon him  do you ever have a scarcity of food  never for the country as you have seen swarms with game  we dry the flesh of deer otter martens and muskrats and store it for winter and during that season we have willowgrouse and rabbits for fresh meat besides in autumn we freeze both flesh and fish and thus keep it fresh till spring at which time the wildfowl return to us  the skins and furs of these creatures furnish us with plenty of clothingin fact more than we can use  the question sometimes comes into my mind why did the great father provide such abundance for the use of man without sending men to use itfor the few micmacs who dwell in the land are but as a drop in the ocean and they totally neglect some things while they waste others  i have seen them slaughter thousands of deer merely for the sake of their tongues and other titbits  there is much of mystery connected with that master hendrick which we cannot clear up remarked trench  mystery there is no doubt said paul quickly  yet there are some things about it that are plain enough to those who choose to look  the word of god which by the way is beginning to be circulated now among us in england in our mother tongue that word tells man plainly to go forth and replenish the earth  common sense from the beginning of time has told us the same thing but what does man do  he sticks to several small patches of the earth and there he trades and works and builds and propagates until these patches swarm like anthills and then he wars and fights and kills off the surplus population in other words slays the young men of the world and sows misery debt and desolation broadcast  in fact man seems to me to be mad  rather than obey god and the dictates of common sense he will leave the fairest portions of the world untenanted and waste his life and energies in toiling for a crust of bread or fighting for a foot of land  some such thoughts have passed through my mind said hendrick thoughtfully when i have remembered that my ancestors as i have told you discovered this land as well as that which lies to the west and south of it long before this columbus you speak of was born  but surely we may now expect that with all our modern appliances and knowledge the earth will soon be overrun and peopled  i dont feel very sanguine about it said paul with a prophetic shake of the head  that paul was justified in his doubts must be obvious to every reader who is aware of the fact that in the present year of grace 1889 there are millions of the worlds fair and fertile acres still left untenanted and almost untrodden by the foot of man  its my opinion remarked captain trench with a blink of the eyes induced possibly by wisdom and partly by sleep that you two are talking nonsense on a subject which is quite beyond the reach of mans intellect  it may be so replied paul with a laugh which merged into a yawn and perhaps it would be wiser that we should go to rest  olly and oscar have already set us a good example  what say you hendrick  as you please answered the polite hunter  i am ready either to sleep or to converse  then i will not tax your goodnature  we will seek repose  but what of our future movements  my sleep will be sounder if i could lie down with the assurance that you will continue to be our guide into the fertile interior of which you have said so much  i will go with you returned hendrick after a few moments thought but i must ask you to spend a few days in my camp to rest yourselves while i provide a supply of fresh meat and fish for my family for willing and able though oscar is to provide for them he is yet too young to have the duty laid upon his little shoulders  this having been satisfactorily settled the captain and paul wrapped themselves in deerskin blankets and lay down with their feet to the fire  hendrick having heaped a fresh supply of fuel on the embers followed their example and the camp was soon buried in profound silence    chapter twelve  a surprise a fight and a war party  at this point in our tale we might profitably turn aside for a little to dilate upon the interestingnot to say excitingproceedings of our explorers and the hunters family during the few days spent in the island home and its neighbourhood were it not that incidents of a more stirring and important nature claim our attention  we might if time and space permitted tell how they all went fishing in the lake with olivers codhooks which were of course greatly superior to the bonehooks which hendrick had been accustomed to manufacture how they went salmonspearing by torchlight in a neighbouring stream in which operation oliver soon became as expert as his entertainers and even more enthusiastic insomuch that he several times met what seemed to be his ordinary fatea ducking in the water how in consequence he caught a bad cold as well as fish and was compelled to lie up and be nursed for several days during which time of forced inaction he learned to appreciate the excellent nursing qualities of trueheart and her daughter goodred  he also learned to estimate at its true value the yelling power of the family baby whose will was iron and whose lungs were leather besides being inflated by the fresh wholesome air of the grand wilderness  we might tell of the short but thrilling expeditions undertaken by the men and boys in pursuit of bears otters beaver and deer in which hendrick displayed the certainty of his deadly aim and master trench the uncertainty of his dreadful shooting despite all his former practice  we might relate the interesting stories anecdotes and narratives with which the explorers and the hunter sought to beguile the pleasant periods that used to follow supper and precede repose and describe the tremendous energy of paul burns in springing to the rescue of the selfwilled baby when it fell into the fire and the cool courage of oliver trench in succouring the same baby when it tumbled into the water  all this we might dilate on and a great deal moresuch as the great friendship struck up between oscar and oliver and the intense interest expressed by hendrick on finding that his friend paul possessed a manuscript copy of the gospel of john and the frequent perusals of that gospel over the campfire and the discussions that followed on the great subjects of mans duty the souls destiny and the love of god as shown in and by jesus christbut over all this we must unwillingly draw a curtain and leave it to the courteous readers imagination while we pass on to subjects which bear more directly on the issues of our tale  one day some time after leaving hendricks camp on the great lake captain trench and his son with paul burns and the hunter halted to rest on the summit of a cliff from which they could obtain a magnificent view of the country lying beyond  they had by that time passed over the rich grassland with its parklike plains its lakes and streams and belts of woodland and had entered upon that mountainous region which lies towards the southwesterly portion of the island  hendrick said paul as he gazed with admiration on the wild scene before him i have now seen enough to know that this land is most suitable for the abode of man  the soil is admirable the woods contain magnificent timber fish flesh and fowl are plentiful coal exists in i should think extensive fields while there are indications in many places of great mineral wealth especially copper  besides this the land you tell me is pierced by innumerable bays inlets fords and natural harbours and to crown all the climate except on some parts of the coast is exceedingly good  now it seems to me that these facts ought to be made known in england and that our king should not only take possession but should send out colonists to settle all over this island and develop its resources  if permitted it will be my part to finish this exploration and carry home the news  hendrick did not reply for a few minutes then a faint sigh escaped him as he replied  no doubt what you say is just and i doubt not that these plains and hills will one day resound with the activities of civilised life the plough will obliterate the deertracks the axe will lay low the forests and the lowing of cattle and the bark of dogs will replace the trumpeting of the wildgoose and the cry of plover but when the change begins to come i will strike my tent and go to the great unknown lands of the west for i cannot bear the clatter and the strife of men  paul was about to reply when an arrow whizzed through the air pierced the sleeve of his coat scratched his left arm slightly as it passed and quivered in a tree behind them  leaping up each member of the party sprang for shelter behind a neighbouring tree  at the same moment there arose a terrible cry as of men rushing to attack each other  the form of the ground prevented our travellers from seeing the combatants though the sound of their strife proved them to be close at hand  suddenly hendrick left the tree behind which he had taken shelter and running towards a precipitous bank or cliff called to his companions to follow  they obeyed at once  i fear he said as paul ran up alongside of him that i know the meaning of this  some of the voices sound familiar to me  that arrow was not i think discharged at us  we shall be wanted here  may i count on you  you may said paul  i cannot doubt that your cause must be a just one  im with you exclaimed master trench plucking the hatchet from his sons belta weapon that the youngster could well spare as the bludgeon and the bow were still left to him  hendrick had spoken in quick sharp tones for he was evidently much excited  on reaching the crest of a rising ground he looked cautiously over it  as i thought he said my wifes relations are attacked by savages from labrador  come follow me  he ran swiftly round the base of the rising ground not giving his comrades time even to see the combatants to whom he referred  suddenly they came in full sight of perhaps the most terrible sight that our fallen world can presenttwo bands of armed men mad with rage engaged in the fiendish work of butchering each other  in the immediate foreground two powerful indians were struggling each to plant a short spear in the others heart  one who was shorter than the other but equally powerful was making a desperate effort to wrench his right hand from his foes grasp and another foe was on the point of stabbing the short man in the back when the white men appeared on the scene  paul the captain and oliver although ready with arrow and bolt hesitated for they knew not which to regard as foes and which as friends  no such difficulty however interfered with hendrick who sent an arrow into the brain of the savage who meant to strike from behind  at the same instant the short warrior succeeded in his effort his spear flashed upwards and the next moment his tall enemy fell to rise no more  hendrick who seemed to have been transformed into a human tiger rushed to the attack with a shout and a display of fury that for a moment arrested the fight  the short indian whose life he had just saved bestowed on him and his companions one look of surprise and joined him in the rush  captain trench whose combative tendencies were easily aroused joined them with a roar which was somewhat intensified by the fact that he was still a little uncertain as to which was the enemy oliver relieved his overcharged bosom by an involuntary shriek or howl that rose high and shrill above the tumult as he followed suit whirling his bludgeon with some difficulty round his head  the combined effect of all this was to strike terror into the enemy who turning short round fled precipitately and were followed for a considerable distance by some of the victorious indians  on returning from the pursuit hendrick introduced the short indian as his wifes cousin who with a party of hunters had been out for a supply of fresh meat when attacked by the labrador savages  it is an old feud remarked hendrick as he and paul sat a little apart that evening while their comrades assisted the indians to prepare supper an old feud  oh warwar  there is no place of rest from it i fear in this world  the hunters tone was so sad that paul looked at him inquiringly  you are surprised said his companion that i should long thus for escape from the warring passions of men but if you knew what reason i have for hating war you would not wonder  listen  many years ago i went with my wife and child to visit a kinsman in the scottish highlands  i need scarcely tell you that it was not my present wife and child  she was young fair faultless in person and disposition  our little daughter resembled her in all respects  there chanced to be a miserable feud existing between my relative and a neighbouring chief it originated in some disputed boundary and always smouldered like a subdued volcano but occasionally broke forth in open warfare  at the time of my visit my kinsman who was a bachelor had gone to transact some business at a town not far distant leaving a message for me to follow him as he required my assistance in some family arrangements and meant to return home the same night  i went leaving my wife and child in the castle  that very night my kinsmans foeknowing nothing of my arrivalcame to the castle took the small body of defenders by surprise overcame them and set the place on fire  fiendish and revengeful though the marauders were i believe they would not wantonly have murdered the helpless ones had they known of their being in the place but they knew it not until too late  when we returned that night the castle was a black smoking ruin and my wife and little one had perished  can you wonder that i fled from the horrible spot that i left my native land for ever and that i shudder at the very thought of strife  nay brother i wonder not said paul in a sympathetic tone but i fear there is no region on the face of this earth where the terrible warspirit or rather warfiend is not alive  why the man whose life i took this very day resumed hendrick clenching his right hand almost fiercely has doubtless left a woman at home who is now a widow and it may be children whom i have rendered fatherless  no restno rest anywhere from this constant slaying of our fellowmen yet i was forced to do it to save the life of my wifes kinsman  oh is there no deliverance no hope for this poor world  hendrick said paul laying his hand impressively on his friends arm there is deliverancethere is hope  see here  he pulled out the manuscript gospel as he spoke and turning over the wellthumbed leaves read the words  jesus saith  a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another  let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me  in my fathers house are many mansions  hendrick this same jesus who is immanuel god with us has said come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest  him that cometh unto me i will in no wise cast out  these latter words are not here but they are in other scriptures which i have often heard read  but how shall i know said the hunter earnestly that these words are truethat they are the words of god  for some time paul made no reply then suddenly to the surprise of his friend he looked upwards and in a low voice said  o holy spirit of god convince my friend that these words are thine in jesus name  then turning to the hunter he continued come let us examine this writing together  something of this have i heard before said hendrick and as i thirst for light and truth i will gladly examine it with you  need we say that those two earnest men were soon engrossed in the study of the word and that the interruption of the evening meal did not prevent them from afterwards poring over the manuscript far into the night by the light of the campfire  hendrick was well able to do so for like paul he had received a better education than fell to the lot of most men in those days  at first captain trench and his son had listened to the conversation and discussion of the students with much interest and the sturdy matteroffact mariner even ventured to put one or two puzzling questions to them but by degrees their interest flagged and at last taking example by the indians they rolled themselves in deerskin robes and sought repose  continuing their journey next day they were about to part from their indian friends on the mountain ridge from which a view of the western ocean could be obtained when they observed a band of indians in the far distance travelling eastward  on the warpath suggested hendrick  after a prolonged gaze the kinsman of trueheart came to the same conclusion and said he felt sure that they were not from labrador but were evidently men of the island  can you guess what they are going to do asked hendrick  the indian shook his head solemnly  no he did not knowhe could not guess and as they were separated by some miles of valleys precipices and mountain gorges there was no possibility of finding out  after some time spent in speculation and guessing as to the intention of the war party our explorers bidding farewell to their red friends proceeded on their journey while the latter diverged to the southward and continued their hunt after fresh meat  if paul burns and his friends had known the purpose of the warriors whom they had just seen it is probable that they might not have slept quite as soundly as they did that night under the greenwood trees    chapter thirteen  unlookedfor interruptions and difficulties  no elaborate dissertation is needed to prove that we are ignorant of what the morrow may bring forth and that the bestlaid plans of men are at all times subject to dislocation  it is sufficient here to state that immediately after parting from the indians paul burns and captain trench had their plans and hopes in regard to exploration overturned in a sudden and effective though exceedingly simple manner  on the evening of the day on which their travels were resumed they halted sooner than usual in order to have time to form their camp with some care for the weather had suddenly become cold and that night seemed particularly threatening  accordingly they selected a spot surrounded by dense bushes canopied by the branches of a widespreading firtree and backed by a precipitous cliff which afforded complete shelter from a sharp norwest gale that was blowing at the time  in this calm retreat they erected a roughandready wall of birchbark and branches which enclosed them on all sides except one where a glorious fire was kindleda fire that would have roasted anything from a tomtit to an ox and the roaring flames of which had to be occasionally subdued lest they should roast the whole encampment  there saturated so to speak with ruddy light and warmth they revelled in the enjoyment of a hearty meal and social intercourse until the claims of tired nature subdued captain trench and oliver leaving paul and hendrick to resume their eager and sometimes argumentative perusal of the gospel according to john  at last they also succumbed to the irresistible influences of nature and lay down beside their fellows  then it was that natureas if she had only waited for the opportunitybegan to unfold her little game for overturning the sleepers plans  she quietly opened her storehouse of northern clouds and silently dropped upon them a heavy shower of snow  it was early in the season for such a shower consequently the flakes were large  had the cold been excessive the flakes would have been small  as it was they covered the landscape by imperceptible but rapid degrees until everything turned from ghostly grey to ghastly white which had the effect of lighting somehow the darkness of the night  but in the midst of the effective though silent transformation the camp of our explorers remained unchanged and the dying embers of the slowly sinking fire continued to cast their dull red glow on the recumbent forms which were thoroughly protected by the spreading firtree  by degrees the morning light began to flow over the dreary scene and at length it had the effect of rousing oliver trench from slumber  with the innate laziness of youth the lad turned on his other side and was about to settle down to a further spell of sleep when he chanced to wink  that wink sufficed to reveal something that induced another wink then a stare then a start into a sitting posture a rubbing of the eyes an opening of the mouth and a succession of exclamations of which oh hallo  i say and hiiii were among the least impressive  of course every one started up and made a sudden grasp at weapons for the memory of the recent fight was still fresh  winter exclaimed paul and the captain in the same breath  not quite so bad as that remarked hendrick as he stepped out into the snow and began to look round him with an anxious expression but it may nevertheless put an end to your explorations if the snow continues  never a bit ont man exclaimed the captain promptly  what dye think we are to be frightened by a sprinkling of snow  to this hendrick replied only with a gentle smile as he returned and set about blowing up the embers of the fire which were still smouldering  there is more than a sprinkling master trench observed paul as he began to overhaul the remnants of last nights supper but i confess it would be greatly against the grain were we to be beaten at this point in our travels  let us hope that the storm wont last  anyhow we can go on till we cant daddy said oliver with a tremendous yawn and stretch  well said my son as you once truly remarked you are a chip of the ancient log  just so daddy  dont quite finish that marrow bone i want some of it  there you young rascal i leave you the lions share returned the captain throwing the bone in question to his son  but now hendrick what dye really think o this state of things  shall we be forced to give in an bout ship  no one can tell answered the hunter  if the snow stops and the weather gets warm all will be well  if not it will be useless to continue our journeying till winter fairly sets in and the snow becomes deep and the rivers and lakes are frozen  in which case you must come and stay with me in my island home  you are very good hendrick but dont let us talk of givin up till the masts go by the board  we will carry all sail till then said the captain rather gloomily for he felt that the hunter knew best  this first snowfall occurred about the middle of october there was therefore some reasonable prospect that it might melt under an improved state of the weather and there was also the possibility of the fall ceasing and still permitting them to advance  under the impulse of hope derived from these considerations they set forth once more to the westward  the prospect in that direction however was not cheering  mountain succeeded mountain in irregular succession rugged and bleakthe dark precipices and sombre pinewoods looking blacker by contrast with the newlyfallen snow  some of the hills were wooded to their summits others bristling and castellated in outline afforded no hold to the roots of trees and stood out in naked sterility  everywhere the land seemed to have put on its winter garb and all day as they advanced snow continued to fall at intervals so that wading through it became an exhausting labour and olivers immature frame began to suffer though his brave spirit forbade him to complain  that night there came another heavy fall and when they awoke next morning it was found that the country was buried under a carpet of snow full three feet deep  do you admit now master trench that the masts have gone by the board asked paul and that it is impossible to carry sail any longer  i admit nothing returned the captain grumpily  thats right daddy never give in cried oliver but what has master hendrick got to say to it  we must turn in our tracks said the hunter gravely and make for home  home indeed murmured the captain whose mind naturally flew back to old england  if we are to get to any sort of home at all the sooner we set about making sail for it the better  there was something in the captains remark as well as in his tone which caused a slight flush on hendricks brow but he let no expression of feeling escape him  he only said  you are right captain trench  we must set off with the least possible delay  will you and your son start off in advance to get something fresh for breakfast while master paul and i remain to pack up and bring on our camp equipage  hunters you know should travel lightwe will do the heavy work for you  the captain was surprised but replied at once  most gladly master hendrick will i do your bidding but as we dont know what course to steer wont we be apt to go astray  there is no fear of that captain  see you yonder bluff with the bush on the top of it  where away master hendrick  dye mean the one lyin to windard o that cliff shaped like the side of a dutch galliot  the same  it is not more than a quarter of a mile offmake straight for that  youll be sure to fall in with game of some sort between this and that  wait there till we come up for we shall breakfast there you can keep yourself warm by cutting wood and kindling a fire  rather pleased than otherwise with this little bit of pioneer work that had been given him to do trench stepped boldly into the snow carrying his crossbow in one hand and the hatchet over his shoulder with the other  he was surprised indeed to find that at the first step beyond the encampment he sank considerably above the knees but being wonderfully strong he dashed the snow aside and was soon hid from view by intervening bushes  oliver bearing his bow and bludgeon followed smartly in his track  when they were gone paul turned a look of inquiry on his companion hendrick returned the look with profound gravity but there was a faint twinkle in his eyes which induced paul to laugh  what mean you by this he asked  i mean that master trench will be the better of a lesson from experience  he will soon returnsooner perhaps than you expect  why sohow  i dont understand  because returned the hunter it is next to impossible to travel over such ground in deep snow without snowshoes  we must make these whether we advance or retreat  meanwhile you had better blow up the fire and i will prepare breakfast  did you not tell the captain we were to breakfast on the bluff  i did but the captain will never reach the bluff  methinks i hear him returning even now  the hunter was right  a quarter of an hour had barely elapsed when our sturdy mariner reentered the encampment blowing like a grampus and perspiring at every pore  oliver was close at his heels but not nearly so much exhausted for he had not been obliged to beat the track  master hendrick gasped the captain when he had recovered breath its my opinion that we have only come here to lay down our bones and give up the ghostay and its no laughing business master paul as youll find when you try to haul your long legs out of a hole three futt deep at every step  three futt deep echoed oliver why its four futt if its an inchlook at me  ive been wadin up to the waist all the time  it need scarcely be said that their minds were much relieved when they were made acquainted with the true state of matters and that by means of shoes that could be made by hendrick they would be enabled to traverse with comparative ease the snowclad wildernesswhich else were impassable  but this work involved several days delay in camp  hendrick fashioned the large though light wooden framework of the shoesfive feet long by eighteen inches broadand oliver cut several deerskins into fine threads with which and deer sinews paul and the captain under direction filled in the network of the frames when ready  can you go after deer on such things asked the captain one night while they were all busy over this work  ay we can walk thirty or forty miles a day over deep snow with these shoes answered hendrick  where do the deer all come from asked oliver pausing in his work to sharpen his knife on a stone  if you mean where did the reindeer come from at first i cannot tell said hendrick  perhaps they came from the great unknown lands lying to the westward  but those in this island have settled down here for life apparently like myself  i have hunted them in every part of the island and know their habits well  their movements are as regular as the seasons  the winter months they pass in the south where the snow is not so deep as to prevent their scraping it away and getting at the lichens on which they feed  in springabout marchthey turn their faces northward for then the snow begins to be softened by the increased power of the sun so that they can get at the herbage beneath they migrate to the northwest of the island in innumerable herds of from twenty to two hundred eachthe animals following one another in single file and each herd being led by a noble stag  thus they move in thousands towards the hills of the west and norwest where they arrive in april  here on the plains and mountains they browse on their favourite mossy food and mountain herbage and here they bring forth their young in may or june  in october when the frosty nights set in they again turn southward and march back to winterquarters over the same tracks with which as you have seen the whole country is seamed thus they proceed from year to year  they move over the land in parallel lines save where mountain passes oblige them to converge and at these points i regret to say my kinsmen the bethuck indians lie in wait and slaughter them in great numbers merely for the sake of their tongues and other titbits  there is no call for regret master hendrick said captain trench surely where the deer are in such numbers the killing of a few more or less dont matter much  i think it wrong captain to slay gods creatures wantonly returned the hunter  besides if it is continued i fear that the descendants of the present race of men will suffer from scarcity of food  that hendricks fears were not groundless has been proved in many regions of the earth where wanton destruction of game in former days has resulted in great scarcity or extinction at the present time  in a few days a pair of snowshoes for each traveller was completed and the party was prepared to set out with renewed vigour on their return to the hunters home    chapter fourteen  tells of a tremendous storm and a strange shelter etcetera  proverbial philosophy teaches us that misfortunes seldom come singly newfoundland at the beginning of the sixteenth century does not seem to have been a place of refuge from the operation of that law  on the morning of the day in which the explorers meant to commence the return journey a storm of unwonted rigour burst upon them and swept over the land with devastating violenceoverturning trees snapping off mighty limbs uplifting the newfallen snow in great masses and hurling it in wild confusion into space so that earth and sky seemed to commingle in a horrid chaos  the first intimation the travellers had of the impending storm was the rending of a limb of the tree under which they reposed  the way in which oliver trench received the rude awakening might in other circumstances have raised a laugh for he leaped up like a harlequin with a glare of sudden amazement and plunging headlong away from the threatened danger buried himself in the snow  from this he instantly emerged with an aspect similar to that of father christmas minus the goodnatured serenity of that liberalhearted personage  daddy he gasped are you there  the question was not uncalled for the captain having made a plunge like that of his son but unlike his son having found it difficult to extricate himself quickly  paul and hendrick had also sprung up but the latter remaining close to the stem of the tree kept his eye watchfully on the branches  come herequick he criedthe stem is our safeguard  look out  as he spoke his voice was drowned in a crash which mingled with the shrieking blast and a great branch fell to the ground  fortunately the wind blew it sufficiently to one side to clear the camp  the air was so charged with snow particles that the captain and his son seemed to stagger out of a white mist as they returned to their comrades who were clinging to the weatherside of the tree  dye think it will go by the board asked the captain as he observed hendricks anxious gaze fixed on the swaying tree  it is a good stout stick replied his friend but the blast is powerful  the captain looked up at the thick stem with a doubtful expression and then turned to hendrick with a nautical shake of the head  i never saw a stick he said that would stand the like o that without fore an back stays but it may be that shoregoin sticks are  he stopped abruptly for a terrific crash almost stunned him as the tree by which they stood went down tearing its way through the adjacent branches in its fall and causing the whole party to stagger  keep still shouted hendrick in a voice of stern command as he glanced critically at the fallen tree  yes he added it will do  come here  he scrambled quickly among the crushed branches until he stood directly under the prostrate stem which was supported by its roots and stouter branches  here said he we are safe  his comrades glanced upwards with uneasy expressions that showed they did not quite share his feelings of safety  seems to me master hendrick roared the captain for the noise of the hurlyburly around was tremendous that it was safer where we were what if the stem should sink further and flatten us  as long as we stood to windward of it replied hendrick we were safe from the tree itself though in danger from surrounding trees but now with this great trunk above us other trees can do us no harm  as for the stem sinking lower it cant do that until this solid branch that supports it becomes rotten  come now he added we will encamp here give me the axe oliver and the three of you help to carry away the branches as i chop them off  in little more than an hour a circular space was cleared of snow and branches and a hut was thus formed with the great treestem for a ridgepole and innumerable branches great and small serving at once for walls and supports  having rescued their newly made snowshoes and brought them with their other property into this place of refuge they sat or reclined on their deerskins to await the end of the storm  this event did not however seem to be near  hour after hour they sat scarcely able to converse because of the noise and quite unable to kindle a fire  towards evening however the wind veered round a little and a hill close to their camp sheltered them from its direct force  at the same time an eddy in the gale piled up the snow on the fallen tree till it almost buried them converting their refuge into a sort of snowhut with a branchy framework inside  this change also permitted them to light a small fire and cook some venison so that they made a sudden bound from a state of great discomfort and depression to one of considerable comfort and hilarity  a wonderful change observed trench looking round the now ruddy walls of their curious dwelling with great satisfaction  about the quickest built house on record i should thinkand the strongest  yes daddy and built under the worst of circumstances too  what puzzles me is that such a tree should have given way at all  dont you see olly said paul that some of its roots are hollow rotten at the core  ah boysame with men as trees remarked the captain moralising rotten at the coresure to come down sooner or later  lay that to heart olly  if ever i do come down daddy i hope it wont be with so much noise why it went off like a cannon  a cannon echoed the captain  more like as if the mainmast o the world had gone by the board  what if the gale should last a week asked olly  then we shall have to stay here a week returned hendrick but theres no fear of that  the fiercer the gale the sooner the calm  it wont delay us long  the hunter was right  the day following found the party en route with a clear sky bright sun and sharp calm air  but the art of snowshoe walking though easy enough is not learned in an hour  theyre clumsy things to look atmore like small boats flattened than anything else remarked the captain when hendrick had fastened the strange but indispensable instruments on his feetas he had already fastened those of the other two  now look at me said hendrick  ill take a turn round of a few hundred yards to show you how  the chief thing you have to guard against is treading with one shoe on the edge of the other at the same time you must not straddle  just pass the inner edge of one shoe over the inner edge of the other and walk very much as if you had no snowshoes on at allso  he stepped off at a round pace the broad and long shoes keeping him so well on the surface of the snow that he sank only a few inches  why it seems quite easy observed the captain  remarkably so said paul  anybody can do that cried oliver  now then up anchorhere goes said the captain  he stepped out valiantly took the first five paces like a trained walker tripped at the sixth step and went headlong down at the seventh with such a wild plunge that his anxious son running hastily to his aid summarily shared his fate  paul burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter lost his balance and went downas the captain saidstern foremost  it was a perplexing commencement but the ice having been broken they managed in the course of a few hours to advance with only an occasional fall and before the next day had closed walked almost as easily as their guide  this was so far satisfactory  our three travellers were quite charmed with their proficiency in the new mode of progression when a sudden thaw set in and damped not only their spirits but their shoes  the netting and lines became flabby  the moccasins with which hendrick had supplied them from the bundle he carried for his own use were reduced to something of the nature of tripe  the damp snow which when rendered powdery by frost had fallen through the network of the shoes now fell upon it in soft heaps and remained there increasing the weight so much as to wrench joints and strain muscles while the higher temperature rendered exertion fatiguing and clothing unbearable  i wonder how long i can stand this without my legs coming off said poor oliver giving way at last to a feeling of despair  seems to me to get hotter and hotter growled his father as he wiped the perspiration from his face with the tail of his coathaving lost the solitary handkerchief with which he had landed  im glad the thaw is so complete said hendrick for it may perhaps clear away the snow altogether  it is too early for winter to begin in earnest  i would suggest now that we encamp again for a few days to see whether the weather is really going to change hunt a little and rest a while  what say you  with a sigh of contentment the captain answered amen  paul said agreed and oliver cried hurrah at the same time throwing his cap in the air  two days after that they were enabled to continue the journey on snowless ground with the unwieldy shoes slung at their backs  the change although decidedly an improvement was not perfect for the ground had been made soft the rivers and rills had been swollen and the conditions altogether were rendered much less agreeable than they had been on the outward journey  the travellers enjoyed themselves greatly notwithstanding and the captain added many important jottings in what he styled the logbook of his memory as to bearings of salient points distances etcetera while paul took notes of the fauna and flora soils products and geological features of the country on the same convenient tablets  there can be no doubt about it said the latter one morning as he surveyed the country around him  no doubt about what asked the captain  about the suitableness of this great island for the abode of man answered paul and then continuing to speak with enthusiasm the indication of minerals is undoubted  see you that serpentine deposit mingled with a variety of other rocks varying in colour from darkest green to yellow and from the translucent to the almost transparent wherever that is seen there we have good reason to believe that copper ore will be found  if so observed hendrick much copper ore will be found on the seacoast on the north side of the island for i have seen the same rocks in many places there  but there are indications of other metals continued paul which i perceive though my acquaintance with geological science is unfortunately not sufficient to make me certain still i think i can see that besides copper nickel lead and iron may be dug from the mines of newfoundland indeed i should not wonder if silver and gold were also to be found  of the existence of coalbeds there can be no doubt though what their extent may be i cannot guess but of this i am certain that the day cannot be far distant when the mineral and forest wealth of this land shall be developed by a large and thriving population  it may be as you say paul remarked captain trench with a dubious shake of the head but if you had lived as long as i have and seen as much of the world and its ways you wouldnt be quite so sanguine about the thriving population or the speedy development  you see hitches are apt to occur in the affairs of men which cause wonderful delays and tanglements come about that take years to unravel  if captain trench had been a professional prophet he could hardly have hit the nail more fairly on the head for he indicated exactly what bad government has actually done for newfoundlandonly he might have said centuries instead of yearsfor its internal resources even at the present time remain to a very great extent undeveloped  however not being a professional prophet but merely an ancient mariner the captain wound up his remark with a recommendation to hoist all sail and lay their course as there was no saying how long the mild weather would last  for several days after this they plodded steadily onward sometimes over the mountains or across the grassy plains where migrating reindeer supplied them with abundant venison at other times among lakelets and streams whose excellent fish and innumerable wildfowl provided them with variety for the table and music for the ear  now and then they saw the great moosedeer which rivals the horse in size and once hendrick shot one at a time when they chanced to have consumed their last caribou steak and happened to enter a great forest without anything for supper in their wallets  for occasionally circumstances may render men supperless even when surrounded by plenty  at last they reached the great lake with its beautiful islands where hendrick had set up his home  the hunter became very silent as they drew near to its shores  you seem anxious remarked paul as they approached the lake  have you reason to fear aught  nonenone replied his friend quickly but i never return after a long absence without feeling anxious  a loud halloo soon brought the echoing answer in the shrill voice of little oscar whose canoe quickly shot out from the creek  it was speedily followed by the deerskin boat and when near enough to be heard the reply to hendricks anxious inquiry was the gratifying assurancealls well    chapter fifteen  grummidge asserts himselfgreat discoveries are made and the crew flits  we must turn aside now for a time to inquire into the doings of the crew of the water wagtail whom we left on the little island off the eastern seaboard of newfoundland  at first when the discovery was made that the captain paul and oliver had been put ashore and left to take care of themselves without weapons or supplies there was a disposition on the part of the better men of the crew to apply what we now style lynch law to big swinton david garnet and fred taylor  lets hang em suggested grummidge at a meeting of the men when the culprits were not present  sure an ill howld the rope wid pleasure said squill  an ill help ye cried little stubbs  but jim heron shook his head and did not quite see his way to that while george blazer protested against such violent proceedings altogether  as he was backed up by the majority of the crew the proposal was negatived  but what are we to do boys cried grummidge vehemently  are we goin to be domineered over by swinton  why every man he takes a dislike to hell sneak into his tent when hes asleep make him fast heave him into the boat pull to the big island land him there and bid him goodbye  there wont be one of us safe while he prowls about an gits help from three or four rascals as bad as himself  ay thats it boys said little stubbs it wont be safe to trust him  hang him say i  stubbs was a very emphatic little man but his emphasis only roused the idea of drollery in the minds of those whom he addressed and rather influenced them towards leniency  no no cried the first mate of the water wagtail who since the wreck had seldom ventured to raise his voice in council i would advise rather that we should give him a thrashing and teach him that we refuse to obey or recognise a selfconstituted commander  ah sure now thats a raisonable plan said squill with something of sarcasm in his tone an if i might make so bowld id suggist that yoursilf sor shud give him the thrashin  nay i am far from being the strongest man of the crew  the one that is best able should do the job  the mate looked pointedly at grummidge as he spoke but grummidge being a modest man pretended not to see him  yes yes youre right sir grummidge is the very man cried stubbs  hear hear chorused several of the others  come old boy youll do it wont you and well all promise to back you up  well look ee here lads said grummidge who seemed to have suddenly made up his mind this man has bin quarrellin wi me off an on since the beginning of the voyage whether i would or not so it may be as well to settle the matter now as at another time  ill do the job on one consideration  whats that cried several men  that you promises on your honour though none o yous got much o that that when ive done the job you agree to make me captain of the crew  its a moral impossibility dee see for people to git along without a leader so if i agree to lead you in this you must agree to follow me in everythingis it so  agreed agreed chorused his friends only too glad that one of the physically strongest among themalso one of the besthumouredshould stand up to stem the tide of anarchy which they all clearly saw was rising among them  well then resumed grummidge i see swinton with his three friends acomin  ill expect you to stand by an see fair play for hes rather too ready wi his knife  while he spoke the comrade in question was seen approaching with fred taylor and david garnet carrying a quantity of codfish that had just been caught  youve been holding a meeting comrades i think said swinton looking somewhat suspiciously at the group of men as he came up and flung down his load  yes we have said grummidge advancing hands in pockets and with a peculiar nautical roll which distinguished him  youre right big swinton we have bin havin a meetin a sort of trial so to speak an as you are the man whats bin tried it may interest you to know what sentence has bin passed upon you  oh indeed returned swinton with a look of cool insolence which he knew well how to assume no matter what he felt  well yes it would interest me greatly to hear the sentence of the learned judgewhoever he is  the fingers of the man fumbled as he spoke at his waistbelt near the handle of his knife  observing this grummidge kept a watchful eye on him but did not abate his nonchalant freeandeasy air as he stepped close up to him  the sentence is he said firmly but quietly that you no longer presume to give orders as if you was the captain o this here crew that from this hour you fall to the rear and undertake second fiddleor fourth fiddle for the matter o that and that you head a party to guide them in a sarch which is just agoin to begin for the two men and the boy you have so sneakingly betrayed and put on shorean all this youll have to do with a ready goodwill on pain o havin your brains knocked out if you dont  moreover you may be thankful that the sentence is so light for some o your comrades would have had you hanged right off if others hadnt seen fit to be marciful  while this sentence was being pronounced swintons expression underwent various changes and his face became visibly paler under the steady gaze of grummidge  at the last word he grasped his knife and drew it but his foe was prepared  like a flash of light he planted his hard knuckles between swintons eyes and followed up the blow with another on the chest which felled him to the ground  there was no need for more  the big bully was rendered insensible besides being effectually subdued and from that time forward he quietly consented to play any fiddlechiefly however the bass one  but he harboured in his heart a bitter hatred of grummidge and resolved secretly to take a fearful revenge at the first favourable opportunity  soon after that the boat was manned by as many of the crew as it could contain and an exploring party went to the spot where captain trench and his companions had been landed guided thereto by swinton and led by his foe grummidge whose bearing indicated without swagger or threat that the braining part of the sentence would be carried out on the slightest symptom of insubordination on the part of the former while this party was away those who remained on the islet continued to fish and to preserve the fish for winter use by drying them in the sun  we need scarcely add that the exploring party did not discover those for whom they sought but they discovered the true nature of the main island which up to that time they had supposed to be a group of isles  when the search was finally given up as hopeless an examination of the coast was made with a view to a change of abode  you see lads observed grummidge when discussing this subject its quite plain that we shall have to spend the winter here an as i was a short bit to the south of these seas in the late autumn one voyage i have reason to believe that we had better house ourselves an lay in a stock o provisions if we would escape bein froze an starved  troth its well to escape that boys remarked squills for its froze i was mesilf wanceall buton a voyage to the baltic an its starved to death was me owld grandmotheralmostso i can spake from experience  an we couldnt find a better place for winterquarters than what we see before us said garnet  it looks like a sort o paradise  we cannot say what sort of idea garnet meant to convey by this comparison but there could be no question that the scene before them was exceedingly beautiful  the party had held their consultation on the crest of a bluff and just beyond it lay a magnificent bay the shores of which were clothed with luxuriant forests and the waters studded with many islets  at the distant head of the bay the formation or dip of the land clearly indicated the mouth of a large river while small streams and ponds were seen gleaming amid the foliage nearer at hand at the time the sun was blazing in a cloudless sky and those thick fogs which so frequently enshroud the coasts of newfoundland had not yet descended from the icy north  i say look yonder  whats blazer about whispered jim heron pointing to his comrade who had separated from the party and was seen with a large stone in each hand creeping cautiously round a rocky point below them  conjecture was useless and needless for while they watched him blazer rose up made a wild rush forward hurled the stones in advance and disappeared round the point  a few moments later he reappeared carrying a large bird in his arms  the creature which he had thus killed with mans most primitive weapon was a specimen of the great auka bird which is now extinct  it was the size of a large goose with a coalblack head and back short wings resembling the flippers of a seal which assisted it wonderfully in the water but were useless for flight broad webbed feet and legs set so far back that on land it sat erect like the penguins of the southern seas  at the time of which we write the great auk was found in myriads on the low rocky islets on the eastern shores of newfoundland nowadays there is not a single bird to be found anywhere and only a few specimens and skeletons remain in the museums of the world to tell that such creatures once existed  their extermination was the result of mans reckless slaughter of them when the newfoundland banks became the resort of the worlds fishermen  not only was the great auk slain in vast numbers for the sake of fresh food but it was salted by tons for future use and sale  the valuable feathers or down also proved a source of temptation and as the birds could not fly to other breedingplaces they gradually diminished in numbers and finally disappeared  why blazer exclaimed heron thats one o the sodgerlike birds we frightened away from our little island when we first landed  ay an theres plenty more where this one came from said blazer throwing the bird down an they are so tame on the rocks round the point that i do believe we could knock em on the head with sticks if we took em unawares  what dee say to try lads  agreedfor im gettin tired o fish now said grummidge  how should we set about it think ee  cut cudgels for ourselves then take to the boat creep round to one o the little islands in the bay and go at em answered blazer  this plan was carried out with as little delay as possible  an islet was boarded as squill said and the clumsy astonished creatures lost numbers of their companions before making their escape into the sea  a further treasure was found in a large supply of their eggs  laden almost to the gunwale with fresh provisions the searchparty returned to their campsome of them indeed distressed at having failed to find their banished friends but most of them elated by their success with the great auks and the prospect of soon going into pleasant winterquarters  so eager were they all to flit into this new regionthis paradise of garnetthat operations were commenced on the very next day at early morn  the boat was launched and manned and as much of their property as it would hold was put on board  you call it paradise garnet said grummidge as the two carried a bundle of dried cod slung on a pole between them but if you and the like of ye dont give up swearin an try to mend your manners the place we pitch on will be more like hell than paradise no matter how comfortable and pretty it may be  garnet was not in a humour either to discuss this point or to accept a rebuke so he only replied to the remark with a surly humph  landing on the main island to the northward of the large bay so as to secure a southern exposure the boatparty proceeded to pitch their camp on a lovely spot where cliff and coppice formed a luxuriant background ramparts of rock protected them from the norwest gales and purling rivulets hummed their lullaby  here they pitched their tents and in a short space of time ran up several log huts the material for which was supplied in abundance by the surrounding forest  when the little settlement was sufficiently established and all the goods and stores were removed from what now was known as wreck island they once more launched the boat and turned their attention to fishingnot on the great bank about which at the time they were ignorant but on the smaller banks nearer shore where codfish were found in incredible numbers  some of the party however had more of the hunters than the fishers spirit in them and prepared to make raids on the homes of the great auk or to ramble in the forests  squill was among the latter  one day while rambling on the seashore looking for shellfish he discovered a creature which not only caused him to fire off all the exclamations of his rich irish vocabulary but induced him to run back to camp with heaving chest and distended eyes almost bursting from excitement  what is it boy chorused his comrades  och musha  ive found it at long lastthe great saysurno not exactly that but thethe great sprawlin longleggedoch what shall i say  the greatgrandfather of all thethewords is wantin boys  come an see for yourselves    chapter sixteen  a giant discoverednew home at wagtail baya strange addition to the settlement  the creature which had so powerfully affected the feelings of the irishman was dead but dead and harmless though it was it drew forth from his comrades a shout of intense surprise when they saw it for it was no less than a cuttlefish of proportions so gigantic that they felt themselves in the presence of one of those terrible monsters of the deep about which fabulous tales have been told and exaggerated descriptions given since the beginning of historical time  av hes not the saysarpint himself boys panted squill as he pointed to him with looks of unmitigated admiration sure he must be his first cousin  and squill was not far wrong for it was found that the monstrous fish measured fiftytwo feet between the extremities of its outspread arms its body was about eight feet long and four feet broad  its great arms of which it had ten radiating from its body varied in length and thicknessthe longest being about twentyfour feet and the shortest about eight  the under sides of these arms were supplied with innumerable suckers while from the body there projected a horny beak like the beak of a parrot  its wishin i am that i might see wan o yer family alive said squill as he turned over the dead arms but id rather not be embraced by ye  och what a hug ye could givean as to howldin ona thousand limpets would be nothin to ye  a miser grippin his gold would be more like it suggested grummidge  i dont expect ever to see one alive said little stubbs an yet there must surely be more where that came from  the very next day squill had his wish gratified and stubbs his unbelief rebuked for while they were out in the boat rowing towards one of the fishingbanks with several of their comrades they discovered a living giantcuttlefish  whats that boys cried the irishman pointing to the object which was floating in the water not far ahead of them  seaweed growled blazer  blazer always growled  his voice was naturally low and harshso was his spirit  sometimes a grunt supplanted the growl suggesting that he was porcine in natureas not a few men are  but it was not seaweed  the thing showed signs of life as the boat drew near  starboard starboard hard shouted little stubbs starting up  but the warning came too late  next moment the boat ran with a thud into a monster cuttlefish  grummidge seized a boathook shouted stern all and hit the creature with all his might while stubbs made a wild grasp at a hatchet which lay under one of the thwarts  instantly the horny parrotlike beak the size of a mans fist reared itself from among the folds of the body and struck the boat a violent blow while a pair of saucerlike eyes fully four inches in diameter opened and glared ferociously  this was terrifying enough but when a moment later two tremendous arms shot out from the body near the eyes flung themselves around the boat and held on tight a yell of fear escaped from several of the men and with good reason for if the innumerable suckers on those slimy arms once fairly attached themselves to the boat there seemed to be no chance of escape from the deadly embrace  in that moment of danger little stubbs proved himself equal to the occasion  with the hatchet he deftly severed the two limbs as they lay over the gunwale of the boat and the monster without cry or sign of pain fell back into the sea and moved off ejecting such a quantity of inky fluid as it went that the water was darkened for two or three hundred yards around  well done little stubbs cried grummidge as he watched the creature disappearing  youve often worried our lives in time past but this time youve saved em  coil away the limbs boys  well measure em and enter em in the log when we go ashore  it may interest the reader to know that the measurements were as follows  the longer and thinner arm was nineteen feet in length about three and a half inches in circumference of a pale pinkish colour and exceedingly strong and tough  as all the men agreed that more than ten feet of the arm were left attached to the monsters body the total length must have been little short of thirty feet  towards the extremity it broadened out like an oar and then tapered to a fine tonguelike point  this part was covered with about two hundred suckers having hornytoothed edges the largest of the suckers being more than an inch in diameter the smallest about the size of a pea the short arm was eleven feet long and ten inches in circumference  it was covered on the under side throughout its entire length with a double row of suckers  grummidge who was prone to observe closely counted them that night with minute care and came to the conclusion that the creature must have possessed about eleven hundred suckers altogether there was also a tail to the fishwhich squill called a divilfish shaped like a fin  it was two feet in width  lest any reader should imagine that we are romancing here we turn aside to refer him to a volume entitled newfoundland the oldest british colony written by joseph hatton and the reverend m harvey in which pages 238 to 242 he will find an account of a giantcuttlefish devilfish or squid very similar to that which we have now described and in which it is also stated that mr harvey in 1873 obtained possession of one cuttlefish arm nineteen feet long which he measured and photographed and described in various newspapers and periodicals and finally sent to the geological museum in st johns where it now lies  the same gentleman afterwards obtained an uninjured specimen of the fish and it is well known that complete specimens as well as fragments of the giant cephalopod now exist in several other museums  can any one wonder that marvellous tales of the sea were told that night round the fires at suppertime that little stubbs became eloquently fabulous and that squill drawing on his imagination described with graphic power a monster before whose bristling horrors the great seaserpent himself would hide his diminished head and went into particulars so minute and complex that his comrades set him down as one o the biggest liars that ever lived until he explained that the monster in question had only appeared to him wance in wan of his owld grandmothers dreams  in fishing and hunting with bows and arrows made by themselves as well as with ingenious traps and weirs and snares of their own invention the crew spent their time pleasantly and the summer passed rapidly away during this period the rude tents of spars and sailcloth were supplanted by ruder huts of round logs caulked with hay and plastered with mud holes in the walls thereof did service as windows during the day and bits of old sails or bundles of hay stuffed into them formed shutters at night  sheds were also put up to guard provisions and stores from the weather and stages were erected on which to dry the codfish after being split and cleaned so that our shipwrecked crew in their new home which they named wagtail bay had thus unwittingly begun that great industry for which newfoundland has since become celebrated all the world over  it is not to be supposed that among such men in such circumstances everything went harmoniously  at first indeed what with having plenty to do in fishing hunting building splitting and drying fish etcetera all day and being pretty well tired out at nights the peace was kept pretty easily all the more that big swinton had been quelled and apparently quite subdued  but as the stores became full of food and the days shortened while the nights proportionately lengthened time began to hang heavy on their hands and gradually the camp became resolved into the two classes which are to be found everywherethe energetically industrious and the lazily idle  perhaps we should say that those two extreme phases of human nature began to show themselves for between them there existed all shades and degrees so that it was difficult to tell in some cases to which class the men belonged  the proverbial mischief of course was soon found for the latter class to do and grummidge began to discover that the ruling of his subjects which sat lightly enough on his shoulders during the summer became a matter of some trouble and anxiety in autumn  he also found somewhat to his surprise that legislation was by no means the easywe might say freeandeasybusiness which he had supposed it to be  in short the camp presented the interesting spectacle of a human society undergoing the process of mushroom growth from a condition of chaotic irresponsibility to that of civilised order  the chaotic condition had been growing worse and worse for some time before grummidge was forced to take action for grummidge was a man of longsuffering patience  one night however he lost all patience and like most patient people when forced out of their natural groove he exploded with surprising violence and vigour  it happened thus  the crew had built for themselves a hut of specially large dimensions in which they nightly assembled all together round the fires of which there were twoone at either end  some of the men told stories some sang songs others played at draughts of amateur construction and a good many played the easy but essential part of audience  the noise of course was tremendous but they were used to that and minded it not  when however two of the men began to quarrel over their game with so much anger as to interrupt all the others and draw general attention to themselves the thing became unbearable and when one called the other a liar and the other shouted with an oath youre another the matter reached a climax  come come dick swan and bob crow cried grummidge in a stern voice you stop that  two liars are too much in this here ship  one is one too many  if you cant keep civil tongues in your heads well pitch you overboard  you mind your own business gruffly replied dick swan who was an irascible man and the aggressor  thats just what ill do returned grummidge striding up to swan seizing him by the collar and hurling him to the other end of the room where he lay still under the impression apparently that he had had enough  my business said grummidge is to keep order and i mean to attend to it  isnt that so boys  noyesno replied several voices  who said no demanded grummidge  every one expected to see big swinton step forward but he did not  his revenge was not to be gratified by mere insubordination  the man who did at last step forward was an insignificant fellow who had been nicknamed spitfire and whose chief characteristics were selfwill and illnature  he did not lack courage however for he boldly faced the angry ruler and defied him  every one expected to see spitfire follow dick swan and in similar fashion but they were mistaken  they did not yet understand grummidge  well spitfire whats your objection to my keeping order he said in a voice so gentle that the other took heart  my objection he said is that when you was appinted capting there was no vote taken  you was stuck up by your own friends an that aint fair an i for one refuse to knuckle under to ee  you may knock me down if you like for i aint your match by a long way but youll not prove wrong to be right by doin that  well spoken master spitfire exclaimed a voice from the midst of the crowd that encircled the speakers  well spoken indeed echoed grummidge and i thank you master spitfire for bringin this here matter to a head  now lads he added turning to the crowd you have bin wrong an informal so to speak in your proceedins when you appinted me governor o this here colony  theres a right and a wrong in everything an i do believe from the bottom of my soul that itsthat itsthatwell i aint much of a dab at preaching as you know but what i would say is this its right to do right an it aint right for to do wrong so well krect this little mistake at once for i have no wish to rule bless you  now then all whats in favour o my bein govnor walk to the end o the room on my right hand an all who wants somebody else to bespitfire for instancewalk over to where dick swan is asittin enjoin of hisself  immediately threefourths of the crew stepped with alacrity to the right  the remainder went rather slowly to the left  the grummidges has won cried squill amid hearty laughter  the ruler himself made no remark whatever but seating himself in a corner of the hut resumed the game which had been interrupted quite assured that the game of insubordination was finally finished  the day following that on which the reign of king grummidge was established a new member of considerable interest was added to the colony  blaze stubbs and squill chanced to be out that day along the shore  squill being in a meditative mood had fallen behind his comrades  they had travelled further than usual when the attention of the two in front was attracted by what seemed to them the melancholy howling of a wolf  getting their bows ready they advanced with caution and soon came upon a sad sightthe dead body of a native beside which crouched a large black dog  at first they thought the dog had killed the man and were about to shoot it when stubbs exclaimed hold on dont you see he must have tumbled over the cliff  a brief examination satisfied them that the indian in passing along the top of the cliffs had fallen over and that the accident must have been recent for the body was still fresh  the dog which appeared to be starving showed all its formidable teeth when they attempted to go near its dead master  presently squill came up  ah boys he said ye dont onderstand the natur o the bastesee here  taking a piece of dried fish from his pocket he went boldly forward and presented it  the dog snapped it greedily and gulped it down  squill gave him another and another piece as the fourth offering was presented he patted the animal quietly on its head  the victory was gained  the dog suffered them to bury its master but for four days it refused to leave his grave  during that time squill fed it regularly  then he coaxed it to follow him and at last it became under the name of blackboy a general favourite and a loving member of the community    chapter seventeen  has reference to food and a great fight  there is always a certain amount of pleasure to be derived from the tracing of any subject of interest back to its origin  we have already seen howlike a noble river which has its fountainhead in some mountain lakelet that would scarcely serve as a washingbasin for a cyclopsthe grand codfishing industry which has enriched the world and found employment for thousands of men for centuries had its commencement in the crew of the water wagtail we shall now show that another great industry namely the newfoundland sealfishery had its origin in the same insignificant source  king grummidge was walking one morning along the shore of wagtail bay with hands in pockets hat on back of head and that easy roll of gait so characteristic of nautical men and royalty  he was evidently troubled in mind for a frown rested on his brow and his lips were compressed  it might have been supposed that the cares of state were beginning to tell upon him but such was not the case food was the cause of his trouble  fish fish fish he growled to little stubbs who was his companion in the walk  im sick tired o fish  its my opinion that if we go on eatin fish like weve bin doin since we was cast away here we will turn into fish or mermaids if not somethin worse  what are ye laughin at  at the notion o you turnin into a maid of any sort replied stubbs  thats got nothin to do wi the argiment returned grummidge sternly for his anxieties were too serious to permit of his indulging in levity at the time  what weve got to do is to find meat for them auks are nigh as dry as the fish  meat lad meat wi plenty o fat thats the question o the hour  yes its our question no doubt rejoined stubbs  he might as well have bestowed his bad pun on a rabbit for grummidge was essentially dense and soberminded  but weve had a few rabbits of late an ducks an partridges he added  rabbits ducks partridges repeated his companion with contempt how many of them delicacies have we had  thats what i wants to know  not many i admit for theres none of us got much to boast of as shots  shots echoed grummidge  youre right stubbs  of all the blind bats and helpless boys with the bow theres not i believe in the whole world such a lot as the popilation of wagtail bay  why theres not two of ye who could hit the big shed at sixty paces an all the fresh meat as youve brought in yet has bin the result o chance  now look ee here stubbs a notion has entered my head an when a notion does that i usually grab that notion an hold im a fast prisoner until ive made somethin useful an shipshape of im  if it works properly well soon have somethin better to eat than fish an more substantial than rabbits ducks partridges or auks  we may remark in passing that the animals which those wrecked sailors called rabbits were in reality hares  moreover the men took an easy perhaps unscientific method of classifying feathered game  nearly everything with wings that dwelt chiefly on lake river or sea they called ducks and all the feathered creatures of the forest they styled partridges  from this simple classification however were excepted swans geese eagles and hawks  well grummidge what may be your notion asked stubbs  my notion isseals  for all our hard rowin and wastin of arrows weve failed to catch or kill a single seal though theres such swarms of em all about  now this is a great misfortin for its well known that seals make firstrate beefleastwise to them as aint particlar so well set about catchin of em at once  but how asked stubbs becoming interested under the influence of his comrades earnest enthusiasm  this is how  look there dye see that small island lyin close to the shore with several seals heads appearin in the channel between  yeswhat then  well then what i mean to do is to have nets made with big meshes an set em between that island an the shore and see what comes of it  but wheres the twine to come from objected stubbs  twine  aint there no end o cordage swashin about the water wagtail ever since she went ashore  an havent we got fingers  cant we undo the strands an make small cord  surely some of ye have picked oakum enough to understand what that means  stubbs was convinced  moreover the rest of the men were so convinced that the plan promised well when it was explained to them that they set to work with alacrity and in a brief space of time made a strong net several fathoms in length and with meshes large enough to permit of a seals head squeezing through  no sooner was it ready than the whole community went down to see it set then with difficulty they were prevented from waiting on the shore to watch the result  in the afternoon when grummidge gave permission they ran down again with all the eagerness of children and were rewarded by finding six fat seals entangled in the net and inflated almost to bursting with the water that had drowned them  thus they were supplied with beef and what was of almost equal importance with oil which enabled them to fry the leanest food besides affording them the means of making a steadier and stronger light than that of the log fires to which they had hitherto been accustomed  it may be here remarked by captious readers if such there be that this cannot appropriately be styled the beginning of that grand sealing or as it is now styled swile huntin industry which calls into action every year hundreds of steam and other vessels and thousands of men who slaughter hundreds of thousands of seals which produces mints of money and in the prosecutions of which men dare the terrible dangers of icedrift and pack in order that they may bludgeon the young seals upon the floes  as well might it be objected that a tiny rivulet on the mountaintop is not the fountainhead of a mighty river because its course is not marked by broad expanses and thundering cataracts  grummidges net was undoubtedly the beginning the tiny rill of the newfoundland sealfishery and even the bludgeoning was initiated by one of his party  it happened thus  big swinton went out one morning to try his fortune with the bow and arrow in the neighbourhood of a range of cliffs that extended far away to the northward  swinton usually chose to hunt in solitude  having few sympathies with the crew he shut up his feelings within his own breast and brooded in silence on the revenge he was still resolved to take when a safe opportunity offered for the mans nature was singularly resolute and at the same time unforgiving  now it chanced that grummidge in utter ignorance of where his foe had gone took the same direction that morning but started some time later intending to explore the neighbourhood of the cliffs in search of seafowls eggs  on reaching the locality swinton found that a large icefloe had come down from the arctic regions and stranded on the shore of the island on the ice lay a black object which he rightly judged to be a seal  at first he supposed it to be a dead one but just as he was about to advance to examine it the animal raised its head and moved its tail love of the chase was powerful in swintons breast  he instantly crouched behind a boulder and waited patiently till the seal again laid its head on the ice as if to continue its nap  while the seaman crouched there perfectly motionless his brain was active  arrows he feared would be of little use even if he were capable of shooting well which he was not  other weapon he had none with the exception of a claspknife  what was he to do  the only answer to that question wastry a club  but how was he to get at the seal with a club  while pondering this question he observed that there was another seal on the same mass of ice apparently sleeping behind a hummock  he also noticed that both seals were separated from the water by a considerable breadth of iceespecially the one behind the hummock and that there was a tongue of ice extending from the floe to the shore by which it seemed possible to reach the floe by patient stalking without disturbing the game  instantly swinton decided on a plan and commenced by crawling into the bushes  there with his claspknife he carefully cut and peeled a club which even hercules might have deigned to wield  with this weapon he crawled on hands and knees slowly out to the floe and soon discovered that the seals were much larger than he had at first supposed and were probably a male and a female  being ignorant of the nature of seals and only acquainted with the fact that the tender nose of the animal is its most vulnerable part he crept like a cat after a mouse towards the smaller seal which he judged to be the female until near enough to make a rush and cut off its retreat to the sea  he then closed with it brought his great club down upon its snout and laid it dead upon the ice  turning quickly round he observed to his surprise that the male seal instead of making for the water as he had expected was making towards himself in floundering and violent bounds  it may be necessary here to state that there are several kinds of seals in the northern seas and that the hood sealor as hunters call it the doghoodis among the largest and fiercest of them all  the male of this species is distinguished from the female by a singular hood or fleshy bag on his nose which he has the power to inflate with air so that it covers his eyes and facethus forming a powerful protection to his sensitive nose for besides being elastic the hood is uncommonly tough  it is said that this guard will even resist shot and that the only sure way of killing the doghood seal is to hit him on the neck at the base of the skull  besides possessing this safeguard or natural buffer the doghood is full of courage which becomes absolute ferocity when he is defending the female  this is now so well known that hunters always try to kill the male first if possible when the female becomes an easy victim  swinton saw at a single glance that he had to deal with a gigantic and furious foe for the creature had inflated its hood and dilated its nostrils into two huge bladders as with glaring eyes it bounced rather than rushed at him in terrific rage  feeling that his arrows would be useless the man flung them and the bow down resolving to depend entirely on his mighty club  being possessed of a good share of brute courage and feeling confident in his great physical strength swinton did not await the attack but ran to meet his foe swung his ponderous weapon on high and brought it down with tremendous force on the seals head but the hood received it and caused it to reboundas if from indiarubberwith such violence that it swung the man to one side  so far this was well as it saved him from a blow of the doghoods flipper that would probably have stunned him  as it was it grazed his shoulder tore a great hole in his strong canvas jacket and wounded his arm  experience usually teaches caution  when the seal turned with increased fury to renew the assault swinton stood on the defensive and as soon as it came within reach brought his club down a second time on its head with if possible greater force than before but again the blow was broken by the hood though not again was the man struck by the flipper for he was agile as a panther and evaded the expected blow  his foot slipped on the ice however and he fell so close to the seal that it tumbled over him and almost crushed him with its weight  at the same time the club flew from his hand  though much shaken by the fall the seaman scrambled to his feet in time to escape another onslaught but do what he would he could make no impression on the creatures head because of that marvellous hood and body blows were of course useless  still big swinton was not the man to give in easily to a seal  although he slipped on the ice and fell several times he returned again and again to the encounter until he began to feel his strength going  as muscular power was his sole dependence a sensation of fear now tended to make matters worse at last he tripped over a piece of ice and the seal fell upon him  it was at this critical point that grummidge came in sight of the combatants and ran at full speed to the rescue  but he was still at a considerable distance and had to cross the tongue of ice before he could reach the floe  meanwhile the seal opened its wellarmed jaws to seize its victim by the throat  swinton felt that death stared him in the face  desperation sharpened his ingenuity  he thrust his left hand as far as possible down the throat of his adversary and seizing it with the other arm round the neck held on in a tight though not loving embrace  the struggle that ensued was brief  the seal shook off the man as if he had been but a child and was on the point of renewing the attack when it caught sight of grummidge and reared itself to meet this new enemy  grummidge possessed a fairsized claspknife  armed with this he rushed boldly in and made a powerful stab at the creatures heart  alas for the poor man even though his stabbing powers had been good instead of bad for he would only have imbedded the short weapon in a mass of fat without touching the heart  but grummidge was a bad stabber  he missed his aim so badly as to plunge his weapon into the hood  nothing could have been more fortunate  the air escaped and the hood collapsed  at the same moment grummidge received an ugly scratch on the cheek which sent him sprawling  as he rose quickly he observed swintons club which he grasped and brought vigorously down on the seals now unprotected nose and felled it  another effective blow terminated its career for ever and then the victor turned to find that big swinton lay on the ice quite conscious of what was going on though utterly unable to move hand or foot    chapter eighteen  tells of death and disaster  to bind up swintons wounds some of which were ugly ones was the first business of grummidge after he had hastily staunched the blood which was flowing copiously from his own cheek  the stout seaman was well able to play the part of amateur surgeon being a handy fellow and he usually carried about with him two or three odd pieces of spunyarn for emergenciesalso a lump of cottonwaste as a handkerchief while the tail of his shirt served at all times as a convenient rag  having finished the job he looked earnestly at the pale face and closed eyes of his old enemy and saidyouve bin pretty much banged about old chapeh  as the wounded man made no reply grummidge rose quickly intending to run to the settlement for help knowing that no time should be lost  he was hastening away when swinton stopped him  hallo hold on he shouted  grummidge turned back  youyoure not goin to leave me are you demanded his enemy somewhat sternly ii shall die if you leave me here on the cold ice  an involuntary shudder here bore testimony to the probability of his fear being well grounded  swinton replied grummidge going down on one knee the more conveniently to grasp the unwounded hand of his foe you mistake my crackter entirely  though im not much to boast on as a man i aint quite a devil  i was only goin to run to wagtail bay to start some o the boys with a stretcher to fetch yean its my belief that theres no time to be lost  right you are grummidge replied the poor man in a faint voice so little time that if you leave me here the boys will only find some human beef to carry back an that wont be worth the trouble  dont say that old chap returned the other in a low gruff voice which was the result of tender feeling  keep up heartbless you ill be back in no time  all right said swinton with a resigned look go an fetch the boys but i say grummidge shake hands before you go i dont want to carry a grudge agin you into the next world if i can help it  goodbye  no no mate if thats to be the way of it ill stick to ee  dye think you could manage to git on my back  ill try  with much heaving and many halfsuppressed groans from the one and heavehos from the other big swinton was at last mounted on his comrades broad shoulders and the two started for home  it was a long and weary journey for grummidge found the road rough and the load heavy but before night he deposited his old enemy in a bunk in the large room of the settlement and then himself sank fainting on the floornot we need scarcely add from the effect of sentimental feeling but because of prolonged severe exertion coupled with loss of blood  two days later grummidge sat by the side of swintons bunk  it was early forenoon and they were aloneall the other men being out on various avocations  blackboy the large dog lay asleep on the floor beside them  suddenly the dog jumped up ran to the door and began to whine restlessly  wolves about i suppose said grummidge rising and opening the door  blackboy bounded away in wild haste  hm he seems in a hurry  perhaps its a bear this time  well mate how dye feel now he added closing the door and returning to his seat  grummidge said the sick man in a low voice ill never git over this  that seal have done for me  theres injury somewheres inside o me i feel sure on it  but thats not what i was going to speak about i want to make a clean breast of it afore i goes  ive been a bad man grummidge theres no question about that in my own mind whatever may be in the mind of others  i had even gone the length of making up my mind to murder you the first safe chance i got for which and all else ive done and thought agin ye i ax your pardon  you have it said his friend earnestly  thank ee  thats just what i expected grummidge  now what i want to know is dye think god will forgive me  the seaman was perplexed  such a question had never been put to him before and he knew not what to answer  after a few moments consideration he replied  what you say is true swinton  youve bin a bad lot ever since ive knowd ye  i wont go for to deny that  as to what the almighty will do or wont do how can i tell  i wish i knew more about such things myself for id like to help you but i cant  suddenly an idea flashed into his mind and he continued  but it do seem to me swinton that if a poor sinner like me is willin to forgive ye aint the almighty likely to be much more willin  theres somethin in that grummidgesomethin in that said the sick man eagerly  then the hopeful look disappeared as he added slowly but i fear grummidge that what you say dont quite fit my case for ive got a notion that the almighty must have been willin all my life to save me from myself and that all my life ive bin refusin to listen to him  how dye make that out boy  this way  theres bin somethin or other inside o me as far back as i can remember that somehow didnt seem to be me that has been always sayin dont to me whenever i was agoin to do a mean thing  now i cant help thinkin that it must have bin god that spoke for a man would never say dont to himself an then go right off an do it would he  thats more than i can tell answered grummidge  i remember hearin master burns atalkin on that point wi the cappen an he thought it was conscience or the voice of god  well conscience or no conscience ive resisted it all my life returned the sick man an it do seem a mean sneakin sort o thing to come to the almighty at the very last moment when i cant help myself an say im sorry  it would be meaner to say im not sorry wouldnt it returned grummidge  but now i think of it master burns did read one or two things out o that writin that hes so fond of which he says is the word of god  if its true what he says he may well be fond of it but i wonder how he has found that out  anyway i remember that one o the things he read out of it was that the lamb of god takes away the sins of the world an he explained that jesus is the lamb of god an that he stands in our placetakes our punishment instead of us an fulfils the law instead of us  the sick man listened attentively even eagerly but shook his head  how can any man stand in my place or take my punishments he said in a tone savouring almost of contempt  as far as i can see every man will have enough to do to answer for himself  thats just what come into my mind too when i heard master burns speak returned the other but he cleared that up by explainin that jesus is god as well as mangod with us he said  that do seem strange rejoined the sick man and if true he added thoughtfully theres somethin in it grummidge somethin in it to give a man comfort  well mate im of your mind about that for if god himself be for us surely nobody can be agin us said the seaman unconsciously paraphrasing the word of scripture itself  blow high or blow low that seems to me an anchor that you an mes safe to hang on to  the conversation was interrupted at this point by the sudden entrance of jim heron with an arrow sticking in the fleshy part of his back  attacked by savages he gasped  here grummidge lend a hand to haul out thisi cant well reach it  they came on us behind the big store tother side o the settlement and after lettin fly at us took to their heels  the lads are after them  i got separated from the boys and was shot as you see so i camehah pull gently grummidgecame back here that you might haul it out for its hard to run an fight with an arrow in your back  stay here jim said grummidge after hastily extracting the shaft you couldnt do much with a wound like that  ill take your place and follow up the men and youll take mine here as nurse to swinton  we mustnt leave him alone you know  eager though jim heron was at first for the fray the loss of blood had reduced his ardour and made him willing to fall in with this proposal  goodbye grummidge cried swinton as the former having snatched up his knife and bow was hastening to the door  goodbyegoodbye mate he responded turning back and grasping the proffered hand  youll be all right soon old chapand jims a better nurse than i am  i like what you said about that anchor mate ill not forget it said swinton sinking back on his pillow as grummidge sallied forth to join in the pursuit of the savages  the stout seamans movements were watched by some hundreds of glittering black eyes the owners of which were concealed amid the brushwood of the adjoining forest  meanwhile at the other end of the settlement the greater number of the shipwrecked mariners were engaged in hot pursuit of the party of indians who had attacked them  they were very indignant several of their mates having been wounded and a considerable quantity of their stores carried off  it quickly became apparent however that the seamen were no match for savage at a race through the woods therefore grummidge who soon overtook his comrades called a halt and gathered as many of his men as possible around him  now lads he said its plain that some of you cant run much further  you aint used to this sort o work  besides we have left our settlement undefended  most of you must therefore return an a few of the smartest among you will follow me for we must give these rascals a fright by followin em till we catch emif we canor by drivin em back to their own place wherever that may be  many of the men were more than willing to agree to this arrangement while others were quite ready to follow their leader  the party therefore that finally continued in pursuit of the indians was composed of grummidge george blazer fred taylor little stubbs garnet squill and several others  armed with bows arrows short spears and clubs these set off without delay into the forest trusting to the sun and stars for guidance  the remainder of the men returned to the settlement where they discovered that they had been the victims of a ruse on the part of the savages  the assault at the further end of the settlement proved to be a mere feint made by a comparatively small party for the purpose of drawing the seamen away and leaving the main part of the settlement undefended and open to pillage  while the small detachment of indians therefore was doing its part the main body descended swiftly but quietly on wagtail bay and possessed themselves of all that was valuable there and carried it off  of course swinton and jim heron were found there  both had been beheaded and their bodies stripped and left on the floor  heron seemed to have offered a stout resistance until overpowered by numbers and slain  poor swinton who could not have had much more life remaining than enabled him to understand what was occurring had been stabbed to death where he lay  fortunately it was not possible for the indians to carry off all the dried fish and other provisions so that the men were not reduced to absolute starvation  all ignorant of what was going on at the settlement the avengers were pushing their way through the woods in pursuit of the smaller body of savages  nothing could have been more satisfactory to these latter from every eminence and knoll unseen eyes watched the movements of the white men who remained under the delusion that they were striking terror into the hearts of a flying foe  sure well have to take a rest soon said squill as they halted on the top of a mound about sunset to breathe and wipe their heated brows  true a short sleep we must have but well have to take our rest without kindling a fire said grummidge  ay an go supperless to bed too remarked little stubbs for weve brought nothing to eat with us  this fact had not struck any of the party till that moment  they had been so eager in pursuit of the foe that all prudential considerations had been thrown to the winds  they now lay down therefore to the very brief rest that was absolutely needful not only without supper but with the prospect of starting again without breakfast  however each man felt bound in honour not to damp his fellows by complaining  now boys said grummidge you lie down an ill mount guard  sleep as fast as you can for ill route ye out in an hour or so  but grummidge did not fulfil his promise  seating himself with his back to a tree his bows and arrows ready to hand and actuated by a firm resolve to watch with intense care he fell fast asleep and the whole party snored in concert  about fifty indians who had joined the original attacking party had waited patiently for this state of affairs  when quite certain that the seamen were all sleeping soundly they crept silently forward and pounced upon them  the struggle was sharp but short  courage and strength are futile when opposed to overwhelming numbers  a few minutes later and the white men were led with hands bound behind them into the depth of the unknown wilderness    chapter nineteen  a new friend with startling news  turn we now to the island in the great lake where hendrick the hunter had set up his romantic home  the premature touch of winter which had put so sudden a stop to the work of our explorers gave way to a burst of warmth and sunshine almost as sudden  it was that brief period of calm repose in which nature indulges in some parts of the world as if to brace herself for the rough work of approaching winter  there was a softness in the air which induced one to court its embrace  absolute stillness characterised the inanimate world  clouds floated in the heavenly blue in rotund masses which seemed to the careless glance as unchangeable as the hills and the glassy water reflected them with perfect fidelity  it also reflected gulls ducks plover and other wildfowl as they sailed whirred or waded about absorbed in the activities of their domestic economy or in the hilarious enjoyment of the sweet influences around them  colours most resplendent dyed the forest trees gentle sounds from bird and beast told of joyous life everywhere and the blessed sun threw a golden haze over wood and lake and hill  it was as though paradise had been restored to man and our loving creator had swept away every trace of evil and misery from the beautiful earth  but although the day is surely coming when through jesus christ sorrow and sighing shall flee away paradise had certainly not returned to earth at the date we write of  doubtless however something which seemed marvellously like it had reappeared round the hunters home for while all nature was peaceful as well as beautiful love was the grand motive power which actuated the hearts of those who dwelt there and that love had been greatly intensified as well as purified since the advent of paul burns with the manuscript gospel of john in his bosom and the spirit of god in his heart  besides being naturally sympathetic paul and hendrick were thus drawn still more strongly together as they communed with each other sometimes while walking through the forest engaged in the chase often beside the campfire after supper while others slept and not unfrequently while paddling in their canoe over the sleeping lake  one evening they were in the latter positionreturning from a successful days hunt in the canoewhen hendrick became more communicative than usual about the indian tribe to which his wife belonged and in regard to which subject he had hitherto been reticent the sun was setting the island home was not far distant  the total absence of wind and consequent stillness of the lake rendered it unnecessary to do more than make an occasional dip of the paddles with which the light craft was propelledpaul using his in the bow while hendrick sat in the stern and steered  no one was with themindeed the canoe was too small to carry more than two when loaded with the proceeds of the chase  i have often thought said the hunter dipping his paddle lazily that you must wonder why one whose position in the world warranted his looking forward to a bright and prosperous career should inflict on himself voluntary banishment and wed an indian woman  hendrick returned paul i wonder at few things in this life for i know something of the working of the human mind and heart and have ceased to judge other mens feelings by my own  besides i criticise not the actions of my friend  the motives of his acts are known only to himself and his god  the gospel tells me to judge not according to the appearance  moreover the longer i live with you the more have i learned to know that there are qualities in trueheart which would do honour to dames of the highest station  a gleam of satisfaction lightened the hunters face for a moment as he exclaimed with unwonted energy you do her no more than justice my friend  i have lived to learn that love truth and every virtue are to be found in every stationalike with the highborn and the lowly also that the lack of these qualities is common to both and to say truth i had rather mate with a gentle savage than with a civilised female tiger  but trueheart is not a gentle savage returned paul scarcely able to repress a smile at the tone in which his friend uttered his sentiments she is a gentle woman  of course i know that rejoined hendrick moreover she is a halfcaste  i only used the word to designate the class of humanity to which she belongs and to contrast her with that other class which deems itself at the top of the civilised tree  but it seems to me master hendrick that you are inclined to be too severe on the highborn  there are those among them whose lives conform to the teachings of the gospel of jesus  do i not know it replied the hunter abruptly  have i not told you that my murdered wife was highborn and endowed with every grace  true but what of this civilised female tiger whom you would scorn to wed  did not christ die for her  may she not be saved by the same power that drags the tiger of the lower ranksboth male and female from the pit  i doubt it not answered hendrick thoughtfully as he relapsed into his usual quiet manner and i am glad you appreciate trueheart for she is worthy of your regard  her name was bestowed on her by her indian relations  my children i have named after some of my kindred in the old country  the tribe to which my wife belongs are called bethucks  they are welldisposed and kindly in disposition and do not quarrel among themselves more than other human beingsindeed not so much as men in our own land probably because they have not so much to quarrel about and have more elbowroom  they are good kinsmen as i know good hunters also and inclined for peace but the natives of labrador render peace impossible for they make frequent raids on our island and of course we have to drive them away  if white men now come to newfoundland i fear that the poor bethucks will be exterminated  the bethucks are now extinct  i trust not said paul  so do i returned hendrick and if the gospel you have brought here only takes good root in our own land all will be well for if men acted on the command let us love one another war and robbery murder and strife would be at an end  can we expect all men to act upon that precept asked paul  apparently not but we might at least expect christians to do so those who accept the gospel as their book of law  i had expected to escape from war and bloodshed when i left civilised lands and settled here but i have been disappointed  the necessity for fighting still exists  and will exist until the reign of jesus extends to every human heart returned paul  it seems to me that what we have some right and ground to expect is not the stoppage of all war but the abolition of war between nations calling themselves christian  it is a curious circumstance that only a few days after the above conversation an incident occurred which induced both paul and hendrick to buckle on their armour and sally forth with a clear perception that it was their bounden duty to engage in war  that incident was the arrival of an indian hunter who was slightly known to hendricks wife  he came in a canoe just as the family on the island were about to sit down to supper  it was dark when his tall figure was seen to stalk out of the surrounding gloom into the circle of firelight  trueheart recognised him at once and a word from her sufficed to inform her husband that the stranger was a friend  he was welcomed of course cordially and made to sit down in the place of honour  every attention he accepted with the grave solemnity of an owl and without any other recognition than a mild grunt which was by no means meant as a surly return of thanks but as a quiet mode of intimating that the attention was agreeable to his feelings  it may perhaps be not unknown to the reader that grave reticence is one of the characteristics of the red men of the west  they are never in a hurry to communicate their news whether important or otherwise but usually on arriving at any hospitable abode sit down with calm dignity and smoke a pipe or make slight reference to unimportant matters before coming to the main point of their visitif it have a main point at all  as it is with the red men now so was it with the bethucks at the time we write of  true the pernicious practice of smoking tobacco had not yet been introduced among them so that the social pipe was neither offered desired nor missed but the indian accepted a birchbark basket of soup with placid satisfaction and consumed it with slow felicity  then being offered a formidable venison steak he looked calmly at his host blinked his thanksor whatever he feltand devoured it  has he got nothing to say for himself asked captain trench surprised at the mans silence  plenty to say i doubt not answered hendrick who then explained to the captain the indian characteristic just referred to  what a power of suction he has got said olly referring not to the indian but to the family baby which he had got on his knee and was feeding with a dangerously large lump of bears fat  what does he say asked paul referring to their visitor who having come to a temporary pause with a sigh of contentment had said something in his native tongue to hendrick  he asked me if the singingbirds will gladden his ears and cause his heart to thrill  what means he by that  he only refers to a fact well known among the indians replied the hunter with a quiet smile that trueheart and goodred have such sweet voices that they are known everywhere by the name of the singingbirds happening to have some knowledge of music i have trained them to sing in parts one or two hymns taught to me by my mother and composed i believe by a good monk of the olden time  some things in the hymns puzzled me i confess until i had the good fortune to meet with you  i understand them better now  you shall hear one of them  so saying he turned and nodded to trueheart who of course understood the conversation  with a slight inclination of the head denoting acquiescence she began to sing  at the same moment goodred parted her pretty lips and joined her  the result was to fill the air with harmony so sweet that the captain and his comrade were struck dumb with delight and surprise the indians jaw was arrested with an unchewed morsel in the mouth and the family baby gazing upward in wonder ceased the effort to choke itself on bears fat  it need scarcely be said that the grunt of the indian was very emphatic when the sounds died away like fairymusic and that the hunters white guests entreated for more  trueheart and her daughter were quite willing and for a considerable time kept their audience enthralled  at last having washed down his meal with a final basketful of soup the indian began to unbosom himself of his newsa few words at a time  it was soon found however that he had no news of importance to tell  he was a hunter he had been out with a party of his tribe but having differed with them as to the best district to be visited he had left them and continued the hunt alone  being not far distant from the home of the white hunter who had mated with the bethuck singingbird he had turned aside for no other purpose than to have his ears gladdened and his heart thrilled  we are happy said hendrick that our bethuck brother should have his ears gladdened and his heart thrilled and we trust that the spirit of the wolf within him is subdued now that his stomach is also filled  a polite grunt was the reply  will our bethuck brother tell us more news  there is no more he answered strongbow is now an empty vessel  considering that strongbow has just filled himself with venison he can hardly call himself an empty vessel responded the hunter with intense gravity  strongbow turned his head quickly and gazed at the speaker  his solemnity deepened  could his white brother be jesting  the white brothers gravity forbade the idea  in order to convey more strongly the fact that he had no news to give the indian touched his foreheadstrongbow is empty here  that may well be remarked hendrick quietly  again the indian glared  solemnity is but a feeble word after all  he said nothing but was evidently puzzled  has our bethuck brother seen no enemies from the setting sun  is all quiet and peaceful among his friends asked the hunter  all is peacefulall is quiet  but we have news of a war party that left us many days past  they had gone about the time that the deer begin to move to punish some white men who were cast on shore by the sea where the sun rises  what say you cried hendrick starting  have the red warriors been successful  they have  some of the white men have been killed others caught and taken to our wigwams to be made slaves or to die  the consternation of paul and his friends on this being translated to them may be imagined  past injuries were forgotten and instant preparations were made to set off to the rescue at the earliest dawn of the following day    chapter twenty  the rescue partya rencontre and bad news  hot haste now marked the proceedings of the rescue party for paul and his friends felt that they had no time to lose  fortunately the weather favoured them  that very night a sharp frost set in hardening the moist and swampy grounds over which they had to pass  strongbow on being made acquainted with the state of matters willingly agreed to lead the party to the place to which he thought it likely the captives had been taken or where at least information about them might be obtained from members of his own tribe  little oscar at his own urgent request was allowed to accompany them and trueheart goodred and the family baby and nurse were left in charge of an old indian whose life had once been saved by hendrick and who although too old to go on the warpath was still well able to keep the family in provisions  although the party was smallnumbering only six two of whom were boysit was nevertheless formidable each man being more than usually powerful as well as valiant whilst the boys although comparatively small possessed so much of the unconquerable spirit of their sires as to render them quite equal to average men  the frost which seemed to have fairly set in kept them cool during the day while walking and rendered their bivouacfires agreeable at nights little time however was allowed for rest or food  they pressed on each day with unflagging energy and felt little disposition to waste time in conversation during the brief halts for needed rest and food  occasionally however some of the party felt less disposed than usual for sleep and sought to drive away anxiety regarding their old shipmates by talking of things and scenes around them  does strongbow think that the frost will hold asked hendrick one evening after supper as he reclined in front of the fire on a pile of brushwood  strongbow cannot tell returned the indian  it looks like thaw but the great spirit sometimes changes his mind and sends what we do not expect  having uttered this cautious reply with sententious gravity he continued his supper in silence  the great spirit never changes his mind said paul  perfection cannot change because it need not  waugh replied the indian  it was evident that he did not agree with paul but was too polite to say so  i like this sort o thing remarked captain trench looking up from the rib on which he was engaged and gazing round at the magnificent sweep of hill and dale of which they had a birdseye view from their camp  so do i daddy with lots to eat an a roarin fire a fellow feels as happy as a king said oliver  happier than most kings i doubt not returned hendrick  but olly you have mentioned only two of the things that go to produce felicity said paul  food and fire are certainly important elements but these would be of little avail if we had not health strength and appetite  to say nothin of the fresh air o the mountains and the excitement o the wilderness and the enthusiasm of youth added the captain  are you not as happy as me daddy asked the boy with a sudden glance of intelligence  happier a great deal i should say replied the father for im not so much of a goose  why then daddy if you are happier than we what you call the enthusiasm of youth can have nothing to do with it you know  you young rascal the enthusiasm of middle age is much more powerful than that of youth  you let your tongue wag too freely  dye hear that osky said oliver to his little companion in an audible whisper  theres comfort for you an me  well be more enthusiastic and far happier when we come to middle age  what dye think o that  oscarwho although much inclined to fun and humour did not always understand the curious phases of them presented to him by his civilised friendlooked innocently in his face and said me no tink about it at all  whereupon olly burst into a short laugh and expressed his belief that on the whole that state of mind was about the happiest he could come to  how long think you will it take us to reach the wigwams of your kindred from this point asked hendrick of their guide as he prepared to lie down for the night  two days answered the indian  god grant that we may be in time murmured paul i fear a thaw for it would delay us greatly  that which was feared came upon them the next day  they were yet asleep when those balmy influences which alone have power to disrupt and destroy the icekings reign began to work and when the travellers awoke the surface of the land was moist  it was not soft however for time is required to draw frost out of the earth so that progress was not much impeded  still the effect of the thaw depressed their spirits a good deal for they were well aware that a continuance of it would render the low grounds into which they had frequently to descend almost impassable  it was therefore with anxious forebodings that they lay down to rest that night and pauls prayer for strength and guidance was more fervent than usual  about this period of the year changes of temperature are sometimes very abrupt and their consequences curious  during the night frost had again set in with great intensity  fatigue had compelled the party to sleep longer than usual despite their anxiety to press forward and when they awoke the rays of the rising sun were sweeping over the whole landscape and revealing as well as helping to create a scene of beauty which is seldom if ever witnessed elsewhere  when rain falls with a low thermometer near the earth it becomes frozen the moment it reaches the ground and thus a regular deposit of pure glassy ice takes place on every branch and twig of the leafless shrubs and trees  the layer of ice goes on increasing sometimes till it attains the thickness of half an inch or more  thus in a few hours a magical transformation is brought about  the trees seem to be hung with glittering jewels the larger limbs are edged with dazzling iceropes the minutest twigs with threads of gleaming crystal and all this with the sun shooting on and through it presents a scene of splendour before which even our most vivid conceptions of fairyland must sink into comparative insignificance  such then was the vision presented to the gaze of the rescue party on awaking that morning  to some of them it was a new revelation of the wonderful works of god  to hendrick and the indian it was familiar enough  the newfoundlanders of modern times know it well by the name of a silver thaw  after the first gaze of surprise and admiration our travellers made hasty preparation to resume the journey and the frost told beneficially on them in more ways than one for while it hardened the ground it rendered the atmosphere clear and exhilarating thus raising their spirits and their hopes which tended greatly to increase their power of action and endurance  that night they encamped again on a commanding height and prepared supper with the hopeful feelings of men who expect to gain the end of their journey on the morrow  as if to cheer them still more the aurora borealis played in the heavens that night with unwonted magnificence  it is said that the northern lights are grander in newfoundland even than in the arctic regions  at all events they were finer than anything of the kind that had ever before been seen by paul burns or captain trench and his son insomuch that the sight filled them with feelings of awe  the entire heavens seemed to be ablaze from horizon to zenith not as with the lurid fires of a great conflagration which might suggest only the idea of universal devastation but with the tender sheen of varied halftints playfully shooting athwart and intermingling with brighter curtains of light of every conceivable hue  the repose of the party was somewhat interfered with by the wonders that surrounded them that night and more than once they were startled from slumber by the loud report of great limbs of trees which strong though they seemed to be were torn off by the load of ice that had accumulated on them  daybreak found the party again passing swiftly over the land  it really seemed as if even the boys had received special strength for the occasion for they neither lagged behind nor murmured but kept well up during the whole forced march  no doubt that youthful enthusiasm to which captain trench had referred kept olly up to the mark while osky as his friend called himhad been inured to hard labour of every kind from infancy  at last about noon that day their leader came to a sudden halt and pointed to something on the ground before him  what does he see asked paul in a low voice  footprints said hendrick  what ofdeer asked the captain in a hoarse whisper  nonatives  perhaps his friends  while they were whispering the indian was on his knees examining the footprints in question  rising after a few minutes survey with a grave look he said  strongbow is not sure  the prints look like those of his tribe but he is not sure  at all events we can follow them said hendrick  the land is open we cannot easily be surprised and we have our weapons handy  as he spoke he drew an arrow from his quiver and affixing the notch to the bowstring carried the weapon in his left hand  the others followed his example  oliver felt his belt behind to make sure that the axe was there and glanced at the mighty club that hung from his shoulder  oscar regarding with a slight degree of wonder the warlike arrangements of his friend also fitted an arrow to his little bow and then with cautious steps and inquiring glances the party continued to advance  but hendrick was wrong in supposing that a surprise was not probable for suddenly from behind a frowning rock or cliff there appeared a band of armed men who confronted them and instantly raised their bows to shoot  quick as lightning the white men did the same  evidently both parties were taken by surprise for if the indians had been a party in ambush they would have shot at the others without showing themselves this or some such idea seemed to flash into the minds of both parties for there was a slight hesitation on the part of each  just at that moment a large black dog which accompanied the indians and had displayed all its formidable teeth and gums on seeing the strangers was observed to cover its teeth and wag its tail interrogatively  hendrick gave a low whistle  instantly the dog bounded towards him and began to fawn and leap upon and around him with every demonstration of excessive joy at sight of which both parties lowered their weapons  the dog is an old friend explained hendrick to paul  good dog he added addressing the animal in the indian tongue you are a faithful friendfaithful in time of need  then dropping his bow and advancing unarmed to the indians he said  this dog belongs to the bethucks of grand lake  did you obtain him from them  no we did not replied one of the indians who seemed from his bearing to be a chief but we are kinsmen of the men of grand lake one of their braves little beaver took one of our girls rising sun for his wife  we come from yonder pointing northward  some moons have passed since little beaver who came to revisit us with his wife left us to return to his wigwam on grand lake  i know little beaver well said hendrick as the chief paused at this point the dog belongs to him  without noticing the remark the chief continued  when little beaver and rising sun left us they went on alone by the shores of the great salt lake  we never saw our brave in life again some time after a party of our warriors came upon a grave  they examined it and found the dead body of little beaver  it was bruised and many bones were broken  a party of white men had built lodges near to the place  it was they who had murdered little beaver we knew for there was no sign of others near and his dog was with them  so our braves went to the kinsmen of rising sun and we returned and attacked the palefaces  did you slay all the palefaces asked hendrick anxiously  no some we slew others we took prisoners  hendrick thought it best to reserve in the meantime his communication of all this to paul and his friends  i am your kinsman also he said to the chief for trueheart is my wife  i have much to say to you but our business is pressing  will you walk with me while we talk  the chief bowed his head and ordered his party to fall to the rear and follow while he walked in advance with the palefaced hunter  hendrick then explained to the indian as much about the wreck of the water wagtail and the dismissal of captain trench and his comrades as he thought necessary and then said that although his three friends were indignant at the treatment they had received from their comrades they would be grieved to hear that any of them were to be killed and he greatly wished to prevent that  would the chief guide him to the place where the prisoners were  i will guide you said the chief but you will find it hard to save them  palefaces have slain little beaver and stolen rising sun and palefaces must die    chapter twenty one  old friends in a sad plight  anxious though paul burns naturally was for the fate of the crew of the water wagtail he could not help being interested in and impressed by the fine country which he was thus unexpectedly obliged to traverse his mind being of a practical and utilitarian cast as well as religious he not only admired the grand and richly diversified land as being part of the works of god but as being eminently suitable for the use and enjoyment of man  look there he said to captain trench as they plodded steadily along at the same time pointing to a break in a neighbouring cliff which revealed the geological features of the land  do you see yonder beds of rock of almost every colour in the rainbow  these are marblebeds and from the look of the parts that crop out i should say they are extensive  but not of much use returned the captain so long as men are content to house themselves in huts of bark and skins  so might some shortsighted mortal among our own savage forefathers have said long ago if the mineral wealth of britain had been pointed out to him returned paul  yet we have lived to see the abbey of westminster and many other notable edifices arise in our land  then you look forward to suchlike rising in this land said the captain with something of a cynical smile  well not exactly master trench but our grandchildren may see them if men will only colonise the land and strive to develop its resources on christian principles  such as asked trench  such as the doing to others as one would have others do to onesself and the enacting of equal laws for rich and poor  then will newfoundland never be developed said the captain emphatically for history tells us that the bulk of men have never been guided by such principles since the days of adam  since when were you enrolled among the prophets master trench  since you uttered the previous sentence master paul  i appeal to your own knowledge of history  nay i question not your historical views but your prophetical statements as to the fate of this island  have you not heard of this writingthat the knowledge of the lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea  does not that signify completeness in the spread of knowledge  and when that comes to pass will it bear no good fruit if not why is it recorded as a blessed state of things to which we may look forward and towards which we may strive  i admit that the wickedness of man may delay the desired end  unjust laws interference with freedom of action hatred of truth may check progress here as it has done elsewhere but who can tell how soon the truth as it is in jesus may begin to operate or how rapidly it may culminate  you may be right master paul i know not  anyhow i withdraw my claim to be numbered with the prophetsall the more that i see strongbow making signals which i dont rightly understand  the indian guide who had been walking somewhat in advance of the party was seen standing on the summit of a knoll making signals not to his friends behind him but apparently to some one in front  hastening forward they soon found that he had discovered friendsa body of indians who were hurrying to meet him while down in the valley beyond which suddenly burst upon their view stood an extensive indian village it was of that evanescent and movable kind which consists of conelike tents made of skins and bark spread upon poles  they are friends said strongbow when hendrick and the others reached him kinsmen of the murdered little beaver  friends of hendrick also i see said the captain to paul as the hunter hastened forward to meet the indians and salute them  he was right and a few minutes conversation with his friends sufficed to put the guide in possession of all he wished to know  returning to his companions he at once relieved their minds to some extent at least by telling them that it was indeed the tribe into whose hands their old shipmates had fallen and that the sailors were still alive and well though prisoners and lying under sentence of death  come that at all events is good news said paul  i thank god we are not too late and i make no doubt that we will persuade the indians to delay execution of the sentence till we find out whether or not they have been guilty of this murder  some of our old shipmates i know are capable of it but others are certainly innocent  hendrick did not at once reply  it was evident from his looks that he had not much hope in the merciful disposition of the indians  i know some men of this tribe he said but not all of themthough they all know me by report  you may at least depend on my influence being used to the utmost in behalf of your friends  come we will descend  a few minutes walk brought them to the foot of the hill where the indian tents were pitched  here they found a multitude of men women and children watching them as they descended the hill and from the looks of many of the former it seemed not at all improbable that a rough reception awaited them  you see said paul in a low voice to the captain they probably class us with the murderers because of our white skins  our only hope under god rests in hendrick  that pauls hope was not illfounded became apparent the moment the hunter made himself known  for the scowling brows cleared at once and one or two men who had formerly met with the white hunter came forward and saluted him in the european manner which he had already taught to many of the red men namely with a shake of the hand  a great palaver followed in the wigwam of the chief bearpaw in the course of which many things were talked about but we confine our record to that part of the talk which bears specially on our tale  the men must die said bearpaw sternly  what you tell me about their harsh treatment of their chief and his son and friend only proves them to be the more deserving of death  my two young braves who visited them on the island were treated like dogs by some of them and little beaver they have slain  it is just that they should die  but my three friends here returned hendrick treated your braves well and they had no knowledge or part in the killing of little beaver perhaps the palefaces did not kill him  do they admit that they did  how can we tell what they admit  we know not their language nor they ours  but there is no need to palaver  did not strongbow and his braves find the dead body of little beaver bruised and broken  did they not see his black dog in the paleface camp and has not rising sun disappeared like the early frost before the sun  doubtless she is now in the camp with those palefaces who have escaped us but whom we will yet hunt down and kill  bearpaw is right said hendrick murderers deserve to die  but bearpaw is also just he will let the men of the sea speak in their own defence now that i am here to interpret  bearpaw is just returned the chief  he will hear what the palefaces have got to say  one of the young men will take you to their prison  he signed as he spoke to a young indian who instantly left the tent followed by hendrick and his friends  passing right through the village the party reached a precipice on the face of which was what appeared to be the entrance to a cavern  two indians stood in front of it on guard  a voice was heard within which struck familiarly yet strangely on paul and the captains ears  and little wonder for it was the voice of grummidge engaged in the unaccustomed act of prayer  the young indian paused and with a solemn look pointed upwards as if to intimate that he understood the situation and would not interrupt  those whom he led also paused and listenedas did the sentinels though they understood no word of what was said  poor grummidge had evidently been brought very low for his once manly voice was weak and his tones were desponding  never before perhaps was prayer offered in a more familiar or less perfunctory manner  o lord he said do get us out o this here scrape somehow  we dont deserve it though we are awful sinners for weve done nothin as i knows on to hurt them savages  we cant speak to them an they cant speak to us an theres nobody to help us  wont you do it lord  sure its no manner o use goin on like that grummidge said another voice  youve done it more than wance aready an theres no answer very likely weve bin too wicked intirely to deserve an answer at all  speak for yourself squill growled a voice that was evidently that of little stubbs  i dont think ive been as wicked as you would make out nor half as wicked as yourself  anyhow im goin to die game if it comes to that  we can only die once an itll soon be over  ochone groaned squill av it wasnt for the short allowance theyve putt us on an the bad walkin every day an all day i wouldnt mind so much but ive scarce got strength enough left to sneeze an as to my legs och quills they are instid of squills  for shame man remonstrated grummidge to be makin your bad jokes at a time like this  the tone of the conversation now led the young indian to infer that interruption might not be inappropriate so he turned round the corner of rock that hid the interior from view and led his party in front of the captives  they were seated on the ground with their backs against the wall and their arms tied behind them  the aspect of the unfortunate prisoners was indeed forlorn  it would have been ludicrous had it not been intensely pitiful  so woebegone and worn were their faces that their friends might have been excused had they failed to recognise them but even in the depths of his misery and state of semistarvation it was impossible to mistake the expressive visage of poor squill whose legs were indeed reduced to something not unsuggestive of quills to say nothing of the rest of his body  but all the other prisoners grummidge stubbs blazer taylor and garnet were equally reduced and miserable for the harsh treatment and prolonged journeying through forest and swamp over hill and dale on insufficient food had not only brought them to the verge of the grave but had killed outright one or two others of the crew who had started with them  the visitors owing to their position with their backs to the light of the caves mouth could not be recognised by the prisoners who regarded them with listless apathy until captain trench spoke swallowing with difficulty a lump of some sort that nearly choked him  hallo shipmates how goes it  glad to have found ye lads  och exclaimed squill starting up as did all his companions but no other sound was uttered for a few seconds  then a deep thank god escaped from grummidge and little stubbs tried to cheer but with small success while one or two sitting down again laid their thin faces in their hands and wept  reader it were vain to attempt a description of the scene that followed for the prisoners were not only overwhelmed with joy at a meeting so unexpected but were raised suddenly from the depths of despair to the heights of confident hope for they did not doubt that the appearance of their mates as friends of the indians was equivalent to their deliverance  even when told that their deliverance was by no means a certainty their joy was only moderated and their hope but slightly reduced  but tell me said paul as they all sat down together in the cave while the indians stood by and looked silently on what is the truth about this indian who was murdered and the dog and the woman  the indian was never murdered said grummidge stoutly  he had evidently fallen over the precipice  we found him dead and we buried him  his dog came to us at last and made friends with us though it ran away the day the settlement was attacked  as to the woman we never saw or heard of any woman at all till this hour  when bearpaw was told how the matter actually stood he frowned and said sternly  the palefaces lie  if they never saw rising sun why did she not come back to us and tell what had happened  she was not a little child  she was strong and active like the young deer  she could spear fish and snare rabbits as well as our young men  why did she not return  where is she  either she is dead and the palefaces have killed her or they have her still among them  not only shall the palefaces answer for her with their lives but the bethucks will go on the warpath to the coast and sweep the paleface settlement into the sea  it was of no avail that hendrick pleaded the cause of the prisoners earnestly and set forth eloquently all that could be said in their favour especially urging that some of them had been kind to the two indians who first visited the white men  rising sun had been a favourite with the chief she was deadand so the palefaces must die    chapter twenty two  tells of terrible suspenseviolent intentions and religious discussion  now i tell you what it is master hendrick said captain trench the day after their arrival at the indian camp  i see this is goin to be an ugly business an i give you fair warning that im goin to git surly  i wont stand by quietly and see grummidge and my men slaughtered before my eyes without movin a finger  ill keep quiet as long as theres any chance of all your palaverin resulting in anything but if the worst comes to the worst ill show fight even if i should have to stand alone with all the red devils in newfoundland arrayed against me  i honour your feelings captain trench but doubt your judgment  how do you propose to proceed  will you join me  answer me that question first  i will join you in any scheme that is reasonable returned hendrick after a pause but not in a useless attempt to fight against a whole colony of indians  then ill keep my plans of procedure in my own noddle said the captain turning away with an indignant fling and taking the path that led to the cave or prisonhouse of his shipmates for as yet they were allowed free intercourse with their friends  grummidge said he in a stern voice as he squatted down on the floor beside the unfortunate seaman things look bad theres no doubt about that an it would be unkind deception to say otherwise for that villain bearpaw seems to git harder and harder the more they try to soften him  now what i want to know is are you an the others prepared to join me if i manage to cut your cords an give you weapons an  shush clap a stopper on your mouth cappen said grummidge in an undertone the redskins are listening  an what then  they know no more about english than i know about timbuctoosh returned the captain irascibly  let em listen  what i was agoin to say is are you an the other lads ready to follow me into the woods an bolt if we can or fight to the death if we cant  sure an im ready to fight interposed squill or to follow ye to the end o the world an further but if i do ill have to leave my legs behind me for theyre fit for nothin  true it is i feel a little stronger since your friend hendrick got the bastes to increase our allowance o grub but im not up to much yet  howsiver im strong enough praps to die fightin  anyhow ill try  so will i said little stubbs  i feel twice the man i was since you found us  putt me down on the list too capn said fred taylor who was perhaps the least reduced in strength of any of the prisoners  im game for anything short o murder  similar sentiments having been expressed by his other friends the captains spirit was somewhat calmed  leaving them he went into the woods to ponder and work out his plans there he met paul and hendrick  we are going to visit the prisoners said the former  youll find em in a more hopeful frame of mind observed the captain  i wish they had better ground for their hopes returned his friend but bearpaw is inexorable  we are to have a final meeting with him tomorrow  i go now to have a talk with our poor friends  it may be that something in their favour shall be suggested  nothing however was suggested during the interview that followed which gave the remotest hope that anything they could say or do would influence the savage chief in favour of his prisoners  indeed even if he had been mercifully disposed the anger of his people against the seamenespecially the relatives of little beaver and those who had been wounded during the attack on wagtail settlementwould have constrained him to follow out what he believed to be the course of justice  when the final meeting between the visitors and the chief took place the latter was surrounded by his principal warriors  hendrick he said in reply to a proposal that execution should be at least delayed the name of the white hunter who has mated with the bethuck girl is respected everywhere and his wishes alone would move bearpaw to pardon his paleface foes but blood has been shed and the price of blood must be paid  hendrick knows our lawsthey cannot be changed  the relations of little beaver cry aloud for it  tell your paleface friends that bearpaw has spoken  when this was interpreted to paul burns a sudden thought flashed into his mind and standing forth with flushed countenance and raised arm he said  hendrick tell the chief of the bethucks that when the great spirit formed man he made him without sin and gave him a just and holy law to obey but man broke the law and the great spirit had said that the price of the broken law is death  so there seemed no hope for man because he could not undo the past and the great spirit would not change his law  but he found a way of deliverance  the great spirit himself came down to earth and as the man jesus christ paid the price of the broken law with his own blood so that guilty but forgiven man might go free  now if the great spirit could pardon the guilty and set them free would it be wrong in bearpaw to follow his example  this was such a new idea to the indian that he did not at first reply he stood with folded arms and knitted brow pondering the question  at last he spoke slowly  bearpaw knows not the thing about which his paleface brother speaks it may be true  it seems very strange  he will inquire into the matter hereafter  but the laws that guide the great spirit are not the laws that guide men  what may be fit in him may not be fit in them  my darkskinned brother is wrong said hendrick  the law that guides the great spirit and that should guide all his creatures is one and the same  it is the law of love  was it love that induced the palefaces to kill little beaver and steal rising sun demanded the chief fiercely  it was not replied hendrick it was sin and bearpaw has now an opportunity to act like the great spirit by forgiving those who he thinks have sinned against him  never returned the chief vehemently  the palefaces shall die but they shall live one day longer while this matter is considered in council for it is only children who act in haste  go  bearpaw has spoken  to have secured even the delay of a single day was almost more than the prisoners friends had hoped for and they resolved to make the most of it  now hendrick said paul when they were in the tent that had been set aside for their use we must be prepared you and i to give the chief a full account of our religion for depend on it his mind has been awakened and he wont rest satisfied with merely discussing the subject with his men of war  true paul what do you propose to do  the first thing i shall do is to pray for guidance  after that i will talk with you  for my part said captain trench as paul rose and left the tent i see no chance of moving that savage by religion or anything else so ill go an make arrangements for the carryin out o my plans  come along to the woods with me olly i shall want your help  father said the boy in a serious tone as they entered the forest surely you dont mean to carry out in earnest the plan you spoke of to grummidge and the others yesterday  why not my son  because we are sure to be all killed if you do  as well might we try to stop the rising tide as to subdue a whole tribe of savages  and would you olly said the seaman stopping and looking sternly at the boy would you advise me to be so mean as to look on at the slaughter of my shipmates without making one effort to save them  i would never advise you to do anything mean father an if i did so advise you you wouldnt do it but the effort you think of makin would not save the men  it would only end in all of us bein killed  well and what o that  would it be the first time that men have been killed in a good cause  but a cause cant be a good one unless some good comes of it  if there was a chance at all i would say go at em daddy an bowl em down like skittles but you know theres no chance in your plan  boltin into the woods an gittin lost would be little use in the face o savages that can track a deer by invisible footprints  an fighting them would be like fighting moskitoesone thousand down another thousand come on  besides when you an i are killedwhich were sure to bewhat would come o mother sittin there all alone day after day wonderin why we never come back though we promised to do so think how anxious itll make her for years to come an how brokenhearted at last an think how careful she always was of you dont you remember in that blessed letter she sent me just before we sailed how she tells me to look well after you an sew the frogs on your seacoat when they git loose for she knows youll never do it yourself but will be fixin it up with a wooden skewer or a bit o ropeyarn  an how i was to see an make you keep your feet dry by changin your hose for you when you were asleep for youd never change them yourself till all your toes an heels came through em  ah daddy it will be a bad job for mother if they kill you and me  but what can i do olly said the mariner in a somewhat husky voice when this pathetic picture was presented to his view  your mother would be the last to advise me to stand by and look on without moving a finger to save em  what can i do olly  what can i do  this question was more easily put than answered  poor oliver looked as perplexed as his sire  praps he said we might do as paul said hed do an pray about it  well we might do worse my son  if i only could believe that the almighty listens to us an troubles himself about our small affairs i  dont you think it likely father interrupted the boy that if the almighty took the trouble to make us he will take the trouble to think about and look after us  theres somethin in that olly  common sense points out that theres somethin in that  whether or not the captain acted on his sons suggestion there is no record to tell  all we can say is that he spent the remainder of that day in a very disturbed almost distracted state of mind now paying short visits to the prisoners anon making sudden rushes towards the chiefs tent with a view to plead their cause and checking himself on remembering that he knew no word of the indian tongue now and then arguing hotly with paul and hendrick that all had not been done which might or ought to have been done and sometimes hurrying into the woods alone  meanwhile as had been anticipated the chief sent for hendrick and paul to demand an explanation of the strange words which they had used about forgiveness and the broken law of the great spirit and jesus christ  it would be out of place here to enter into the details of all that was said on both sides but it may not be uninteresting to state that during the discussion both the palefaces and the red men became so intensely absorbed in contemplation of the vast region of comparatively new thought into which they were insensibly led that they forgot for the time being the main object of the meeting namely the ultimate fate of the captives  that the chief and his warriors were deeply impressed with the gospel message was evident but it was equally evident that the former was not to be moved from his decision and in this the warriors sympathised with him  his strong convictions in regard to retributive justice were not to be shaken  no he said at the end of the palaver the blood of a bethuck has been shed the blood of the palefaces must flow  but tell him that that is not just even according to his own views said paul  the blood of one paleface ought to suffice for the blood of one bethuck  this was received in silence  evidently it had some weight with the chief  the paleface is right he said after a minutes thought  only one shall die  let the prisoners decide among themselves who shall be killed  go bearpaw has spokenwaugh  a few minutes later and the prisoners with their friends were assembled in the cave discussing this new phase of their case  its horrible said grummidge  dye think the chief is really in earnest  there can be no doubt of it said hendrick  then my lads ill soon bid ye all farewell for as i was your leader when the socalled murder was done im bound in honour to take the consequences  not at all cried squill whose susceptible heart was touched with this readiness to selfsacrifice  you cant be spared yet grummidge if any man shud die its the irishman  shure its used we are to bein kilt anyhow  therell be none o you killed at all cried captain trench starting up with looks of indignation  ill go and carry out my plansah you neednt look like that olly wi your poor mothers reproachful eyes for im determined to do it right or wrong    chapter twenty three  deliverance  fortunately for captain trench and indeed for the whole party the execution of his plan was rendered unnecessary by an incident the full significance of which requires that we should transport the reader to another but not far distant part of the beautiful wilderness of newfoundland  under the boughs of a spreading larch on the summit of a mound which commanded a wide prospect of plain and morass sat an indian woman  she might have been taken for an old woman so worn and thin was she and so hollow were her cheeks but the glossy blackness of her hair the smoothness of her brow and the glitter of her dark eyes told that she was yet in her youthful years  she sat perfectly listless with a vacant yet steadfast expression on her thin features as if she were dreaming with her eyes open  the view before her was such as might indeed arouse the admiration of the most stolid but it was evident that she took no notice of it for her eyes were fixed on the clouds above the horizon  long she sat almost motionless thus gazing into space  then she began to sing in a low sweet voice a plaintive air which rose and fell for some time more like a tuneful wail than a song  suddenly and in the very midst of her song she burst into a wild laugh which increased in vehemence until it rang through the forest in a scream so terrible that it could be accounted for by nothing but insanity  that the poor creatures reason was indeed dethroned became evident from her subsequent movements for after falling backwards from the exhaustion produced by her effort or it might be from the sheer weakness resulting from partial starvation she got up and began quietly to cut up and devour raw a small bird which she had killed with a stone strengthened a little by this food she rose and made a futile effort to draw more closely around her a little shawl or rather kerchief of deerskin which covered her shoulders shuddering with cold as she did so  her short leathern gown and leggings were so soiled and torn that the ornamental work with which they had been originally decorated was almost invisible and the moccasins she had worn hung in mere shreds upon her little feet  rising slowly and with a weary sigh the poor creature descended the side of the hill and entered the forest at the foot of it  lying concealed in a neighbouring thicket an indian youth had watched the motions of the girl  it was evident from his gaze of surprise that he had just discovered her  it was equally evident from his expression of perplexity that he hesitated to intrude upon one who he could not help seeing was mad but when she moved forward he followed her with the soft wary tread of a panther  at first the girls step was slow and listless  then it became rapid a fit of excitement seemed to come on and she began to run  presently the excitement seemed to have passed for she fell again into the listless walk  after a time she sat down and recommenced her low wailing song  at this point taking advantage of a neighbouring thicket the young indian drew as near to the girl as possible and in a low voice uttered the indian word forrising sun  starting violently the girl turned round stretched out both arms and with intense hope expressed in every feature took a step forward  in an instant the expression vanished  another terrible scream resounded in the air and turning quickly away she fled like a hunted deer  the young man pursued but he evidently did not try to overtake her only to keep her in sight  the maniac did not choose her course but ran straight before her leaping over fallen trees and obstructions with a degree of agility and power that seemed marvellous  sometimes she shrieked as she ran sometimes she laughed fiercely but she never looked back  at last she came to a small lakeabout a quarter of a mile wide  she did not attempt to skirt it but went straight in with a wild rush and being well able to swim struck out for the opposite shore  the young man followed without hesitation but could not overtake her and when he landed she had disappeared in the woods beyond  skilled to follow a trail however the youth soon recovered sight of her but still did not try to overtake heronly to keep her in view  at length the fire which had sustained the poor creature seemed to have burned itself out  in attempting to leap over a low bush rising sun stumbled fell and lay as if dead  the indian youth came up and raising her in his arms looked very sadly into her face  she still breathed but gave no other sign of life  the youth therefore lifted her from the ground  he was tall and strong she was small in person and reduced almost to skin and bone  he carried her in his arms as though she had been but a little child and an hour later bore her into the indian camp for which for many days past she had been makingstraight as the arrow flies from the bow  he carried her at once to the chiefs tent and laid his burden softly down at the same time explaining how and where he had found her  bearpaw sprang up with an air of excitement which an indian seldom displays  evidently his feelings were deeply touched as he knelt and raised the girls head  then he ordered his chief squaw to supply rising sun with some warm food  it was evening when this occurred  most of the people were supping in their tents  no one was with the chief save his own family and two of his braves  when the poor maniac revived under the influence of the warm food she started up with wild looks and sought again to fly but was forcibly detained by one of the braves  oh let me golet me goto his mother she wailed piteously for she felt herself to be helpless in the youths strong grasp  has rising sun forgotten bearpaw said the chief tenderly as he stood before her  yesyesno  i have not forgotten she said passing her hand over her brow but oh let me go to her before i die  rising sun shall not die  she is among friends now  the palefaced enemies who killed little beaver can do her no harm  killed himenemies murmured the poor girl as if perplexed then quickly yesyeshe is dead  does not rising sun know it  did she not see it with her own eyes  he was killedkilled  the poor girls voice rose as she spoke until it was almost a shriek  rising sun said the chief in a tone which the girl could not choose but obey tell us who killed him  killed him  no one killed him she answered with a return of the perplexed look  he missed his footing and fell over the cliff and the great spirit took him  then the palefaces had nothing to do with it asked the chief eagerly  oh yes the palefaces had to do with it  they were there and rising sun saw all that they did but they did not see her for when she saw them coming she hid herself being in great fear  and she knew that little beaver was dead  no man could fall from such a cliff and live deaddead  yes he is dead  oh let me go  not yet rising sun  what did the palefaces do  did they take his scalp  no oh no  the palefaces were kind  they lifted him tenderly  they dug his grave  they seemed as if they loved him like myself  then they went away and thenrising sun forgets  she remembers running and bounding like the deer  she cannotshe forgets  the poor girl stopped speaking and put her hand to her brow as if to restrain the tumult of her thoughts  then suddenly she looked up with a wild yet intelligent smile  yes she remembers now  her heart was broken and she longed to lay it on the breast of little beavers motherwho loved him so well  she knew where the wigwams of bearpaw stood and she ran for them as the bee flies when laden with honey to its home  she forgets much  her mind is confused  she slept she fell she swam she was coldcold and hungrybutbut now she has come home  oh let me go  let her go said the chief in a low voice  the young brave loosed his hold and rising sun bounded from the tent  it was dark by that time but several campfires threw a lurid glare over the village so that she had no difficulty in finding the hut of her dead husbands mother for during the interchange of several visits between members of the two tribes she had become very familiar with the camp  all ignorant of the poor maniacs arrival for the news had not yet spread the mother of little beaver sat embroidering a moccasin with dyed quillwork  the traces of profound grief were on her worn face and her meek eyes were dim as she raised them to see who lifted the curtain of the tent so violently  only one word was uttered by rising sun as she sprang in and fell on her knees before the old womanmother  no cry was uttered not even an expression of surprise moved the old womans face but her ready arms were extended and the girl laid her head with a longdrawn sigh upon the old bosom  long did she lie there that night while a tender hand smoothed her coalblack hair and pressed the thin cheek to a warm throbbing heart which feared to move lest the girls rest should be disturbed but there was no need to fear that  even the loving old heart could no longer warm the cheek that was slowly but surely growing cold  when the face was at last turned anxiously towards the firelight it was seen that a rest which could not be disturbed had been found at lastfor rising sun was dead  while this solemn scene was enacting in the old mothers tent a very different one was taking place in the cave prison where the captives still sat bound hand and foot leaning against the wall  captain trench and his son sat in front of them  a small fire burned in the cave the smoke of which found an exit among the crevices of the high roof  it cast a lurid light on the faces of the men and on projections of the wall but left the roof in profound darkness  the captain was still much excited for the moment for his desperate venture was rapidly approaching  now grummidge he said in a low but earnest voice its of no use your objectin any more for ive made up my mind to do it  which means returned the seaman that for the sake of savin my life youre agoin to risk your own and the lives of all consarned now its my opinion that as the sayin goes of two evils a man should choose the least  its better that i should die quietly than that the whole of us should die fightin and maybe killin savages as well which would be of no manner of use dye see  i can only die once you know so i advise ye to give it up an leave the whole matter in the hands of providence  not at all said squill stoutly  its my opinion that when theyve kilt you grummidge theyll be like tigers when theyve tasted blood theyll want to kill the rest of us  no ive made up me mind to bolt and if need be fight an so has all the rest on usso heave ahead cappen an tell us what weve got to do  well boys here it is said the captain  you see this weapon  he took up the heavy bludgeon that oliver had made for himself on commencing his travels in newfoundland  well ive brought this here every time ive come just to get the two sentries accustomed to see me with it  this is your last night on earth grummidge so im goin to pay you an extra visit about midnight by way of sayin farewell  as i pass the sentrieswho are quite used to me nowill fetch the first one i come to such a crack with this here that he will give no alarm before the other has time to wink ill treat him to the same  its a mean sort o thing to do but necessity has no law so ive made up my mind to go through with it  itll be a bad lookout if you do said grummidge  itll be a worse lookout if i dont replied the captain  then when thats done he continued ill cut your lashins an well crowd all sail for the woods where i have already concealed some arms an dried deersmeat an if we cant get fair off and make for the east coast well get on the top o some mound or rock an show these redskins what english seamen can do when theyre hard pressed  not to mintion irish wans said squill  an have master paul an hendrick agreed to fall in wi this mad plan asked grummidge  no i cant say they have  to say truth considerin that hendricks a relation o the redskins an that master paul is his friend i thought it best to say nothing to them about it  so ill  he was interrupted here by the sudden entrance of hendrick and paul themselves accompanied by bearpaw and the sentries  to one of the latter the chief gave an order and the man drawing his knife advanced to grummidge  the seaman instinctively shrank from him but was agreeably surprised on having his bonds cut  the others having also been liberated the chief said  my palefaced brothers are free  yes lads said paul heartily grasping grummidge by the hand  god has sent deliverance at the eleventh houryou are all free    chapter twenty four  the last  the joy with which the news was received by our seamen and their friends was somewhat marred by the death of the poor girl who had unconsciously been the means of their deliverance  during several days there was profound grief in the indian village for rising sun had been a favourite with every one  about this time one or two scattered bands of the party which had gone to attack the paleface settlement returned to the village and when they found what had occurred in their absence their enmity was turned into friendship and general goodwill prevailed among all  from the men just arrived paul and his friends heard of the fate of poor swinton and jim heron but at the same time were relieved to find that none of the other seamen had been slain  a grand council and palaver was held in front of bearpaws tent not long afterwards  it was a very grave and orderly councilone which would contrast favourably with many of our nineteenth century councils for those savages had not at that time acquired the civilised capacity for open offhand misrepresentation calumny and personal abuse which is so conspicuous in these days and which must be so gratifying to those who maintain that civilisation is the grand panacea for all the moral ills that flesh is heir to  whether the bethucks ever improved in this matter is not known for history is silent on the point but it is perhaps of little consequence the bethuck race having become extinct  it is now a matter for our consideration my friends and warriors said bearpaw in opening the palaver whether the palefaces are to spend the winter here and hunt with us or to return to the crooked lake to stay with our kinsman the white hunter and his wife the sweet singer  of course my warriors know well that we could keep the palefaces by force just as easily as we could take their scalps if we were so disposed but bearpaw is not a tyrant  he will not inflict kindness on his friends  his heart is great  it swells within him something inside of him whispers let them do as they please  that must be right for if circumstances were reversed it would be right to let bearpaw do as he pleases  the chief paused and looked sternly round as if to say contradict that if you dare  possibly he felt that the something inside of him might have stated the golden rule more simply  returning to the point he continued  bearpaw is glad that rising sun came home before he killed the palefaces for her words have saved their lives  he is also glad that the friends of the palefaces came for they have taught him wisdom they have shown him that he was going to act in haste they have told him that the great spirit orders all events here and the great spirit himself has proved the truth of what they said for when bearpaw refused to believe the palefaces he sent rising sun to confirm their words and to convince bearpaw that he was wrong  again the chief paused and looked round upon his men some of whom appeared to dissent from what he said in condemnation of himself by slightly shaking their heads  bethuck warriors continued the chief have often told bearpaw that he is wise  bearpaw now tells his warriors that they are foolsfools for telling their chief that he is wise  if he had been wise he would not have come so near to shedding the blood of innocent men but the great spirit prevented him  if the great spirit had not prevented him still that would have been right for the great spirit cannot do wrong and he is not bound to give explanations to his creatures though doubtless we will do it in the end  the heart of bearpaw is grateful to his paleface brothers and he would be glad if they will stay to hunt over his lands and palaver in his wigwam during the winter but if they prefer to go they may do as they please  waugh  bearpaw has spoken  the chief sat down with emphasis as if he felt that he had done his duty and his men uttered a decided ho of approval  then hendrick rose and looking round the circle with that grave dignity of countenance and manner which was not less natural to himself than characteristic of his indian friends delivered himself as follows  i and my friends are glad that bearpaw recognises the hand of the great spirit in all that has occurred for we rejoice to believe that he is the great first cause of all things and that men are only second causes gifted however with the mysterious power to do evil  in thanking my bethuck brother and his warriors for their kind invitationi speak for all my partywe are all grateful and we would greatly like to spend the winter here and enjoy the hospitality of our red brothers  especially would my friend paul burns rejoice to read more to you from his wonderful writing and explain it but we cannot stay  my paleface brothers wish to return with me to crooked lake where the sweet singer and her little ones await the return of the hands that feed and protect them  hendrick pausing looked round and received some nods of approval at this point  the winter is long however he continued and when the snow is deep over all the land we can put on our snowshoes and revisit bearpaw or better still bearpaw and his warriors may come to crooked lake when the sweet singer and her daughter will give them hearty welcome supply them with more food than they can consume and cause their ears and hearts to thrill with music  hendrick paused again and decided marks of approval greeted his last words  but my friends and kinsmen he resumed when winter draws to a close the palefaces will go to the coast to see how it fares with their comrades and to try whether it is not possible for them to make a big canoe in which to cross the great salt lake for some of them have wives and mothers sisters fathers and other relations whom they love in the mighty land that lies far away where the sun risesthe land of my own fathers about which i have often talked to you  if they cannot make a big enough canoe they will wait and hope till another great canoe like the one they lost comes to this islandas come it surely will bringing many palefaces to settle in the land  when they come they shall be welcome said bearpaw as hendrick sat down and we will hunt for them till they learn to hunt for themselves we will teach them how to capture the big fish with the red flesh and show them how to track the deer through the wildernesswaugh  but will our guests not stay with us till the hard frosts set in  no we must leave before the deep snow falls said hendrick  much of that which fell lately has melted away so we will start for crooked lake without further delay  the indian chief bowed his head in acquiescence with this decision and the very next day paul and the captain and oliver with their rescued comrades and strongbow set out for hendricks home which they reached not long after to find that all was well that the old indian servant had kept the family fully supplied with fish flesh and fowl that no one had visited the islet since they left that the sweet singers were in good voice and that the family baby was as bright as ever as great an anxiety to its mother and as terrible a torment to its idolising nurse  among others who took up their abode at that time on the hunters islet was the large dog blackboy  that faithful creature having always had a liking for hendrick and finding that the old master and mistress never came back had attached itself to the party of palefaces and quietly accepted the english name of blackboy  now it is impossible with the space at our command to recount all the sayings and doings of this section of the water wagtails crew during that winter how they built a hut for themselves close to that of their host how they learned to walk on snowshoes when the deep snow came how when the lake set fast and the thick ice formed a highway to the shore little oscar taught oliver trench how to cut holes through to the water and fish under the ice how hunting sledging football and firewoodcutting became the order of the day supping storytelling singing and reading the manuscript gospel according to john the order of the evening and sleeping like tops with occasional snoring the order of the night when the waters were thus arrested by the power of frost and the land was smothered in snow  all this and a great deal more must be left untold for as we have said or hinted or implied before matters of greater moment claim our attention  one night towards the close of that winter paul burns suggested that it was about time to go down to the coast and visit their comrades there  so say i remarked grummidge who at the time was feeding the baby to the grave satisfaction of blackboy  sure an im agreeable said squills who was too busy feeding himself to say more  as little stubbs george blazer fred taylor and david garnet were of the same opinion and hendrick had no objection except that trueheart goodred and oscar would be very sorry to part with them and the family baby would be inconsolable it was decided that a start should be made without delay  they set out accordingly hendrick and strongbow alternately leading and as it is styled beating the track while the rest followed in single file  it was a long hard journey but our travellers were by that time inured to roughing it in the cold  every night they made their camp by digging a hole in the snow under the canopy of a tree and kindling a huge fire at one end thereof  every morning at dawn they resumed the march over the snowclad wilderness and continued till sundown  thus day by day they advanced living on the dried meat they carried on their backs and the fresh meat and ptarmigan they procured with bolt and arrow  at last they reached the coast  it was a clear sharp starry night when they arrived at wagtail bay with an unusually splendid aurora lighting them on their way  anxious forebodings filled the breasts of most of the party lest they should find that their comrades had perished but on coming in sight of the principal hut oliver exclaimed theres a light in the window and smoke coming fromhurr  he would have cheered but grummidge checked him  shut up your hatchway lad  let us see what they are about before goin in  they all advanced noiselessly grummidge leading strongbow bringing up the rear  the hut had two windows of parchment which glowed with the light inside but through which they could not see except by means of one or two very small holes to which eager eyes were instantly applied a most comfortable scene was presented and jovial sounds smote the ears of those who listened  as far as they could make out every man of the crew was there except of course big swinton and jim heron  some were playing draughts some were mending nets or fashioning bows and others were telling stories or discussing the events of the past day  but a great change for the better was perceptible both in words and manners for some of the seed which paul burns had let fall by the wayside had all unexpectedly found good ground in several hearts and was already bearing fruit  dick swan and spitfire no longer quarrelled as they played together and bob crow no longer swore  heigho exclaimed the latter at the end of a game as he stretched his arms above his head i wonder if well ever play draughts in old england or see our friends again  youll see some of em tonight anyhow god bless ye bob crow cried grummidge as he flung open the door and sprang in while his snowsprinkled comrades came tramp tramp in a line behind him  who can describe that meeting as they shook hands gasped exclaimed laughedalmost cried while blackboy leaped around wildly joyful at the sight of so many old friends  we will not attempt it but leaving them there we will conduct the reader down to a small creek hard by where a curious sight may be seena small ship on the stocks nearly finished which will clearly be ready to launch on the first open water  from the wreck of the old ship tools and timber and cordage had been recovered  the forests of newfoundland had supplied what was lacking ingenuity and perseverance did the rest  need we add that the work went on merrily now that the wanderers had returned  hendrick stayed with them till the little ship was launched  with a pleased yet sorrowful expression he watched as the eager men tested her stability and her sailing powers and rejoiced with them on finding that she worked well and answered to her helm smartly  goodbye friends and god watch over you and me till that day after which there shall be no more partings he said as they all shook hands for the last time  he was left standing beside his indian friend on the rocks when the morning star finally set sail  the tall forms of the two men were still visible when the little vessel rounded the neighbouring headland and turned its prow towards england  they stood there sadly watching the lessening sails till the ship became a mere speck on the horizon and finally disappeared  then hendrick slowly reentered the forest and followed by strongbow returned to his own home in the beautiful wilderness of newfoundland  the end
