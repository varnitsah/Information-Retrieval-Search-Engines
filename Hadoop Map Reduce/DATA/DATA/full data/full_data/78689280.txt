78689280	the pirate city by rm ballantine  a tale of the pirates of the city of algiers and their defeat by the british navy  the time of the action is about 1817  the pirate cityby rm ballantyne    chapter one  opens the tale  some time within the first quarter of the present nineteenth century a little old ladysome people would even have called her a dear little old ladysat one afternoon in a highbacked chair beside a cottage window from which might be had a magnificent view of sicilian rocks with the mediterranean beyond  this little old lady was so pleasant in all respects that an adequate description of her is an impossibility  her mouth was a perfect study it was not troubled with anything in the shape of teeth  it lay between a delicate little downturned nose and a soft little upturned chin which two seemed as if anxious to meet in order to protect it  the wrinkles that surrounded that mouth were innumerable and each wrinkle was a distinct and separate smile so that whether pursing or expanding it was at all times rippling with an expression of tender benignity  this little old lady plays no part in our tale nevertheless she merits passing introduction as being the grandmother of our hero a sicilian youth of nineteen who at the time we write of sat on a stool at her feet engaged in earnest conversation  grandmother said the youth in a perplexed mood why wont you let me go into the church instead of brother lucien  im certain that he does not want to though he is fit enough as far as education goes and goodness but you know well enough that he is desperately fond of juliet and she is equally desperate about him and nothing could be more pleasant than that they should get married  tut child you talk nonsense said the old lady letting a sigh escape from the rippling mouth  your fathers dearest wish has always been to see lucien enter the church and although juliet is our adopted child we do not intend to interfere with the wishes of her uncle the abbot who has offered to place her in the convent of saint shutemup as to you taking luciens placehere the mouth expanded considerablyah  mariano you are too foolish too giddy better fitted to be a sailor or soldier i should think  how interrupted mariano  do you then estimate the profession of the soldier and sailor so low that you think only foolish and giddy fellows are fit for it  not so child but it is a school which is eminently fitted to teach respect and obedience to foolish and giddy fellows who are pert to their grandmothers  ah how unfair exclaimed mariano with assumed solemnity i give you good advice with gravity equal to that of any priest and yet you call me pert  grandmother you are ungrateful as well as unjust  have i not been good to you all my life  you have my child said the little old lady very goodalso rather troublesome especially in the way of talking nonsense and im sorry to find that although your goodness continues your troublesomeness does not cease  well well replied the youth with a sprightly toss of the head lucien and i shall enjoy at least a few weeks more of our old life on the blue sea before he takes to musty books and i to the stool of the clerk  ah why did you allow father to give us a good education  how much more enjoyable it would have been to have lived the free life of a fishermanor of that pig he said pointing to one which had just strayed into the garden and lain down to roll in the earthwhat happy ignorance or ignorant happiness what concentrated enjoyment of the present what perfect oblivion as to the past what obvious disregard of the future  ay interrupted the little old lady what blissful ignorance of the deeds of ancient heroes of the noble achievements of great and good men of the adventures of marco polo and magellan and vasco de gama over whose voyages you have so often and so fondly pored  i see grandmother that it is useless to argue with you  let us turn to a graver subject  tell me what am i to bring you from malta  as this is in very truth to be our last voyage i must bring you something grand something costlyah here comes juliet to help us to decide  as he spoke a pretty darkeyed girl of nineteen entered the room and joined their council but before they had gone very deep into the question which mariano had propounded they were interrupted by the entrance of the head of the house francisco rimini a strong portly man of about fifty years of age with a brown healthy complexion grizzled locks a bald pate and a seminautical gait  he was followed by a stranger and by his eldest son luciena tall grave slender youth of twentythree who was in many respects the opposite of his brother mariano physically as well as mentally  the latter was middlesized broadshouldered and very powerful with short curly brown hair flashing eyes and sprightly dispositionactive as a kitten and rather mischievous  lucien was grave gentle and studious elegantly rather than powerfully formed and disposed rather to enjoy fun by looking on than engaging in it  both brothers as well as their father possessed kindly dispositions and resolute spirits  mother said francisco let me introduce to you my friend signor bacri a merchant who goes in my vessel as a passenger to malta  he dines with us today and that reminds me that you must hasten our dinner as events have transpired which oblige me to set sail two hours earlier than i had intended so please expedite matters juliet  the stranger bowed with oriental dignity to the little old lady and seating himself by her side entered into conversation  bacri was a middleaged man of magnificent appearance  from the cast of his features it was easy to perceive that he was of jewish extraction and his proportions might have been compared to those of the ancient enemy of his nation goliath  like saul he was a head and shoulders higher than ordinary men yet he evidently placed no confidence in his physical strength for although his countenance was grave and his expression dignified he stooped a good deal as though to avoid knocking his head against ceilings and beams and was singularly humble and unobtrusive in his manners  there was a winning softness too in his voice and in his smile which went far to disarm that distrust of and antipathy to his race which prevailed in days of old and unfortunately prevails still to some extent in christendom  with the activity of a good housewife juliet expedited the operations of the cook dinner was served in good time francisco who was owner of his vessel and cargo as well as padrone or captain entertained bacri with accounts of his adventures on the sea which the jew returned in kind with his experiences of mercantile transactions in savage lands mariano drank in all that they said with youthful avidity and the little old ladys mouth rippled responsive like the aspen leaf to the breeze while lucien and juliet thus left to themselves had no other resource than to entertain each other as best they could  then the adieux were said the voyagers went down to the port embarked on board their good shipa trimbuilt schoonerand set sail with a fair wind  i wish i saw them all safe back again said the little old lady with a sigh  juliet said nothing though she echoed the sigh  meanwhile the schooner leant over to the breeze and ere nightfall left the shores of sicily far behind    chapter two  unfolds a little of the tale  another and a very different vessel chanced to be floating in those seas at the time the sicilian trader set sail  at a distance she might have been mistaken for a fishingboat for she carried only two lateen sails of that high triangular form which may still be seen in the mediterranean and on the lakes of switzerland  in reality however the vessel was of greater dimensions than even the largest boat and her mainmast with its sail was of gigantic proportions  she was also fulldecked and several pieces of heavy ordnance pointed their black muzzles from portholes in her bulwarks  no one could have mistaken her character as a vessel of war for besides the guns referred to she had an unusually large crew of bronzed and stalwart men  their costume as well as their arms told that these were of eastern origin  although there was much variety in detail they all wore the same goldlaced jackets the same loose turkish drawers gathered in below the knees and broad silken scarfs round their waists with richly chased silvermounted pistols and yataghans or curved swords  some wore the turban others the bluetasselled red fez or tarbouch of tunis while a few contented themselves with a kerchief tied loosely round their heads  one who appeared to be the captain of the vessel stood near the steersman leaning on the bulwarks and scanning the horizon with a telescope  his costume was similar to that of his men but of richer material  it is certainly a sail said he whom we have styled the captain to one who stood by his side and might have been his lieutenant or mate  she bears souwest i think replied the latter  so much the better returned the captain let her fall off a little so steady  if this wind holds for half an hour we shall get well abreast of her and then  the captain shut up the telescope with an emphatic bang by way of termination to his remark and turning on his heel paced the deck rapidly by the side of his mate  we have been unlucky hitherto he observed perchance fortune may change and now be favourable  at all events we shall be ready  see the breeze freshens  go call up the men and clear for action  the breeze had indeed been freshening while he spoke and now came down in a series of squalls that caused the piraticallooking craft to lie over as if she were about to capsize  the vessel which they were pursuing also bent over to the breeze and crowded all sail for well did francisco its owner and padrone know from past experience that algerine corsairs were fast sailers and that his only hope lay in showing them his heels  he had often given them the slip beforewhy should he not again  while thus doing his best to escape however the bluff merchant did not neglect to make preparations for defence  clear away the big gun he said to mariano who acted as his first officer lucien being the scrivano or supercargo of the vessel tis a good piece and has turned the flight of many a pirate with its first bark  the latter part of this remark was addressed to bacri who stood leaning over the taffrail looking anxiously at the vessel in chase  if it be sidi hassan muttered the jew half aloud there is little chance  what say you demanded francisco  i say that if it be the vessel of a man whom i happen to know you will have to trust to your sails for deliverancefighting will be of no avail  francisco looked at the jew with some surprise not unmingled with contempt  a warlike spirit it seems does not always consort with a powerful frame he said but how come you to have scraped acquaintance with these pirates whose existence is a blight upon the commerce of the mediterranean and a disgrace to our age  none should know better than thyself that a trader like any other traveller becomes acquainted with strange bedfellows replied bacri with a quiet smile  as to a warlike spirit of what use would it be in a despised israelite to display such  there is truth in that returned the padrone in a more respectful tone nevertheless if fighting becomes needful i trust that one furnished with such thews and sinews will not fail to lend effective aid  that he will not i dare say and here is a cutlass for him wherewith to carve a name and fame said mariano coming aft at the moment and presenting the weapon to bacri who took it with a halfhumorous smile and laid it on the seat beside him  hast got the big gun ready boy demanded francisco  ayloaded her almost to the muzzle  i ordered her to be doubleshotted and that big black rascal manqua slily crammed in a handful of nails without leave  i only hope she wont burst  burst exclaimed the padrone with a laugh if you were to load her even beyond the muzzle she wouldnt burst  i remember once loading her with a full dose of canister and clapped two round shot on the top of that after which the same negro you have mentioned for he has a tendency in that way shoved in a handspike without orders and let the whole concern fly at a pirate boat which it blew clean out of the water she wellnigh burst the drums of our ears on that occasion but showed no sign whatever of bursting herself  nevertheless said bacri earnestly i advise you to trust entirely to your sails  we havent another stitch of canvas to set said francisco in reply and if we had the old schooner couldnt stand it for as you may see the strain is already as much as she can bear  this was indeed the case for the vessel was by that time flying before a stiff breeze with all the sail set that she could carry while the water dashed in clouds from her bows and rushed over her lee bulwarks  but the sailing powers of the piratevessel were superior to those of the trading schooner  in a short time she was close alongside and fired a shot across her bows to cause her to heaveto  this however the determined skipper resolved not to do  in reply he sent on board the pirates the varied contents of the big gun which cut the halyards of their smaller sail and brought it down on the deck  this result was celebrated by a hearty cheer from the schooners crew  the pirates in return discharged a broadside which cut away the foremast of the schooner thus rendering escape impossible  now men cried francisco when the disaster occurred you must this day make your choicevictory or slaveryfor there is no mercy in the breasts of these scoundrels  he waited for no reply but at once sprang to the big gun which had been reloaded with a charge so miscellaneous that the sable manqua grinned with satisfaction as he endeavoured to ram it home  meanwhile mariano and lucien placed the men who were armed to the teeth at the gangways and along the weatherside of the schooner to be in readiness to repel the foe when they should attempt to board  there was no hesitation on the part of the pirates although they saw plainly the vigorous preparations which were being made to receive them bearing down on the crippled vessel at full speed in spite of the bellowing discharge from the great gun and a welldelivered volley of small shot which stretched many of them on the deck they ran straight against her threw grapplingirons into the rigging and sprang on board with a fierce yell  the melee that followed was sharp but very short and decisive  the sicilian crew fought with the courage of desperate men but were almost instantly overpowered by numbers  mariano had singled out the pirate captain as his own special foe  in making towards the spot where he expected that he would board he observed the tall jew standing by the wheel with his arms crossed on his breast and regarding the attack with apparent indifference  what cried mariano anger mingling with his surprise do you stand idle at such a moment  you will miss your chance returned bacri giving a glance and a nod towards the side of the vessel where the pirate captain stood ready to spring  almost at the instant that the brief hint was given mariano had sprung to the bulwarks and parried the thrust of a boardingspike which act unfortunately disconcerted his aim in discharging his pistol  next moment he had seized the pirate by the throat and fell with him to the deck where a fierce struggle ensued  we have said that the sicilian youth was powerfully made but the pirate captain was more than a match for him in size if not in courage nevertheless the superior activity of mariano coupled with the fact that he chanced to fall uppermost gave him an advantage which would in a few moments have cost the pirate his life had not a blow from behind rendered his youthful adversary insensible  rising hastily and regaining the yataghan which had fallen from his grasp in the struggle the pirate captain was about to rush again into the fight but perceiving that although one or two of the schooners crew still showed resistance his men were almost everywhere in possession of the deck he desisted and turned with a look of surprise to the man who had freed him from his antagonist  you here bacri he said  truly my fate is a hard one when it condemns me to be rescued by a dog of a jew  it might have been harder sidi hassan if it had condemned you to be slain by the hand of a christian replied the jew with an air of humility that scarcely harmonised with his towering height and his breadth of shoulder  hassan uttered a short laugh and was about to reply when a shout from his men caused him to run to the forward part of the vessel where francisco lucien and the warlike negro already referred to were still fighting desperately surrounded by pirates many of whom were badly wounded  it was well for the three heroes that their foes had discharged all their pistols at the first rush  some of them now rendered furious by the unexpectedly successful opposition made by the dauntless three as well as by the smarting of their wounds were hastily reloading their weapons when their captain came forward  it was obvious that mercy or forbearance had been driven from their breasts and that a few seconds more would put a bloody end to the unequal contest  spare them sidi hassan said the jew in a deeply earnest tone  why should i spare them returned the captain quietly they deserve to die and such men would prove to be but troublesome slaves  the jew bent towards hassans ear and whispered  ha sayest thou so exclaimed the pirate with a piercing glance at his companion  may i trust thee jew  you may trust me replied the jew apparently quite unmoved by the insolent tones of the other  stand back men cried hassan springing between the combatants death by sword or pistol is too good for these christian dogs we shall reserve them for something better  then turning to francisco lay down your arms  we will lay down our arms answered the bluff merchant who was not at all sorry to obtain this brief period of breathingtime when we have laid you and a few more of your ruffians on the deck  hassan turned to his men and gave them an order in the turkish language  several of them hurried aft and immediately returned dragging along with them poor mariano who was just recovering from the blow given to him by bacri  on seeing the plight of his father and brother he made a desperate effort to free himself but quickly found that he was as helpless as a child in the grasp of the three powerful men who held him  hassan drew a pistol and put its muzzle to the youths temple then turning to francisco said  lay down your arms else i scatter his brains on the deck  take your choice but see that you be quick about it  there was that in the pirate captains tone and look which induced instant compliance  francisco and his companions at once laying down their weapons were seized and had their arms pinioned  mariano was also bound and then their conquerors proceeded to clear the decks of the dead and wounded  this was soon accomplished a prize crew was placed in the schooner the captives still pinioned were transferred to the deck of the piratevessel and there left to do as they pleased while the captain and bacri descended to the cabin  night soon after descended on the sea the wind fell almost to a calm the moon shone round and full in a cloudless sky and the vessel glided quietly along while the rascally crew lay conversing and smoking on her deck many of them bearing marks of the recent conflict and some sleeping as peacefully as though their hands were guiltless of shedding human blood and legitimate trade their occupation    chapter three  reveals something surprising in regard to european forbearance and piratic impudence  seated on a guncarriage apart from his comrades in sorrow francisco rimini gazed in stern silence upon the moonlit sea and thought perchance of the little old lady with the rippling mouth and the darkeyed daughter of his adoption  your fate is a sad one said a deep voice close to his side  francisco started and looked round with indignant surprise at bacri  none the less sad that a friend has proved false jew he said sternly  it has never been my custom to call any of your race dog as too many of my creed have done in time past but i am tempted to change my custom this night  to misname me would do you no good and me no harm replied the jew gravely  my race is an accursed one as far as man is concerned but mans curse is of no more value than his blessing  if these arms were free bacri retorted francisco hotly i would teach thee that which would prove anything but a blessing to thy carcase thou huge caitiff  i had thought better of thee than thou didst deservego thy bulky presence is distasteful  wherein have i wronged you asked the jew  wronged me exclaimed francisco with rising wrath art thou not hand and glove with the chief pirate  thinkest thou that my eyes have lost their power of vision  truly i am acquainted with the corsair though the acquaintance was none of my seeking returned the jew for as i said before traders have dealings with many sorts of men but i did not advise him to attack you and i could not hinder him  scoundrel exclaimed the padrone couldst thou not restrain thine hand when it knocked the senses out of my boy mariano  wouldst have me believe that thy huge fists are not subject to thy villainous will or that they acted as they did by mere accident instead of aiding to repel the pirates  i did it to save his life replied bacri and not only his but your own and the lives of all your men  i saw that mariano was about to prevail and if he had slain the corsair chief not one of you would have been alive at this moment  franciscos wrath when roused was not readily appeased nevertheless this statement puzzled him so much that he remained silently gazing at the jew from sheer inability to express his feelings  listen continued bacri drawing nearer and speaking in a lower tone the man into whose hands you have fallen is sidi hassan one of the most noted and daring of the pirates on the barbary coast  escape from him is impossible  i know him well and can assure you that your only hope of receiving anything that deserves the title of good treatment depends on your quiet and absolute subjection to his will  rebellious or even independent bearing will insure your speedy and severe humiliation  we dogs of jews continued bacri with a sad smile may seem to you to hang our heads rather low sometimes but i have seen christian men as bold as you are crawl upon the very dust before these turks of algiers  our fate then said francisco is i suppose and as i half suspected to be slavery in that pirates nest algiers  i fear it is replied the jew unless providence permits a storm to set you free but let me correct your notion of algiers  a pirates nest it undoubtedly is but there are others than pirates in the nest and some of these are even honest men  ha exclaimed the padrone quickly and with bitterness is one of these said honest men a jew of stalwart frame and does his connexion with the piratical nest free him from the bonds to which i and my sons are doomed  to both questions i answer yes replied the jew  then a fig for your honesty master bacri said francisco with a toss of his head in lieu of a snap of his fingers which in the circumstances was impossible for i now believe that you knocked mariano down simply to save the life of your comrade sidi hassan and that you will pocket your own share of my ship and cargo  i have not the power to alter your belief said the jew quietly as he turned away and left the unfortunate captive to his meditations  as the night advanced the wind continued to abate and when morning broke the broad breast of the mediterranean undulated like a sheet of clear glass on which was gradually revealed the form of a strange vessel becalmed not far from the prize  as soon as it was sufficiently light to permit of objects being clearly seen sidi hassan fired a gun and showed the algerine flag  our luck has changed he said to his first officer with an air of satisfaction  get the boats ready we will board at once  she shows british colours said the mate regarding the vessel in question intently through his glass  so she does returned the captain but that device wont go down with me  board her at once while i bring our broadside to bear  the mate with two boats full of armed men soon pulled alongside the strange sail and the piratevessel was brought round with her broadside to bear by means of long oars or sweeps  in a short time the boats returned with the mortifying intelligence that the papers were all right and that the vessel being in truth a british merchantman was not a legitimate prize  the corsair therefore sailed away under the influence of a light breeze which had arisen  at the time of which we write about sixty years ago algiers was under the dominion of turkey but exercised all the rights of an independent state  it may be described as a monstrous blot of barbarism hanging on the skirts of civilisation  it was an anomaly too for it claimed to be an orthodox power and was recognised as such by the nations of europe while in reality its chief power consisted in consummate impudence founded on pride and ignorance of the strength of other powers coupled with the peculiarity of its position and with the fact that the great nations were too much engaged fighting with each other to be at leisure to pay attention to it  its rulers or deys were most of them ignorant men who had risen in many cases from the ranks of the janissaries or common turkish soldiery and its sole occupation was piracypiracy pure and simple  it did not like other powers find a pretext for war in the righting of a supposed or real wrong  the birds of the pirates nest were much too simple in their grandeur thus to beat about the bush  they went straight to the point  without any pretext at all they declared war with a nation when they had a mind to plunder it and straightway set about making prizes of the merchantmen of that nation at the same time keeping carefully clear of its cruisers  if there had been a tangible grievance diplomacy might have set it rightbut there never was any grievance either real or imaginary  if there had been a worthy fleet that would come out and face a foe courage and power might have settled the questionbut there was no such fleet  the nest possessed only a few small frigates and a considerable number of boats large and small which crept along the northern shores of africa and pounced upon unwary traders or made bold dashes at small villages on the southern shores of europe and in the isles of the mediterranean  trade was horribly hampered by them though they had no ostensible trade of their own their influence on southern europe being comparable only to that of a wasps nest under ones window with this difference that even wasps as a rule mind their own business whereas the algerine pirates minded the business of everybody else and called that their own special vocation  like other powers they took prisoners but instead of exchanging these in times of war and freeing them on return of peace they made galleyslaves of them all and held them to ransom  at all times there were hundreds of christian slaves held in bondage  even in this present century so late as 1816 the algerine turks held in captivity thousands of christian slaves of all grades and classes from all parts of europe and these were in many cases treated with a degree of cruelty which is perhaps equalled but not surpassed by the deeds recorded of negro slavery and so hopeless were people as to the power or intention of governments to mend this state of things that societies were formed in some of the chief countries in the world including england france and america for the express purpose of ransoming christian slaves from those dreaded shores of barbary  having said this the reader will doubtless be prepared to hear that the civilised world howling with indignation assailed burned and exterminated this pirates nest  not at all  the thing was tolerated more than that it was recognised  consuls were actually sent to the nest to represent great britain france spain portugal holland sweden denmark america disgraceful treaties were entered into and annual tribute was paid by each of these in the form of a costly present to the dey for the purpose of securing immunity to their trading vessels  whatever nation kept a consul at this nest and paid blackmail passed scot free  the nation that failed in these respects was ruthlessly and systematically plunderedand this at the time when lord nelson was scouring the ocean with mighty armaments when our songs lauded the wooden walls of old england to the skies and when great britain claimed to herself the proud title of mistress of the sea  if you doubt this reader let us assure you that all history asserts it that recorded facts confirm it and that our proper attitude in regard to it is to stand amazed and admit that there are some things in this curious world which no fellow can understand  without apologising for this digression we return to the thread of our tale  finding then as we have said that the british merchantman was not a legitimate foe the corsair proceeded to look out for a more worthy object of attacknamely a vessel of some hapless petty state which being too venturesome or too poor to pay blackmail was at war perforce with the algerines  fortune however ceased for a short time to be propitious  no suitable vessel was to be found therefore sidi hassan resolved to exercise the rights of the unusually free and independent power of which he was a worthy representative in a somewhat strange fashion  bearing down on the coast he sailed along it for some time with the intention of making a bold dash at some small fishing village  his mate rather objected to this knowing well that such attempts were too apt to be attended with considerable loss of life but sidi hassan was not a man to be easily turned from his purpose  the sight of a brig in the offing however induced him to run out again to sea  he was soon within hail and finding that the vessel was a sicilian trader boarded her at once  no opposition was offered the brig being totally without arms and her crew small  she like the vessel of our friend francisco was laden with wine and fruit  there were only two passengers on board but these two were great prizes in hassans estimation being beautiful girls of about seventeen and eighteen respectively  they were sistersthe elder being on her way with her infant son to join her husband in malta  hassan was glad of the opportunity thus thrown in his way of pleasing his master the dey of algiers by presenting to him these unfortunates whose manners and appearance bespoke them ladies and at once sent them on board his vessel along with their money and jewels  their wardrobe was distributed among the pirate crewthe money and jewels being the deys perquisite  i have a plan in my head said hassan to his second in command which the capture of this brig has suggested to me  go take charge of our vessel and send me twenty of the best men of our crew fully armedalso a british unionjack  there is a captain of a port in this neighbourhood against whom i have a special grudge and to whom i would fain give a free passage to algiers so make haste  the order was soon executed and the piratevessel ordered to remain where she was while the brig stood inshore and sailed along the coast in a few hours she was off the port above referred to when she hoveto hoisted the british flag and fired a gun  the captain of the port innocently put off to the brig and in a few minutes found himself and his boats crew taken captive by the algerines  having thus successfully accomplished his design hassan returned to his vessel put a crew on board the second prize and directing his course to africa made all sail for the port of algiers  during the voyage the unfortunate captives saw little of each other nevertheless mariano saw enough of the sisters to create in his breast feelings of the tenderest pityespecially for the younger sister whom he thought rather pretty than otherwise  as for the jew he kept aloof from all the captives but seemed to have a good understanding with the pirate captain and to be acquainted with several of his men    chapter four  introduces the reader to the pirate city and to a few of its peculiarities and practices  permit us now good reader to introduce you to the top of a house in algiers  the roofs of the houses in the pirate city are flata most admirable eastern peculiarity which cannot be too strongly recommended to western builders  they are therefore available as pleasant terraces on which you may rise above your cares to lounge and smokeif afflicted with the latter maniaand sip coffee with your wife wives if you be a turk or romp with your childrenif not too dignifiedor cultivate flowers or read in a state of elevated serenity or admire the magnificent view of the blue bay backed by the bluer jurjura mountains with the snowtopped range of the lesser atlas beyond  how much wiser thus to utilise ones housetop than to yield it up rentfree to cats and sparrows  achmet pasha the dey of algiers at this time or rather the pirateking had a thorough appreciation of the roof of his palace and spent many hours daily on it in consultation with his ministers or in converse with his wives  as deys went achmet was a comparatively respectable man  he thought no more of cutting off a human head than of docking a rats tail but then he did not take a particular pleasure in this employment and was not naturally cruel which is more than could be said of many of his predecessors  he was also said to be a kind husband and a fond father but as no one save the wives and children in question knew anything of the inner and private life of the palace this must for ever remain a matter of uncertainty  there was no doubt however that he was a tall handsome dignified man in the prime of life with a stern eye and a pleasant expression of mouth that in character he was bold and resolute and that in his jewelled turban goldincrusted vestments and flowing eastern robes he looked resplendent  courage and resolution were indeed qualities without which a dey of algiers could scarcely come into existence because his high position not being hereditary was naturally the ambitious goal of all the bold spirits in the turkish army of janissaries which held the city with its mixed arab population in subjection  the most common mode of a change of government was the strangulation of the reigning dey by the man who had power and party influence sufficient to enable him to ascend the vacant throne  sometimes the throne thus obtained was held for only a few days or even hours when it chanced that there were several factions of pretty equal power and two or three men of similar vigour in the army  it is a fact that on more than one occasion three deys have ascended and sat upon this undesirable throne within twentyfour hours each having been strangled or having had his head cut off by the opposition soon after occupying his predecessors warm seat  achmet however had reigned for a considerable period in peace and was on the whole a popular ruler  at the time when we introduce him he was pacing the terrace or roof of the palace with slow dignified steps but with a troubled expression of countenance  his chief adviser sidi omar the minister of marine and one of the most unscrupulous and cunning men in the nest walked beside him  they were attended and followed by a young but nearly fullgrown lion  it was a common thing for the deys and his chief officers to keep lionpups as pets but as a rule these were chained up on becoming too large to be safe playthings  achmet however being of a bold reckless nature seemed to enjoy the occasional symptoms of alarm betrayed by his attendants at sight of his overgrown pup and kept it by him until as we have said it was nearly fullgrown  he appeared to have no idea of personal danger  possibly he did not believe the huge playful brute to be capable of mischief  perhaps he felt confident in the keen edge of his damascene scimitar and in the power of his arm to lop off even leonine heads  whatever may have been the truth on this point his ease and indifference were evidently not shared by sidi omar  that sly individual was a strongbodied middleaged turk of commanding presence but sinister countenance which latter was damaged by the loss of an eye and a sabrecut across the nose  i have been asked said omar continuing a conversation which had already lasted some time to beg that your highness will grant an audience to the spanish consul he claims as countrywomen the two ladies who have been just brought in by sidi hassan but i advise that you should refuse him  why so asked achmet  because although there is i believe some ground for his claim the investigation of the question will only occasion useless trouble as he is unable to prove his case  nay then your last reason seems to me in favour of granting an audience returned the dey for if his plea be insufficient i shall thus appear to be desirous of furthering justice without suffering loss it is always wise to act with urbanity when it costs one nothing  achmet smiled and a gleam of mischievous fun twinkled in his eyes as he observed his minister cast a furtive glance suggestive of anything but urbanity at the lion which had playfully brushed its tail against his leg in passing  your highnesss judgment is always just returned sidi omar and were we desirous of maintaining peace with spain at present it would be right to propitiate their consul but as you are aware the treaties which we have recently formed with various nations are not to our advantage  the peace recently forced upon us by america has stopped suddenly the annual flow of a very considerable amount of tribute see note 1 and the constant efforts made by that nation of illfavoured dogs the british to bring about peace between us and portugal will i fear soon dry up another source of revenue if things go on as they have been doing of late it is plain to me that we shall soon be at peace with all the world and be under the necessity of turning our hands to farming or some such work for a livelihood  fear not sidi omar replied the dey with a short laugh this fair and ancient city has lived too long by war to be capable of condescending now to arts of peace  we shall have no difficulty in picking a quarrel with any nation that seems most desirable when our coffers begin to grow emptyin regard to which let us be thankful they show no signs at present  but have a care omar how you speak disrespectfully of the british  they are apt like their representative at your heels to spring when you least expect it and they have powerful claws and teeth  besides they are my very good friends and some of their statesmen have a great regard for me  being at war as you know with some of the most powerful european nations just now they know that i do them good service in the mediterranean by rendering trade difficult and hazardous to all except those with whom i am at peace spain being on friendly terms with us at present i will receive the spanish consul  go let him know my pleasure and see that thou hast my scrivano instilled with all requisite information to refute him  sidi omar bowed low and retired without venturing a reply  at the same time a man of curious aspect stepped from the doorway which conducted from the terrace to the lower parts of the house  his eastern costume was almost equal to that of the dey in magnificence but there was a tinselly look about the embroidery and a glassy sheen in the jewels which added to the humorous and undignified cast of his countenance bespoke him one of low degree  he was the deys storyteller and filled much the same office at the palace that was held by court jesters in the olden time  the presence of some such individual in achmets court even in the first quarter of the present century was rendered necessary by the fact that the dey himself had risen from the ranks and was an illiterate man  advancing towards his master with a freedom that no other domestic of the palace would have dared to assume he with affected solemnity demanded an audience  i cannot refuse it hadji baba seeing that thou dost swagger into my presence unbidden said achmet with a smile as he sat down in the usual oriental fashioncrosslegged on a low couchand patted the head of the noble animal which he had chosen as his companion and which appeared to regard him with the affection of a dog  what may be your news  i have no news replied baba with humility  news cannot be conveyed to one who knows all things by one who is a dog and knows nothing  thou knowest at all events how to look well after that which concerns thyself replied the dey  what hast thou to say to me  that the man with the proboscis who struts when he walks and snivels when he speaks desires a favour of your highness  speak not in riddles returned the dey sharply  i have no time to waste with thee today  say thy say and be gone  hadji baba who was indeed thoroughly alive to his own interest was much too prudent to thwart the humour of his master  briefly though without changing his tone or manner he informed him that the spanish consul awaited his pleasure below  let him wait said the dey resuming the pipe which for some minutes he had laid aside and caressing the lions head with the other hand  may i venture to say that he seems anxious added the storyteller  how much did he give thee for thus venturing to interrupt me at the risk of thy head demanded the dey sternly  truly replied the jester with a rueful air not much more than would buy gold thread to sew my head on again were your highness pleased to honour me by cutting it off  be gone caitiff said the dey with a slight smile  baba vanished without further reply  meanwhile sidi omar left the palace and directed his steps to his own quarters which stood on the little fortified island in front of algiers  this islet having been connected with the mainland by a pier or neck of masonry about a hundred yards long formed the insignificant harbour which gave shelter to the navy of small craft owned by the pirates  at the present day the french have constructed there a magnificent harbour of which that now referred to is a mere corner in the vicinity of the old lighthouse  although small the port was well fortified and as the minister of marine descended towards it his eye glanced with approval over the double and treble tiers of guns which frowned from its seaward battlements  in passing over the connecting pier sidi omar paused to observe a gang of slaves at work repairing some of the buildings which covered the pier stretching from the mainland to the island  although slaves they were not of the black colour or thicklipped flatnosed aspect which we are apt to associate with the name of slave they were indeed burnt to the deepest brown and many of them also blistered by the sun but they were all white men and contemptuously styled by their mohammedan taskmasters christians  the pier on which they wrought had been constructed long before by thirty thousand such slaves and the algerine pirates for above three centuries previous to that had expended the lives of hundreds of thousands of them in the building of their fortifications and other public works in the cultivation of their fields and gardens and in the labours of their domestic drudgery  some of the slaves thus observed by the minister of marine had been sailors and merchants and mechanics military and naval officers clerks scholars and other gentlefolks from italy portugal america and all the lands which chanced to be at war with his highness the dey  formerly there had been hosts of english french spanish etcetera but their governments having bowed their heads opened their purses and sent consuls to the piratical city they were now graciously exempted from thraldom  it was hardish work for men accustomed to cooler climates to be obliged in the sunshine of an african summer to harness themselves to carts like oxen and lift huge stones and hods of mortar with little more than a ragged shirt and trousers to cover them from the furnaceheat of day or the dews of night  men who carry umbrellas and wear puggeries nowadays on the boulevard de la republique of algiers have but a faint conception of what some of their forefathers endured down at the marina not much more than fifty years ago and of what they themselves could endure perhaps if fairly tried it must not be supposed however that all the slaves stood the trial equally well  some were old others were young some were feeble others strong all were more or less wornsome terribly so  yonder old man carrying the block of stone which might tax the energies of a stout youth and to whom a taskmaster has just administered a cut with the drivingwhip looks like one who has seen better days  even in his ragged shirt brokenbrimmed straw hat and naked feet he looks like a gentleman  so he is and there is a gentle lady and a stout son and two sweet daughters in naples who are toiling almost as hard as he doesif hours be allowed to count for painsin order to make up his ransom  the strong bullnecked man that follows him with a hod of mortar is an unmistakable seaman of one of the mediterranean ports  he is a desperate character and in other lands might be dangerous but he is safe enough here for the bastinado is a terrible instrument of torture and the man is now not only desperate in wrath but is sometimes desperately frightened  his driver takes a fiendish pleasure in giving him an extra cut of the whip just to make him apparently a willing horse whether he will or not  the poor youth beside him is a very different character  his training has been more gentle and his constitution less robust for he has broken down under the cruel toil and is evidently in the last stages of consumption  the taskmaster does not now interfere with him as he was wont to do when he first arrived he knows that the day is not far distant when neither the bastinado nor any other species of torture will have power to force work out of him he also knows that overdriving will only shorten the days of his usefulness he therefore wisely lets him stagger by unmolested with his light load  but why go on enumerating the sorrows of these slaves  sidi omar looked at them with a careless glance until he suddenly caught sight of something that caused his eyes to flash and his brows to contract  a sbirro or officer of justice stood near him whether by chance or otherwise we know not  touching the sbirro on the shoulder he pointed to a group under the shade of an archway and said in a low tone  go fetch hither that scoundrel blindi  the sbirro at once stepped towards the group which consisted of two persons  one was an old apparently dying slave the other was a strong middleaged man in a quaint blue gown who knelt by his side and poured something from a flask into his mouth  the sbirro seized this man rudely by the neck and said  get up blindi and come along with me  laying the head of the old man gently on the ground and rising with some wrath blindi demanded in english so broken that we find difficulty in mending it sufficiently to be presented to the reader  wot for you means by dat  speak your mother tongue you dog and make haste for the minister of marine wants you  oh mos awfrul exclaimed blindi turning pale and drawing his blue garment hastily round him as he meekly followed the officer of justicewhose chief office by the way was to administer injustice  the man whom we have styled blindi was a somewhat peculiar character he was an algerine by birth but had served several years in the british navy and had acquired a smattering of the english languageforecastle english as a matter of course  in consequence of this and of having lost an eye in the service he had obtained a pension and the appointment of interpreter to all his britannic majestys ships visiting algiers  he dwelt at the harbour or marina where he excited the wonder and admiration of all the turks and moors by his volubility in talking english  he was a man of no small importance in his own estimation and was so proud of his powers as a linguist that he invariably interlarded his converse with english phrases whether he was addressing turk jew or christian  lingua francaa compound of nearly all the languages spoken on the shores of the mediterraneanwas the tongue most in use at the marina of algiers at that time but as this would be unintelligible to our reader we will give blindis conversations in his favourite language  what his real name was we have failed to discover  the loss of his eye had obtained for him in the navy the name of blind bob  in his native city this was italianised into blindi bobi  but bobi was by no means blind of the other eye  it was like seven binocular glasses rolled into one telescope  once he had unfortunately brought it to bear on the minister of marine with such a concentrated stare that he being also blind of an eye regarded it as a personal allusion thereto and never forgave blindi bobi  this is the second time said omar when the culprit was brought before him that i have caught you interfering with the slaves  please sar hims was werry baddyin me spose  speak your own tongue dog else you shall smart for it said the minister of marine with increasing wrath  the poor interpreter to his britannic majestys navy repeated his words in the lingua franca but omar again interrupting him ordered the sbirro to take him off and give him the bastinado  and have a care blindi added omar observing that the interpreter was about to speak if you say that you are under the protection of the british consul ill have you flayed aliveoff with him  the sbirro with a comrade led bobi through several of the narrow streets of the town to a chamber which was set apart for the infliction of punishment  it was a dark vaulted apartment under a public building  the massive pillars of stone which supported its roof looked pale and ghostlike against the thick darkness which was beyond them giving the idea of interminable space  one of the sbirros lighted a lantern and led the way through a massive door all studded with huge nails into a small square chamber the walls of which looked as if they had been bespattered with a darkbrown liquid especially in the neighbourhood of several iron rings from which chains depended  in addition to these and a number of other characteristic implements there was a pile of bloodstained rods in a corner  saying a few words to a powerful negro whom they found in attendance the sbirros handed blindi bobi over to him  he instantly disrobed him of his blue gown and threw him on his back with the aid of an equally powerful assistant and began to uncover his stomach  the interpreter was no coward  he had prepared himself to endure manfully the bastinado on the soles of his feetas it was usually administeredbut when he perceived that they were about to inflict the blows on a more tender part of his body he trembled and remonstrated  sidi omar no say you hit im dare  hims peal to british consil  thus far he spoke from the force of habit in his adopted tongue but fear speedily drove him to that of his mother  all tongues however were alike to the negroes who rendered callous from long service against their will in a brutalising office went about their preparations with calm and slow indifference  just as they were about to begin one of the sbirros who had a personal regard for bobi spoke a few words to one of the negroes who immediately turned blindi bobi on his face and firmly raised his feet so that the naked soles were turned upwards  the other negro applied one of the rods thereto with all his might  for a few seconds the poor sufferer uttered no sound but at last he gave vent to an irresistible yell  at a sign from the chief sbirro the punishment was stopped and bobi was released and allowed to rise  conducting him to the door the sbirro thrust him into the street flung his blue gown after him and advised him to beware of again rousing the wrath of sidi omar  blindi bobi was far too well acquainted with the cruelties perpetrated continually in the pirate city to be ignorant of the fact that he had got off with a light punishment yet we fear that did not cause him to entertain much gratitude to sidi omar as he limped back to his quarters at the marina  arrived there he observed that the sick old man still lay where he had left him  running towards him with a sudden impulse he drew forth his flask knelt down raised the old mans head and gave him a long hearty draught after which he took another to himself  derre he said rising and shaking his fist defiantly in the direction in which sidi omar dwelt is revenged on youbrute bah booo  after this relief to his feelings blindi bobi went home to attend to his poor feet    note 1  in 1795 the americans concluded peace with the algerians by the payment of half a million piastres and an annual tribute of 24000 piastres    chapter five  shows the light in which consuls were regarded by pirates and tells of a cruel separation and a stunning blow  seated on a throne in a recess of the audiencechamber of the palace achmet pasha at length condescended to receive don pedro the representative of spain  the dey was robed in barbaric splendour and absolutely shone with gold embroidery and precious stones  centuries of robbery on the high seas had filled the treasury of the pirates nest to overflowing not only with hard cash but with costly gems of all kinds hence there was a lavish expenditure of jewellery on the costumes of the dey and his wives and courtiers  the recess in which he sat had a domeceiling of workmanship so elaborate that there was not a square inch of unadorned stucco on any part of it  it was lighted partly from the roof by means of four minute windows of yellow crimson green and blue glass  the walls were decorated with coloured china tiles and the floor was paved with white marble  in front of the throne or elevated dais couched the magnificent lion which we have already mentioned  it was the deys whim to use this animal as a footstool on all public occasions much to the annoyance of his courtiers and household who felt although they did not dare to express it considerable anxiety lest it should take a sudden fancy to feed on human flesh  behind the dey stood several guards two of whom were negroes  don pedro bowed low on being admitted and the lion raising his head uttered a low growl which had something distantly thunderous in the tone  being apparently satisfied that the don was a friend it again laid its chin on its paws and appeared to go to sleep  the spanish consul was a finelooking dignified man with a nose sufficiently prominent to account for the irreverent reference made to it by hadji baba the storyteller  in a few words he stated his case touching the female captives recently brought in by sidi hassan and claimed that as spanish subjects they should be set free and placed under his care  what proof can you give demanded the dey that these ladies are really the subjects of spain  alas replied don pedro i have no means of verifying what i say but i feel assured that your highness will not doubt my word when i say that while in my own land i knew the family to which they belong  that is not sufficient returned the dey  from all that i can learn their father lived and died and they were born in sicily and the eldest is the wife of an italian merchant who will doubtless be glad to pay a good ransom to get her and his little infant back  as to the sister we can find room for her in the palace if she be not ransomed besides monsieur le consolehere the dey spoke sternlyyour word is not a good guarantee  did you not give me your word three months ago that your government would pay the six thousand dollars which are still due to us  why has not this promise been fulfilled  it grieves me your highness replied don pedro with a mortified look that this debt has not yet been discharged but i can assure you that i have communicated with my sovereign on the subject and have no doubt that a satisfactory explanation and reply will be sent to you without delay  it is to be hoped that such may be the case for i give you my word and you may safely rely on itthat if the cash is not sent to me immediately i will send you to work in chains in the quarries with the other slavesgo let your sovereign know my intention as speedily as may be  lest the reader should be surprised to hear of any consul being thus cavalierly treated it may be well to explain that the barbarians who were thus unworthily honoured in being recognised by the european powers at all were grossly ignorant of the usages of civilised nations and of the sacred character in which the persons and families of consuls are held  the deys of algiers were constantly in the habit of threatening the consuls themselves with flagellation and death in order to obtain what they desired from their respective governments and sometimes even carried their threats into executionas an instance of which we may cite the wellauthenticated fact that when the french admiral duquesne bombarded algiers the consul and twentytwo other frenchmen were sent out to the fleet in small piecesblown from the mouths of cannon true this was in the year 1683 but up to the very end of their bloody and ferocious domination the deys maintained their character for ignorance and barbarityevidence of which shall be given in the sequel of our tale  when don pedro had been thus ignominiously dismissed sidi hassan was sent for by the dey  this man was one of the most turbulent characters in the city and the dey thought it his wisest policy to secure his friendship if possible by mingling kindness with severity  in the event of this course failing he comforted himself with the reflection that it would not be difficult to get rid of him by the simple and too frequently used process of strangulation  the knowledge that hassan was a favourite among the turkish troops prevented his at once adopting the latter method  he was all urbanity and smiles therefore when the pirate captain obeyed his summons  he thanked him for the two pretty slavegirls he had brought in commended him for his success in taking prizes and added that he had appointed him to fill the office of attendant janissary upon the british consul  up to this point sidi hassan had listened with satisfaction but the appointment just offered seemed to him so contemptible that he had difficulty in dissembling his feelings  the knowledge however that his despotic master held his life in his hand induced him to bow and smile as if with gratitude  and now said the dey i have a commission for you  go to the british consul tell him of your appointment and present him with my compliments and with the eldest slavegirl and her infant as a gift from me  paulina is her name is it not  yes your highnesspaulina ruffini and the sisters name is angela diego  good  angela you may keep to yourself continued the dey as coolly as if he had been talking of a silver snuffbox  hassan again bowed and smiled and again had to constrain his countenance to express gratification though he was not a little disgusted with achmets indifference to the captive girls  leaving the palace in a state of high indignation he resolved to sell angela in the public market although by so doing he could not hope to gain so much as would have been the case were he to have disposed of her by private bargain  thus with strange perversity does an angry man often stand in the way of his own interests  we need scarcely say that when their fate was announced to the unhappy sisters they were plunged into a state of wild grief clung to each others necks and refused to be separated  little did sidi hassan care for their grief  he tore them asunder locked paulina up with her infant and led the weeping angela to the slavemarket which was in the immediate neighbourhood of one of the largest mosques of the city  this mosque named djama djedid still stands under the name of the mosquee de la pecherie one of the most conspicuous and picturesque buildings in algiers  it was built in the seventeenth century by a genoese architect a slave who unfortunately for himself built it in the form of a cross for which he was put to death by the reigning dey in front of the northern door of this mosque the narrow streets of the city gave place to a square in which was held the market for christian slaves  here might be seen natives of almost every countrymen and women and children of all ages and complexions civilised and uncivilised gentle and simpleexposed for sale while turbaned turks moors in broadcloth burnouses and gay vestments jews in dark costume arabs from the desert and men of nondescript garments and character moved about criticising examining buying and selling  just as sidi hassan reached the market a gang of christian slaves were halted near the door of the mosque  it was evening  they had been toiling all day at the stonequarries in the mountains and were now on their way weary ragged and footsore to the bagnio or prison in which were housed the public slavesthose not sold to private individuals but retained by government and set to labour on the public works  a few of these slaves wore ponderous chains as a punishment for having been unrulythe others were unshackled  among them stood our unfortunate friends francisco rimini and his sons lucien and mariano but ah how changed  only two days had elapsed since their arrival yet their nearest friends might have failed to recognise them so dishevelled were they and their faces so covered with dust and perspiration  for their own garments had been substituted ragged shirts and loose turkish drawers reaching to below the knee  old straw hats covered their heads but their lower limbs and feet were naked where not stained by blood and dust the fairness of their skins showed how little they had been used to such exposure  luciens countenance wore an expression of hopeless despair that of his father which was wont to look so bluff and hearty now betrayed feelings of the tenderest pity as if he had forgotten his own sufferings in those of his children mariano on the contrary looked so stubborn and wicked that no one could have believed it possible he had ever been a gay kindly lighthearted youth  poor fellow his high spirit had been severely tried that day but evidently not tamed though the blood on the back of his shirt showed that his drivers had made vigorous attempts to subdue him  during the heat of the day lucien had grown faint from toil and hunger and had received a cruel lash from one of their guardians  this had roused mariano  he had sprung to avenge the blow had been seized by three powerful men lashed until he became insensible and on recovering had been forced to continue his toil of carrying stones until not only all the strength but apparently all the spirit was taken out of him  from this condition he was reviving slightly when he reached the marketplace and as his strength returned the firm pressure of his lips and contraction of his brows increased  the slavedrivers were not slow to observe this and two of them took the precaution to stand near him  it was at this critical moment that the poor youth suddenly beheld angela diego led into the marketmore interesting and beautiful than ever in her sorrowto be sold as a slave  mariano had been deeply touched by the sorrow and sad fate of the sisters when he first saw them on board the piratevessel  at this sight of the younger sister prudence which had retained but a slight hold of him during the day lost command altogether  in a burst of uncontrollable indignation he sent one of his guards crashing through the open doorway of the mosque drove the other against the corner of a neighbouring house rushed towards sidi hassan and delivered on the bridge of that heros nose a blow that instantly laid him flat on the ground  at the same moment he was seized by a dozen guards thrown down bound and carried off to the whippinghouse where he was bastinadoed until he felt as if bones and flesh were one mass of tingling jelly  in this state almost incapable of standing or walking he was carried to the bagnio and thrown in among the other prisoners  while mariano was being conveyed away sidi hassan arose in a halfstupefied condition from the ground  fortunately he was ignorant of who had knocked him down and why he had been so treated or he might have vented his wrath on poor angela  just at that moment he was accosted by bacri the jewa convenient butt on whom to relieve himself for the despised israelites were treated with greater indignity in algiers at that time than perhaps in any other part of the earth  dog said he fiercely hast thou not business enough of thine own in fleecing men that thou shouldst interfere with me  dog though i may be returned bacri with gravity but without a touch of injured feeling i do not forget that i promised you four thousand dollars to spare the christians and it is that which induces me to intrude on you now  humph ejaculated hassan somewhat mollified i verily believe that thou hast some interested and selfish motive at the bottom  however that business is thine not mine  whether my motive be interested or not you are well able to judge returned bacri gently for the slaves are poor and helpless they are also christians and you know well that the jews have no love for the christians in which respect it seems to me that they bear some resemblance to the men of other creeds  sidi hassan felt that there was an intended sarcasm in the last remark but the thought of the dollars induced him to waive further discussion  do you wish to sell the girl said bacri in a casual way as though it had just occurred to him  ay but i must have a good price for her replied the turk  name it said the jew my wife has need of a handmaiden just now  hassan named a sum much larger than he had any expectation the jew would give  to his surprise the other at once agreed to it  why bacri he said with a smile as with his right hand he tenderly caressed his injured nose you must have been more than usually successful in swindling of late  god has recently granted me more than deserved prosperity returned the other  without further palaver the bargain was struck  hassan accompanied the jew to his residence in one of the quaint moorish houses of the old town  angela was handed over to bacris wife a pleasantvisaged woman of forty and hassan returned home with his pockets well lined his nose much swelled and his temper greatly improved  bethinking him of the deys commands he set out with paulina and her infant for the residence of the british consul which lay a short distance outside the northern wall of the town not far from the bluff height on which at the present day towers the picturesque pile of notredame dafrique    chapter six  sends a gleam of hope into a gloomy region  the short twilight of southern latitudes was giving place to the shades of night when bacri the jew issued from the low door of his house and threaded the narrow labyrinth of streets which compose the old town of algiers  the greater part of the old or as it is styled the moorish town remains almost exactly the same at the present time that it was at the time of which our tale treats  it occupied the face of a steep hill and was built in the form of a triangle the apex being a fort or casba near the summit of the hill  the base was a street of oriental houses upwards of half a mile in extent beyond which the seawall well lined with batteries rose directly from the beach and was washed by the spray in every breeze  all the houses facing the sea have now been taken down and their places are occupied by wide handsome streets of french buildings the beach and the site of the old wall being occupied by splendid quays wharves and terraces  the houses of the moorish town were square whitewashed blocks built so close to each other that most of the streets were mere lanes not more than from six to ten feet wide  no windows worthy of the name garnished the dead white walls of these houses whose light sprang in reality from within each house being in the form of a square of building surrounding a central court which at the top was open to the weather  the real windows of the houses looked into the courts which however were by no means dismal  they had fountains in the midst of them which sent up a perpetualand in such a climate gratefulsound of trickling water while in their corners and elsewhere boxes of earth enabled bananatrees and palms and various creepers to convert the little spots into delightful though miniature gardens  such windows as opened outwards were mere loopholes not much more than a foot square many of them lessthe larger of them being always strongly grated most of these houses projected beyond their basement storeys thus rendering the open space above narrower than the streets below and in many cases the walls absolutely met and converted the streets into tunnels  strange wooden props seemingly insufficient for their duty upheld these projecting upper storeys and gave a peculiarly uneuropean character to the streetsa character which became still more perplexing to the stranger when he observed here and there in places where architecture had scarcely space or light to be seen fountains of the most elegant design and workmanship doorways of white marble most elaborately and beautifully carved and entrancehalls that resembled courts of the alhambra in miniature  when one first sees such things they induce surprise but the surprise evaporates when we reflect that these pirates had at their command the services of thousands of slaves many of whom represented the artistic talent of the civilised world  passing rapidly along these narrow streets and bending his tall form when he came to low archways bacri at length emerged on the chief high street of the town which entering at the north or babeloued gate completely traversed the city under that name as far as the deys palace where it changed its name to babazoun and terminated at the south gate of the same name  in this street was the bagnio already mentioned as being the prison of the government slaves  here bacri paused drew a glittering coin from his pocket and knocked at a strong oaken door  a janissary opened and roughly demanded his business but changed his tone at once and gave the jew admission on receiving the coin  passing though a lobby whose marble pillars were sadly broken and disfigured the jew entered a courtyard open to the sky around which were a number of recesses or cells  in these the unhappy slaves sat huddled together  they were not cold for it was summer but their misery and want of space probably induced them to cling closely to each other  the place had once been a bathing establishment and an old fountain still gurgled in the centre of the court but its drains had been choked long ago and the waters had overflowed to find exit as they best might rendering the floor a damp and uncomfortable residence for scorpions centipedes and other repulsive insects  the slaves received only two small rolls of black bread as their rations at the close of each day and they were too eagerly engaged in devouring these to pay much regard to their visitor  looking carefully round the jew at length discovered the objects of his searchfrancisco lucien and mariano rimini  the two first were seated side by side eating their meagre meal  mariano lay near them heavily laden with irons and also endeavouring to eat  friends said bacri approaching them  villain cried mariano starting up into a reclining attitude despite the agony that the act occasioned and fixing his eyes on the jew  you do me injustice young man said bacri seating himself on the basement of a pillar  it may be that he does you injustice said lucien sternly nevertheless we have all of us good reason to believe that you are a friend of the pirate hassan and no friend of ours  whether friend or foe say thy say man and be gone cried the bluff francisco whose spirit suffered even more than his body from the indignities to which he had been subjected that day  listen then said bacri impressively  you know my name and nation but you do not know that i am the chief of the jews in this city of devils  i and my people are regarded by these followers of mohammed as worse than the dogs in their streets yet while they treat us with the utmost indignity they know that we are good traders and as such bring riches within their walls  i have powerthe power of wealthto help you at a pinch indeed i have helped you for it was only by means of a promise of gold that i induced sidi hassan to spare your lives when his men were bent on taking them  but that is not what i came to tell you tonight  i came to say that the poor captive girls with whom you voyaged to this place are for the present out of danger  say you so exclaimed mariano eagerly  how can that be  did i not see angela led to the slavemarket this very afternoon  you did and i purchased her for the purpose of protecting her  she is now in my house  her sister and the infant have been sent as a temporary gift or loan to the british consul under whose care she is safe for the present  but be not too sanguine added bacri seeing that marianos countenance brightened the whim of the dey or a change of government which latter is common enough here may totally alter the state of affairs  if the dey willed it i could not hold anything that belongs to me for an hour  they call us dogs and treat us as such  they are themselves dogs cried mariano indignantly  christians have called us by the same name returned the jew calmly thereby proving the falsity of their own faith  say not so cried lucien with animation  many calling themselves christians have undoubtedly treated your race ill but those who really love the lord jesus cannot help respecting the people from whom himself sprang  i side not with those who disgrace themselves by vilifying the jews  lucien extended his hand as he spoke and bacri grasped it kindly  bah you are fools all of you arrant idiots cried a wildlooking ragged man in the neighbouring cell starting up and glaring at them as he clenched his fists  what avails christianity or judaism or anything else here  tis a world of fiendsha ha murderers tormentors hypocritesha ha  here the man gave vent to a burst of wild ferocious laughter so loud that even the careless and callous warder was disturbed and rattled his keys as if about to enter  the sound appeared to send a chill to the heart of the captive an expression of terror overspread his thin haggard features and he shrunk together as he retired quickly to the remotest corner of his cell  a maniac i fear said francisco in a low tone observing that the jew regarded him with a look of pity  no not quite mad replied bacri in the same low tone but sometimes very near it i think  poor man i know him well  he has been fifteen years a prisoner in algiers  when first brought here he was as fine a specimen of a genoese youth as i ever saw  his name is lorenzo benoni he was captured with his wife and two children all of whom died before the first year was out  of course although in the same city he was never again permitted to see wife or children  he was very dangerous at first attacking and nearly killing his guards whenever he got a chance and frequently attempting to take his own life so that they were obliged to make him work constantly in heavy irons and i need scarcely add bastinadoed and tortured him until his body became a mass of bruises from head to foot  they subdued him in the course of years to a condition of callous and brutal indifference to everything and at last his great strength began to give way  he is now considered incapable of doing much injury to any one and seems almost tamed  the turks think that this has been brought about by sickness and starvation it may be partly so but i cannot help thinking that despite the contempt which in a sudden burst of passion he poured on it just now religion has something to do with it for i have noticed a considerable change in him since he began to listen to the voice of an old man who has been a true friend of the poor slaves since long before i came here the old man professes at least he teaches your religion but i know not to what sect he belongs  indeed i think he belongs to none  this however am i sure of that he holds equally by our scriptures and your testament as being the whole word of god  the three captives listened to this narration with sinking hearts for it opened up a glimpse of the terrible and hopeless future that lay before themselves so that for some time they sat gazing in silence at their visitor and at the miserable beings who were devouring the last crumbs of their black bread around them  i came to see you continued bacri partly to assure you of the comparative safety of the girls who interested us all so much on board the vessel of sidi hassan and partly to say that i will do what lies in my power to alleviate your sad condition  with luciens education and knowledge of languages it may be possible to get him into the immediate service of the dey in which case he will be able to aid his father and brother  have you then much influence with the dey asked francisco  none replied the jew with a sad smile  i have already told you that the pirates detest us that we are tolerated only because of our moneymaking powers and the ease with which they can bleed us when they want gold  but i have some influence with others in the city who have power to move the dey  there is one thing however here the jew glanced pointedly at mariano in regard to which i would give you most earnest counsel namely that you should at once dismiss all idea of rebellion  it will be utterly unavailing  you may like the caged lion if you will dash yourselves to death against your prison bars but you cannot break them  countless thousands of bold and brave spirits have attempted this plan with no good result in time past the turks are well acquainted with and quite prepared for it  your only chance of mitigating the woes of your condition lies in submission  it were better and nobler to die than to submit said mariano gloomily  it were better and nobler to bow to the will of the almighty than to commit suicide retorted bacri somewhat sternly  it is selfishness and pride which induces us to seek deliverance from sorrow and suffering in death  there are men who have thought that truest nobility lay in choosing a life in the midst of suffering and woe for the purpose of alleviating it and who have acted on their opinion  this lesson however is not so frequently learnt by us through precept as in the school of sorrow  mariano felt abashed yet at the same time rather nettled  truly then he said with a glance at his bloodstained shirt it seems to me that i have at all events begun my lesson in the right school  however i believe thou art right bacri and i bear thee no illwill for the rap thou didst bestow on my skull which luckily is a thick one else thy ponderous fist had split it from the cranium to the chin  we had misjudged you bacri said francisco extending his hand as the jew rose to depart  we will lay your advice to heart and we thank you meanwhile for coming to see us in this foul den which i dislike less because of moisture and dirtthese being familiar to methan because of the lively reptiles which hold their nightly revels in it  there was mingled humour and bitterness in franciscos tone as he uttered this sentence which he concluded with a heavy sigh immediately after the rusty bolts of their prisondoor grated harshly on their ears and they listened sadly to the retreating footsteps of one whom they now esteemed their only friend as they died away in the distance    chapter seven  some new characters walk glide and furiously gallop into the tale and otherwise introduce themselves to notice  in the interior court of a beautiful moorish villa not far from the city sat mrs langley wife of colonel langley british consul at the court of algiers  the lady of whom we write was unusually romantic for her romance consisted of a deep undercurrent of powerful but quiet enthusiasm with a pretty strong surfaceflow of commonsense  her husband was a man of noble mind and commanding presencea magnificent representative john bull with the polish of a courtier and the principles of a christian one who had been wisely chosen to fill a very disagreeable post full of responsibility and danger  on a stool at the feet of mrs langley sat a sunny second edition of herself about eight years of age named agnes  in the cradle which agnes had formerly occupied reposed a remarkably plump and dimpled representative of the colonel  when respectfully addressed he was called jim but he was more familiarly known as baby  a small negress from beyond the zahara and blacker than any coal rocked jim violently  for thisnot the rocking but the violenceshe had been unavailingly rebuked by mrs langley until that ladys heart had nearly lost all hope  thereyou have done it again zubby said mrs langley referring to a push that wellnigh rolled master jim as a seacaptain once said out at the starboard side of the cradle  zubby confessed her guilt by looking abashedand what a solemn look an abashed one is in a negress with very large eyesas well as by rocking more gently  agnes vented a sudden little laugh at the expression of zubbys face and the door opening at that moment colonel langley entered the court and sat down beside his wife under the giant leaves of a small bananatree whose life was drawn from a boxful of earth about three feet square  my dear said the colonel i have two rather amusing things to lay before you this evening  one is a gift from the dey the other is a letter  which will you have first  the gift of course replied the lady  let her come in ali called the colonel to his interpreter who stood in the passage outside  rais ali a moor clad in the usual turkish garb but with a red fez or skullcap on his head instead of a turban threw open the door leading out of the court and ushered in poor paulina ruffini with her child  is this the deys gift asked the astonished lady rising hurriedly  it is at least she is lent to us and we are bound to accept her address her in french my dear she does not understand english  in fact youd better take her to your own room and have a talk  mrs langley addressed to the poor captive a few reassuring words and led her away leaving the colonel to amuse himself with agnes  what has she been sent to us for asked agnes  to be a serva companion to you and baby my pet  that was kind of the dey wasnt it said the child  wellyees oh yes doubtless it was very kind of him replied the colonel  we fear that the colonel did not fully appreciate the kindness that resulted in the gift either of paulina ruffini as his servant or of sidi hassan as his attendant for he saw clearly that the former was unaccustomed to menial work and he knew that sidi hassan was a turbulent member of the community  however being a man of prompt action and knowing that it was of the utmost importance that he should stand well in the good graces of the dey he resolved to receive paulina into his establishment as governess of the nursery and companion to his wife and to leave sidi hassan very much to the freedom of his own will so long as that will did not interfere with the interests of the consulate  on the return of his wife he listened to her pathetic account of paulinas sad history and then produced the letter to which he had referred on first entering  this letter necessitates my riding into town immediately  it is a curious document in its way therefore lend me your ear  opening it he began to read  we give it verbatim et literatim    to the brittish cownsul algeers    7 teenth jully 18    sur im an irishman an a sailer an recked on the cost of boogia wid   six of me messmaits hoo are wel an arty tho too was drowndid on landin   an wan wos spiflikated be the moors which are born divls an no   mistaik  i rite to say that weer starvin but the kaid as they cals   the guvner here says heel take a ransum for us of 150 spanish dolars   the kaid has past his word in yoor name to the moors for that sum or   theyd hav spiflikate us too  i hope yer onor has as much to spair in   yer pokit an will luke alive wid it for if yoo dont its all up wid   me mesmaits inkloodin yoor onors obedent humbil servint to comand ted   flagan  well i hope with poor flaggan said mrs langley laughingly that you have as much to spare in your pokit for if not it is plain that the poor fellows will be led into captivity  i would readily advance a larger sum for so good an end replied the consul folding the letter  i shall at once ride into town to make arrangements and as it is so late will pass the night in our town house  i shall send our new attendant sidi hassan on this mission and leave you for the night under the guardianship of rais ali  the consul left immediately and next morning sidi hassan set out for bugia with the necessary ransom  in regard to this we need say nothing more than that he accomplished his purpose paid the ransom and received the seven british seamen accompanied by whom he commenced the return journey he and his men riding and driving the sailors on foot before them as though they had been criminals  on the way however they were attacked not far from algiers by a body of predatory arabs from the jurjura mountains  these bold villains at the very first onset killed more than half of the turkish escort and put the rest to flight  six of the sailors they captured and carried off but ted flaggan who was an exceedingly active as well as powerful man proved himself more than a match for them all during the melee he managed to throw himself in the way of one of the bestmounted among the arabs who instantly charged him but ted sprang aside and let him pass ducking low to avoid a cut from his curved sword  before he could turn the irishman ran close to his side seized him by the burnous at the same time grasping his bridle and pulled him out of the saddle with such sudden violence that he fell headlong to the ground where he lay quite stunned by the fall  flaggan instantly sprang into the saddle as if he had been an accomplished cavalier though in reality he knew no more about horses than an esquimaux however a man who was accustomed to hold on to a topsailyard in a gale was not to be easily shaken off by an arab charger  he clung to the high saddlebow with one hand and with the other grasped his claspknife which he opened with his teeth  therewith he probed the flanks of his fiery steed to such an extent that he not only distanced all his arab pursuers but overtook and passed his own escort one by one until he reached sidi hassan himself  he then attempted to pull up but the claspknife had fired the chargers blood in an unusual degree  with a wicked snort and fling that lifted flaggan high out of the saddle it rushed madly on left the pirate captain far behind and at length dashed through the babazoun gate of algiers despite the frantic efforts of the guard to check or turn it  right onward it sped through the street babazoun scattering turks moors jews negroes and all the rest of them like chaff passed the deys palace straight along the street bab eloued out at the watergate with similar contempt of the guards down into the hollow caused by the brook beyond up the slope on the other side halfway towards the summit on the opposite side of frais vallon and was not finally pulled up until it had almost run down the british consul who chanced to be riding leisurely homeward at the time  you seem to have had a pretty sharp run my man said the consul laughing as the irishman thankfully jumped off and grasped the bridle of the now thoroughly winded horse  faix an i have yer honour an if i havent run down an kilt half the population o that town wotevers its name no thanks to this selfopiniated beast replied flaggan giving the bridle a savage pull  youre an irishman i perceive said the consul smiling  well now yer right sur though how ye came to persaive is more nor i can understand  where have you come from and how in such a plight demanded the consul in some surprise observing that a troop of janissaries came galloping up the winding road near the top of which they stood  sorrow wan o me knows where we touched at last replied the seaman in some perplexity the names goes out o me head like wather out of a sieve  all im rightly sure of is that i set sail four days ago from a port they calls boogee or sothin like it in company with a man called seedy hassan an sure hed ha bin seedy enough be now if his horse hadnt bin a good un for we wos attacked and half his party killed and took forby my six messmates but  your name is ted flaggan inquired the consul hastily  it is said the seaman in great surprise sure yer honour must be  the sentence was cut short by the arrival of the janissaries who pulled up with looks of considerable astonishment on finding the mad fugitive engaged in quiet conversation with the british consul  gentlemen said colonel langley with much urbanity of tone and manner i suppose you wish to make a prisoner of this man  the soldiers admitted that such was their desire and intention  then you will oblige me continued the colonel by allowing me to be his jailer in the meantime  he is a british subject of whom i can give a good account at the fitting time and place  sidi hassan under whose charge he has been by my orders will doubtless soon arrive in town and further enlighten you on this subject  without waiting for a reply the colonel bowed and wheeling his horse round rode quietly away followed by the irishman who regarded his new jailer with a very puzzled look while a touch of humour further tended to wrinkle his remarkably expressive countenance    chapter eight  ted flaggan and rais ali proceed on a mission and see impressive sights  two days after the events narrated in the last chapter mrs langley being seated on her favourite couch in the court under the small bananatree sent zubby into the garden to command the attendance of ted flaggan  that worthy was gifted with a rare capacity for taking the initiative in all things when permitted to do so and had instituted himself in the consuls mansion as assistant gardener assistant cook and hostler assistant footman and nurseryman as well as general advicegiver and factotum much to the amusement of all concerned for he knew little of anything but was extremely goodhumoured helpful and apart from advicegivingmodest  flaggan said mrs langley when the stout seaman appeared hat in hand i want you to accompany our interpreter rais ali into town to bring out a message from a gentleman named sidi omar  ali himself has other duties to attend to and cannot return till evening so take particular note of the way lest you should miss it in returning  i will maam replied ted with a forecastle bow does mister ally onderstand english  oh yes returned mrs langley with a laugh  i forgot that he was absent when you arrived  you will find that he understands all you say to him though im not quite sure that you will understand all he says to you  like some of the other moors here he has been in the british navy and has acquired a knowledge of english  youll find him a pleasant companion i doubt not  be so good as to tell him that i wish to see him before he leaves  obedient to the summons rais ali quickly appeared  the interpreter was a stout tall dignified man of about thirtyfive with a great deal of selfassertion and a dash of humour expressed in his countenance  ali said mrs langley you are aware that sidi omar is to be married tomorrow  i have been invited to the wedding but have stupidly forgotten the hour at which i was asked to see the bride dressed  will you go to sidi omar or some of his people and find this out  take the sailor mr flaggan with you and send him back with the information as soon as possible  yis mum replied the interpreter an please mum i was want too tree days leave of absins  no doubt colonel langley will readily grant your request  have you some particular business to transact or do you merely desire a holiday  bof replied the moor with a mysterious smile  ise got finished the partikler bizziness of bein spliced yesterdays an i wants littil holiday  indeed said mrs langley in surprise you have been very quiet about it  ho yis wery quiet  where is your bride ali  i should like so much to see her  hers at ome safe said rais ali touching a formidable key which was stuck in his silken girdle  what have you locked her up  yisbleeged to do so for keep her safe  not alone i hope said mrs langley  no not lone  hers got a bootiflul cat an i means buy her a little nigger boy soon  having arranged that mrs langley was to visit his bride on her way to sidi omars wedding the following day rais ali set out on his mission accompanied by mr flaggan  the irishman soon discovered that the moor was a conceited coxcomb and a barefaced boaster and ere long began to suspect that he was an arrant coward  he was however goodhumoured and chatty and ted being in these respects likeminded rather took a fancy to him and slily encouraged his weakness  ye must have seed a power o sarvice in the navy now he said with an air of interest how came you to git into it  ha that wos cos o me bein sitch a strong goodlookin feller replied ali with an air of selfsatisfaction  just so said flaggan but its not common to hear of moors bein taken aboard our men o war dee see  its that as puzzles me  oh thats easy to splain returned ali  the fac is id bin for sevl year aboord a maltese trader tween meddrainean an liverpl and got so like a english tar you coodnt tell the one fro the oder  spok english too like natif  ha exclaimed ted nodding his head gravelywell  well one night wen we was all sleeperin in port in a ouse on shore the pressgang comes round an nabs the whole of us  we fight like lions  i knock seven men down one before the tother cause of bein very strong an had learn to spar a littil  you know how to spar  well returned ted looking with a smile at his huge hands i cant go for to say as i know much about the science of it dee see but i can use my fists after a fashion  good continued the moor  well then we fights till all our eyes is black an all our noses is red an some of our teeths is out but the sailirs wos too many for us  we wos bleeged to gif in for wot kin courage do agin numbers so we wos took aboord a friggit and zamined  an what asked the seaman  zamined  overhauled replied the moor  oh examined i see  well  well i feels sure of git hoff bein a algerine moor so wen my turn comes i says to the hofficer wot zamined us says i is not a breetish man  wot are you then says the hofficer  is a moor says i  moors the pity says he  ted gave a short laugh at this  now thats strange observed ali glancing at his companion in some surprise thats zactly wot they all did wen the hofficer says that ive thought oftin bout it since but never could see wot they laugh at  oh its just a way weve got returned flaggan resuming his gravity the english have a knack o larfin off and on wen they shouldnt ought togit along with your yarn  well that wos the finish  i became a breetish tar an fouted in all the battils of the navy  i spected to get promotion an prizemoney but nivir git none cause of circumstances as wos never splained to me  well one night we come in our friggit to anchor in bay of algiers i gits leave go ashore wi tothers runs right away to our dey who gits awrful waxy sends for breetish capn splain that is the son of a turk by a algerine moder an wery nigh orer the capns head to be cutted off  you dont say so  yis its troo  wery near declare war with england acause of that said ali with an air of importance  but the breetish consul he interfere goes down on hims knees an beg the dey for to parding hims nation  he must ha bin a cowardly feller that consul  no said the interpreter sternly hims not coward  him was my master kurnil langley an only do the right ting humbil hisself to our dey wen hims contry do wrongnow here we is comin to babeloued that means the watergate in yoor lingo were the peepils hold palaver  this in truth appeared to be the case for many of the chief men of the city were seated under and near the gate as the two drew near smoking their pipes and gossiping in the orthodox eastern style  the big irishman attracted a good deal of notice as he passed through the gates but turks are grave and polite by nature no one interrupted him or made audible comments upon his somewhat wild and unusual appearance  passing onwards they entered the town and traversed the main street towards the babazoun gate which ali explained to his companion was the gate of tears and the place of public execution  here they came suddenly on the body of a man the feet and limbs of which were dreadfully mangled showing that the miserable wretch had perished under the bastinado  at the time we write of and indeed at all times during turkish rule human life was held very cheap  for the slightest offences or sometimes at the mere caprice of those in power men were taken up and bastinadoed in the open streets until they died from sheer agony and their relations did not dare to remove the bodies for burial until their tyrants had left the scene  cruelty became almost the second nature of the people  theft was checked by the amputation of the first joint of the forefinger of the right hand for the first offence  for the second the whole hand was sacrificed and for the third the head itself was forfeited  sometimes in cases of capital punishment decapitation was performed by degrees and other refinements too horrible to mention were constantly practised  while the interpreter was explaining to his companion as much of this as he deemed it right for him to know several of the sorrowing relations of the dead man came forward and carried the body away  little notice was taken of the incident which from beginning to end scarcely interrupted the general flow of business  at the babazoun gate which occupied a position not many yards distant from the spot on which now stands the principal theatre of algiers ali left ted flaggan for a few minutes begging him to wait until he had transacted a piece of business in the market held just outside the gate  tell me before ye go ally what may be the use of them three big hooks close to the gate said flaggan pointing upwards  thems for throwin down teeves an murderers on toyou stay here me not be wery long come back  rais ali hurried away leaving the sailor to observe and moralise on all that passed around him  and there was a good deal to induce thought in one who had been accustomed to comparatively humane laws and merciful dispensations in his native land for besides the scene which he had just witnessed and the huge hooks whose uses had just been explained to him he now noticed that several conspicuous places near him were garnished with the heads of malefactors who had been recently executed he observed also that the innumerable donkeys which were being constantly driven past him overladen with market produce were covered with open sores and that these sores appeared to be selected for special flagellation when the brutal drivers wished to urge the wretched creatures on  he stood thus for some time watching with interest the throng of turks jews moors negroes and others that continually streamed to and fro some on foot some on horseback and others especially the men with marketable commodities on mules and donkeys  it was not difficult for him to distinguish between the races for rais ali had already told him that none but turks were permitted to wear the turban not even the sons of turks by algerine mothers and that the jews were by law commanded to dress in sombre black  suddenly he observed a body of men advancing towards the gate carrying something in their arms and followed by an orderly crowd at a respectful distance  with the curiosity of an idler he approached and found that they bore a man who was firmly bound hand and foot  the man was a moor and the anxious look of his pale face showed that he was about to suffer punishment of some kind  the seaman mingled with the crowd and looked on  laying the man on the ground with his face downwards the officers of justice sent away two of their number who speedily returned with a blacksmiths anvil and forehammer  on this they placed one of their victims ankles and flaggan now saw with a sickening heart that they were about to break it with the ponderous hammer  one blow sufficed to crush the bones in pieces and drew from the man an appalling shriek of agony  pushing his leg farther on the anvil the executioner broke it again at the shin while the other officials held the yelling victim down  a third blow was then delivered on the knee but the shriek that followed was suddenly cut short in consequence of the man having fainted  still the callous executioner went on with his horrible task and breaking the leg once more at the thigh proceeded to go through the same process with the other leg and also with the arms  when twelve blows had thus been delivered the writhing of the wretched victim proved that he was still alive though his labouring chest was now incapable of giving vent to his agony in shrieks  we would not describe such a scene as this were it not certainly true and we relate it reader not for the purpose of harrowing your feelings but for the sake of showing what diabolical deeds we men are capable of unless guarded therefrom by the loving and tender spirit of jesus christ  we say spirit advisedly for we are well aware that false professors of that blessed name have many a time committed deeds even more horrible than that which we have just described  unable to bear the sight longer the sailor turned and hurried away from the spot  fortunately he met rais ali just outside the crowd  come lad come he cried seizing that boastful man by the arm in such a grasp that rais turned pale with alarm  i cant stop here lets git away  sure its divls they must be an not men  blindly dragging the interpreter along by main force through several streets flaggan stopped suddenly at last to recover breath and to wipe the perspiration from his brow  dont ask me wot ive seen he said to alis inquiries i cant abear to think on it  god help me  i wish i could wipe it out of me brain intirely  come along lets finish our business an git out o this cursed place  proceeding rapidly and in silence towards the street at the base of the triangular town which followed the line of ramparts that faced the sea they discovered the great man of whom they were in search sidi omar walking up and down with the cadi or chief judge to whose daughter he was to be united on the following day  it wont do to trupt em jus yit  hold on a littil said rais ali to his companion  ted flaggan had no objection to hold on for the sight of the ocean with its fresh breezes cooled his brow and tended to turn his mind away from the horrible thoughts that filled it  while they are waiting let you and me reader listen to the conclusion of the converse held between the bridegroom and fatherinlaw  the cadi was a stern old turk with a long grey beard  the soninlaw elect was as we have elsewhere said an illfavoured elderly man with only one eye  he did not look quite so happy as one would have expected in a bridegroom so near his weddingday but that was to be accounted for to some extent by the fact that he already possessed four wives and was naturally somewhat used to weddings  no no said he in a cautious tone to the judge it wont do to be hasty about it achmet is too popular at present  what has that to do with the question asked the cadi in a tone of contempt  if our party be strong enough we have only to strike and i tell you that i believe it to be quite strong enough  i know it returned omar impatiently but i also know that my enemy sidi hassan is more than usually on the alert just now i think it well to delay for a time  besides he added smiling you surely would not have me begin a revolution on the very eve of my marriage  i would have you lose as little time as possible replied the cadi but see if i mistake not these two men are eyeing us rather narrowly  seeing that they were observed rais ali advanced and with a low salaam delivered his message to sidi omar who gave him the necessary reply and dismissed him  resuming their conference the two magnates turned to saunter along the street when omar observed a dark object like a dog coiled up in an angle of the parapet  poking it with his cane he caused it to uncoil and display the vacant features of a halfwitted negro boy  the poor creature fell on his knees in alarm on seeing the wellknown face of sidi omar but sprang to his feet with alacrity and ran off at full speed on being sternly told to be gone  meanwhile rais ali led his friend safely through the babeloued gate and turning his face in the right direction said  now you git ome fast  keep er steadya point morer to the westwardso yoo cant go wrong  instead of obeying orders ted flaggan turned and with an amused smile watched the retreating figure of the interpreter  then after sauntering on some distance in a reverie he stopped and gazed long and earnestly at the pirate city whose whitewashed domes and minarets gleamed in the sunshine like marble contrasting beautifully with the bright green of the sahel hills behind and the intense blue of the sky and sea  a whited sepulchre muttered the seaman with a frown as he turned away and pushed forward at a rapid pace towards the residence of the british consul    chapter nine  describes a moorish bride a wedding and a metamorphosis besides indicating a plot  on the following morning mrs langley set out on horseback for the palace of the cadi to attend the wedding of his daughter with sidi omar and true to her promise turned aside on the way to pay a visit to the imprisoned bride of rais ali  she was accompanied of course by the remarkable bridegroom himself and also by her husbands janissary sidi hassan as well as by her daughter agnes who rode a spirited arab pony  immediately on entering the gate of the city rais and the ladies dismounted and leaving their horses in charge of a groom ascended on foot one of the narrow streets of the town  so steep was this street that it consisted of a flight of broad steps which led ultimately to the casba or citadel at the upper part of the town  but before they had ascended it very far the interpreter diverged into a cross street which was much narrower  it terminated in a culdesac at the bottom of which stood the door of rais alis town residence  and a remarkable door it was made of thick oaken planks studded with enormous nails the heads of which were as large as a halfcrown  just above it there was a square hole grated with thick iron bars which served to enlighten the gloomy passage within  applying the key before mentioned to this door rais threw it open and bade the visitors enter  having carefully shut and relocked the door the interpreter led them through a narrow passage which terminated in the usual square court of moorish houses  this was very small and like all such courts had no roof so that a pleasant gleam of sunshine flickered through the creepers which twined up its pillars and gleamed on the drops that fell from a tinkling fountain in the centre  entering an open doorway on the right of the court the interpreter led the way up a flight of marble steps to the second storey of the house a small gallery such as one sees in public libraries in england ran round the four sides of the building over the balustrade of which one could look down on the leafy court with its ever singing jet deau the windows of the several private apartments opened upon this gallery  in the centre of one side of the square was a large open doorway in the form of a moorish arch by which entrance was obtained into a little extremely ornate apartment  the domeshaped roof of this boudoir was lighted by four little holes filled with stainedglass and the walls were covered with beautifully painted tiles  rich ornaments of various eastern and fanciful kinds were strewn about and valuable persian rugs covered the marble floor  on an ottoman in the centre of all sat rais alis bride crosslegged and on a cushion before her lay the cat her only companion  she was clothed in garments of the richest description which glittered with gold embroidery and jewels  seated thus stroking the cat and with a selfsatisfied smile on her fat pretty face she seemed the very personification of contentment  her soft brown neck was almost hidden with rows of pearls and long rows of the same jewels depended from the high filigree cap which towered above her head  her dress consisted of three open jackets or short caftans one above the other without sleeves  these were profusely garnished with gold lace and fastened only at the waist  white linen trousers or drawers covered her limbs to the ankles but these were so immensely wide as to bear more resemblance to female drapery than to the masculine appendages which their name suggests  a silken goldstriped shawl was fastened by two corners round her waist and hung down in front like an apron  sleeves of fine embroidered muslin and of great width covered her arms  her little feet and ankles were bare but the latter were ornamented with several thick gold leglets  in each ear she wore five large round earrings two of these fitting into two holes in the lower and three into the upper part of the ear  one awkward result of this was that the upper earrings pulled the ears down and made them pendent like those of a poodle  the visitors having been introduced madam rais ali received them with a goodhumoured stare but said nothing  mrs langley then tried to engage her in conversation but mrs ali continued to stare and smile without speaking for the good reason that she understood neither french nor english  requesting ali to interpret mrs langley then put one or two questions  the bride turned her large dark eyes on her husband while he was speaking and then instead of replying turned them on her visitors and laughed  whereupon little agnes unable to control herself also laughed this unhinged mrs langley who laughed likewise and rais ali followed suit from sympathy  after this satisfactory ebullition mrs langley again essayed to induce conversation but beyond yes no and a laugh she could draw forth nothing whatever from the bride whose mind in regard to all things terrestrial with the exception of household affairs was a perfect blank  mohammedan females are treated by their lords like babies  they receive no education worthy of the name and are therefore apt to be childish in their ideas  after one or two fruitless attempts the visitors took leave of the happy bride who was thereupon locked up again by her jealous husband and left to her own resources and the cat  returning to the place where their steeds had been left the party remounted and proceeded to the palace of the cadi  this palace being situated in one of the narrow lanes of the town had a very undignified and dull exterior  indeed no one could have imagined it to be a palace but for the spiral columns of marble and other rich and costly carving around the entrance  inside however the aspect of things was more in keeping with the dignity of the owner  the lady and her daughter were ushered into a little square hall in which several guards were seated crosslegged on small stone seats or niches round the walls smoking long pipes  beyond this was the principal entrancehall or antechamber of the palace  it was gorgeous in marble pillars stucco designs horseshoe arches and other mooresque decorations  here a large party of officials and friends were moving about  beyond this they came to the square court which is the same in general arrangements in all moorish houses though of course not in size or luxury of detail  here the cadi himself met his guests and conducted them to the suite of chambers on the second storey which were devoted to the ladies  at the principal entrance to these they were received by the cadis wife and with much display of friendliness and affection were conducted into the haremthat mysterious retreat which in a mohammedan household is never entered by mortal man except the lord thereof  it was mrs langleys first visit to such a scene and although she had been prepared for something magnificent the gorgeous nature of everything far surpassed her expectations  the rooms indeed were small being like those of all moorish dwellings rather long and narrow with recesses or antechambers  some of these latter had domeshaped roofs with little coloured glass skylights such as we have already described and were delightfully snug retreats  the walls and ceilings of all the apartments were profusely ornamented and the hangings and furniture were of the richest material  on a silken couch at the farther end of one of these small apartments sat the bride zara youngest daughter of the cadi and a lovely girl of nineteen  poor zara  her historynot by any means an uncommon one in that landgoes to prove that mohammedan women far more than english have need of a womens rights society  zara was already a widow with two beautiful children  her first husband to whom she had been married without her inclination being consulted had been strangled  it was afterwards proved that he was innocent of the crime for which he had suffered but that gave very little pain to the consciences of those who had strangled him partly because their consciences were callous and partly because they regarded the event as one of the decrees of fate  after his death it became necessary that another husband should be found for zara  she poor creature would have been thankful to have remained in a state of widowed felicity but this was not deemed proper by her wealthy relatives  of course it was not difficult to find a suitor where a pretty girl was the hook and a large dower the bait  sidi omar came forward and all the relatives said that it was an excellent matchall save one zaras eldest sister hanyfa  hanyfa wasto speak plainlya bad girl  she was one of the wives of a great officer of statein other words a particularly noted pirate named sidi hamet  now hamet was the aga or commanderinchief of the cavalry  he was an ambitious man and a rival of sidi omar in this respect  of course he hated omar and so did his wife hanyfa hence her objection to him as her sisters husband  but neither she nor hamet could stay the marriage they therefore made up their minds to endure it  one thing that struck and surprised mrs langley was the extreme fairness of many of the moorish ladies some of whom were quite as fair as europeans and very beautiful with much finer eyes than those of the more northern belles  having laid aside the shroudlike veils which moorish ladies wear when exposed to the slightest chance of meeting the gaze of man they now stood confessed in all the magnificence of oriental taste  it is impossible to describe the dazzling splendour of the jewels with which their costumes absolutely blazed especially those in the little golden caps or salmas which some of them wore  there were bouquets of roses jessamine peacocksfeathers and butterflies formed of diamonds rubies emeralds and other precious gems  we do not draw on our imagination here good reader  it is probable that if a comparison had been instituted these pirates could have far outshone any court of europe in the matter of jewellery  of course no gentlemen were present  it is one of the drawbacks of mohammedan female life that the ladies can never enjoy the satisfaction of displaying themselves to male admirers with the exception of husbands fathers and brothers  how far the display of themselves to each other is attended with pleasure remains a doubtful point especially when we consider that jealousy has not yet been quite eradicated from the female human breast  however on the occasion of which we write most of the assembled ladies appeared to be highly delighted with each other  they were all very merry too and being little better than children as regards intellectual training they were particularly childlike in their merriment  as the wife of the british consul was a lady of some importance just then the consul being high in favour with the dey she was received with becoming ceremony and conducted to a seat next the bride  this seat like the seats of orientals in general was simply a cushion laid on the marble floor  seating herself with some difficulty in the moorish fashion she proceeded to pay some compliments to the bride in english and french but as zara knew neither of these languages she shook her head smiled and returned some compliments in turkish whereupon mrs langley shook her head and smiled  the rest of the company from infection probably nodded to each other also and smiled two or three pretty young and rather stout girls turned aside and went the length of giggling  fortunately at this point an interpreter was brought forward in the person of an italian slave a goodlooking middleaged lady who understood french and who during a servitude of ten years had also acquired turkish  compliments were now bandied to and fro with great volubility without any introductory references to weather and much notice was taken of little agnes whose appearance was the cause of some goodnatured criticism among the algerine belles  as the costume of these latter with much variety in colour and detailbore strong general resemblance to that of the bride of rais ali it is not necessary to describe it more minutely  coffee and sweetmeats were now served the former in exquisitely delicate porcelain cups so small that they might have been easily mistaken for part of a dolls establishment  they had neither handles nor saucers and were prevented from burning the fingers by being inserted into what we may style eggcups of beautiful gold and silver filigree  the coffee was too thick to suit the european palate being ground in a fashion peculiar to the moors  it was also too sweet  there was present a younger sister of the bride who had not only a tendency but had already attained in an unusual degree to the possession of embonpoint and was appropriately named fatma  she wore the salma a dazzling little golden cap in token of being still unmarried  she seemed much captivated with little agnes  no wonder for in the simplicity of a pure white dress and with her fair curls streaming down her cheeks unadorned save by one little blush rose she looked like an ethereal spirit dropped into the midst of the garish party  fatma got up suddenly and whispered to her mother  my little girl said the moorish lady through the interpreter thinks your daughter would look so pretty in our costume  i have no doubt she would replied mrs langley glancing with some pride at agnes  she asks if you will allow her to be dressed just now in the moorish fashion  if there is sufficient time said mrs langley with an amused smile  oh plenty of time cried fatma who immediately seized the not unwilling agnes by the hand and ran off with her  opposite to zara sat her sister hanyfa who looked pretty and innocent enough just then though mrs langley was struck by her look of superior intelligence and a certain sharpness of glance which might almost have been styled suspicious  the consuls lady was about to address her but was interrupted by the entrance of several dancingwomen who immediately claimed the undivided attention of the company  one of these carried a sort of guitar another an earthenware drum covered at one end with parchment and a third a large tambourine while a fourth prepared to dance  of the dancing we need say little  it was unworthy of the name  there was little motion of the feet and a good deal of waving of a kerchief held in each hand  the music was still less worthy of note its chief feature being noise  nevertheless the moorish ladies knowing no better enjoyed it extremely and mrs langley enjoyed it sympathetically  these women were professionals the ladies themselves taking no part in the dancing  after this the bride ascended by steps to one of the shelves or stone recesses which formed convenient sofas or couches round the walls of the apartment and there seated on cushions submitted to be arrayed in bridal apparel  none but a ladys pen could do full justice to her stupendous toilet  we shall therefore do no more than state that the ludicrously high headdress in particular was a thing of unimaginable splendour and that her ornaments generally were so heavy as to render her incapable of walking without support  while this was going on in the chamber of state a very different but not less remarkable transformation was being wrought in fatmas own private apartment where she and several of her algerine companions assisted by a coalblack slavegirl named zooloo converted innocent little agnes into a moor  of course conversation with the heroine of the hour was impossible but this mattered little to agnes for she could converse quite powerfully with her eyes and her young friends chattered more than enough among themselves  standing over her with a formidable pair of scissors and grasping her front hair with her left hand the coalblack zooloo said  stand still you white thing till i perform my duty  of course she said it only by her looks and agnes quite understood her  next moment a whole cluster of golden ringlets fell to the ground  for one moment agness eyes and mouth resembled three round os  she felt that something telling had been done and thoughts of her mother flashed into her mind but fatmas pretty little round face with no eyes to speak of owing to laughter caused her to smile and then to laugh heartily  having brushed the front hair over her forehead and cut it straight across the energetic zooloo next painted her eyebrows black with a substance called kohl causing them to meet over her nose in the most approved form of algerine elegance  then she dyed her nails and the palms of her hands darkred with another substance named henna  the first of these takes about a week to remove and the last can be got rid of only by the growth of the nail  agnes was not aware of this else she might have objected  they finished up the adornment of the face by sticking it all over with gold spangles  now you look lovely said zooloowith her eyesstepping back and surveying her as a painter might his chefdoeuvre  do i  how nice replied agnes  then the whole party broke into a chorus of laughter and running to a wardrobe tumbled out a mass of richly embroidered garmentsin silk satin muslin damask fine linen and gold that would have stocked at least half a dozen european families with charading material for life  from this heap were selected and put on a lovely pair of fair linen drawers of that baggy kind peculiar to algerine ladies also an exquisite little caftan or sleeveless jacket of scarlet cloth so covered with gold lace that scarcely any of the scarlet was visible likewise a perfect gem of a cap of gold not bigger than agness own hand which fatma put on in a coquettish style very much to one side of the head saying with her eyes as she did so and laughing heartily the while  youre not married yet of course  to which agnes replied also with her eyes innocently  no not yet but i hope to be soon  whereupon the whole party laughed immoderately and said each one with her eyes  there cant be the smallest doubt whatever upon that point  at this point they were interrupted by the entrance of hanyfa but that lady far from damping their ardour took particular pleasure in assisting  by her advice they cut off a good deal more of the flaxen hair and deepened the dye on the eyebrows nails and palms gradually however hanyfa drew the negress zooloo from the scene of action and entered into a very earnest conversation in whispers quite unheeded by the riotous youngsters  there seemed to be a pretty good understanding between these unusually intelligent females if one might judge from the nods and winks and knowing smiles which passed between them but their confabulation was cut short by the completion of the toilet  many other things of rare value and beauty which we cannot afford space to mention were put upon agnes and then she was led by the hand into the presence of her mamma  to say that mrs langley was dumbfounded is but a feeble way of expressing the state of her mind  although a lady of great moral courage and accustomed from infancy to selfcontrol she felt on first beholding her timid little daughter strongly disposed to seize fatma by the hair of the head and use her as a bludgeon wherewith to fell her algerine mother but remembering the dignity of her position as in some sort a reflected representative of the british empire in these parts and also recalling to mind the aptitude of algerine gentlemen to tie up in sacks and drown obstreperous algerine ladies she restrained herself bit her lips and said nothing  fortunately at that moment it became necessary to conduct the bride to her future lords apartment which for the time was in another part of the same mansion  to the cry of lai lai lella which was meant to express great joy and was always raised at moorish weddings the guests conducted poor zara to her fate  that evening hanyfa sat at the feet of her lord sidi hamet and watched the curls of smoke which arising from the bowl of his magnificent hookah rolled like cannonwreaths from beneath his frowning and no less magnificent moustache  zooloo is a smart girl said hamet referring to something that had just been said  she is assented hanyfa  you are sure she cannot have misunderstood asked hamet  quite sure  dressed as a boy she lay close to their feet at the time in an angle of the wall near the djama djedid and overheard every word distinctly  good said the aga of cavalry venting a sigh of relief which propelled a miniature gunshot halfway across the room that enables me to decide the course which i shall pursue and gives us a little breathingtime before entering on the final act of the play    chapter ten  shows what lessons were taught in the bagnio and describes a brave dash for freedom  bacri the chief of the jews proved as good as his word  by means of a golden lever he moved some one who moved some one else who moved the dey to make certain inquiries about the slaves in the bagnio which resulted in his making the discovery that lucien rimini was a firstrate linguist and an excellent scribe  immediately he was commanded to fill the office of scrivano to the dey that post being vacant in consequence of the previous secretary having given his master some offence for which he had had his head cut off  but luciens elevation did not necessarily improve the condition of his father and brother  the dey cared only for those slaves who made themselves useful to him their relations he utterly ignored unless they succeeded in gaining his regard  the sicilians had too much commonsense to expect any great immediate advantage from the change nevertheless the slight hope which had been aroused by this event enabled the two who were left in the bagnio to endure their lot with greater fortitude and resignation  as for lucien he resolved to win the deys esteem in order to be able to influence him in favour of his father and brother  we must learn to submit my son said francisco one evening while he and mariano were finishing the last crumbs of the black bread which constituted their morning and evening meals  i admit it father said mariano with a longdrawn sigh  bacri was right but its not easy to bear  for myself i think i could stand their insults and their lash better if they would only spare you but when i see the villains strike you as they did todayoh father mariano flushed and clenched his handsit makes me so wild that i feel as though the blood would burst my veins  you cannot wonder that i find it impossible to submit  god bless you boy said francisco laying his hand on the youths shoulder i understand your feelingsnevertheless it were well that you learned to restrain them for rebellion only works evil  you saw what was the consequence of your attacking the man who struck me todayyou got knocked down and bastinadoed and i  francisco paused  yes go on father i know what you mean  well i would not hurt your feelings by mentioning itas you say you know what i mean  you mean said mariano that in consequence of my violence they gave you an additional flogging  true father true and that is the one thing that will now enable me to suffer in silence  at this point in the conversation they were interrupted by a deep groan from a young man in the cell opposite which was prolonged into an appalling cry  most of the slaves in the foul den had finished their meagre meal and lain down on the hard floors to seek in heavy slumber the repose which was essential to fit them for the toils of the coming day  some of them awoke and raised themselves on their elbows but sank back again on seeing that nothing particular had occurred  a few who had been rendered callous by their sufferings did not take the trouble to move but francisco and mariano rose and hastened to the man supposing him to have fallen into a fit  mariano moved with difficulty owing to the chains upwards of sixty pounds weight which he wore as a punishment for his recent violence  gogo back to your rest said the man who lay with clenched teeth and hands as francisco kneeled beside him there is nothing the matter with me  nay friend you are mistaken said francisco taking his hand kindly your look and that perspiration on your brow tell me that something is the matter with you  let me call our jailer and  call our jailer exclaimed the young man with a fierce laugh dyou think that hed take any notice of a sick slave  no when we get sick we are driven out to work till we get well  if we dont get well we are left to die  surely surely not said francisco  surely not repeated the young man  look look there  he pointed as he spoke to the old man who lay on his back at full length in the recess next to his own  see  he is a free man now  i knew he was to be released tonight  i have seen many and many a one set free thus since i came here  francisco was horrified on going to the place where the old man lay to find that he was dead  he had observed him tottering and looking very feeble at his work in the stonequarries that day but in his own misery had forgotten him since returning to the bagnio  too true he said returning to the young man his troubles are indeed ended but tell me what is it that ails thyself  tis memory said the young man raising himself on his elbow and gazing sadly into franciscos face  your conversation tonight for a moment aroused memories which i have long sought to stiflelad he said laying a hand impressively on marianos arm take the advice that bacri gave you  i was once as you are  i came hereyears agowith a father like thine but he was an older and a feebler man  like you i fought against our fate with the ferocity of a wild beast and they tortured me until my life hung by a thread for i could not endure to see the old man beaten  as you said just now you cannot wonder that i found it impossible to submit but they taught me to submit  oh they are clever devils in their cruelty  they saw that i cared not for my life but they also saw that i suffered through my father and at last when i became rebellious they beat him  that tamed me and taught me submission  the old one who lies there was a friend and comrade in sorrow of the dear father who was set free a year ago  i lay thinking of them both tonight and when i saw you two taking the first steps on the weary path which i have trod so longand have now methinks wellnigh finishedi could not restrain myself  but goget all the rest you can  we cannot afford to waste the hours in talk  only be sure lad that you take the jews advicesubmit  without replying the father and son crept back to their hard couch had they been in more comfortable circumstances their thoughts might have caused them to toss in feverish restlessness but sheer muscular exhaustion acting on healthy frames caused them to fall at once into a deep slumber from which they were rudely aroused next morning at four oclock to proceed to the marina where they were to be engaged that day on certain repairs connected with the bulwarks of the harbour  on the way down they were joined by an old man in a semiclerical costume whose gentle demeanour appeared to modify even the cruel nature of their savage guards for they ceased to crack their whips at his approach and treated him with marked respect  some of the slaves appeared to brighten into new creatures on beholding him and spoke to him in earnest tones addressing him as padre giovanni  the padre had a consoling word for all and appeared to be well acquainted with the various languages in which they spoke  approaching francisco and his son he walked beside them  thou hast arrived but recently methinks he said in a tone of commiseration and hast suffered much already  ay we have suffered somewhat replied francisco in an offhand tone not feeling much inclined to be communicative just then  in a few minutes however giovanni had ingratiated himself with the sicilians to such an extent that they had related all their sad history to him and already began to feel as if he were an old friend before they had traversed the halfmile that lay between their nightly prison and the harbour  arrived at their place of toilthe artificial neck connecting the little lighthouse island with the mainlandmariano was ordered to convey large masses of stone for the supply of a gang of slaves who were building a new face to the breakwater while his father was harnessed with another gang to the cart that conveyed the stones to their destination along a temporary tramway  the severity of the labour consisted chiefly in the intense heat under which it was performed and in the unremitting nature of it  it must not be imagined however that there was not a single touch of humanity in the breasts of the cruel slavedrivers  hard taskmasters though they undoubtedly were some of them were wont to turn aside and look another way when any of the poor slaves sat down for a few minutes overcome with exhaustion  there was little opportunity allowed however for intercourse among the unfortunates  one or two who judging from their faces showed sympathetic leanings towards each other were immediately observed and separated  this had the effect of hardening some while it drove others to despair  one of those whose spirit seemed to vacillate between despair and ferocity was the young man already referred to as being an inhabitant of franciscos part of the bagnio  he was a portuguese named castello in carrying the stones to and fro he and mariano had to pass each other regularly every three or four minutes  the latter observed after a time that castello glanced at him with peculiar intelligence  at first he was puzzled but on next passing him he determined to give him a similar look  he did so  next time that castello passed he said in a low tone without looking up and without in the least checking his pace  better to die than this  mariano was taken by surprise and at first made no reply for he recalled the mans advice of the previous night but on passing the portuguese again he said in the same low tone  yes much better  curious to know what was meant by thisfor the tones and glances of castello were emphaticmariano kept on the alert as he repassed his comrade expecting more  he was not disappointed though the nature of the communication tended to increase his surprise  fall and hurt yourself whispered castello and passed on  much perplexed mariano tried to conceive some reason for such a strange order but failed  he was however one of those rare spirits who have the capacity in certain circumstances to sink themselvesnot blindly but intelligentlyand place implicit confidence in others  hastily reviewing the pros and cons while laying his stone on the breakwater and feeling assured that no great harm could possibly come of compliance he gave a nod to his comrade in passing  i want to speak to you muttered castello briefly  at once the reason flashed on marianos mind  the delay consequent on the fall would afford opportunity for a few more sentences than it was possible to utter in passing  on returning therefore with a huge stone on his shoulder just as he passed his friend he fell with an admirable crash and lay stunned on the ground  castello instantly kneeled by his side and raised his head  ten of us he said quickly intend to make a dash for the babeloued gate on the way back tonight join us  its neck or nothing  i will if my father agrees said mariano still lying with closed eyesunconscious  if he does pull your hat on one side of your head as you a tremendous lash from a whip cut short the sentence and caused castello to spring up  rise you dog cried the turk who had bestowed it are christians so delicate that they need to be nursed for every fall  castello hurried back to his work without a word of reply and mariano opportunely recovering with a view to avoid a similar cut staggered on with his stone but the turk quickened his movements by a sharp flip on the shoulder which cut a hole in his shirt and left a bright mark on his skin  for one moment the gush of the old fierce spirit almost overcame the poor youth but sudden reflection and certain tender sensations about the soles of his feet came to his aid in time to prevent a catastrophe  when the slaves were collecting together that evening on the breakwater mariano managed to get alongside of his father who at first was very unwilling to run the risk proposed  its not that im afraid o my neck lad said the bluff merchant but i fear there is no chance for us and they might visit their wrath on poor lucien  no fear father i am convinced that the dey has already found out his value  besides if we escape we shall be able to raise funds to ransom him  francisco shook his head  and what said he are we to do when we get clear out of the babeloued gate supposing we are so far lucky  scatter and make for the head of frais vallon whispered castello as he passed  a boat waits at barbarossas tower  our signal is  here the portuguese gave a peculiar whistle which was too low to be heard by the guards who were busy marshalling the gang  youll agree father urged mariano entreatingly  the merchant replied by a stern yes as the gang was ordered to move on  mariano instantly gave his straw hat a tremendous pull to one side and walked along with a glow of enthusiasm in his countenance  one of the guards noting this stepped forward and walked beside him  so much the better thought mariano there will be no time lost when we grapple  traversing the passages of the mole the gang passed into the town and commenced to thread those narrow streets which to the present day spread in a labyrinth between the port and babeloued  as they passed through one of those streets which being less frequented than most of the others was unusually quiet a low hiss was heard  at the moment mariano chanced to be passing an open doorway which led by a flight of stairs into a dark cellar  without an instants hesitation he tripped up his guard and hurled him headlong into the cellar where to judge from the sounds he fell among crockery and tin pans  at the same moment francisco hit a guard beside him such a blow on the chest with his fist as laid him quite helpless on the ground  the other ten who had been selected and let into the intended plot by castello on account of their superior physical powers succeeded in knocking down the guards in their immediate neighbourhood and then all of them dashed with headlong speed along the winding street  there were one or two passengers and a few small shops in the street but the thing had been done so suddenly and with so little noise that the passengers and owners of the shops were not aware of what had occurred until they beheld the twelve captives rush past them like a torrenteach seizing as he passed a broomhandle or any piece of timber that might form a handy weapon  of course the other guards and such of the maltreated ones as retained consciousness shouted loudly but they did not dare to give chase lest the other slaves should take it into their heads to follow their comrades  poor creatures most of them were incapable of making such an effort and the few who might have joined had they known of the plot saw that it was too late and remained still  thus it happened that the fugitives reached the northern gate of the city before the alarm had been conveyed thither  the sun had just set and the warders were about to close the gates for the night when the desperadoes bursting suddenly round the corner of a neighbouring lane bounded in perfect silence through the archway  the sentinel on duty was for a few moments bereft of the power of action  recovering himself he discharged his musket and gave the alarm  the whole guard turned out at once and gave chase but the few moments lost by them had been well used by the fugitives besides despair terror and hope are powerful stimulators  after running a short time together up the steep ascent of the frais vallon or fresh valley they scattered according to arrangement and each man shifted for himselfwith the single exception of mariano who would not leave his father  seeing this the turks also scattered but in this condition they began to waverall the more that the short twilight of those regions was rapidly deepening into night  they reflected that the guarding of their gate was a prior duty to the hunting down of runaway slaves and one by one dropped off each supposing that the others would no doubt go on so that the officer of the guard soon found himself alone with only one of his men  having observed that two of the fugitives kept together these turks resolved to keep them in view  this was not difficult for they were both young and active while francisco was middleaged and rather heavy  stay a moment boy cried the bluff padrone as they tolled up the rather steep ascent of the valley  mariano stopped  come on father they are overhauling us  i know it boy said francisco taking mariano by the shoulders and kissing his forehead  go thou run  it is all over with me  god bless thee my son  father said the youth impressively grasping a mass of timber which he had wrenched from a shop front in passing if you love me keep moving on i will stop these two orfarewell  without waiting for a reply the youth rushed impetuously down the hill and was soon engaged in combat with the two turks  foolish boy muttered francisco hastening after him  mariano made short work of the soldier hitting him such a blow on the turban that he fell as if he had been struck by a sledgehammer unfortunately the blow also split up the piece of timber and broke it short off at his hands  he was therefore at the mercy of the young officer who seeing the approach of francisco rushed swiftly at his foe whirling a keen scimitar over his head  marianos great activity enabled him to avoid the first cut and he was about to make a desperate attempt to close when a large stone whizzed past his ear and hit his adversary full on the chest sending him over on his back  well aimed father exclaimed mariano as the two turned and continued the ascent of the valley  at its head frais vallon narrows into a rugged gorge and is finally lost in the summit of the hills lying to the northward of algiers  here the panting pair arrived in halfanhour and here they found that all their comrades had arrived before them  friends said castello who was tacitly regarded as the leader of the party we have got thus far in safety thank god  we must now make haste to pointe pescade  it lies about three or four miles along the shore  there a negro friend of mine has a boat in readiness  he told me of it only an hour before i spoke to you tonight  if we reach it and get off to sea we may escape if not we can but die  follow me  without waiting for a reply castello ran swiftly along a footpath that crossed over the hills and soon led his party down towards that wild and rocky part of the coast on which stand the ruins of a fort said to have been the stronghold of the famous pirate barbarossa in days of old    chapter eleven  is diplomatic and otherwise  just after the escape of the slaves as already narrated the british consul demanded a private audience of the dey  his request was granted and one morning early he set off on horseback to the city  arriving there too soon he put up his horse and threading his way through the streets of the old town soon found himself in front of the small and unpretending though massive portal of bacri the jew  he found the master of the house seated in the central court or skiffa drinking coffee with his wife and children  bacri said the colonel may i venture to interrupt your present agreeable occupation  i wish to have a talk with you in private  with pleasure replied the jew rising and ushering his visitor into a small apartment the peculiar arrangement and contents of which betokened it the wealthy merchants study or officeindeed it might have been styled either with equal propriety for bacri besides being an able man of business was learned in arabic literatureof which the town possessed and still possesses a valuable libraryand was a diligent student of the hebrew scriptures  you are aware said the colonel that i am at your request about to use my influence with the dey in behalf of certain friends of yours now there is an old sayingand i have great respect for many old sayingsthat one good turn deserves another  may i then ask you to do me a favour  certainly said the jew  name it  you must know then that the dey has been pleased to send me a pretty portuguese girl as a slave along with her infant child  i know it said bacri  you do  well this poor girl turns out to be a very sweet creature and my wife although somewhat annoyed at first by the unexpected gift and puzzled what to do with her is now so fond of her and finds her so gentle as well as useful that she has set her heart on having paulina ruffinithat is her namefreed and sent home  this however is not the point  paulina has a sister named  angela diego interrupted the jew  oh you know that too said the colonel with some surprise  you seem to know everything that goes on in this curious city  indeed it is a belief in this general knowledge of yours that brings me here well poor paulina is naturally in great anxiety about her sisters fate not having heard of her since the day they were cruelly separated by sidi hassan  the latter is now my janissary and tells me that he sold angela to a jew in the public market and does not know where she is  believing that you can find this out for me i have come hither this morning on my way to the palace  do you think you can  i think i can said the jew opening a door and beckoning to some one without  come hither angela  a gentleman wishes to see you  what is this paulinas sister said the consul in surprise as a pretty brighteyed girl obeyed the summons  speak fair one said the jew  dost know of one paulina ruffini and her infant angelina  we need scarcely add that angela admitted with a look of surprise that she did and was overwhelmed with joy on finding that her sister was a happy inmate of the consuls villa and that in a short time she would be permitted to see her  leaving the jews house well satisfied with his unlookedfor success in this matter the consul proceeded to the palace and was at once admitted into the audiencechamber  according to custom the dey was seated on a sort of throne with the huge lionpup serving as a footstool  we have said before that this lion had a decided antipathy to the british consul  not being able to speak it could not give the reason why  perhaps although unable to speak it might have been able to understand what was said and possibly had taken offence at the straightforward manner in which the consul had more than once remonstrated with the dey for allowing so old a pup to be at large  be this as it may certain it is that on the present occasion the lion raised its head when the consul was announced  on seeing his hated scarlet uniform it uttered a savage growl sprang up and ran out of the room by another door with its tail between its legs  in springing up the brute had forgotten its temporary character of footstool  the result was that the dey was tilted violently backwards and fell off his throne in a confused and most undignified heap  fortunately for the lionperchance also for the consulachmet possessed too much native dignity and commonsense to allow such an accident to ruffle his temper  he rose and resumed his seat with a hearty laugh as he said  you see monsieur le consul that even lions are afraid of the english uniform  your highness is pleased to be complimentary replied the consul with a bow and that emboldens me to observe that a dey should not retain the services of one who is capable of showing fear  perhaps you are right returned achmet with a smile especially one who has had the audacity to dethrone meand now what demand have you to make of me today  not i trust that old onethe liberation of slaves  no not exactly that replied the consul  nevertheless he added earnestly i do come to make an appeal in behalf of slaves  the deys countenance became grave  i refer continued the consul to those unfortunate slaves who recently attempted to escape and are now lying in chains condemned to be bastinadoed thrown on the hooks and otherwise tortured to death  how exclaimed the dey frowning darkly while a flush of anger covered his face can you plead for slaves who have not only rebelled and fled but who have disabled two of my janissaries and some of whomespecially their leader castello and the young sicilian mariano are so turbulent as to be an absolute nuisance to their guards  your highness is aware answered the consul respectfully that british ideas in regard to slavery and all connected with it are widely different from those entertained by algerines and i do not presume to pass an opinion on the sentences pronounced on men who are held guilty of having violated your laws  i merely plead that you will extend to them the royal prerogative of mercyespecially to two of their number francisco and mariano  on what ground do you ask mercy for these demanded achmet sternly  on the ground that courageous and worthy men although tempted to rebel in order to regain their liberty are not deserving of death that the portuguese girl your highness was so generous as to send me and who was captured along with them has interested me deeply in their history and also on the ground that one is the father and the other the brother of your scrivano lucien rimini  indeed exclaimed the dey in surprise lucien never told me that although his own hand made out the order for their execution  that answered the consul with a smile is because i advised him to leave the pleading of their cause to me  believing no doubt returned the dey with a laugh that your powers of persuasion are superior to his  well monsieur le consul you may be right nevertheless let me tell you that short though the time be in which lucien has been my scrivano there is that in his modest air and ready will as well as his talent which constitutes a sufficient plea to induce me to pardon his relations  it rejoices me said the consul to find that as i expected your highnesss  yes yes say no more on that head interrupted the dey  here lucien he added calling aloud to his secretary who clad in superb oriental costume appeared at the door which led into his office make out an order to cancel the sentence against your father and brother and let them be sent to the palace immediately  i will speak with thee again on the mattermeanwhile will monsieur le consul come and behold the present which i am preparing for my royal master the sublime porte  there was a touch of sarcasm in the tone in which he used the words royal master which the consul understood well enough for he was aware that although nominally subject to turkey algiers was to all intents and purposes an independent power and that the present referred to was almost all the benefit derived by the sultan from his piratical vassal  it was costly enough no doubt viewed simply in the light of a gift and afforded a subject of great interest to the consul when permitted to survey itan honour by the way which the dey would not have conferred on the consul of any of the other nations represented at the algerine court for the british consul at that time was as we have said a special favourite  it consisted of two magnificent milkwhite arab horses richly caparisoned their saddles and bridles being profusely ornamented with diamonds and other gems and their shoes being made of pure gold several boxes of rare and costly jewels six womenslaves with skins of the most beautiful ebony tint a number of blackmaned lions several parrots and a few monkeys  your highness is resolved to please the sultan by means of variety observed the consul with a smile after commenting on the gift in detail  that replied achmet would have little power to please if the jewels were not numerous and costly  but happily our treasury can afford it although we have not been very successful in war of late  he looked at the consul with a sly smile as he spoke but the latter deemed it wise to be lost in admiration of some of the jewels in question  after examining the present the consul retired and achmet went to his private apartments to enjoy a cup of coffee and a pipe  the room in which he sat was similar to that already described as being the receptionroom of the bridal party only the decorations were if possible more elaborate and sumptuous  here seated on rich cushions with not his most beautiful but his wisest wife beside him achmet once a petty officer of janissariesgave himself up to the enjoyment of the hour  christian slavesonce the happy butterflies of european and other landsattended on him filled his pipe brought him hot coffee and watched his every movement  they were richly dressed more richly and gaily perchance than they had ever been in the days of freedom when they had been wont to chat and laugh with careless hilarity  but they were mute enough now  a few of them had tasted the bastinado and been tamed most of them had been wise enough to tame themselves  if shakespeare had been a turk he would probably have written a very different version of the taming of the shrew  when coffee was finished the dey ordered the attendants to withdraw and then settling himself comfortably on the cushions and puffing two white streams of smoke slowly through his nose in order to gather the fullest enjoyment therefrom he thus addressed himself to his betterproportionwe had almost said half but forgot for the moment that there were several sultanas  ashweesha thou art a wise woman  i might almost style thee my guardian angel for not only hast thou often guided me on the right road but sometimes thou hast prevented me from straying into the wrong  ashweesha who was a sweet and passably goodlooking woman of about thirty raised her large dark eyes to the face of achmet with a look of gratitude but did not reply  indeed her husband did not seem to expect an answer for he continued to smoke for some time in silence with his eyes fixed abstractedly on a tame gazellethe kitten of the haremwhich tried to attract his attention  thou art sad or anxious tonight said ashweesha at length breaking silence  both sad and anxious replied the dey slowly  my position is indeed one of power but not of comfort or safety  a shade rested for a moment like a flitting cloud on the face of ashweesha  gladly would she have exchanged her high estate with all its costly and gorgeous array for a life of humble toil accompanied with peace and securityfor she was of gentle naturebut this was denied her  listen said the dey laying aside his pipe and talking earnestly it may well chance as it has happened before that thy counsel may lighten my care  i am sad because two of my chief officers are snakes in the grass  they are venomous too and their bite will prove deadly if it be not avoided  canst thou guess their names ashweesha  sidi omar and sidi hassan said ashweesha  achmet looked surprised  thou art partly right though i did not expect thy swift reply  is it a guess or hast thou obtained information  i have heard of it from one who is our friend  indeed  well thou art right as to omar and it is that which makes me sad  thou art right also in regard to sidi hassan but i care little for him  he is but a tool in the hands of one whose power is great hamet our aga of cavalry  omar i had hoped better things of but fear him not  the aga however is a dangerous foe and unscrupulous  i do not clearly see my way to guard against his wiles  my chief safeguard is that he and omar are bitter enemies  i know not what to do  the bowstring suggested ashweesha  the reader must not think this suggestion inconsistent with the character of one whom we have described as gentle and sweet  the sultana had been trained in a peculiar school and was as much accustomed to hear of disagreeable and troublesome people being strangled as europeans are to the drowning of inconvenient kittens  the dey laughed  alas my gentle one he said all powerful and despotic though i be there are a few officers around me whom i dare not get rid of in this wayat least not just now  but it amuses me to hear thee recommend such strong measures thou who art always on the side of mercy  truly said ashweesha with a flash in her dark eyes that proved the presence of other elements besides sweetness in her disposition my leanings are always towards mercy save when you have to deal with those who possess no mercy  if you do not apply the bowstring to hamet in good time rest assured that he will apply it to you  the dey became more serious at this yet still smiled as he gazed in the flushed countenance of his spouse and adviser  thou art right ashweesha said he in a meditative tone and it is for the purpose of finding out if possible when it is the right time to strike that i now take counsel with thee  what wouldst thou advise  sidi hassan you say has been sent to be the british consuls janissary  yes  for what purpose asked the sultana  partly to keep him out of the way of the mischief which is always brewing more or less in this warlike city partly to flatter his vanity by placing him in the service of one for whom he knows that i entertain great respect personally as well as on account of the powerful nation which he represents and partly to remind him gently of my power to order him on any service that i please and to cut off his insolent head if so disposed  that is so far well said ashweesha letting her delicate hennastained fingers play idly with the gorgeous pearls which fell like a lustrous fountain from her neck but it is possible that he may reflect on the propriety of trying to secure at no distant date a master who will reward him more liberally without conveying covert threats  but much good she hastened to add observing that her lord did not much relish her last remark much good may result from his being placed under the british consuls roof for the consuls wife is a wise woman and may help us to discover some of his plots for plotting he is certain to be whether in the city or out of it and you may be sure that a clever woman like madame langley will have her eyes open to all that goes on in her own palace  nay then ashweesha returned the dey laughing thou hast studied the lady to small profit if thou dost believe her capable of acting the part of a spy on her own domestics  and thou hast studied thy wife to small profit retorted ashweesha playfully if you think i could make such a mistake as to ask her to become a spy  does not all the city know that madame langley has over and over again refused the most costly bribes offered to induce her to use her influence with her husband and is it not also wellknown that if her influence is to be gained at all it must be by touching her heart  she is so open too in her conduct that her domestics know all she does  did i not tell you the other night how the chief from marocco offered her a splendid diamond ring to induce her to intreat her husbands favour in somethingi know not whatand how she flushed with indignation as she refused it and told the chief that all the diamonds in the world could not move her to attempt the leading of her husband from the path of duty  no i will not ask her to become a spy but i will lead her in conversation to tell me all she knows or at least is willing to communicate about sidi hassan and perchance some good may come of it  it may be so said the dey and where and when dost thou propose to meet with her  here and tomorrow  how in the palace  yes  ask her and her little girl to come and dine with me said ashweesha  that would be a high compliment returned the dey dubiously such as has never been paid before methinks by a dey of algiers to any consuls wife  no matter returned the sultana you have a high regard for colonel langley and have often paid him unusual complimentswhy not compliment his wife  well it shall be done  tomorrow afternoon prepare to receive her    chapter twelve  mrs langley and agnes go out to dinner  an agreeable surprise is something like sunshine in november it warms up the constitution mentally and physically  such a surprise did mrs langley receive the morning that followed the evening on which achmet dey and his sultana held their private conversation on the affairs of state  agnes she exclaimed reading a note with elevated eyebrows just fancy here is an invitation for you and me to dine with the deys wife or wives  oh wont that be delightful cried agnes coming from the court into the room where her mother sat with such a bound that she filled with sympathetic excitement the heart of the small negro girl from beyond the zahara and caused her to rock the cradle too violently  there youve bumped it again i knew you would said mrs langley in tones of despair  poor zubbys first awful glance of mingled deprecation and selfreproach was so touching that no one but a hardened monster could have withstood it but the look with the feelings which it implied was shortlived it passed like a summer cloud and was replaced by an expression of supreme contentment and selfsatisfaction when it became apparent that master jim was not going to awake and that mrs langleys despair was vanishing  indeed that ladys despair was at all times remarkably shortlived  she had been trained in a school of dire adversity ever since the arrival of the coalblack one from beyond the zahara and had learned to hope against hope in an extraordinary degree in a case which was absolutely hopeless for whatever others might think or hope zubby knew herself to be incurable  not that she was unwilling on the contrary there never was a more obliging or amiable creature among the sable daughters of ham but she had a tendency to forget herself as well as her charge in moments of sudden emotion or delight and gave way to burstlets of action which if slight were always inopportune and sometimes though not often disastrous  we must get ready immediately continued mrs langley with a cautioning shake of the head at zubby as she turned to agnes because you know we may as well take the opportunity to do a little shopping before dinner  what shopping in the pirate city we hear you exclaim reader  yes there was shopping there in those days though it did not bear much resemblance to shopping in more civilised lands  there were no wide fronts or plateglass windows in those days  indeed then as now a shop in the moorish town might be fitly described as a hole in the wall  it was as it were a deep window without an interior to speak of  a square hole six feet by six and from four to ten feet deep without glazing or protection of any kind from the weather except in some cases an awning was a fair average shop one of eight feet frontage was rather a grand shop and one of twelve feet was quite a bazaar  of course such shops were stuffed like eggs to an excess of fulness they gave one the impression that the goods had been packed into smaller space than was possible and that the introduction of another pin would infallibly explode the whole affair  a passage among the goods in each shop just big enough to admit an ordinary man was the scene of action in which the owner disported  this passage did not begin at the street so much valuable space could not be afforded  a counter laden with small wares had to be leapt in order to gain it and a rope depending from the ceiling rendered possible the acrobatic feat which was necessary to do so  purchasers had to stand in the streets and transact business the said streets being so narrow that there was no room for lobbies or paved footpaths  while engaged in traffic buyers were compelled more or less to block the way and had their garments scraped successively by turks and moors and veiled mohammedan females by cabyles from the mountains negroes from timbuctoo white slaves from almost every country in europe and donkeys of the most debased and abject typethese latter by the way being quite as capable as the humanthough not humanebeings who drove them of going up and down stairs  no slope short of a perpendicular dead wall appeared to be able to stop them and no wonder poor wretches for no torture short of total destruction was spared them  ah ye members of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals in algiers forgive us if we interject here the observation that there is earnest need for your activities at the present day  followed by the faithful though uncontrollable zubby with a huge triangular grass basket mrs langley entered the tortuous streets of the city and proceeded to shop  fear not reader  it is not our purpose to drag you through the details of the too wellknown process  we pass onward to matters more important  having traversed several streets in which moors sat crosslegged embroidering purses and slippers with gold in holes in the wall so small that a goodsized bust might have objected to occupy them where cobblers in similar niches made and repaired roundtoed shoes of morocco leather and the makers of horn rings for fingers wrists arms and ankles wrought as deftly with their toes as with their fingers where working silversmiths plied their trade in precious metals and gems in a freeandeasy openair fashion that would have made the mouth of a london thief water and where idle arabs sipped coffee and smoked the livelong day as though coffee and tobacco were the aim and end of lifewhich latter they proved indeed to many of themmrs langley with agnes followed by zubby paused before a niche in which were displayed for sale a variety of curious old trinkets of a nondescript and utterly useless character  in short it appeared to be an algerine curiosityshop  here while bargaining with the owner for some small articles she was surprised to hear a voice at her ear say in french  madame good morning i have great pleasure in this unexpected meeting  she turned hastily and found the danish consul standing by her side  ah monsieur she said returning his salutation it is indeed seldom that i wander alone through this labyrinth but necessity compels me an english friend wishes me to send her a few characteristic articles and i can trust no one to choose them for me  but you look anxious  yes excuse me replied the danish consul in haste glancing round i am followed persecuted i may say  i had intended to call for your husband today to beg him to use his influence with the dey in my behalf but i cannotcircumstancesin short will you kindly mention to him that i am in trouble because of the nonpayment of the tribute due by our government and  breaking off suddenly the danish consul bowed low and hurried away mrs langley observed that immediately after a chaouse or executioner of the palace passed her  this incident induced her to conclude her shopping rather quickly and furnished her with food for thought which entirely engrossed her mind until agnes exclaimed  oh mamma look look theyre going to shave a little boy  mrs langley directed by agness finger looked and found that this was indeed true  a little boy between eight and nine years of age was seated in a barbers shop near them with a towel about his neck glancing timidly yet confidently in the face of an elderly man who advanced towards him with an open razor as though about to cut his throat  as it turned out however neither throat nor chin were in danger of violation  it was the head that the barber attacked and this he scraped quite bare without the aid of soap leaving only a tuft of hair on the top  this tuft we have been informed is meant as a handle by means of which the owner may after death be dragged up into heaven but we rather incline to the belief that it is left for the purpose of keeping the red fez or skullcap on the head  be this as it may no sooner did the urchin behold mrs langley than casting aside the towel and ignoring the barber he rushed out and exclaimedin a compound of french arabic and lingua franca of which we give a free translation  oh missus me massr console dansh vants see ver moch your hosbund  thank you i know it replied mrs langley giving the boy a small coin and a bright smile  quite satisfied that he had fulfilled his duty the urchin returned to the barber and the lady proceeded to the palace  here she was received ceremoniously by the father of ashweesha sidi cadua a mild gentlespirited little old turk who would have made a very fine old english gentleman but who was about as well fitted to be fatherinlaw to an algerine dey and a man of position in the pirate city as he was to be prime minister to the man in the moon  sidi cadua conducted her to the seraglio where she was heartily welcomed by the ladies who expressed their delight at meeting her with girlish glee  ashweesha laughingly said that she was glad to see agnes had become a mohammedan on which mrs langley related what circumstances had caused the change and the sultana listened to the recital with tears of laughter running down her cheeks  the english lady had naturally expected something gorgeous in the palace but she was not prepared for the lavish display of wealth that met her eyes everywhere  she found the sultana and her six beautiful children in a room which though not imposing in size glittered with decoration  the ceiling and walls were rich with tessellated and arabesque work  the floor was covered with a carpet of cut velvet with a pattern of the richest and most brightlycoloured flowers and this carpet was strewn with costly jewels which shone in the variegated light of the stainedglass windows above like glowing fireflies  around the walls were several recesses or niches arched in the moorish horseshoe style  in one of these was a glass cabinet on the shelves of which were some splendid articles of jewellery  in another recess hung a variety of swords and pistols chiefly of eastern manufacture their handles and scabbards blazing with diamonds  opposite to these stood a gilt fourpost european bedstead with four mattresses of gold brocade and curtains of blue tiffany embroidered with gold sprigs  in fact the apartment and its occupants were adorned with so much magnificence that the genie of aladdins famous lamp would not have improved it for although that remarkable personage might have brought unlimited treasure to its decoration he would not have found a spare inch anywhere on which to bestow it  the sultana and her children were alone with the exception of halfadozen beautiful georgian slaves and one or two negresses who attended on them  of course no gentlemen were present  my husband is very fond of yours said ashweesha with a pleasant smile leading her guests to a large cushion on the floor and squatting them down beside her  it gratifies me much to hear you say so replied mrs langley  they spoke in a jargon of languages and made up their deficiencies by signs of which we dare not attempt a characteristic translation  he sent you a new slavegirl lately i believe said the sultana beginning to feel her way  yes exclaimed the guest with animation it was very kind of him and i find her so sweet and amiable and useful too  she assists me with my dear baby so admirably as well as with the household that i begin already to feel as if i could not get on without her  do you know i have set my heart on raising sufficient money to ransom her and set her free  then you will only lose her for she will certainly go home to her husband observed ashweesha with a look of simplicity  of course i count on that returned mrs langley  you know that we christians differ from mohammedans widely on the point of slavery and i am sure she added playfully you will not think me rude when i say that i mean to take advantage of your laws and procure the ransom of as many slaves as possible during my residence here  if you had the wealth of a king said ashweesha with a smile you could not ransom the half of them they are so numerous  i am too well aware of that rejoined the other sadly nevertheless that does not exempt me from my duty  in the laws of my heavenly king and saviour jesus christ it is writtenwhatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might  the sultana bent a keen look of interest on her guest and was about to reply but seemed to change her mind and said  it was sidi hassan i am told who brought in this slavegirl and by the way i hear that he has become your janissary  do you like him  i have seen so little of him that i can hardly tellyou have walked with him in the garden agnes several times what do you think of him  i dont like him at all answered agnes with powerful emphasis  both ladies laughed and so did the six little daughters of the sultana who had maintained a dignified silence while their elders were conversing  my little girl is rather given to take hasty prejudices said mrs langley apologetically  does your husband find him useful continued the sultana returning to the charge  no doubt he does but i really cannot say for my husband has only mentioned him casually and i never venture to speak of his business affairs unless called on to do so  the fact that sidi hassan has been much oftener in town than at our residence since he was sent to us may account for my slight knowledge about him  oh he has been very often in town has he exclaimed ashweesha  before mrs langley could reply an attendant announced that dinner was served in the adjoining room whereupon the georgian slaves were ordered to pick up the jewels that strewed the carpet  this they did and having locked them in the glass cabinet before mentioned followed the party into the diningroom  it was a somewhat peculiar dinner in many respects  there was great variety  meat poultry pastry and sweatmeats of strange kinds and forms succeeded each other and were done full justice to by all present  it was like a glimpse of paradise to little agnes for having been brought up in the simplest of styles and forbidden pastry and sweatmeats altogether since the day of her birth she absolutely revelled in new sensations  it must not be supposed that she violently broke through all restraints on this occasion but her mother saw that if old rules were enforced the child would be confused by the conflicting entreaties of her hostesses and the denials of her mother while the sultana might be offended  mrs langley therefore gave her carteblanche to eat what she pleased  the party all sat on embroidered cushions on the floor round a small low table made of silver and motherofpearl  on this each dish was placed separately and all ate out of the same dish after the moorish fashion  the spoons were made of rosewood tipped with amber and the napkins were richly embroidered in gold silver and variously coloured silk on a curiouslywrought linen ground  all the vessels used were of the most elaborate and costly description and we need scarcely add that the viands were good  among other things there was fish which was served and eaten with honey but the chief among the dishes was kooskoos  this was the piece de resistance of the moorish dinnertable the substance on which the ladies chiefly fed and flourished  to be fat was in those days the most desirable attribute of a wife in the eyes of an algerine husband therefore kooskoos was eaten in quantity  it was made largely of flour rolled in some mystical manner into the form of little pellets like small sago this boiled with butter and other fatty substances with bits of meat and chicken and other viands mixed through itthe whole being slightly seasoned and spicedwas deemed food fit for a sultana  during the meal they became very chatty and the young people paid much attention to agnes who being a sensitively good girl felt every time that she experienced a new taste as though she were breaking all the ten commandments notwithstanding the permission of her mother  several times ashweesha turned the conversation on the home affairs of her guests and attempted to gain further information about sidi hassans doings but found much to her annoyance that mrs langley knew little more than she had already communicated  her goodhumour was however restored by that ladys unaffected admiration of the numerous lovely things by which she was surrounded  she specially praised the splendid napkins and the spoons before referred to and when they rose from table the sultana presented her and agnes with those that they had used  after giving them coffee and making another vain attempt to extract information ashweesha dismissed her guests who returned home charmed with the novelty of their reception and entertainment    chapter thirteen  relates something about improvements surprises and changes in the state of affairs  in consequence of the opportune interference of the british consul and of the goodwill which lucien had inspired in the breast of the dey a ray of light stole into the gloomy bagnio and tended to cheer at least two of the slaves  this ray was conveyed by means of the padre giovanni whom we have elsewhere mentioned as being the friend and benefactor of the slaves  previous to his visit a cloud had overshadowed the prison  several chaouses had entered and after loading castello and the other runaways with chains had led them forth to death  it would be painful as well as unnecessary to detail the terrible tortures under which these wretched men perished  the remaining slaves knew well the nature of the fate that awaited them and the blank caused by the disappearance for ever of their wellknown faces was fitted to restrain all thoughts of rebellion had such existed  some surprise was felt at first by all the slaves at the delay of punishment in the case of francisco and mariano but after the first hour or two had passed they ceased to give the matter a thought  when therefore the old man giovanni entered the bagnio and informed these two that the dey had reprieved them and commanded their attendance at the palace their surprise was reawakened and speculation as to the cause of such unusual proceedings was revived  i am the bearer of still further tidings said the old man taking a letter from a sort of wallet that hung from his shoulder and handing it to francisco  from juliet exclaimed francisco tearing it open and reading aloud eagerly    dearest fatherit is not possible to express to you the agony that   we endured on hearing that you had been taken captive by the   algerines  oh why are such monsters allowed to live  why   indeed interjected francisco bitterly  but take comfort  god   watches over us all  some of your old friends here have begun to   collect money for your ransom and i work hard to increase the sum   but oh how slowly it grows  even darling grandmamma has got some   light sewing work which brings in a little  but our hearts mourn   because of you  we earnestly hope that the pirates treat you well   thank god they do not know anything about that muttered   francisco and we feel almost sure that they do because we have been   told that they are careful of the slaves who they hope will be   ransomed  i have therefore written to the deyhow i hated him while   i wrote the humble lettertelling him that we hoped to raise the sum   in a short time  every one here is very kind and sympathises with us   besides giving a contribution to the fund    this letter goes by a french vessel which is to touch at algiers   and which conveys a priest who has a large sum of money with him to   ransom sicilian and other slaves  i entreated him to ransom you with   part of it but he smiled pitifully and said the money had been   raised by the friends of particular slaves some of whom had been many   years in captivity and that it could not be diverted from its proper   objects  how my heart sank when he spoke of some being in slavery for   many years  but it was cheered again when i reflected how hard we are   all working to raise the money for you and lucien and mariano  we   send you all our dear loveyour affectionate daughter  shall i have an opportunity of answering this asked francisco eagerly  yes i am about to conduct you to the palace where your son lucien who i may mention is a favouriteawaits you  you mustnt let them know the truth father said mariano earnestly  would you have him tell them what is false asked the padre gravely  no no replied the youth with a laugh but there is no occasion to mention all that we have suffered you know and there is a good deali mean a littlethat is agreeable to communicate  for instance this very summons to the palace and luciens good luck  trust me lad said francisco i wont fail to cheer them if i can and you may be sure i wont exaggerate our misfortunesbut lead on old man i am anxious to get out of this foul den as quickly as  forgive me comrades he added checking himself and turning to the slaves near him i am grieved more than i can tell to leave you behind if by remaining i could lighten your sorrows i would gladly do so  it may seem presumptuous in one who is himself a slave to say so yet i cant help assuring you that if the almighty is pleased to give me any power in this city i wont forget you  this speech was received with a kindly nod by some and a laugh of scorn by others  probably the latter had heard similar sentiments before from somewhat kindred and hearty spirits and had learned from sad experience that nothing ever came of their goodwill  following the old man the father and son were soon in the presence of lucien who received them as may well be believed with a full heart  god bless you my son said francisco for well assured am i that it is through your influence that we are here  it is through the influence of the british consul replied lucien  well i pray for a blessing on you both for it is useless to tell me that you have had no hand in it  i do not say that i had no hand in it  on the contrary i wrote out the order for your acquittal and added lucien with a peculiar smile i also had previously written out your and marianos deathwarrant  you are jesting lad said francisco  indeed i am not returned lucien relating the circumstances of the whole matter to his astonished and somewhat horrified auditors  and now he continued i must let you know your destination  dont be disappointed  you must remember that we are slaves and have just been delivered from the bagnio  the dey seems to have taken a fancy for me  i dont wonder interrupted mariano enthusiastically seizing and squeezing his brothers hand  and continued lucien he has permitted me to select situations for you  i have arranged that you father shall be my assistant in the secretarys office and that you mariano shall be shopman to bacri the jew  lucien looked awkwardly at his father and brother as he spoke feeling uncertain no doubt as to the manner in which they would receive this information  he was therefore rather relieved than otherwise by a smile on the face of mariano  why lucien he said i always thought you a great original and this last display of your powers confirms me in my opinion  not that i deem it strange your having appointed father your clerkfor in the circumstances it would have been charity to have appointed him even to the office of shoeblackanything being better than the bagniobut what wild fancy induced you to make me shopboy to a jew  that replied lucien you shall find out in good timeonly pray remember that i am not the deys grand vizier and have not many places to offer  well well be it so returned the other i am well content with what your wisdom provides  and so am i said francisco cheerfully  i suppose you will feed us better than we have been fed of late  that will i father but there is no pay attached to your offices for slaves you know get no wages  they get splendid habiliments it would seem observed francisco regarding his son with twinkling eyes  but come lucien i am all impatience to begin the work of undersecretary of state  you bear in remembrance i trust that i can read and write nothing save my mother tongue  yes italian will suffice father such of the duties as you fail to perform i can easily fulfilnow mariano he said taking his brother aside and speaking in a low earnest tone see that you act wisely in the situation i have selected for you  the jew is a kind good man despite what is said about his worship of mammon  i would that all in this city were like him for in that case we should have no slavery during the short period i have held my office my eyes have been opened to much that i may not mention  there the very walls of this palace have ears  i have said enough  you remember angela  remember her exclaimed mariano with a deep flush and a look of intense surprise how can you ask me lucien  well you will hear of her from bacri  good byego  he rang a bell as he spoke and ordered the slave who answered the summons to lead mariano to the abode of bacri at the same time he took his fathers hand and conducted him to his office or bureau  amazed at all that had happened particularly at his summary dismissal by his brother the youth followed his conductor in silence and in a short time reached the ironbolted door of the chief of the jews  this is bacris house said his guide in italian and having discharged this duty he turned on his heel and abruptly left him  pausing a moment to think and finding that the more he thought the less he seemed to be capable of thinking to any purpose mariano applied his knuckles to the door  for a youth of his character it was a timid knock and produced no result  mariano was one whoin peculiar circumstances like those in which at that time he found himselfmight once in a way act with timidity but he was not the man to act so twice  finding that the first knock was useless he hit the door a blow that caused the old house to resound in a few seconds it was opened slightly and the face of a beautiful girl in jewish costume appeared  if mariano had been suddenly petrified he could not have stood more rigidly motionless amazement sat enthroned on his countenance  angela  signor mariano  the words in each case were followed by a deep flush and angela retreated  of course mariano advanced  excuseforgive me signorina he exclaimed taking her hand respectfully  i did not knowof course i could nothow was it possible thatthe fact is i came to see a jew andand  ive found a jewel he might have said but that didnt seem to occur to him  bacrithats his name continued mariano  is bacri within  i came to see him but  yessignor bacri is at home said angela much confused by the youths confusion as well as by the sudden and unexpected nature of the meeting  but your fatherand brother lucienoh i hope they are well that they have not been treated cruelly that they are not in that dreadful bagnio of which i have heard so much said angela at last finding the use of her tongue  they were interrupted at this point by the appearance of bacri himself who welcomed the youth to his house said that he had been told by lucien to expect him and introduced him to his wife and the other members of his family  thereafter the jew took his new shopman into his private apartment and made many strange revelations to him in regard to the affairs of the piratical city as well as about the details of his new appointment in regard to which we shall say nothing here but it may be well to add that mariano finally retired for the night well satisfied with the wisdom of his elder brother  for some time after this things went well with those actors in our tale in whose welfare we are chiefly interested  francisco proved himself to be an able clerkwhen assisted by his superiorand mariano became a most willing and useful shopmanwith the prospect before him of returning each night to bask in the sunshine of angelas countenance  at the consuls residence paulina was as happy as was possible in her sad circumstances for she became very fond of mrs langley and was a perfect treasure in the housenot only taking a large part of the management thereof but keeping watchful guard over the dangerous zubby so that that zaharan specimen of humanity inflicted a perceptibly smaller percentage of bumps on the head of master jim than in former times  paulinas baby too began to indicate signs of intelligence by crowing knocking over whatever it came within reach of and endeavouring to dig the eyes out of every one who permitted familiarities especially the eyes of master jim who it is but fair to add soon displayed superior capacity in the same line so that the parents agreed mutually that they would soon be sweet playmates to each other and that they were the most delicious babes that ever were or could be born  ted flaggan also remained a happy inmate of the consuls abode awaiting the arrival of a british vessel which might enable him to depart but not at all anxious for that consummation and in the meantime making himself generally useful  down at the marina too the state of things was a little though not much improved  another guardian of the slaves had been appointedthe former one having been strangled on account of some wickedness reported by enemies to have been done by him and of which he was afterwards found to be entirely innocent  his successor was a man of better nature who although he kept the slaves hard at their toil and did not abate the lash or bastinado nevertheless supplied them with occasional comforts such as an extra roll of bread when extra work had to be done or even a glass of spirits when as was often the case they were called up at nights in drenching rain and cold to protect the shipping in the harbour and prevent wreck when sudden gales arose  thus the aspect of things in the pirate city bad though it was became a little brighter and continued so for some time until an event occurred which flung a darker cloud than usual over the ever changing scene    chapter fourteen  the plot thickens and marianos forbearance and courage are tested  when the commanderinchief of cavalry condescended to pay a visit to a jew it was a sign that events of considerable importance were hovering in the air  the approach therefore of sidi hamet to the residence of bacri one night under cover of the darkness was regarded by the jew with feelings of misgiving which caused his face to become suddenly very grave as he looked through the little ironbound hole or window which commanded a view of his court  the aga carried no light although the laws ordained that all who moved about after nightfall should do so but bacri knew him as well by his outline and gait as if he had seen his face in the sunshine  descending the stair at once the jew opened the door and let him in  thou art surprised bacri said hamet swaggering into the skiffa where angela chanced to be at work at the timeha thou hast a pretty daughter he added with a gaze of insolent admiration  the girl is passing fair replied the jew opening the door of his study and purposely avoiding the correction of the agas mistake please to enter here  hamet obeyed remarking as he passed that the girl were worthy of being the wife of a dey if she had not been a jewess  bacri he said sitting down while the master of the house stood respectfully before him thou knowest the object of my visiteh come it is not the first time thou hast had to do with such as i  the plot thickens bacri and thou must play thy part willing or not willing  say how much is it to be  how much do you demand asked the jew  the aga rose and whispered in his ear  impossible said bacri shaking his head decidedly  how dog impossible exclaimed the turk sternly  dost know that i can let the whole turkish army loose on thee and thy falsehearted race  my race is maligned alike by mohammedan and christian returned the jew with dignity  you know full well sidi hamet that the sum you have named would ruin all the jews in the town  if the security of my people is not to be purchased for a smaller sum we must perish  my utmost efforts would not avail to raise more than the half thereof within the specified time  you may indeed ruin us if you will but it were wise to remember that if you kill the goose that lays the golden eggs there will be no more golden eggs to lay  true o bacri returned hamet laughing thou art wise and i shall act on thy wisdomhaving first however acted on mine own when i demanded double the sum i expected to receive knowing thine inveterate tendency to drive a hard bargain  now goodnight he said rising and leaving the roomha thy pretty daughter has fled  well we shall hope to see her again  mean while have a care our plot is in your hands but thine every movement shall be watched from this hour and if a note of warning escapes thee thou art but a dead man  saying this the aga departed and bacri returning to the skiffa summoned mariano who had been engaged in another part of the house when hamet entered  come hither lad said the jew while a careworn expression seemed to settle on his handsome features i have work for you to do which requires courage and speed  hamet the agai may say the blackhearted agahas been here on an errand which i have been looking forward to for some months  you may be aware perhaps that in this barbarous city there is no hereditary succession of deys  each dey is elected by the turkish janissaries from among the men of their own ranks one result of which is that various factions are kept up in the army and the most vigorous man among them the one who can command the greatest number of admirers and followers generally wins the unenviable but muchcoveted post  when the reigning dey becomes unpopular the factions begin to ferment and instead of waiting for him to die they invariably strangle poison or behead him  the factions generally have some disturbance among themselves but in any case the consequence of a revolution of this kind is that complete anarchy prevails in the city and until a new dey is elected by the janissaries the moors and jews are at the mercy of the rude soldiery  of course all who have enemies among them hide themselves and their pelf if possible until the anarchy ceases which it does the moment the green standard of the prophet is hoisted on the terrace of the palace announcing that a new dey is seated on the warm throne of his not quite cold predecessor  i tell you all this continued the jew impressively that ye may understand what is about to happen and know how to act  it is a sharp ordeal to go through but a short one the scene of violence lasting usually but one day  still that affords ample time for irreparable injury to be done  it is usual just before a revolution for the dominant faction to make an arrangement with the persecuted jews so that in virtue of the payment of a large sum their families and possessions may be spared of course we are compelled to agree to this and even compliance does not always secure us because when violent men are once let loose they often become unmanageable for a time even by those who command them still the payment of this unjust tax is our only safeguard  this evening sidi hamet the commanderinchief of cavalry has been here to make the arrangement with me  i have long known of his designs indeed we jews know nearly all the secret plots that go on around us for gold is potent and we have those who are willing to give us information both in the palace and in the casba  i likewise know that sidi omar whom you may have seen also aims at the throne but he has no chance against his rival hamet who is a more powerful man in mind and body besides being younger  your old enemy sidi hassan has agreed to assist hamet who has promised to reward him with the office next in dignity to his own  i have more than once warned achmet of what is plotting for he has been kinder to my people than most of the deys who preceded him but he is strangely slow in guarding himself  he is a bold fearless man and perchance trusts too much to a popularity which for some time has been on the wanechiefly i believe because he is not a sufficiently unprincipled villain to please the taste of the lawless crew over whom he reigns  this is a dreadful state of things said mariano who had listened to the narration in silent amazement  it is indeed dreadful returned bacri and yet although the european powers must be thoroughly aware of it through their consuls this is the state of things that they not only tolerate but absolutely sanction by the presence of their representatives and the payment of tribute  tribute exclaimed mariano in a tone of indignation is it possible that tribute is paid by the great powers to these miserable pirates  even so young man answered bacri with a smile just as we jews pay them tribute to avoid being pillagedonly without having our excuse we are compelled to do it but no one can suppose for a moment that a small power like algiers can compel nearly all the maritime nations to bow before it  nevertheless the nations do submit some of them to very humiliating terms  you saw the swedish frigate conveying two storeships that entered the port yesterday  yes  well these vessels contained the annual tribute due by sweden and that country is also bound by treaty to furnish the dey with a person capable of directing his gunpowder factory  denmark not only pays tribute but is bound to pay it in naval stores and her consul here is at present in disgrace because his country has failed to pay its tribute at the specified time  there is an american ship just now detained in port because the nation to which it belongs is also dilatory in paying up what is due by treaty therefore the american consul is also in the deys black books and i may add in regard to him that at the time of his appointment to his office he gave the dey a consular present of sixteen thousand spanish dollars  even that notorious warrior napoleon who is at present turning europe upside down thought it worth his while lately to send to the dey a present of telescopes and other things to the amount of four thousand pounds and england that great nation which styles herself mistress of the seas cannot enter the mediterranean with her merchant ships until she has paid toll to this exacting city  now continued bacri stopping abruptly in his account of these matters i must not waste more time on a subject which is incomprehensible  indeed i would not have said so much were it not that the hour is yet too early for the undertaking which i have in view for you  achmet then must be at once put on his guard but to do so is no easy matter for his enemies surround him  it would be impossible for me or any one sent by me to gain admittance to him  i am already under surveillance and should forfeit my life were i to attempt it  the only method i can think of is to send to the british consul and let him know what is pending  he is the only consul here to whom the dey will grant an immediate unquestioning audience  you are active and strong mariano and are i believe willing to aid me  indeed i am replied the youth fervently  i need scarcely tell you said bacri sadly that you and your friends are intimately concerned in the safety of the present dey for if he falls it will go ill with all connected with him especially with the scrivanogrande your brother lucien and your father  i guessed as much said mariano with an anxious look but tell me is there likely to be much danger to this house and its inmates  i think not i hope not mariano but there is no place of absolute safety for me or mine in the city  i might indeed take refuge in the british consulate but i prefer to remain where i am and put my trust in god  then you and yours returned the youth with hesitation may want the aid of a stout and willing arm  is it well that i should leave you at this crisis  fear not i think there will be ample time for you to go and return if you make haste said the jew  then let me go at once urged the other  not so answered bacri we must proceed wisely as well as with cautiongo angela he said to the maiden who entered the room at that moment open the closet at the head of the terrace stair you will find a thin knotted rope hanging therefetch it hither  in a few minutes angela returned with the rope  sit thee down pretty one said bacri kindly while i give this youth some directions  i will explain to you afterwards the cause of his being sent awaythis line mariano is all you need  it is long enough to reach from the city walls to the ground  you will go towards the tower to the west of babazoun gate  there is an iron spike on the wall there on which is fixed the head of your poor friend castello fasten the rope to the spike and lower yourself  the ground reached leave the rope hanging it will serve for your ascent on returning then speed round the back of the town and over the hills by frais vallon to the house of the british consul tell him of the urgent need there is for his seeing the dey and letting him know the danger which hovers over his head and then return as fast as possible  this rope you will find suitable to its objects  an active young fellow like you can have no difficulty in remounting the walls with the aid of these knots and you need not fear interruption if you exercise ordinary caution for turkish soldiers like the warriors of all nations become arrant cowards when supernatural fears assail them  poor castellos head will keep the nearest sentinel as far off as is consistent with his duty  no doubt they are well used to trunkless heads in this city but there is a vast difference between the sight of such in the glare of day when surrounded by comrades and amid the excitement of war or an execution and a similar head in the stillness of a calm night during the solemn hours of a long and solitary watch  but why not allow me to start off at once asked mariano with some impatience at the jews prolixity  because the sentinels will not be relieved for an hour yet and it is well to make such an enterprise as near to the relief as possible wearied men at the end of a long watch being less on the alert than at the beginning of it  besides the moon will be lower in half an hour and that will favour your enterprise  being constrained to wait mariano busied himself in making the useful preparations  he wound the rope tightly round his waist and covered it with a thin scarf such as was commonly worn by the moors  he also trimmed and prepared a small lantern  now said bacri looking at his watch you may go  but staynot in the direction of our usual passage  you could not move ten yards from my door tonight without being intercepted  follow me i have long been prepared for emergencies such as this  goodnight angela said mariano extending his hand as he prepared to follow the jew  oh be careful said angela earnestly  from the little i have heard it seems that there is much danger impending  what i can do to avert it shall be done replied the youth kissing his hand to the girl as he passed through the doorway and followed his master to the terraceroof of the house  we have said that algerine roofs are flat but they are by no means regular  there are often various elevations on the same roof and various forms as if the architect had terminated the summits of the several walls and partitions at the dictates of a wayward fancy rather than a settled plan  in some cases a stepin others a flight of stepsformed the communication between one part of a roof and another while divisionwalls varying from a foot to two yards in height cut it up into irregular squares and triangles  such roofs are eminently fitted for the game of hide and go seek to which doubtless they have been applied more or less since the days of abraham  issuing on the terrace of his house then bacri pointed out to mariano by the light of the moon which was slowly descending to its bed in the sahel hills that the roof of his neighbours house could be easily reached by a single step  you will cross over this roof he said taking a ring from his finger and placing it on that of his slave and be sure that you tread with care until you come to the other edge of it where you will be able to place yourself in the shadow of a chimney until a cloud covers the moon my neighbour is not a friend therefore tread like a cat  attend well to my directions now and obey them implicitly  you require no arms whatever happens to you offer no resistance as that will only ensure death  when the moon is clouded leap to the next roof which you may see now in line with yonder minaret  there is about six feet between the twowhich is nothing to a youth like you only be careful for failure will plunge you into the street sixty feet below  that terrace gained you are on friendly ground  go knock gently at the door leading to the house below and show the owner my ring asking him at the same time to guide you to the street after which you know how to act and may the god of abraham direct you  stay  if the owner of the house who is a jew should use you roughly heed it not  whatever you do be passive  your own life and it may be the lives of others depends on this  the first part of the jews caution would have availed little for when mariano was roused he recked little of his own life but the reference to others reminded him of angela and his father so that he made up his mind to be a very model of forbearance whatever should happen  stepping easily from the house of the jew to the terrace of his neighbour he proceeded with extreme caution to the chimney pointed out to him and took his stand under its shadow  it was a time and situation which induced many burning thoughts and sad reflections to chase each other through the youths brain as he awaited impatiently the clouding of the moon  from the elevated point on which he stood nearly the whole city lay spread out at his feet its white terraces domes and minarets shining like silver in the pale light and contrasting vividly with the dark blue bay lying between it and the distant range of the jurjura mountains  everything was profoundly calm quiet and peaceful so that he found it difficult to believe in the fierce passions black villainy horrible cruelty and intolerable suffering which seethed below  for some time his eyes rested on the palace of the dey and he thought of his father and lucien with deep anxiety  then they wandered to the hated bagnio and he thought with pity of the miserable victims confined there and of the hundreds of other christian men and women who toiled in hopeless slavery in and around the pirate city  passing onward his eyes rested on the lighthouse and fortifications of the port and he wondered whether any of the powerful nations of the earth would ever have the commonsense to send a fleet to blow such a wasps nest into unimaginable atoms  at this point his thoughts were interrupted by the darkening of the moon by a thick cloud and the sudden descent of deep shadow on the townas if all hope in such a blessed consummation were forbidden  turning at once to the parapet of the terrace he mounted but paused a moment as he endeavoured to gauge the distance of the opposite wall and gazed into the black gulf below  bacri had told him that the space was six feet  in the darkness that now prevailed it appeared twenty he would have ventured it in the circumstances had it been sixty  collecting all his energies and courage he made a bound forward that might have roused the envy of an acrobat and cleared not only the space between but the parapet beyond coming down with an awful crash into the midst of a certain boxgarden which was the special pride of the owner of the mansion  poor mariano leaped up in horror and listened with dread but suddenly remembering that he now stood on what bacri had termed friendly ground he recovered selfpossession and sought for the door on the roof finding it after some trouble he knocked gently  it was opened much sooner and more violently than he had anticipated and a tall man springing out seized him by the throat in a grasp like a vice and held a gleaming dagger to his breast  in other circumstances mariano would certainly have engaged in a struggle for the dagger but remembering angela and the jews warning he gave back and said in french as well as the vicelike grip would allow  a friend  truly replied the man gruffly in lingua franca thy knock might imply friendship but thine appearance here at such an hour requires more explanation than a mere assurance  remove your hand and you shall have it replied the youth somewhat angrily  dost suppose that if i had been other than a friend i would not have ere now flung thee headlong from thine own terrace  speak quickly then returned the man relaxing his hold a little  this ring said the youth  ha  enough a sure token interrupted the jew in a low friendly tone on seeing the ring at the same time leading mariano within the doorway  what wouldst thou  nothing more than to be shown the nearest way to the street  that is soon donefollow me  in a few minutes mariano found himself in a narrow street down which after lighting his lantern and thanking the jew he proceeded at a rapid pace  in the intricacies of that curious old town the youth would certainly have lost himself but for the fact that it was built as we have said on the slope of a hill so that all he had to do was to keep descending in order to secure his final exit into the principal thoroughfare babazoun  few persons met him at that hour and these appeared desirous of avoiding observation  after passing the bagnio with a shudder he extinguished the lantern  and now the real danger of his enterprise had begun because he was acting illegally in traversing the streets after dark without a light and liable to be taken up and punished by any of the guards who should find him  he proceeded therefore with great caution keeping close to the walls in the darkest places and gliding into doorways to hide when any one approached  thus he succeeded escaping observation and had almost reached the city wall not far from the spot where it was garnished by poor castellos head when he heard the tramp of soldiers  they were about to turn a corner which would in another second have brought him full into view  to retreat was impossible and no friendly doorway stood open to receive him  in this extremity he pressed himself into a niche formed by a pillar and an angle of the house beside him  it could not have concealed him in ordinary circumstances but aided by darkness there was some possibility of escaping notice  crushing himself against the wall with all his might and wishing with all his heart that he had been a smaller man he breathlessly awaited the passing of the soldiers    chapter fifteen  in which ted flaggan and his friend rais ali act a conscious part and a political storm begins to break  there is unquestionably many a slip twixt the cup and the lip but on the present occasion there was no such slip  mariano succeeded in diminishing and flattening himself to such an extent that the janissaries passed without observing him  the moment they were out of sight he glided from his hidingplace and soon found his way to the top of the ramparts near the babazoun gate  the head of castello was at his elbow the wearied turkish sentinel was not a hundred yards distant mariano could see him clearly defined against the eastern sky every time he reached the end of his beat  if he takes it into his head to walk this way i am lost thought mariano  it seemed as if the man had heard the thought for he walked slowly towards the spot where the youth lay at full length on the ground there was no mound or niche or coping of any kind behind which a man might conceal himself  the dead mans head was the only object that broke the uniformity of the wall  in desperation mariano lay down with it between himself and the advancing sentinel and crept close to itso close that while he lay there he fancied that a drop of something cold fell from it and mingled with the perspiration that stood in large beads upon his brow  the sentinel stopped just as mariano was preparing to spring upon and endeavour to strangle him  he looked earnestly and long in the direction of the dead mans head as if in meditation on its owners untimely fate or possibly on the unusual length and solidity of the shadow that tailed away from it  fortunately he advanced no further but turning on his heel walked slowly away  just then the moon shot forth a ray of light from the midst of the cloud that had covered it as if to cheer the fugitive on his desperate adventure  instead of cheering however it alarmed him and expedited his movements  in a moment mariano put a loop of his rope over the head and drew it tight on the spike close to the masonry  another moment and he was over the parapet down the wall and into the ditch  here again unusual caution was needful but the youths catlike activity enabled him to overcome all obstacles  in a few minutes he was speeding over the sahel hills in the direction of frais vallon  we need scarcely say that wind and muscle were tried to their uttermost that night  in an incredibly short space of time he reached the gate of the consuls garden which stood open and darted in  now it chanced that night that the stout british seaman ted flaggan lay in a hammock suspended between two trees in a retired part of the consuls garden the weather being so warm that not only he but several of the other domestics had forsaken their dwellings during the night and lay about the grounds in various contrivances more or less convenient according to the fancy or mechanical aptitude of the makers thereof  flaggan had out of pure goodwill slung a primitive hammock similar to his own between two trees near him for his friend rais ali in which the valiant moor lay sound asleep with his prominent brown nose pointing upwards to the sky and his long brown legs hanging over the sides  ted himself lay in a wakeful mood  he had fought unsuccessfully for some hours against a whole army of mosquitoes and now having given in allowed the savage insects to devour him unchecked  but the poor victim found it difficult to lie awake and suffer without occupation of any kind he therefore arose and cut from a neighbouring hedge a light reed which was long enough to reach from his own hammock to that of his friend  with the delicate end of this while reclining at his ease he gently tickled rais alis nose  after making several sleepy efforts to kill the supposed insect that troubled him and giving vent to three or four violent sneezes the interpreter awoke and growling something in arabic opened his eyes which act enabled him to observe that his neighbour was awake and smiling at him  ha yous not be for sleep hey  mos troubelzum brutes dem muskitoes  och its little i mind em said flaggan  wy you no for sleep den demanded rais  cos i likes to meditate young man specially wen ive got sitch a splendid subjic of contemplation before me as a slumberin moor  wont ye go in for a little moor slumberin eh  rais turned his back on his friend with an indignant growl  he was evidently indisposed for jesting  in a few seconds being indifferent to real mosquitoes the moor was again sound asleep  it was soon clear however that he was not indifferent to teds artificial insect  being unable now to reach his nose the restless son of erin thrust the feathery point of the reed into his friends ear  the result was that rais ali gave himself a sounding slap on the side of the head to teds inexpressible delight when rais indicated that he was off again he received another touch which resulted in a second slap and a savage growl as the unfortunate man sat up and yawned  they seems wuss than ornar said flaggan gravely  wuss  i nebber knowd noting wusser replied rais with a look of sleepy exasperation  beats ebberyting  been fiveantwenty eer in de kontry an nebber seed de like  seed the like echoed the seaman  did ye saw em when ye was aslape  feel um then replied the other sulkily yoos too purtikler  suppose we goes an has a whiff suggested flaggan leaping to the ground  its a fine night entirely tho a dark un  come ill trate ye to a taste o me cavendish which is better than growlin in yer hammock at the muskaities poor things as dont know no better  feeling that the advice was good or perhaps tempted by the offer of a taste of his friends peculiarly good tobacco the interpreter arose calmly made a paper cigarette while flaggan loaded his cutty and then accompanied him in a saunter down the road leading to the gate  ally began the seaman making a stopper of the end of his little fingerby the way you aint related are you to the famous ally babby as was capting of the forty thieves  no nuffin ob de sort replied ali shaking his head  well no matter you deserve to be but thats neither here nor there what i was agoing to say is that its my opinion that fellow seedy hassan aint all fair an above board  ted glanced keenly at his companion for he had made the remark as a sort of feeler  wat de matter wid um asked rais carelessly  oh nothini only thought you might know somethin about him  i doesnt only im a dab at whats called in ireland fizzyognomy an  i dont like the looks of him  why bless ye i knows a feller by the cut of his jib directly  i could have taken my davy now that you were a sly clever sort o chap even before i was introduced to ee dee see  whether he saw or not remains to this day an uncertainty for it was at that moment that as before stated mariano rushed in at the gate and unintentionally into the arms of rais ali who uttered a loud cry and flung him off with a kick that unfortunately took effect on the youths shin  supposing that he was intercepted afraid lest his mission should miscarry and angered by the pain mariano lost the power of selfrestraint which he had hitherto exercised so well that night  he rushed at the interpreter and hit him a blow on the forehead that caused him to tumble backwards violently  the act was scarcely done when the youth found himself in the embrace of ted flaggan and strong though he was he found it impossible to throw off or to free himself from that sturdy tar  still he struggled fiercely and there is no saying what might have been the result had not rais recovering from the blow hastened to his friends aid  between them they succeeded in securing mariano and with a handkerchief tied his hands behind him  now then young feller said flaggan taking the youth by the arm youll have to go before the british counsl an give an account of yerself  so come along  of course when mariano was taken into the presence of colonel langley and had whispered a few words in his ear the seaman and his friend rais ali were dismissed with the assurance that all was rightan assurance by the way which was not quite satisfactory to the latter when he reflected on and tenderly stroked the bump about as large as a pigeons egg which ornamented the space between his eyes  never mind ally babby was his friends consolatory remark as they left the house and returned to their hammocks it cant damage your good looks an ll prove a mighty source of amazement to the muskaities  meanwhile the consul accompanied mariano a short way on his return to town so that the latter might not be delayed  i hope there is no fear of an outbreak occurring before i can get into town tomorrow said the consul as they were about to part  it is impossible that i can demand an audience of the dey before breakfast without creating suspicion  tell bacri however that he may depend on my doing my utmost without delay to avert the evil  and now how do you mean to return to himfor it occurs to me that although you may scale the walls easily enough you wont be able to retrace your way to the house of the jew who favoured your escape  bacri had foreseen that replied the youth and has arranged to meet and guide me from a street leading south from the bagnio which is known to both of us  he runs great risk in doing this said the consul however he knows the outs and ins of the city well  goodbye and god speed you on your way  mariano who was impatient to return at once darted away like a deer and was soon lost to view among the aloes and cactuses that clothed the slopes of the sahel hills  not long afterwards the grey light of day began to tip the domes and minarets of the pirate city and with it began the soft hum of a general awakeningfor mohammedans are early risers and even pirates deemed it consistent with their calling to commence the day with formalnot to say ostentatiousprayers  any one traversing the streets at that early hour might have seen men at the fountains busy with their prescribed ablutions while elsewhere others were standing kneeling or prostrating themselves with their faces turned carefully in the direction of mecca their holy city  it must not be supposed however as we have already remarked that all the men of the town were pirates  that the town existed by means of piracy and that all its chief men from the dey downwards were pure and simple robbers is quite consistent with the fact that there were many honest enough traders and workmen whose lot had been cast there and whose prayers were probably very heartfelt and genuinesome of them perchance being an appeal for deliverance from the wretches who ruled them with a rod of ironindeed we might almost say a rod of redhot iron  whatever the nature of their prayers however they were early in presenting and remarkably particular in not omitting them  down at the marina there was a group of christian slaves who were not behind their taskmasters in this respect  in an angle of the fortifications the padre giovanni was kneeling by the side of a dying slave  the man had been crushed accidentally under a large piece of the rock with which the bulwarks of the harbour were being strengthened  he had been carried to the spot where he lay and would have been left to die uncared for if blindi bobi had not chanced to pass that way  after administering such consolation as lay in a little weak wine and water from his flask the eccentric but kindhearted man had gone off in search of the padre who was always ready to hasten at a moments notice to minister to the necessity of slaves in sickness  too often the good mans services were of little avail because the sick slaves were frequently kept at work until the near approach of death rendered their labours worthless so that when giovanni came to comfort them they were almost if not quite indifferent to all things  on the present occasion he was too late to do more than pray that the dying man might be enabled by the holy spirit to trust in the salvation wrought outand freely offered to sinners even the chiefby jesus christ  while the spirit of the poor slave was passing away sidi omar approached the spot  blindi bobi remembering a former and somewhat similar occasion at once glided behind a projection of the walls and made off  he is past your help now giovanni said omar to the old man for whom he in common with nearly all the people of the town entertained great respect despite his christianity for the padre had spent the greater part of a long life among them in the exercise of such pure humble philanthropy that even his enemies if he had any were at peace with him  his spirit is with god who gave it replied the old man rising and contemplating sadly the poor crushed form that lay at his feet  his spirit wont give us any more trouble then returned omar as he regarded the dead man with a stern glance he was one of the most turbulent of our slaves  and one of the most severely tried said giovanni looking gently in the face of the minister of marine  he had all the advantages and comforts of other slaves i know not what you mean by tried retorted omar with a grim smile  he was wrenched with his family from home and friends and earthly hope twenty years ago he saw his children perish one by one under cruel treatment he saw his wife sold into slavery though he did not see her dieas i didof a broken heart and he suffered all the torments that ingenuity could devise before his spirit was set free  giovanni said this slowly and very gently but two bright red spots on his pale careworn cheeks showed that he spoke with strong emotion  well well returned omar with a sinister smile that gives him all the better chance in the next life for according to the faith of you christians his sufferings here go to make weight in the matter of his salvation  is it not so  men who call themselves christians said the padre do not all hold the same faith  there are those who appear to me to wrest scripture to their own destruction they find in one part thereof a description of true faith as distinguished from a dead false or spurious faith which reveals its worthlessness by the absence of works and founding on that they refuse to accept the other portion of scripture which saith that by the works of the law shall no man living be justified  i with many others hold that there is no merit in our simply suffering the sufferings and the obedience of jesus christ in our stead is all the merit on which we rest our hopes of salvation  it may be so giovanni returned omar carelessly but i profess not to understand such matters  the slave is dead and thou hast one less to care for  with this sentiment accompanied by a smile of pity and a shake of his head the minister of marine left the padre and directed his steps towards the town  on his way he met the court storyteller or jester  thou art early astir hadji babi he said  is there aught in the wind  there is much in the wind answered the jester gravely there is oxygen and nitrogen if philosophers be rightwhich is an open questionand there is something lately discovered which they call ozone  discoveries in time past give ground for expectation of discoveries in time to come  there is much in the wind methinks  true true rejoined omar with an approving nod and what sayest thou as to the atmosphere of the palace  the jester who had strong suspicions as to the goodfaith of omar yet was not sufficiently in the confidence of the dey to know exactly how matters stood replied with caution  it is serene as usual not disturbed by untoward elements as the air of a palace ought to be  that is well hadji baba returned omar in a confidential tone nevertheless thou knowest that the atmosphere in palaces is not always sereneby the way hast seen sidi hamet of late  not i replied the other carelessly  he is no friend of thine it would seem said omar  no answered the jester shortly  nor of mine added omar  each eyed the other narrowly as this was said  wouldst do him a service if you could asked omar  no said baba  nor i returned omar  i owe service to no one save the dey rejoined baba  if it were possible i would for his sake put a bowstring round the neck of a certain aga  ha interrupted omar hast thou then seen aught to justify such strong measures  come hadji baba thou knowest me to be thy masters true friend  tell me all  it shall be well for thee  it might be ill for thee if thou didst decline but fear not  i am thy friend and the friend of achmet  it behoves friends to aid each other in straits  the jester felt that he had committed himself but at the same time conceived that he was justified in trusting one who had always been the intimate friend and adviser of his master  he therefore revealed all that he knew of the plot which was hatching and of which he knew a great deal more than the minister of marine had expected in consequence of his having been kept well informed by a negro girl called zooloo whose capacity for eavesdropping was almost equal to a certain bird of the air which has been in all ages accredited with the powers of an electric telegraph  in consequence of the information thus received sidi omar made instant and formidable preparations to thwart the schemes of his adversary in doing which of course he found it advantageous to uphold the dey  achmet also made energetic preparations to defend himself and was quite cool and collected when about the usual breakfast hour he received the british consul and thanked him for the timely warning which he brought  but the precautions of both were in vain for sidi hamet was a man of vigour beyond his fellows  suddenly when all seemed profoundly peaceful some of his followers rushed upon the palace guards disarmed them and hauled down the standard  at the same hourpreviously fixedthe port the casba and the gates of the city were surprised and taken  the lieutenants employed to accomplish these feats at once announced that sidi hamet was about to become dey of algiers in proof whereof they pointed to the naked flagstaff of the palace  the janissaries most of whom were indifferent as to who should rule at once sided with the insurrectionists  those who favoured sidi omar were cowed and obliged to follow suit though some of themespecially those at the marinaheld out for a time  and now the reign of anarchy began  knowing that for a few hours the city was destitute of a head the rude turkish soldiery took the law into their own hands and indulged in every excess of riot entering the houses of jews and moors by force and ransacking them for hidden treasure  of course sidi hamet attempted to fulfil his engagement with bacri by placing guards over the houses of the more wealthy jews as well as giving orders to the troops not to molest them  but like many other reckless men he found himself incapable of controlling the forces which he had set in motion  many of the jews expecting this had sought refuge in the houses of their friends and in the british consulate where the consul finding himself as it were caught and involved in the insurrection deemed it wise to remain for a time    chapter sixteen  tells of riot and revolution in the pirate city  at the first sound of tumult achmetwho was seated at the time on his accustomed throne of judgment ready to transact the ordinary business of the morningsprang up and roused his pet lion to a sudden and towering pitch of fury by thrusting the point of his dagger into it the result was that when the door burst open the huge creature sprang into the midst of the insurgents with a tremendous roar  a volley of balls laid it low for ever but the incident diverted attention for a moment from the dey and afforded him time to escape from the audiencechamber  darting up a staircase he gained the palaceroof from which he sprang to a neighbouring roof and descended hastily to the street throwing off some of his brilliant apparel as he ran and snatching up a common burnous in which he enveloped himself  every avenue to the palace had been carefully secured by sidi hamet but it chanced that the one which achmet selected was guarded by a young soldier towards whom at some previous time he had shown acts of kindness  on seeing the dey hastening towards him the soldier lowered his musket but appeared undecided how to act  achmet at once taking advantage of his hesitation went boldly up to him and reminding him of what he had formerly done for him attempted to bribe him with a magnificent diamond ring but the soldier refused the ring  placing his left hand on his eyes he said hurriedly  your servant can neither hear nor see  the dey at once took the hint and passed on but the delay proved fatal for a band of janissaries who were traversing the narrow streets in search of him came suddenly round a corner  achmet instantly turned back and fled hotly pursued by the yelling soldiers  they were quickly joined by others and ere long a surging crowd followed the footsteps of the fugitive as he darted from one to another of the intricate streets the dey was a cool and courageous as well as an active man and for some time eluded his pursuers whose very eagerness to take his life caused them to thwart each other by getting jammed in several of the narrow passages  at last achmet gained the entrance to the palace of his wives  the door was already shut and secured as well as guarded by two of the insurgent janissaries  rendered desperate and savage by the hopelessness of his case he cleft the skulls of these men with his sword and was about to dash himself violently against the strong door in the vain hope of bursting it open when he was checked by hearing an appalling shriek inside  next moment the door was flung wide open and his faithful wife ashweesha appeared with a dripping dagger in her hand  no word was uttered because none was needed  the dey leaped in and shut the door violently just as his infuriated pursuers gained it while ashweesha with cool precision shot in the heavy bolts and let down the ponderous bars  achmet sank exhausted on one of the couches of the vestibule regardless of the din which was made by the mob outside in their vain endeavours to batter down the strong oaken door  do not give way said ashweesha falling on her knees beside him and resting his head tenderly on her shoulder there are many who love you in the city  escape over the terraces to the house of jacob the jew he has many hidingplaces and will assuredly aid you  i will try for your sake ashweesha said achmet starting up i have little hope it is true for my enemies are too strong for me but it were cowardly to fail for want of an effort  allah bless thee my wife  he kissed her and immediately made for the staircase that led to the terrace  gaining the roof he looked over the parapet and the first glance was enough to convince him that he must bid adieu to hope  the palace was completely surrounded by the insurgents who set up a fierce shout on observing him and fired a volley of balls from many directions all of which however passed harmlessly over his head  thou seest ashweesha he said with a sad smile as the sultana followed him to the terrace my time has come  it is fate  allah has willed it sothere is therefore no possibility of averting it  say not so cried ashweesha earnestly the terrace of jacob is easily gained once there you can descend to some of the back streets where no one looks for you  i will make the attempt said the dey sternly casting his eyes over the city  it was a sight that might well lull him with sad thoughts for the roofs or terraces everywhere were covered with affrighted womenthe houses of the jews being especially distinguishable by the frantic manner in which the jewesses wrung their hands and otherwise displayed their grief and alarm  a plank thrown from the parapet of his palace to that of the nearest house enabled achmet to escape from those of his enemies who had gained an entrance below but it was only a momentary respite while they were searching for another plank to enable them to follow him he attempted to cross over to the house of the jew above mentioned  he was at once observed on the frail bridge that supported him and a shout of anger rose from the populace like a hoarse roar  during the whole time in which the dey was thus endeavouring to escape his proud spirit fought against him urging him to turn and dare his foes to do their worst  at the moment when their roar burst upon his ear all desire to escape seemed to vanish  he stopped suddenly drew himself up with his wonted look of dignified composure and from his perilous and elevated position looked down almost reproachfully on those who had been wont to bow at his footstool  the act was followed by another roar  a hundred muskets belched forth their deadly fire and achmet dey fell headlong into the street  the shattered body was instantly seized by the soldiers and the head severed from the trunk was carried off to the palace there to be presented as a trophy to sidi hamet the new dey of algiers  so soon as the green standard of the prophet was run up on the flagstaff of the palace announcing that a new ruler had seated himself on the throne the period of recognised anarchy came to an end and order began to be in some measure restored  still most of the wealthy inhabitants kept in close retirement having of course hidden away most of their valuables and cash  the jews especially were very chary of showing themselves in public and those of them who had fled for refuge to the british consulate remained quiet and were hospitably entertained for several days  among the first who fled to that shelter was the valiant rais ali  he entered with a trembling frame and pale visage about the time the incidents we have described were being enacted and found colonel langley with the aid of ted flaggan engaged in preparing the various rooms of the building for the reception of those who from past experience he expected to require them  why rais what ails you demanded colonel langley in surprise not unmingled with anger for he had on leaving home placed the interpreter in charge of his family in his suburban villa  oh massr said ali piteously yous no know wat dangers me hab if de janissary cotch me  life not wuth wone buttin  rascal exclaimed the colonel did i not charge you to guard my household  how dare you forsake your post  are you not under my protection  ah yis yis massr butbutyous no know de greatness of me danger  go scoundrel exclaimed the colonel losing all patience with him return to your duty as fast as your horse can carry you else i shall hand you over to the janissaries  you hears what yer master says dont ee said ted flaggan who viewed the infidelity and cowardice of the interpreter with supreme disgust as he seized him by the nape of the neck and thrust him towards the door  git out ye whitelivered spalpeen or ill multiply every bone in yer body by two  rais ali went with extreme reluctance but there was no resisting the persuasive violence of teds powerful arm nor the emphatic kick of the muscular leg with which he propelled his moorish friend into the street he did not wait however to remonstrate but immediately drew forward the hood of his burnous and hurried away  just then bacri entered conducting a number of women and children who sought sanctuary there  some of my people have need of the british arm to protect them said the jew with a sad smile  and they shall have it said the consul taking bacri by the handsee them attended to flaggan he added turning to the seaman  ay ay sirthis way my dears said ted waving his hand with a fatherly air to the group of weeping women and children and conducting them to one of the large chambers of the house where mrs langley and paulina had already spread out bedding and made further preparations for a large party  do you think bacri said the consul as the other was about to depart that there is much chance of hamet succeeding  i do answered the jew  achmet is now become very unpopular  he is too kind and generous to suit the tastes of the soldiers and you are aware that the janissaries have it all their own way in this city  this was indeed the case  the turkish soldiers were extremely insolent and overbearing alike to moors and jews one of the privileges they claimed being to enter the gardens of the inhabitants whenever they pleasednot excepting those of the consulsand eat and destroy fruit and vegetables at will  achmets party added bacri is not strong while that of hamet is not only numerous but influential  i fear much that the sands of his glass are nearly run out  it is a woeful state of things observed the colonel while a slight flush mantled on his cheekpossibly at the thought of his having as the representative of a civilised power to bow his head and recognise such barbarians  and you bacri will you not also stay here  no  there are others of my people who require my aid  i go to join them  i trust that hamets promiseif he succeedswill sufficiently guard me from violence  it may be that they will respect my position in any case i stay not herefarewell  when the jew had left the consul turned to superintend the arrangements of his house which by this time had assumed the appearance of a hospital or prisonso numerous and varied were the people who had fled thither for refuge  chief among the busy ones there was the ebony damsel from beyond the zahara whose tendency to damage master jim and to alarm jims mamma has already been remarked on more than once  zubbys energies were at the time devoted to paulina in whom she took a deep interest  she had made one little nest of a blanket for her baby angelina and another similar nest for master jim whose head she had bumped against the wall in putting him into itwithout awaking him however for jim was a sound sleeper and used to bumps  she was now tearfully regarding the meeting of paulina with her sister angela  the latter had been brought to the consulate by bacri along with her mistress and some other members of the jews household and the delight of the two sisters at this unexpected meeting afforded the susceptible zubby inexpressiblewe might almost say inconceivablejoy as was evidenced by the rising of her black cheeks the shutting of her blacker eyes and the display of her gorgeous teethfront and backas well as her red gums  oh  im so glad exclaimed angela sitting down on a mat beside her sister and gazing through her tears  so am i darling responded paulina and so would baby be if she were awake and understood it  zubby looked as if she were on the point of awaking baby in order to enable her to understand it fortunately she thought better of this  but im so frightened added angela changing rather suddenly from a smile to a look of horror  why dearest asked paulina  oh youve no idea what awful things i have heard since i went to live with the jew who is very kind to me paulina  they said they were going to kill the dey  who said dear  thethe peopleyou know  of course i dont know who all the people are that come to see us and i dont like to ask but some of them are badoh so bad she looked appallingly solemn hereand then mariano  ah what of mariano and francisco and lucien asked paulina with increasing interest while zubby became desperately intelligent  oh he was sent on such a dangerous expedition continued angela blushing slightly and more than slightly crying and when he was coming back he was caught in the streets and carried off to that dreadful bagnio about which he has told me such awful horrors  so bacri told me on his return for bacri had tried to save him but couldnt and was nearly lost himselfbut what is all the noise about outside sisterand the shooting off of guns  the noise referred to by the pretty sicilian was caused by a party of rioters who returning from the slaughter of the dey were hurrying towards the house of bacri intent on plunder  they were led by one of those big blustering men styled bullies who in all lands have a talent for taking the lead and talking loud when danger is slight and modestly retiring when it is great  waving a scimitar which already dripped with blood this man headed the rushing crowd and was the first to thunder for admittance at the jews door  but no one answered his demands  shouting for a beam he ran to a neighbouring pile of timber and with the aid of some others returned bearing a batteringram which would soon have dashed in the door if it had not been opened by bacri himself who had returned just in time to attempt to save his house from being pillaged  for a few seconds the rioters were checked by surprise at the cool calm bearing of the jew  then they dropped the beam uttered a yell of execration and rushed upon him but were unexpectedly checked by one of their own number suddenly turning round and in a voice of stern authority ordering the crowd to stand back  the young janissary who acted thus unexpectedly was a tall handsome man of resolute bearing but with a frame that rather denoted activity than strength  as he held a glittering sword threateningly in his right hand his order was obeyed for a few seconds and then it was observed that he held in his left hand a rope which was tied round the neck of a christian slave  this slave was none other than our unfortunate friend francisco rimini  who art thou that issues commands so bravely demanded the bully stepping forward  you must be aware comrades said the young soldier addressing the crowd rather than his interrogator that sidi hametnow dey of algiershas given strict orders that the houses of the jews are to be respected  i am here to see these orders carried out  and who art thou again i demand said the bully observing that his comrades showed a tendency to waver that dost presume to  i am one cried the young soldier with a whirl of his gleaming blade so close to the mans nose that he staggered back in alarmi am one who knows how to fulfil his duty  perchance i may be one who shall even presume some day to mount the throne when hamet dey is tired of itin which case i know of a bully whose head shall grace the highest spike on babazoun  the quiet smile with which the latter part of this speech was delivered and the determined air of the youth combined to make the soldiers laugh so that the bully felt himself under the necessity of retiring  sheathing his sword with a businesslike air and rudely pushing his prisoner into the house whither bacri had already retired the young soldier entered and shut the door  lucien exclaimed bacri in surprise as he grasped the hand of the young janissary thou hast managed this business well considering that thou art no turk  how didst thou come to think of it  i should never have thought of it had not my worthy father suggested the idea replied lucien with a smile as he removed the rope from the neck of his sireforgive me father if i have played my part too roughly  too roughly echoed the bluff merchant with a laugh why boy dost think that thine old father has lost all his youthful vigour  i trow notyou see signor bacri we have had information of what was impending for some days past and although we could do nothing to avert the catastrophe we thought it possible that we might manage to avoid the massacre at the palace  knowing from report that the janissaries ran riot at such times and being aware that my son lucienwho is a noted linguist signor bacrispoke their language almost as well as a native i suggested that he should procure a uniform and personate a janissary while i should act the part of a runaway slave  being a favourite with poor achmet as you know lucien had much influence among the domestics and easily procured the disguise  the moment the insurrection took place we fled from the palace and as you see here we are  but why came you hither asked bacri with a troubled look  to whom else could we flee for shelter returned lucien  you are the only friend we have in the cityexcept indeed the padre giovanni who has no power to save us  alas returned the jew leading his friends into the skiffa and seating himself on the edge of the fountain that played there you lean on a broken reed  my power is not sufficient to protect myself  even now the soldiers might have taken my life and robbed my house with impunity had it not been for your courage lucien  my predecessor was shot in cold blood by a man who for the murder was only transported  if he had slain the poorest turk or even a moor he would have been strangled  we are a despised as well as persecuted race and our influence or power to protect you is very small  indeed if it were known that i had given you shelter my life would be forfeited as well as yours  i have already placed it in great jeopardy in order to save mariano  mariano exclaimed francisco turning an anxious gaze on the jew is he then in danger  he is captured by the turks replied bacri and is now in the bagnio  where they will doubtless bastinado him to death said francisco grinding his teeth and clenching his hands with suppressed passion bacri i feel that in me which makes me long to run amuck among these turks  i understand you not said bacri  why i will take the first opportunity that offers to cut the throats of as many of these fiends as possible before they manage to cut mine they say that vengeance is sweet  i will taste it and try said the merchant with a grim smile  vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord returned bacri slowly says not your own scripture so  it may be so but mans power of endurance is limited retorted francisco gloomily  but gods power to aid and strengthen is not limited returned the jew  believe me no good ever came of violenceat least from revengeful violence  no doubt a violent assault at the right time and with a right motive has often carried the day but violence given way to for the mere purpose of gratifying the feelings is not only useless it is hurtful and childish  hast never given way to such thyself bacri demanded francisco with some asperity  i have replied the jew with humility and it is because i have done so that i am enabled to speak with some authority as to the results your desire i suppose is to save mariano  if you would attain that end you must learn to curb your passions and use the powers of judgment with which your maker has endowed you  well well we will let that point hang on its peg in the meantime returned francisco impatiently but what wouldst thou advise we are at your mercy  i will do what i can to prove that a jew is not ungrateful answered bacri  if they leave us unmolested here till nightfall we may find a way of escape for you at all events from the city but it is only such as desperate men would choose to take  we are desperate men said lucien quietly  once outside the walls continued the jew you must keep perfectly close and still by day for a diligent search will be made for you and only at night will you be able to creep out from your place of hiding to steal what you can for food and to attempt to gain the coast where your only chance of escape lies in seizing one of the small feluccas in which the piracies of the algerines are carried on and putting off to sea without provisionswith the certainty of being pursued and the all but certainty of being overtaken  such risks are better than death or slavery answered francisco  we think not of danger  the only thing that gives me concern is how we are to get my poor son out of the bagnio  i will manage that for you said bacri for my gold is at least powerful with menials but in order to do this i shall have to leave the house for a time and must conceal you in a cellar  do as you will bacri said francisco we are in your hands and place implicit confidence in you  well follow me said the jew  rising and leaving the skiffa he conducted them down a staircase into a small cellar which was almost too low to admit of their standing erect here he pointed out a shelf on which were a pot of water and a loaf also a bundle of straw on which they might rest when so disposed having described carefully to them the manner of marianos escape over the roof of the house and by the city wall and having given them the rope that had been used on that occasion he said  now i leave you  i must lock the trapdoor that leads to this dungeon and carry away the key because if rioters were to break in and find the key in it they would at once discover your refuge  and what if you be killed bacri and we be left here without a soul in the world who knows of our whereabouts said francisco with a look of anxiety  id rather be bastinadoed to death than be buried alive after all  if it goes ill with me as may well be the case answered the jew you have only to make use of this crowbar and wrench off the lock of the door  but if rioters enter the house be careful not to do it until some time after they are gone and all is quiet  when free you must use your own wisdom and discretionfarewell  bacri ascended the trapladder and shut the door leaving his friends in darkness which was made visible but not dispelled by a small lantern they listened intently to his receding footsteps until the last faint echo left them in total silence    chapter seventeen  francisco and his son in danger  for several hours francisco and his son sat on the bundle of straw listening intently to every sound being naturally filled with anxiety as to the success of bacri in his efforts to aid mariano  at last they heard a loud knocking at the street door which after being repeated impatiently once or twice was followed by a thunderous noise as if the house were being entered by violence  the janissaries have returned said francisco with a serious look  we had better put out the light suggested lucien as a crashing sound announced the bursting in of the door  do ladstay let me get hold of this crowbar it is better than nothing if it comes to  now out with it  a moment more and they were in total darkness while the trampling of feet overhead and the shouts of many voices told that the mob had entered the jews dwelling  every moment the two prisoners expected to see the trapdoor of their retreat wrenched open but no one seemed to have discovered it and they were beginning to breathe more freely and to hope that they should escape when there came a sudden and violent stamping just overhead then there was a sound of breaking timber and presently the edge of the trapdoor began to lift and creak under the pressure of some powerful instrument  another moment and it flew open and a man looked in but of course could see nothing  descending the steps he called loudly for a light and one of his comrades brought a lantern with which he was about to descend but missing his footstep he fell to the ground and extinguished it  at that moment lucien and his father drew back into the darkest part of the cellar in the shadow of a small projection  fetch another light shouted the soldiers  nows our time whispered lucien grasping his scimitar and preparing for a dash  not yet replied his father laying a strong grasp on his arm  it was well that lucien was restrained for while the soldiers were clamouring for a light their comrades above gave a shout as though something new and surprising had been discovered  full of curiosity the soldiers in the cellar darted out  now whispered francisco  lucien at once sprang up the ladder but looked out cautiously for the sudden change in the sounds above apprised him that the robbers had left the apartment  he saw them busy ransacking a cupboard in which the jew had placed a large quantity of plate a little of which was solid and a large portion showy but comparatively valueless  it had been arranged by him in such a way as to make a superb show of wealth in the hope that it might tempt any who should take a fancy to rob his house to expend much of their labour and energy on that horde thereby creating an important diversion from much more valuable deposits made elsewhere  so busy were the plunderers that they left the room above the cellar quite unguarded  the coast is clear whispered lucien looking back  we must act out our part of janissary and slave father  quick  shoulder this small chest  francisco obeyed almost mechanically laid down the crowbar threw a light chest that chanced to be near at hand on his shoulder and followed his son silently up the staircase to the entrancehall of the house where they found two janissaries guarding the door  pretend to stumble father whispered lucien on observing them  francisco not only pretended to but in his zealous obedience actually did stumble with such good will that he fell with a heavy crash on the marble pavement sending the chest violently out at the door into the street much to the amusement of the two sentinels  scoundrel cried lucien furiously in turkish at the same time flourishing his scimitar and bestowing on his submissive parent a most unmerciful kick  up out with you and shoulder it  see that you mind your feet better else the bastinado shall make them tingle  he brushed so savagely past the sentinels that they had not time to stop him even if so disposed then turning suddenly back said  your lantern friend one will serve you well enough and i shall need the other with so awkward a slave  here it is comrade replied the man but who and what hast thou got there  waste not your time in questions said lucien hastily they have discovered heavy treasure inside and require the aid of one of you surely it needs not two to guard a jews door  he hurried off without awaiting a reply  in perfect silence they traversed several narrow streets without meeting any one  it was nearly dark at the time and it was evident that the rioters had been restrained by the new dey for their shouts were now heard in only two or three of the main thoroughfares  during his service as scribe to achmet lucien had visited all parts of the town and was familiar with its main outlines if not with its details  he therefore knew how to avoid the frequented parts and yet take a pretty direct course for babazoun  but he was sorely perplexed as to how he should now act for it was much too early in the night to make an attempt to get over the city walls  in this dilemma he retired into the deep shadow of an old doorway and covered up the lantern while he held a whispered consultation with his father  it seems to me my son said francisco sitting down on the chest which he had hitherto carried that we have only got out of the fryingpan into the fire for it is not reason to expect that all the janissaries we chance to meet will let us pass without question and i fear that you have no sufficient ground of excuse for wandering about the city at such hours in disturbed times in charge of a slave on whose countenance submission sits with so bad a grace  true father answered lucien much perplexed perhaps it would be well to remain where we are till a later hour  if any one seeks to enter this dismal staircase we can easily avoid observation by getting into one of its dark corners and  he was interrupted by the sound of approaching footsteps and immediately retired with his father into one of the corners referred to  it is only two streets further on said a low voice which sounded familiar in the ears of the listeners  there you shall be safe for jacob mordecai is a trusty friend and i will go see how it fares with our  tis bacri whispered lucien as the voice died away in the distance  we must not lose sight of him said francisco darting out  lucien outran his father and quickly overtook bacri and another man who was completely enveloped in the folds of a burnous such as was then and still is worn by the bedouin arabs  on hearing the footsteps in pursuit bacri and his companion had commenced to run but perceiving that only two men followed them they turned and stood in an attitude of defence  he who wore the burnous flung back the hood and freeing his swordarm from its folds displayed to the astonished gaze of lucien and francisco the face and form of mariano  father he exclaimed lucien  mariano cried francisco throwing his arms round his younger son and giving him a hearty kiss on each cheek  hist be quiet said bacri seizing francisco by the arm in his powerful grasp and dragging him along  the interference of the jew was not a moment too soon for several soldiers who were patrolling the streets at the time overheard the sound of their voices and hurried towards them  they ran now in good earnest and quickly reached the door of jacob mordecais house which bacri opened with a key and shut gently after letting his friends pass so that the soldiers lost sight of them as if by a magical disappearance  your house is plundered said francisco to bacri after jacob mordecai had conducted them to the skiffa of his dwelling  i guessed as much  but how came you to escape asked bacri  lucien related the circumstances of their escape while his father dipped his head in the fountain for the purpose as he remarked of cooling his brains  and what is now to be done asked mariano with a look of perplexity bacri has been kind enough to get me out of that horrible bagnio just in time to save me from torture of some sort but here we are in the heart of a city in a state of insurrection with almost every streetcorner guarded and bands of men that appear to me to be devils in turbans going about seeking for subjects on whom to exercise their skill  the insurrection is overat least this one is over said jacob mordecai sadly though it may well be that another insurrection shall follow close on its heels but it is probable that there will be some degree of peace now for a time and the guarded condition of the town will favour your escape  how so signor mordecai asked francisco it has hitherto been my belief as well as experience that a town in a state of siege was the reverse of favourable to anything implying freedom of action  thou art right friend returned jacob with a smile and that absence of freedom will keep the streets clear of all who might otherwise interrupt thee while as to the guarded corners my brother bacri knows a variety of passages above and under ground through which he will guide you past them to the city wall  then let us be gone without delay urged francisco for good sirs my neck has for some time past felt sundry twinges as though the bowstring were already around it  half an hour must elapse ere we can venture forth with safety said bacri  tis well that you have brought the knotted rope with you mariano knows how to use it  he will explain the mode of escape which you must follow while i hold private converse with my brother  so saying the kindly jew bowed his tall form to his friends with the air of a king and accompanied jacob mordecai into an inner room  at the end of the time specifiedwhich had appeared an age to the impatient triobacri returned to the skiffa with two coarse burnouses similar to the one worn by mariano  he directed francisco and lucien to put these on after exchanging their varied habiliments for the jacket short drawers and red fez or cap worn by moors of the middle class he then produced some brown ochre with which he stained their hands and their legs below the kneethese latter parts being usually uncovered in moors who did not belong to the wealthy classes  why not paint our faces too asked mariano amused at the figure they cut despite the dangers which rendered the disguise necessary  because neither the painting of your faces replied bacri nor the shaving of your headswhich latter would be essential to the converting of you into genuine moorswould constitute any disguise were your voices to be heard or your features to be scrutinised  you must be careful to pull the hoods of your burnouses well forward on your faces all that you can hope to gain by your costume is to avoid attracting the attention of any whom you should chance to meet or whom you may have to pass at a distance  if any one speaks to you after you reach the open country refuse to answer  if he should insist on it you must either run or fight for which latter purpose i provide you with these short swords which you will find better suited to your hands than the curved weapons of the turks  signor bacri said francisco examining the straight short weapon handed to him i thank thee for all thy kindness to me and my boys especially for these swords for assuredly unless thou canst also furnish me with a pair of young and active legs i am like to have more of fighting than running hereafter  however let us not waste more time in speech for as i have said my neck already itches most uncomfortably  in deference to franciscos anxiety to be out of the city which he was wont to style with great emphasis the pirates nest bacri hastened his preparations and soon led them to the roof of the house of jacob mordecai from which they scrambled to that of a friendly neighbour and crossed over with the care of burglars and the quiet steps of cats to the other side  here a difficulty met them in the shape of a leap which was too long for franciscos heavy person to venture  he might indeed have taken it with ease on level ground and in daylight but like his son mariano on a somewhat similar occasion he felt it difficult to screw up his courage to the point of springing across a black chasm which he was aware descended some forty or fifty feet to the causeway of the street and the opposite parapet on which he was expected to alight like a bird appeared dim and ghostly in the uncertain light  twice did the courageous man bend himself to the leap while the blood rushed with apoplectic violence to his bald head and twice did his spirit fail him at the moment of need  oh bacri he said in a hoarse whisper wiping the perspiration from his brow as he stood on the giddy height if there were only a damsel in distress on the opposite side or a legion of turks defying me to come on i could go over methinks like a rocket but to be required to leap in cold blood upon next to nothing over an unfathomable abyss really  hast never a morsel of plank about thee jacob  fortunately for all parties jacob had a flower stand on his roof to which he returned with mariano who wrenched a plank therefrom and brought it to the point of difficulty  after this they met with no serious obstruction  sometimes descending below the streets and passing through cellars at others crossing roofs or gliding along the darkest sides of dark walls and passages they traversed the town without being challenged and gained the southern wall near the point at which mariano had crossed it on a former occasion  here the jew bade them godspeed and left them  i hope thou art sure of the road mariano said francisco anxiously  trust me father i know it well  only have a care that you tread lightly and make no noisecome  leading them to the point on the ramparts where poor castellos head still stood withering in the nightwind mariano bade them remain in shadow while he attached the rope to the spike  the sentinel could be dimly seen for there was no moon pacing to and fro within two hundred yards of them  they watched and lay still while he sauntered towards them and glided noiselessly and quickly to the rope while his back was turned  thus one by one they descended the wall crossed the ditch ascended the slope on the other side without having been observed and ere long were safe among the rocks and fastnesses of the sahel hills    chapter eighteen  in which soles are beaten and men are soldwith plots and counterplots  comfortably ensconced in the palace of the deyselected by a majority of his comradesthe aga hamet proceeded to enjoy his high position and to exercise the authority of ruler of the pirate city  the day after his ascension of what we may call the dangerous throne he sent for hadji baba the storyteller  thou art a witty fellow it seems said the dey when baba made his appearance  so it has been said of me and so i once thought replied the jester humbly but i have come to doubt the worth of my own wit since it has led me to dwell in a palace  how so knave  what mean you  in truth i know not replied baba  my wit is scarce sufficient to make my meaning plain even to myself  only i feel that the brilliancy of the wit of those who dwell in palaces is too much for me  twere better methinks if i had remained on my shoemakers bench  twere indeed better for thee to have done so good fellow if thou canst say nothing better than that replied hamet angrily for he was a stupid as well as an ambitious man  lets have something better from thee else the bastinado shall drive sense from thy heels into thy head  nay then it is hard returned baba with a smile to be asked to talk sense when i was hired by thy late master  my late master roared the dey  surely i said my late master did i not returned hadji baba rubbing his forehead as if he were confusedas in truth the poor fellow was by the terrible scenes that had lately been enacted in the palace  as i meant to say thenit is hard for me to talk sense when my late master hired me expressly to talk nonsense  hm yes very true replied the dey looking wise  let me then hear some of thy nonsense  ah your highness that is easily done said baba with sudden animation  what shall be the subject of my discoursethe affairs of state  the dey nodded  let me then make a broad statement of a nonsensical kind which in its particular applications may be said to be endless  a throne won by treachery violence and bloodshed cannot stand long in  villain shouted the dey  nay i do but jest said baba with a look of simplicity  jest or no jest thou shalt smart for it cried the dey whose anger had been greatly rousedho seize him and give him the bastinado and afterwards bring him hither again  two chaouses who were in attendance in a neighbouring room at once entered and seizing the unfortunate storyteller hurried him down to an apartment in the palace which was reserved for punishments of various kinds including strangulation  here they stripped off babas embroidered shoes and white hose  we have long been fellowservants under this roof said hadji baba as they were about to begin  that is true replied one of the chaouses sternly  i shall be forgiven and depend on it thou shalt not be forgotten said baba quietly  the executioner who knew that the storyteller had been a man of influence and power in the previous reign hesitated  we have our orders hadji baba said he remonstratively and you know that it is as much as our lives are worth to fail in our obedience  i bid you not to fail in the performance of your duty but i counsel you to lay on lightly returned the jester with a grim smile  and how if the dey should expect to hear thy cries and afterwards to see thee limp into his presence asked the man in a tone of indecision  depend ont he shall both see and hear exclaimed baba with a laugh thinkest thou that my head is not equal to the saving of my feet  lay on lightly so that there may be somewhat to show but see thou dost not overdo it  i will engage to let the tyrant hear on the deafest side of his head and will limp into his presence with most unfeigned sincerity  well then i begin said the man applying a few strokes with a lithe rod to the soles of the jesters feet  baba was true to his word  he suddenly gave vent to a yell so appalling that the very executioner accustomed though he was to such sounds quailed for a moment and said anxiously  did i hit you too hard  hard echoed baba mingling a roar of laughter with his next yell fear not good comrade go on do thy dutyha hahooo  stop why it is worse than i had imagined he added as the man delivered a cut that was rather sharp  but go on cried hadji baba with another yell i must have something to show and he shall smart for it  he followed up this remark with a series of amateur shrieks and howls so terrible that the hardened chaouses being accustomed only to the genuine display of suffering were overcome and entreated him to desist  the excitement of the exercise the conflict of varied feelings the smarting of his soles the indignation of his soul and the absurdity of the deception had such an effect on hadji babas spirit that he experienced no difficulty whatever in limping like a confirmed cripple and trembling like an aspen leaf when led into the presence of the tyrant  ha exclaimed the dey i think i have cured thee  thou wilt talk no more nonsense i warrant  not a word your highness not a syllable exclaimed the jester falling on his knees as the executioners retired  even though your highness were to hold the reins of power with a hand of gentleness and benignity which i doubt not you will i would not repeat such nonsense for the world  gentleness and benignity laughed the dey catching at the words and paying little regard to what followed truly that were a novel feature in my character as thou knowest wellnow listen rascal as thy feet are in good walking trim i have an errand for thee  go tell sidi hassan that i want him and see thou find him quickly else another beating awaits thee  your highness shall be obeyed said the jester with a profound obeisance as he turned and limped out of the room  sidi hassan had left the service of the british consul without leave just before the insurrection and was seated in his own town mansion sipping a cup of coffee and conversing with rais ali when the message reached him  thou art but a cowardly fellow a weak villain after all said hassan to some remark of the interpreter  the man who plays fast and loose is sure to be brought low sooner or later  why not leave the british consuls service now that a chance offers  it will be to thy advantage for i can speak a good word for thee with the new dey  because said rais ali anxiously although i have not a sensitive conscience i cannot prevail on myself to betray my old master  very good said hassan continue to vacillate until thy head is shaken off  adieu  i must not keep his highness waiting  so saying he hastened to the palace congratulating himself on the expected fulfilment of the promises which the late aga hamet had so lavishly made to him  like many other sycophants sidi hassan had mistaken his man  the new dey was well aware that hassan was a turbulent ambitious character and thought that it would be best for his own interests to appoint him governor of a distant province of his dominions  like many other coarse though energetic characters hamet also mistook his man  he did not know that hassan would be content with nothing short of the position of second in command  when therefore he handed him with many compliments the paper containing his commission to the governorship of the province alluded to he was greatly surprised to behold his former friend fly into a violent passion tear the paper to pieces and fling it on the ground as he turned on his heel and left the room abruptly  so suddenly and vigorously was the act done that hamets wonted coolness failed him for a moment and hassan had passed out into the street before he gave orders in a voice of thunder to have him arrested and brought back  there is no doubt that in his present temper the dey would have had his late colleague strangled on the spot but fortunately for himself sidi hassan instead of returning to his own house went straight to the marina without having any definite object in view save that he thirsted for vengeance and meant to have it if possible  on his way down he met the sapient interpreter blindi bobi  well bobi he said making an effort to look calm any probability of a rising among the slaves  not much replied bobi in turkish shaking his head slaves dont like to have their heads cut off and their skin torn away in bits  true returned hassan smiling grimly  do you know where sidi omar is  there said blindi bobi in reply pointing to the individual in question and sidling rapidly away  something ails you methinks said omar with a keen glance as hassan approached  ay the new dey ails me returned hassan with a feeling of desperation for he felt that he was committing himself in thus speaking to one whom he knew to be his enemybut anger often leads men into unwise speech  has he deceived you asked omar with a quiet smile  truly yes  had i known him better he should not have had mine aid my party followed me not him  i could have led them otherwise and still can  it may not be too late said omar pointedly as he began to suspect that hassans thirst for revenge would carry him to any lengthare these sbirros in search of you he added on observing several of the officers of justice issue from the town gate  hassan turned pale  your regrets come too late said omar significantly  my hand and party said hassan quickly are with you sidi omar if if  step in here said the minister of marine pushing open a small sidedoor which led into his house  hassan obeyed the door was shut and he felt that he was now completely in the hands of one whom he had hitherto regarded with suspicion and dislike  of course the minister of marine understood this as well as himself but he was too wily to let him read his thoughts by his looks or words  hassan he said leading him into a small chamber in the seaward ramparts which was lighted by a very small and stronglybarred window you are safe from immediate danger  we may here talk over our plans for plans i at least have  the dey fears me too much as you know to permit me to remain here as minister of marine  he is also so savage and hasty that i do not expect him to restrain his hand for more than a day or two  but i do not mean to give him a chance  my friends are already in possession of the casba  already exclaimed hassan in surprise  ay and they hold other places besides  you and your party are of course doomed  hassan started to his feet  naywere doomed said omar with a smile but what you have said just now alters the case  give me your aid and that of your party and you shall have from me the post which hamet has failed to give you you know me to be a man of my word  whether hassan was much comforted by the last remark is a point of uncertainty but feeling that he was now entirely in omars power and knowing that although the soldiers whom he styled his party were not nearly numerous or influential enough to place him on the throne he willingly fell in with omars views  when do you strike he asked  tonight said omar  so soon  the sooner the better  come we have time to go together to the casba there thou wilt assemble thy chief men and in my presence give them instructions  you do not trust me said hassan reproachfully  i have trusted you with my secret and my life replied omar it is but fitting that thou shouldst give me some sure guarantee of thy friendshipthough i doubt it not  be it so said hassan as he rose and following the conspirator into the street hurried up to the citadel  when hamet dey issued the order to have sidi hassan arrested as already related hadji baba having returned to his wonted place in the lobby of the palace heard the order and being a bold man ventured into the audiencechamber after the dey had left it  there he found the pieces of the torn commission  picking them hastily up he retired to his own apartment put them together and very soon guessed the nature of the quarrel between his new master and sidi hassan  rightly concluding from the insolent violence of hassans exit and the extremity of the deys rage that the breach was irreparable and knowing that hassan was a man of some weight with the army he resolved to ascertain the views of that worthy and in the event of his designing mischief to aid him  with this end in view he hastened out to search for hassan but like the officers of justice failed for some time to find him  he met however with two of the searchers in the persons of the chaouses who had so recently administered the bastinado in a mild manner to himself  well met comrades he said with a nod we have no chance of finding sidi hassan i fear for when fools are abroad wise men stop at home  thou hadst better get thee home then retorted the executioner gruffly  not badly thrust said the jester laughing but have patience with me comrade  i am no fool today  for once in a way i mean to act the wiseacre  you seehere he became confidentialwhat the household of the palace may expect from our new master  i see nothing replied the man testily except that whatever master rules there is always plenty of work for me and my chum here to do and let me tell you master baba that i am no revolutionisti mind my own business  very good comrade returned baba lightly thou wilt play the fool today and change places with me  but bear in remembrance that a chaouse may have to be beaten as well as a jester and that it would not be difficult to find others to take thy place  i might even be tempted to do so myself in case of necessity  it would be a rare jest to have a chaouse beaten by a jester would it not  if it ever comes to that i hope you will prove grateful and lay on lightly returned the man with a grim smile  that will depend on thy behaviour  if thou art resolved to play the fool now i must of necessity be in earnest then  what mean you  this said baba with sudden gravity that those who stand by a falling man must een fall along with him  but hamet dey is not falling  he has only just risen said the chaouse with a perplexed look  he is not the first who has risen to fall replied hadji baba gravely i would not stand in his slippers for all the treasure in the casba be wise and take advice from a fool  sidi hassan did not quit the palace today to go and smoke his pipe  he is a man of power and a malcontent  there are other men of power who are also malcontents and more popular than hamet  when this is so it behoves the like of you and me to look carefully after our necks to say nothing of our soles  as he said this an exclamation from the elder chaouse drew his attention to the fact that sidi hassan himself had just turned the corner of the street in which they had been conversing and was at that moment so earnestly engaged in conversation with sidi omar that the two approached without at first observing the officers of justice  the instant hassans eye alighted on them he stopped and became visibly paler  omar also stopped but pretended not to observe the change in his companions countenance nor its cause as he continued the conversation  hist whispered hadji baba to his companions when enemies become sudden friends we should know how to act  it was evident from the look of anxiety and uncertainty depicted in the visage of the elder chaouse that he did not by any means know how to act  with the stern resolution of a bulldog nature however he suddenly made up his mind to do his duty  advancing quickly toward hassan he was about to lay hold of him when hadji baba stepped abruptly before him and said with an affable air and smile  his highness the dey has sent these good fellows to arrest sidi hassan and i have taken upon my own shoulders the weighty responsibility being as is wellknown a foolto offer our united services in the reversal of the decree by the arrestment of the dey instead  a bold jest good fellow and one that may cost thee thy life for the present dey understands not a jest  it is no jest returned baba with a keen glance at omar whom he knew to be a plotter in the state my soles tingle now with what they have already received and my thoughts tingle with what is yet to come  if you have need of friends in the palace here are twogood and true said baba turning to the chaouses who stood mute with amazement at the mans impudence and i am one which makes three according to the rules of arithmetic  if we are not wanted then these men must do their duty for sidi hassan is wanted and we may as well go blithely to our doom together  fellow said omar sternly dost know that i have power to have thee flayed alive without consulting thy master  nay not without consulting my master said baba bowing respectfully for my master is before me  in sooth thou art a very impudent knave returned omar smiling in spite of himself and were i the vile plotter thou imaginest i should be afraid of having such a changeable friend in the palace  am i changeable for preferring the kind master who was slain to him who slew him said baba simply  that is true hadji baba returned omar suddenly changing his tonesidi hassan fortune is favourable to us  we will trust these men  they dare not play us false even though they would because their own lives would be forfeitedhadji baba it may be well for thee to know that while we avail ourselves of thine aid and that of thy friends we are quite independent of it because it happens that the train is already laid and nothing that thou couldst do not even the instant alarm of the palace guards could prevent it from being fired i believe thee faithful but this information may help to increase thy fidelity  go and hark ee be very careful to have the guards well placed and looked after tonight at the hour of nine    chapter nineteen  describes an important event in the pirate city  madman exclaimed the elder chaouse after omar and hassan had left you have put the bowstring round our necks as well as your own  true answered baba with a bland smile and if we would not have it drawn tight we must een obey the commands of omar the dey  i suppose we must returned the chaouse gloomily but it is hard enough to be compelled to spend our days in strangling thrashing burning beheading flaying and tormenting other men without the addition of having our own necks put in jeopardy  the injustice attaching to themselves and their office seemed to weigh heavily for some time on the minds of both the executioners notwithstanding the sallies and remonstrances of hadji baba but before reaching the palace they had gone through the not difficult processto a turkof setting the whole matter down to the decrees of fate and washing their hands of all guilt  that evening as the hour for action drew nigh hadji baba and his colleagues began to grow rather uneasyall the more so that the dey was in a particularly bad humour  being an ignorant and uneducated man he had found the work of gathering up the reins of government a very difficult task notwithstanding the boldness of his heart and the determination of his will  true he had simplified several knotty matters by bastinadoing and cutting off the heads of all concerned but this left a multitude of matters which could not be disposed of in that summary fashion  among other things he had been thwarted in his resolution to get possession of angela diego whom he intended to have made a slave of the palace  finding that she had taken refuge with the british consul at his country house he sent a peremptory order to have the girl returned immediately and pending the result of that order had locked bacri up in a dungeon with threats of the bastinado and even death in the event of any difficulty being thrown in the way  after this he called for his coffee and pipe his tame gazelle chief executioners and storyteller resolving to throw the cares of state aside for the night and enjoy himself  it was nearly eight oclock when this order was given to the consternation of hadji baba and his confederates who were thus deprived of the power of rendering in the guardroom any assistance to the insurrectionists  there was however no alternativeobedience was imperative  sit down said the dey to the unfortunate jester when he entered the presence limping with much apparent difficulty  we will extend clemency to thee in the hope that thou wilt redeem thy character  i am fond of marvellous stories  thou mayest sit on that carpet  now look behind thee  hadji baba obeyed and observed his two friends standing mute and motionless like statues ready at a moments notice to do their masters bidding  knowest thou these men asked the dey  your highnesss slave knows them but too well replied baba with a wellfeigned shudder which changed into a real one on his observing that a gorgeous timepiece opposite pointed to the hour of eight  proceed then and acquit thee well else thou shalt come to know them still better ere long  thus admonished the storyteller cleared his throat wished intensely for a draught of water and taxed his fertile brain to the uttermost at last under a feeling of absolute desperation he began  once upon a time  the dey nodded as though he thought that not a bad beginning  once upon a time continued baba and then checking himselfyour highness wishes a very marvellous story i believe  yes very marvellous said the dey not quite pleased with the interruption  your highness shall have ita very marvellous story and what is more it shall be a true story  hadji baba said this with so much energy and fire that the dey again nodded his approval and sent two thin clouds of tobaccosmoke through his nostrils as he patted the gazelle which crouched at his feet resting its head on his knee and gazing affectionately at the tyrant with its magnificent eyes  once upon a time resumed the storyteller with sustained vigour and fluency as he glanced at the clock there was a poor shoemaker who dwelt in a certain town and was noted among his friends for his powers of song  one day the sultan of the country chanced to hear of this mans talent and sent for him to the palace  he was so pleased with him that he made him his chief musician  this shoemaker possessed magical gifts  villain exclaimed the dey didst thou not say that the story should be a true one  how can that be when thou speakest of gifts which do not and never did exist  your highnesss slave replied baba refers to those powers of legerdemain or pretended magic with which some men are gifted  go on returned the dey  well one day the shoemaker offered to amuse the sultan by mesmerising his guards  mesmerising interrupted the dey what is that  throwing them into a sleep your highness against their will  well  well the sultan did not believe him so he said if thou shalt put these guards into sleep against their wills i will give thee my daughter in marriage  the shoemaker was well pleased to hear this for the sultans daughter was virtuous and very beautiful  so he begged the sultan to order in his guards which he did  drawing them up in a line the man began at the first and made the passes or signs which are necessary to throw men into the mesmeric state  the first man winked very much and smiled a little but did not fall asleep  ha cried the sultan on seeing this thou art deceiving me it seems  not so your highness replied the shoemaker it is not every man who can be thus subdued  permit me to go on and i will find one who is susceptible  so the shoemaker went on and made the passes and signs which were necessary until at last he found one who at once fell asleep and then one after another they all fell asleep and no one could awake them except the shoemaker  i could not have believed this your highness said hadji baba if i had not been told it by the shoemaker himself who also taught me the mysterious power of thus throwing men in to sleep which in some languages is signified by the term throwing dust into their eyes  how exclaimed the dey dost mean to tell me that thou couldst really do as that shoemaker did and put my guards to sleep before mine eyes  your highnesss slave presumes to answer emphaticallyyes  by the beard of the prophet thou shalt prove it said the dey whose curiosity was arousedho there order the guard into my presence  hold exclaimed hadji baba they must appear absolutely unarmed  in order that men should be brought under the influence of this power it is necessary that they should divest themselves not only of all ordinary weapons but also of the defensive armour of commonsense  that is the reason why the exercise of the power is so difficult  but once accomplished the effect is unquestionable and very amazing  let them leave their arms behind them then said the dey only see that two are left to keep the gates  would it not be well suggested baba humbly that considering the recent riots more than two should be left to guard the palace gates it is true the more men that are brought under my influence the more likely is my influence to be effectual but these chaouses might for a few minutes supply their place  be it sothou hearest said the dey turning to his executioners  the chaouses went out as the men of the guard entered unarmed and drew up in a line before the dey  now show thy power hadji baba  your highness will i trust have patience for a few minutes said baba observing that the clock still indicated ten minutes short of the appointed hour while i perform the curious but necessary motions which are essential to a happy result  saying this he advanced to the first guard in the line and throwing himself into a vigorously picturesque attitude pointed with two fingers of the right hand at his eyes trembling violently the while as though he was exerting some tremendous but subtle energy  the first guardsman gazed at him in mute amazement but would as soon have cut off his own head as have objected to the operation in such presence  he opened his eyes very wide with surprise then looked at the points of babas fingers which caused him to squint horribly and finally smiled in spite of himself whereupon the thought of having been guilty of such undignified conduct caused him to turn deadly pale with terror all of which symptoms being regarded by the dey as indications of coming success were highly satisfactory  suddenly sweeping his hands in front of the mans face and making a noise with his feet to distract attention baba whispered shut your eyes if you would escape death and terminated the whole operation with a low growl  the terrified man instantly shut his eyes and baba proceeded to operate on the next  he had operated thus on about six of the men when there was heard a sudden crash and shouting in the guardroom  the disarmed guard at once made a rush towards the door but were driven back by the chaouses who sprang in and cut down two of the foremost with yataghans which were already bloodstained  traitor shouted the dey drawing his scimitar and leaping furiously on hadji baba but that worthy being as active with his body as his brain parried the cut with a cushion and running in on the dey seized him round the waist  it would soon have gone hard with him however hamet being a much more powerful man had not sidi omar with a band of his janissaries dashed in and secured him  but for enemies within thou hadst not overcome me thus easily said the dey bitterly as two of the soldiers held him fast while others bound his arms behind his back  very true hamet returned omar with quiet indifference of manner and now it remains with thee to choose thy death for that must be speedily accomplishedho there fetch the cup  a silver cup filled with poison was brought and presented to the unhappy hamet by his former friend sidi hassan  my undoing has been caused by leniency to dogs like thee said the dey with a dark scowl then clearing his brow and drawing himself up with dignity he turned to omar and added i decline to take part in mine own death  if i must die let me be led forth to the place of public execution  i would die as i have lived with my face to my foes and in the sight of my comrades  be it so we are ready returned omar let the torchmen lead the way  as omar truly said they were indeed ready for in a few seconds the front of the palace was lighted up with blazing torches a procession was formed and hamet was led forth to the babazoun gate and there strangled in the midst of an overawed and silent populace who probably cared very little as to which of the unruly turkish pirates who held them in subjection should misrule the unfortunate city  whether it was a touch of pity on the part of omar or the lateness of the hour we know not but from some cause or other hamet was spared the too common cruelty of being twice revived with a glass of water during the process before the final deed of strangulation was accomplished  thus was the undesirable throne of algiers again emptied and immediately afterwards sidi omar ascended itthe third dey within fortyeight hours    chapter twenty  describes a retreat among the hills  let us turn now good reader to a scene more congenialnamely the garden in front of the british consuls country residence  one evening two weeks after the event just narrated ted flaggan and rais ali chanced to meet at the gate  yeve got stirrin times of it here intirely  mister ally babby said the tar whose familiarity almost verged on impudence what betwane you an the 40000 thievesmore or lessin the town i find it rare entertainment  yoos complimentary dis marnin returned the interpreter

than that continued the seaman calmly scanning the seaward horizon as he filled his pipe  have ee heard that the dey omar has cut off the head of sidi hassan for nothin worse than a touch of imperliteness  no i not heers dat answered ali with a look of interest  is werry glad  glad why so  cos sidi hassan hims gib me reason to xpec hims cut off my hid soonerer or laterer  its my opinion said flaggan with a peculiar smile that if ye go cutting away at one another like that soonerer or laterer youll all be like the converse o the kilkenny cats and have nothin left of ee but your heads stickin on spikes above your gates and walls  praps so was alis complacent reply  at this point the conversation was interrupted by the sudden appearance of angela and her sister paulina who carried in her arms the little angelina  following them at some distance came the amiable zubby bearing aloft on her shoulderas being the place of greatest safety colonel langleys youngest hope  master jims backbone had not at that time attained sufficient stiffness to warrant the position but zubby never thought of that and master jim consequently complained in a series of yells and wry faces but zubby being ignorant of the state of his feelings did not mind that  master jim soon became purple in the visage but zubby looking up at him and supposing the effect to be the result of an unusual flow of spirits rather enjoyed that than otherwise  praps i may be excused for the observation said flaggan removing his pipe for a moment and gazing over paulinas shoulder but if that youngster aint being strangulated he looks oncommon  a scream from paulina as she rushed back and bestowed on zubby a box on the ear cut short the seamans observation  have i not told you again and again girl never to put the child on your shoulder  oh mim me forgit exclaimed the penitent zaharian  that will keep you in remembrance then said paulina giving her another slap  her own little one woke up at this point and crowed being too young we presume to laugh  oh signor flaggan said angela earnestly while her sister entered into converse with the interpreter have you heers yit bout de signors rimini  angela had already acquired a very slight amount of broken english which tumbled neatly from her pretty lips  whist cushla whist interrupted the seaman leading the girls slowly aside ye mustnt spake out so plain

nodded significantly  yes he is a dear man wen you go to his shop but hes as chape as the most libral christian wen hes wanted to go an do a good turn to any one  and yoo sure asked the girl with rekindled earnestness in her large black eyes dat all rimini safefrancisco an mar  ah all safemariano inclusive said the sailor with an intelligent nod  i sees how the land lies  depend on it that young feller aint likely to part with his skin without a pretty stiffish spurt for it  although much of flaggans language was incomprehensible to the pretty sicilian it was sufficiently clear to her sharp intelligence to enable her to follow the drift of his meaning she blushed as she turned away her head with a queenlike grace peculiarly italian and said  when yoo go hoffto seek  this werry

bright significant smile as she turned and called to the interpreter  ali who was rather fond of female society at once advanced with a bow of gracious orientality  com here ali yoo most xplain de flowers me bring hom yiserday  the polite moor at once followed the pretty italian leaving ted flaggan with her sister  youll excuse me maam if i bids you raither an abrup good marnin its business i have on me hands that wont kape nohow  leaving paulina in some surprise the blunt seaman put his hands in his pockets and went off whistling in the direction of algiers  turning aside before reaching the town he ascended the frais vallon some distance meeting with a few arabs and one or two soldiers none of whom however took much notice of him as his stalwart figure and eccentric bearing and behaviour had become by that time familiar to most of the inhabitants of the town  it was known moreover that he was at the time under the protection of the british consul and that he possessed another powerful protector in the shape of a short heavy bludgeon which he always carried unobtrusively with its head in the ample pouch of his peajacket  as he proceeded up the valley and gradually passing from the broad road which had been formed by christian slaves to the narrow path at its somewhat rugged head which had been made by goats he grew more careless in his walk and rollicking in his air  at last he began to smile benignantly and to address to himself a running commentary on things in general  youve got a fine time of it here all to yersilf mister flaggan  ah its little the dey knows what yer after me boy or its the last day yed have to call yer own  well now its more like a drame than anything i knows on  what wid turks an moors an jews an white slaves of every lingo under the sun i cant rightly make out to remimber which it iseurope asia afriky or amerikythat im livin in  never mind yer all right wid that blissid cownsl at yer back an this purty little thing in yer pokit  he became silent and seemed a little perplexed at this point looking about as if in search of something  coorious i thought it was here i left it but i niver had a good mimory for locality  och the number of times i was used to miss the way to school in ould ireland though i thravelled it so often and knowed it so well  surely an it wornt under this rock i putt it it must have bin under a relation  faix an it was  here ye are me hearty come alonghoop  saying this he gave a powerful tug at something under the rock in question and drew forth a canvas bag or wallet which had the appearance of being well filled  slinging this across his shoulder ted flaggan pursued his way moralising as he went until he came to a rugged hollow among the hills in which was a chaos of large stones mingled with scrubby bushes  here he paused again and the wrinkles of perplexity returned to his brow as he peered hither and thither  presently he observed a sharpedged rock which projecting upwards touched as it were the skyline behind it  moving to the right until he brought this rock exactly in line with another prominent boulder that lay beyond it he advanced for about fifty yards and then stopping looked cautiously round among the bushes  it must be hereabouts he muttered for the jew was werry partikler an bid me be partikler likewise seein that the hole is well hid an wan is apt to come on it raitherhah  suddenly poor ted fell headlong into the very hole in question and would infallibly have broken his neck if he had not happened to descend on the shoulders of a man who crouched at the bottom of the hole had been listening intently to the sound of his approach and who now seized his throat in a grip that was obviously not that of a child  the british tar was not slow to return the compliment with a grasp that was still less childlikeat the same time he gasped in much anxiety  howld on ye spalpeen its after yersilf ive come sure what wont ye let goeh  it was quite evident from the tightening of the grip that mariano had no intention of letting go for the good reason that not understanding a word of what was said he regarded the seaman as an enemy  feeling rather than seeing this for the hole was deep and dark flaggan was under the necessity of showing fight in earnest and there is no saying what would have been the result had not lucien suddenly appeared from the interior of a subterranean cavern with which the hole communicated  lucien understood english well and spoke it fluently  one or two of flaggans exclamations enlightened him as to the true character of their unexpected visitor  hold mariano he cried the man is evidently a friend  whats that yere saying cried flaggan looking up for he was still busy attempting to throttle mariano  i tell my brother that you are a friend said lucien scarce able to restrain laughter  faix then it dont look like it from the tratement i resaive at yer handshowsoever said the seaman relaxing his grip and rising while mariano did the same its well for you that i am  bacri sent me wid a few words o comfort to ee an some purvisions which i raither fear weve bin tramplin about in the dirt butno here it is he added picking up the wallet which had come off in the struggle all right an i make no doubt itll be of use to ee  but its a poor sort o lodgin yeve got here wouldnt it be better for all parties if we was to go on deck  not so said lucien with a smile as he fell in with the seamans humour  twere better to come to our cabin this is only the hold of our shipfollow me  so saying he went down on his hands and knees and disappeared in an impenetrably dark hole not three feet high which opened off the hole in which they stood  mariano pointed to it and motioned to the sailor to follow  arter you sir said ted bowing politely  mariano laughed and followed his brother and ted flaggan muttering something about its being the most strornar companion hatch hed ever entered followed suit  a creep of two or three yards brought him into a cavern which was just high enough to admit of a man standing erect and about eight or ten feet wide  at the farther extremity of it there was a small stone lamp the dim light of which revealed the figure of stout francisco rimini sound asleep on a bundle of straw wrapped negligently in his burnous and with a stone for his pillow  beside him stood an empty tin dish and a stone jar of the picturesque form peculiar to the inhabitants of the atlas mountains the sword given to him by bacri lay within reach of his halfopen hand  neither the scuffle outside nor the entrance of the party had disturbed the old man  my father is worn out with a fruitless search for food said lucien sitting down on a piece of rock and motioning to the seaman to do likewise  we can venture out in search of food only at night and last night was so intensely dark as well as stormy that we failed to procure anything  our water jar and platter are empty  then ive just come in the nick of time said flaggan proceeding to unfasten his wallet and display its muchneeded contents    chapter twenty one  social intercourse in the cavern  here you are cried the sympathetic irishman enlarging on the nature of the viands as he spread them temptingly before the hungry men heres food fit for a dey to say nothin of a month  heres a loaf aint itabout a fut an a half long an three inch thick  coorious to look at but a good un to eat i make no doubtthats a foundation for eethere cut im up an fire away ye cant listen properly to me discoorse till you git yer jaws to work  this here is a pie o some sort i shud say havin regard to the shape only that aint the sort o wittles a jew would send ee is it  praps its wildboar for ive seed no end o them critters in the market  maybe its lion for they do says theres lots o the king o beasts in the mountains hereabouts though i cant say ive heerd em roar yet  howsever wotever it is here it is so go aheadhallo exclaimed flaggan remonstratively as he cast a glance at the sleeping man beside him youve begun without the ould man  dont ee think it ud be but filiallike to wake him up an start fair  no well let him sleep on answered lucien as he began to eat with right goodwill in which he was ably seconded by his brother  my father needs rest quite as much as food at present  he shall eat when he awakes  well you knows best returned the seaman taking out his pipe and tobaccopouch its wan comfort anyhow that the wittles cant get colder than they be now and theres overmuch for ee to ait the whole consarn at one bout so the ould manll git his grub though i must own itd have liked to have seed im start fairhand over the glim plaise  lucien passed the small lantern to flaggan whose hard goodhumoured features were for a few seconds suffused with a ruddy glow as he put the light close to it and drew the flame vigorously into the bowl of his very black little pipe  then setting it down beside him he smoked in silence and in much satisfaction as he contemplated the hearty manner in which the young men enjoyed their meal  when he had finished lucien bowed his head for a few seconds in silent thanksgiving and mariano paused respectfully while he did so  then taking a long draught from the earthenware bottle the elder brother expressed his gratitude to the jew for the opportune relief  that seems to be good stuff to judge be the way ye smacked yer lips observed ted removing his pipe and wiping his mouth with the sleeve of his coat  try it said lucien handing him the bottle with a smile  got no smell remarked the tar as he put the bottle to his mouthwather he added contemptuously as he put it down and resumed the pipe  the best of drink for man and beast said lucien laughing  may be so returned flaggan shortly but i aint used to it  is it long since you came to this country asked lucien while he and mariano rolled up two of those neat little cigarettes with which the denizens of algiers at the present day are wont frequently to solace themselves  this question called forth from the seaman the greater part of his recent history in return for which lucien drawing forward the hood of his burnous and resting his elbows on his knees briefly related that of himself and his kindred  but why are you staying here since being a british subject you are free to go when you please asked lucien  bekaise answered flaggan it aint every day that a british ship calls in at this piratical nest and id raither go off in a manowar if i could manage it  theres a merchantman came into port yesterday im towld an the cownsl advised me to go away with it but it seems the turks have made some difficulty about her so ill wait  im in no hurry  the flaggans as a race have been noted since the time of adamif not earlierfor takin life aisy  then the flaggans must be nearly related to the arabs for they take life easier than any race i ever met with said lucien laughing  i shud doubt that cause theyre lazy and we ainttalkin o that sir said the seaman as a sudden thought struck him im towld that you are learned in lingos an histories could ye tell me who was the first people that got howld o this country cause im coorious to know having had a stiffish argiment on that pint with rais ali  he howlds that it was the moors an ive heerd say it was the arabs  you are both partly right replied lucien for the arabs were among the first conquerors of the land but you are wrong in supposing moors and arabs to be altogether different races  when the arabs came into the land some of them took to the plains inland and continued their wild wandering idle style of lifehalf predatory half pastoral others took up their abode on the coast became more mingled with the people of other seafaring tribes built towns and came at last to be known as mauri or moors from which the part of the land they dwelt in was known of old by the name of mauritania  but the aborigines continued lucien  the aborwhat sir asked flaggan removing his pipe  the aboriginesthe original inhabitants of the land  ah i see sir returned ted them as was at the werry beginnin just arter adam and eve like zactly sofire away  well im not quite sure replied lucien with a laugh that they came here immediately after the time of adam but at all events they came before the time of an authentic history for our earliest historians record the fact that before any other nation invaded the northern shores of africa the country was in possession of a very warlike race who although overcome and driven from the plains by the more civilised and betterarmed nations that successively attacked them remained in the fastnesses of the atlas mountains absolutely unconquerable and the descendants of these original inhabitants known as kabyles remain a free and independent people at the present day having successfully defied the might of romans vandals arabs and others since the beginning of time  see note 1  you dont say so sir remarked flaggan blowing a thin cloud of admiration into the air well an how did things git along arter the abridginal inhabitants was fust druv back into the mountains  they did not get along quite so quietly as might have been desired said lucien  the early history of the northern shores of africa now known as algeria he continued is involved in the mists of antiquity  arrah now dont misremimber said ted with a quiet grin that i aint bin edicated quite up to that  well the beginning of it all said lucien returning the grin with a smile is rather foggy  ah thats plain enough  heave ahead an whativer ye do steer clear o jawbreakers murmured the seaman  the region said lucien was first known as numidia and mauritania numidia being so named by the greeks who styled its wandering tribes nomads  they were pastoral in their habits and thievish in their propensities without laws or government worthy of the name  the mauri or moors devoted themselves to more settled pursuits became traders and inhabitants of towns and were a mixed race although originally springing from the same stock as the nomads or arabs  these were the early inhabitants who lived during the foggy period  the medes armenians and persians afterwards founded a colony and traded with the natives of the interior  then the phoenicians landed and began to build towns of which carthage founded bc 853 was the chief  the punic wars followed carthage the city of dido fell and mauritania was annexed to rome  for hundreds of years after this the country was a scene of frequent and bloody warfare in which many great historical names figured and many great armies were swept away to gratify human pride ambition and cupidity on the one hand and to defend hearth and home on the other until the roman power extended far and wide from the libyan desert to the atlantic and from the mediterranean to the zahara  near the time of our saviour bc 46 sallust was established by julius caesar as governor of numidia where he collected materials for his history of the jugurthine wars and at the same time enriched himself by the plunder of the now highly civilised and prosperous country  trust em theyre all sure to do that the haythens said ted whose pipe by its varying cloudlets became a pretty fair index to his feelings  roman remains are now to be found continued lucien all over the land even in the wildest regions of the atlas mountains although the romans utterly failed to subdue the hardy prehistoric natives of these mountains who rose against them at frequent intervals despite temporary defeats and successfully defied all the various races who assailed them  during this roman period the country was so well cultivated that it became and was styled the granary of the roman empire  christianity was also introduced and became so widespread that at one time there were no fewer than a hundred and sixty bishoprics in northern africa  unquestionably there were then as there always were and will be some who were imbued with the peaceloving spirit of christianity including among them such men as augustine tertullian and cyprianwhom i dare say signor flaggan you never before heard ofbut it cannot be doubted that a vast majority possessed nothing of our religion but the name for they constantly resorted to the most bitter warfare and violence to maintain their views  towards the decline of the roman empire boniface the proconsul revolted against the emperor valentinian  the latter asked the aid of genseric king of the vandals  genseric most willingly agreed went to africa with 90000 of his stalwart lighthaired barbarians of the north was joined by the natives and conquered the whole of barbary not for the romans but for himself  this was in the year 428 and the vandals held the land for a hundred years  the romans in the year 533 again invaded northern africa retook carthage and finally regained the country from the vandals but for only a short time for the moors constantly harassed them until the land became desert in many places owing to the decreasing population  then came the followers of mohammed about the year 645 from across the eastern deserts enforcing religion by their favourite means the sword and in half a century they swept completely over the land to the atlantic causing the crescent to supplant the cross  but the arabs did not stop here  about 711 they crossed over the sea and carried the crescent into europe under the bold and daring general tarick gebeleltarick from whom the spot where they landed came to be called gibraltar  hosts of moors followed the arab conquerors and the spaniards confounding them styled them all moors  barbary was for a long time after this under the rule of emirs appointed by the caliphs but they found little rest in africa for the berbers and others harassed them continuallyit would weary you to go over the whole history of the wars and disputes which tore the wretched country to pieces during hundreds of years after this but it may interest you to know that this city of algiers was founded in the year 944 by ziri governor of aschir who established a hereditary throne for his race  but his dynasty came to an end in course of time and so did that of others  race rose against race and tribe against tribe conquering and reconquering only a few of the coast towns being able to maintain their position as independent powers and supporting themselves by piracy  by degrees the pirates of the barbary coast began to be very formidable and daring insomuch that from time to time various nations sent expeditions against them with more or less success but without materially checking their depredations  they were greatly strengthened in numbers at the time of the expulsion of the moors from spain  an expedition was fitted out against them by ferdinand in 1501 and in 1505 the spaniards made themselves masters of some of the chief barbary towns including algiers  about this time two famous pirates ravaged the coasts of the mediterraneanthe brothers barbarossa sons of a fisherman  they were ambitious scoundrels and aimed at a throne  an opportunity ere long presented itself  the algerines invited them in 1510 to come and free them from the spanish yoke  they went gladly defeated the spaniards and then the elder barbarossa proclaimed himself king after beheading hassan another famous corsair killing the king and committing fearful excesses on the inhabitants  this villain was slain by the men of an expedition sent against the algerines by charles the fifth but the turks made his brother hayradin king in his stead  in 1518 hayradin barbarossa sought recognition by the sultan of turkey  he was made pasha and from that time till now algiers has remained a nominal dependency of turkeya pest to the civilised world and a disgrace to humanity  well now observed ted flaggan knocking the ashes out of his pipe and refilling it there are more surprisin things in the history of this here world than i was aware of  its my unwarnished opinion  the expression of the seamans opinion was here cut short by the sudden awakening of the elder rimini who immediately sat bolt upright and stared at the stranger with eyes like those of an owl in sunshine  lucien hastened to explain and to spread the food sent by bacri before his father  feeling sensations like those of a starved wolf francisco merely smiled nodded and shook hands with the sailor and then seizing the remains of the loaf and the porkwildboar or lion pie commenced with infinite gusto to his unexpected meal    note 1  this held true of the kabyles until they were conquered disarmed and completely subdued by the french who now hold possession of their land    chapter twenty two  shows how the pirates were wont to treat men of note  when his hunger was appeased francisco rimini turned to ted flaggan and asked him through lucien to go over again in detail the course of action which bacri advised him and his sons to adopt in order to effect their escape out of the country  for said he with emphasis im neither a lion nor a rabbit and cannot therefore make up my mind to spend the rest of my days in a hole  we will spare the reader mister flaggans repetition of the details referred to merely remarking that they embraced careful directions as to when and where a boat would be found on the coast ready to carry them out to sea and that they contained many earnest cautions to be wary as nothing short of death by slow torture would be their fate if recapturedthis being their second attempt at escape  meanwhile circumstances were transpiring which gave a new turn to the state of affairs in the pirate city  we have elsewhere remarked on the amazing fact that the great powers of europe and america tolerated the system of barefaced piracy which was carried on by the algerines against all nations that did not pay them blackmail but it must not be supposed that this disgraceful submission was the result of fear or of indifference  the truth is that the great powers were so busily engaged in throttling each other that they had no time to give proper attention to the algerine wasps that stung them and the wasps themselves were so besottedly ignorant of european affairs and of their own relative insignificance so puffed up indeed by their supposed greatnessa delusion which was shamefully fostered by the action towards them of the great powers themselvesthat they wilfully proceeded to extremities which a very little knowledge of other nations would have convinced them was the certain way to bring about their own ruin  the immense sums raised year after year by various european nations and given to the pirates for the redemption of thousands of christian slaves proved that they were not indifferent to the scourge of the mediterranean  see note 1  but in the midst of this disgraceful forbearance of the nations there was an occasional growl from one and another and a fierce sideglance at the wasps which might have let them see that their nest was in danger  for instance in 1804 admiral nelson menaced the town with a large fleet and not long afterwards the americans absolutely declined to pay their blackmail and sent a squadron to procure or if need were to compel a favourable treaty of peace with the algerines  other clouds arose here and there and overhung the doomed city but the infatuated pirates remained blind as bats and insolent as monkeys  thus matters stood when the dey omar ascended the throne and for some time afterwards  one morning the english consul was summoned to attend the divan of the dey in connexion with a vessel which had lately been brought in as a prize by one of the algerine corsairs  the consul had previously presented himself at courtas did all the other consulsto pay his respects to the new dey and on a subsequent occasion had made an effort to press a point which had always been a matter of deep interest with him namely the bringing about of peace between the algerines and the portuguese  there were many portuguese slaves in the town and neighbourhood at the time and several officers of that country dwelt there exempt from the duty of labouring like beasts of burden at the works on the walls and about the harbour solely in virtue of annual tribute being paid by their friends  the former dey achmet had declined to oblige his friend colonel langley by making peace with portugal on the ground that he could not forego the advantages resulting from a state of warfare  the new dey omar was still less capable of being influenced by considerations of humanity  what would you have he said when colonel langley spoke to him on the subject my people are brigands and i am their chief  if i make peace with portugal it will be absolutely necessary that i should declare war with america merely to keep my people employed  this was at all events candid and the consul felt that it would be vain to press the matter he had so much at heart as long as omar occupied the throne  on his way down to the marina where the divan referred to was to be held he met blindi bobi looking rather disconsolate  having an hour or more to spare he resolved to have a chat with him  well bobby my boy said the consul kindly for the eccentric interpreter was a favourite you seem sad  nothing wrong i hope  not wi me nohow responded bobi shaking his head  nuffin never wrong wi me  always too well  health to the mastheadmore nor i knows wat to do wid  wishes i could die i dosometimes  i grieve to hear that said the consul earnestly for he saw that the man was in no jesting humour  let me know what distresses you  sidi cadua said bobi  what the father of poor ashweesha widow of my late friend achmet dey said the consul  yis  hush  omar deyde divl growled bobi in a low tones gits the berry stones to listen an reports wat peepil say  never fear returned the consul smiling they dare not report what i say  come tell me about it  oh it shockable said bobi  come an see  so saying the poor man hurried off in the direction of a lowlying part of the town closely followed by the consul  here seated on a plain mat in an empty cellar which was destitute of furniture and almost of light they found the father of the late sultana  his gentle kindly spirit seemed like his frail old body to be bowed to the very dust  my dear friend exclaimed the consul almost overwhelmed with grief at the sight has the villain robbed you of all your wealth  he has replied the old man taking the consuls proffered hand and pressing it warmly but he has done worse than that  what has he dared to  sidi cadua interrupted and answered the question by quietly removing the lower part of his robe and exposing his feet which were dreadfully swollen and scarred with the bastinado  even that is not the worst of it said the old man recovering his mutilated feet my daughter my sweet tender ashweesha has been cruelly bastinadoed for  he broke down here and covering his face with his withered hands groaned aloud  for a few moments colonel langley could not speak  but why he said at length why such cruelty  recovering himself sidi cadua slowly related the circumstances  an enemy he said had accused him to the dey omar of having hidden away a large amount of treasure and he had been put to the torture in order to force him to disclose the truth but the truth was that he had never concealed treasure and had no confession to make  believing that his silence was the result of sheer obstinacy and that the truth might perhaps be extorted from his daughter the cruel monster had the gentle ashweesha dragged from her apartments and subjected to the bastinado  dreadful exclaimed the consul  where is she now  sidi cadua silently pointed to a ragged old burnous in a dark corner of the little cellar under which a human form lay crouched up and motionless  not dead asked the consul anxiously  no not dead replied the old man with an upward glance of gratitude  sidi cadua exclaimed the consul rising hastily excuse my leaving you now  i have to attend the divan  you shall hear from me soon youyoulooking roundhave no other house than thisno food  nothing said the old man in a low voice as his white head sank on his bosom  listen my man said the consul earnestly as he hastened down to the marina  yis signor answered bobi  can you find time to go out to my house just now  yis signor  then gogo as fast as legs or horse can carry you  see my wife tell her what we have seen let her send rais ali into town with other servantsseparately not to attract attentionwith basketsfull baskets you understand  yis signor full to bustin answered bobi with glittering eyes  full as they can hold of all that is needfulshe will understand thatthere be offlose no time said the consul thrusting a quantity of silver into the mans hand  kurnul langley said bobi with enthusiasm glowing in his solitary eye as he turned to go youby the beard of the prophetyoure the ace of trumps  with this strong if not elegant expression of his sentiments the sympathetic bobi hurried away and colonel langley entered the divan where were assembled the dey and the chief officers of state  the discussion on that occasion was conducted warmly for the pirates believed that they had made a good and legitimate prize in the shape of a greek vessel which was owned by a mr and mrs de lisle who with their little son were also captured  colonel langley claimed these as british subjects and the vessel as british property  in this case the pirates had taken a precaution which they had hoped would save them all trouble  on boarding the vessel they had demanded all mr de lisles papers and passports which when delivered up were torn into atoms and thrown into the sea  thus they sought to destroy all evidence of the nature of the prize  mr de lisle was a native of guernsey and therefore an english subject early in life he had entered a commercial house in holland and been naturalised there  afterwards he was sent to a branch of the same house in naples which at that time was occupied by the french  amassing considerable property he resolved to return to his native land and hired a greek vessel as being a neutral one to convey him  on his way he fell into the hands of the algerines  at the divan the british consul claimed that mr de lisle and his family and property should be delivered up to him  the turks with whom colonel langley was out of favour now that his friend achmet was dead were furious  how could he be an englishman they said when it was wellknown that the french would not have permitted one of their chief enemies to remain at naples  and besides added omar with a touch of sarcasm where are his papers to prove that what he says is true  the consul had made his demand with unusual firmness and dignity for the memory of poor sidi cadua was strong upon him but this latter remark somewhat perplexed him  fortunately at the moment de lisle himself who was present started up and said in english across the divan  if i am permitted to go on board my vessel i can still bring satisfactory evidence of my nationality  the turks were extremely unwilling to concede this but when the consul turned and said to the dey i trust your highness will not refuse so reasonable a request he was permitted to go  in a short time he returned with the certificate of his marriage which proved that he had been married in guernsey and was a british subject to the inexpressible rage of the divan who were compelled however to give in  nevertheless monsieur le console said the dey sternly if it shall be proved even twenty years hence that you were wrong in this matter you shall have to answer for it  from that time the british consul and the dey became open enemies which was a matter of gratulation to the consuls of some of the other powers who had been rather jealous of colonel langleys influence with the late dey achmet  not long afterwards they would have been glad if his influence could have been restored for omar being soured by what had occurred at the divan as well as by many other things that crossed his imperious will commenced to act in such an outrageous manner that the various consuls felt not only their independence but their lives in jeopardy  sending for the danish consul one morning omar told that unfortunate man that his government had already been warned more than once to pay the tribute which was past due and that he was going to stand their neglect no longer  he therefore ordered him to be put in chains and sent forthwith to work in the stonequarries  the order was at once obeyed  a chaouse at a signal from the dey seized the danish consul by the waistband thrust him out of the palace and along the streets to the bagnio there loaded him with chains and led him forth to work with the slaves  the consternation of the other consuls was of course extreme  the instant colonel langley heard of it he ordered his horse and galloped into town accompanied by rais ali and ted flaggan the latter having constituted himself a sort of extra aidedecamp or special attendant of the consul in order to gratify the more easily an insatiable thirst for knowledge as to all that took place around him  they went direct to the residence of the danish consul where they found his poor wife and children in the deepest grief and alarm at what had occurred for it had been reported to them that omar had said he would order the wife and children of the danish consul to be put up for sale in the public slavemarket if the tribute due by denmark were not paid without further delay  trust me madam said the colonel with indignation we shall not suffer this barbarian to carry out his threats and we will moreover see instant justice done to your husband  hastily writing several notes requesting a meeting with his brother consuls in the residence of the dane he despatched them by his two satellites and very speedily the whole were assembled  gentlemen said colonel langley after some conversation it is imperative that we should act at once unitedly and with decision anything like vacillation at such a crisis will encourage these barbarians to proceed to extremities which may end in our ruin  need i call to your remembrance the recent case of the unhappy dutch consul who had dwelt twentythree years in this city and who although an old and infirm man was loaded with irons of sixty pounds weight and marched out to labour with the other slaves from which treatment he soon after diedall forsooth because his government had delayed to send the accustomed annual present to the dey at the appointed time it concerns us all gentlemen that we should act promptly  we must proceed in a body at oncewithin this hourto the palace and demand that our brother consul shall instantly be set at liberty  for this purpose if you agree with me we must elect one of our number to be spokesman  at this point the other consuls interrupted the colonel by begging him to accept the office and to lead them out at once  i accept it with pleasure said the colonel turning to rais ali who stood at his elbowrais you will accompany me to interpret  oh monsieur exclaimed rais who had not many minutes before been boasting to his friend flaggan that he was a brave english tar as good as himself but who now turned very pale oh no no  please monsieur demand me not to go dis time for interprit  for certain the dey hims kill mehims kill all of us  well then rais replied the colonel somewhat amused at the mans undisguised terror we shall all die together and you will at least have the comfort of falling in goodly company  but master supplicated rais is not a turk me dare not defy the dey to hims visage  is only a craulie  by which the unhappy man meant to explain that he was only the son of a turk by an algerine mother and that as such he could expect no mercy if he aided in bearding the dey in his den but the colonel was inexorable and poor rais ali was obliged to submit  at this time the english and french being at war there existed a somewhat natural feeling of estrangement between the representatives of the two nations at algiers  colonel langley thought the present a good opportunity to effect a better understanding between them  he therefore offered his arm to the french consul who accepted it politely though with feelings of surprise  thus they walked out two and two into the street and marched down the principal thoroughfare across the great square and straight into the palace  the amazement of the algerines at this sight was great for they were well aware of the bad feeling which had for many years existed between the leading couple in this little procession or rather between their predecessors some of whom had taken undignified not to say disgraceful methods of displaying their jealousy  allah exclaimed the algerines turning up their eyes the english and french consuls walking together  surely the old prophecy is about to come true when christians are at peace among themselves the downfall of algiers is decreed  it is said that there really does exist a very old prophecy to this effect among the mussulmans of algeria and certain it is that the prophecy was ultimately fulfilled but at the time of which we write it was only anticipated  demanding an immediate audience the party were admitted into the presencechamber where they created feelings of great surprise in the breasts of the pirateking and his piratical courtiers  when rais ali had tremblingly translated the demand which had been made with stern dignity by his master the dey flew into a towering rage and actually foamed at the mouth as he replied  why art thou not glad that i thus punish your old enemy  was not england lately at war with denmark  i am not glad answered the british consul because it is against the spirit of christianity to cultivate feelings of revenge and the fact that we were not long since at war with denmark is no doubt the very reason why the danes have found it difficult to pay at the exact time the debt which they will unquestionably discharge before long but if your highness continues to act thus to their representative in despite of his inviolable character and in defiance of treaties wherein it is specified that the persons and families of consuls are to be held sacred you may rest assured that no civilised nation will continue to treat with you  what care the deys of algiers for the persons of consuls which you deem so sacred said omar savagely  hast thou not heard that in time past we have blown the consuls of refractory nations from the months of our cannon  i have replied the colonel calmly and i have also heard that algiers has been several times bombarded and nearly reduced to ashes i do not presume to use threats to your highness added the consul firmly though respectfully but i am here as spokesman of these representatives of various powers to assure you that if you do not release the consul of denmark immediately we will all write to our respective governments to send vessels of war to remove us from a court where the law of nations is not respected  omar attempted to bluster a little more but had sense enough to perceive that he had already gone too far and at length consented to grant the consuls demands  the condemned consul was immediately set at liberty and his brethren returned to his residence in the same manner as they had left it with this difference that the french and english consuls walked in front with the representative of denmark between them  this incident as may be imagined did not improve omars temper immediately after it he issued some stringent decrees in reference to the slaves and ordered the execution of six chief men of the state whose presence in the city had been a source of danger to the consolidation of his power  among other things he made some stern laws in reference to runaway slaves and having his attention drawn to the fact that the scrivanogrande of the late achmet and his assistant secretary had not yet been discovered he not only ordered the search for them to be continued with increased diligence but took the unusual method of offering a reward to any one who should find or bring news of them  this caused the matter to be widely talked about and among others who heard of the proclamation was a little moorish girl named ziffa  now this ziffa was the only daughter of hadji baba the court storyteller who like the vicar of bray managed to remain in office no matter who should come into or go out of power  we are sorry to have to record the fact that ziffa was a bad childa particularly naughty little girl  she told lies and was a little thief besides being fond of that despicable habit styled eavesdropping she listened behind doors and curtains and at keyholes without feeling a particle of shame  it is probable that the childs attention would not have been arrested by the proclamation of the dey if it had not chanced that during a visit which she was asked to pay to the garden of the british consul for the purpose of playing with agnes langley she overheard rais ali and ted flaggan mention the name of lucien rimini the seaman had found it necessary to take rais into his confidence and little ziffa in the exercise of her disgraceful vocation of eavesdropper had overheard a little of their conversation about the riminis  she did not however hear much and having no interest in the riminis forgot all about it  on hearing the proclamation however she bethought her that something might be made out of the matter if she could only manage to get her little friend agnes to play the part of spy and find out about things for her  opportunity was not long wanting  she had an engagement that very day to go out to the consuls garden to spend the day with agnes and a faithful old negro servant of her father was to conduct her thither  ziffa was extremely fond of finery  just as she was about to set out her eye fell on a splendid diamond ring which lay on her fathers dressingtable  hadji baba was very fond of this ring as it had been a gift to him from achmet his former master and he never went abroad without it but a hasty summons to the palace had on this occasion caused him to forget it  as it was made for the little finger of hadji baba which was remarkably thin it exactly fitted the middle finger of ziffa which was uncommonly fat  seizing the ring she thrust it into her bosom resolving to astonish her friend agnes  then running downstairs to the old servant she was soon on her way to the consuls garden  agnes she said on finding herself alone with her friend i want you to do something for  oh what a lovely ring exclaimed agnes as ziffa drew it out of her breast and put it on  yes isnt it pretty  but i must not let my old servant see it lest he should tell my father whod be very angry if he knew i had taken it  agnes was taken by surprise and remained silent  she had been so carefully trained to tell her father and mother everything and to trust them that it was a new and disagreeable idea to her the thought of doing anything secretly  well this is what i want continued ziffa i want you to listen to the talk of rais ali and the sailor who lives with you when they dont know you are near and tell me all that they say about a family named riminiwill you  oh i cant do that said agnes decidedly it would be wrong  what would be wrong asked mrs langley coming out from a sidewalk in the garden at that moment to fetch the children in to lunch  agnes blushed looked down and said nothing  her mother at once dropped the subject and led them into the house where she learned from agnes the nature of her little friends proposal  take no further notice of it dear said her mother who guessed the reason of the childs curiosity  leaving the friends at lunch in charge of paulina ruffini she hastened to find ted flaggan whom she warned to be more careful how he conversed with his friend rais  what puzzles me maam said ted is how did the small critter understand me seein that shes a moor  that is easily explained we have been teaching her english for some time i regret to say for the purpose of making her more of a companion to my daughter who is fond of her sprightly ways  i knew that she was not quite so good a girl as i could have wished but had no idea she was so deceitful  go find rais ali at once and put him on his guard said mrs langley as she left the seaman and returned to the house  now if there ever was a man who could not understand either how to deceive or to guard against deception or to do otherwise than take a straight course that man was ted flaggan and yet ted thought himself to be an uncommonly sharp deceiver when occasion required  having received the caution above referred to he thrust his hands into his coatpockets and with a frowning countenance went off in search of rais ali  marinerlike he descried him afar on the horizon of vision as it were bearing down under full sail along a narrow path between two hedges of aloes and cactus which led to the house  by a strange coincidence agnes and her friend came bounding out into the shrubbery at that moment having finished their brief luncheon and ziffa chanced to catch sight of the stout mariner as he hastened to meet his friend  with the intuitive sharpness of an eastern mind she observed the fact and with the native acuteness of a scheming little vixen she guessed that something might turn up  acting on the thought she shouted  wait a little agnes i will hide you shall find me  innocent agnes obediently waited while ziffa ran down the wrong side of the cactus hedge and kept up with the seamana little in rear of him  ho  ally babby shouted ted flaggan when he was within hailit might be a hundred yards or soof his friend what dee think that little brownfaced chip of hadji baba has been up here eavesdropping and has got to windward of us amost  leastwise she knows enough o the riminis to want to know morethe dirty little spalpeen  thank you thought ziffa as she listened  when flaggan had varied his remarks once or twice by way of translating them rais ali shook his head  that bad said he ver bad  we mus be tremendous cautious ziffas a little brute  ha thought ziffa  you dont say so observed flaggan  well now id scarce have thought we had reason to be so fearful of a small thing with a stupid brown face like that  brute muttered ziffa inaudibly  oh she werry sharp chile returned rais werry sharpgot ears and eyes from the sole of hers head to de top of hers feets  ziffa said nothing either mentally or otherwise but looked rather pleased  well continued rais we wont mention the name of rimini again nowharsonly wen we cant help it like  not a whisper said flaggan but be the way itll be as well before comin to that state of prudent silence that you tell me if the noo hole theyve gone to is near the owld wan  you see its my turn to go up wi provisions tomorrow night and i haint had it rightly explained dye see  here rais ali described with much elaboration the exact position of the new hole to which the rimini family had removed at the head of frais vallon and mademoiselle ziffa drank it all in with the most exuberant satisfaction  shortly afterwards agnes langley found her friend hiding close to the spot in the garden where she had last seen her  that night hadji baba made an outrageous disturbance in his household as to the lost diamond ring and finally fixed with the sagacity of an unusually sharp man on his old negro as being the culprit  next morning he resolved to have the old man before the cadi after forenoon attendance at the palace  while there he casually mentioned to omar the circumstance of the theft of his ring and asked leave to absent himself in the afternoon to have the case tried  go said omar gravely but see that thou forget not to temper justice with mercyby the way tell me friend hadji before thou goest what was the meaning of that strange request of thine the other day and on which thou hast acted so much of late  the storyteller turned somewhat pale and looked anxious  the strange request referred to was to the effect that the dey should give him no more gifts or wages in regard to both of which he was not liberal but that instead thereof he hadji baba should be allowed to whisper confidentially in the deys ear on all public occasions without umbrage being taken and that the dey should give him a nod and smile in reply  omar who was a penurious man had willingly agreed to this proposal and as he now remarked baba had made frequent use of the license  pardon me your highness said baba may i speak the truth without fear of consequences  truly thou mayest replied the dey and it will be well that thou speakest nothing but the truth else thou shalt have good reason to remember the consequences  well then your highness returned baba boldly feeling that my income was not quite so good as my position at court required and desiring earnestly to increase it without further taxing the resources of your highnesss treasury i ventured to make the request which i did and the result has beenhas beenmost satisfactory  blockhead exclaimed the irritable dey that does not explain the nature of the satisfaction  your slave was going to add said hadji baba hastily that my frequent whispering in your ear and your highnesss gracious nods and smiles in reply have resulted in my being considered one of the most influential favourites in the palace so that my good word is esteemed of the utmost value and paid for accordingly  omar laughed heartily at this and hadji baba much relieved retired to have his case tried before the cadi taking his daughter with him for she had assured him that she had seen the old servant take it  the old servant pleaded not guilty with earnest solemnity  are you quite sure you saw him take the ring demanded the cadi of ziffa  quite sure replied the girl  and you are sure you did not take it he asked of the negro  absolutely certain answered the old man  and you are convinced that you once had the ring and now have it not he said turning to hadji baba  quite  the case is very perplexing said the cadi turning to the administrators of the law who stood at his elbow give the master and the servant each one hundred strokes of the bastinado twenty at a time beginning with the servant  the officers at once seized on the old negro threw him down and gave him twenty blows  they then advanced to hadji baba and were about to seize him when he cried out  beware what thou doest  i am an officer of the deys palace and may not be treated thus with impunity  the cadi who either did not or pretended not to believe the statement replied sententiously  justice takes no note of personsproceed  the officers threw baba on his face and were about to proceed when ziffa in alarm advanced with the ring and confessed her guilt  upon this the cadi was still further perplexed for he could not now undo the injustice of the blows given to the negro  after a few minutes severe thought he awarded the diamond ring to the old servant and the two hundred blows to the master as being a false accuser  the award having been given the case was dismissed and hadji baba went home with smarting soles resolved to punish ziffa severely  spare me said ziffa whimpering when her father seizing a rod was about to begin  nay thou deservest it cried baba grasping her arm  spare me repeated ziffa and i will tell you a great secret which will bring you money and credit  the curiosity of the storyteller was awakened  what is it thou hast to tell  promise me father that you wont punish me if i tell you the secret  i promise said baba but see that it is really something worth knowing else will i give thee a severer flogging  hereupon the false ziffa related all she knew about the hidingplace of the rimini family  her father immediately went to the palace related it to the dey and claimed and received the reward  that night a party of soldiers were sent off to search the head of frais vallon and before morning they returned to town with francisco and his two sons whom they threw into their old prison the bagnio and loaded them heavily with chains    note 1  it is said that the treasure in algiers about the end of that century amounted to 4000000 pounds most of which was paid by other governments to purchase peace with the algerines    chapter twenty three  in which danger looms very dark in and around the pirate city  about this time four vessels entered the port of algiers  one was a french manofwar with a british merchantman as a prize  the other was an algerine felucca with a sicilian brig which she had captured along with her crew of twenty men  there were a number of men women and children on board the frenchmans prize all of whom when informed of the port into which they had been taken were thrown into a state of the utmost consternation giving themselves up for lostdoomed to slavery for the remainder of their livesfor the piratical character of the algerines was wellknown and much dreaded in those days by all the maritime nations  newspapers and general knowledge however were not so prevalent then as now and for a thousand englishmen of the uneducated classes who knew that the algerines were cruel pirates probably not more than two or three were aware of the fact that england paid tribute to algiers and was represented at her court by a consul  the crew of the prize therefore were raised from the lowest depths of despair to the highest heights of extravagant joy on hearing that they were free and their gratitude knew no bounds when the consul sent ted flaggan and rais ali to conduct them from the marina to his own town residence where beds and board attendance and consolation were hospitably provided for them  we might add with truth that they were also provided with amusement inasmuch as ted flaggan allowed the effervescence of his sympathetic spirit and wayward fancy to flow over in long discourses on algerine piracy and practice in general in comparison with which the arabian nights is tameness itself  with the poor sicilian captives however the case was very different for the felucca which brought them in brought also a report that the sicilian government had behaved very brutally to some algerines whom they had captured  the immediate result was that all the sicilian captives then in algeria were ordered to be heavily ironed and put to the severest work at the quarries and on the fortifications while some of the most refractory among them were beaten to death and others were thrown upon the large hooks outside the townwall or crucified  to the latter death francisco rimini and his sons were condemned and it is certain that the sentence would have been carried into immediate effectfor legal processes among the pirates were short and judicial action was sharphad not an event occurred which arrested for a brief period the hand of piratical justice  this event was the arrival of a sicilian priest who was commissioned to treat for the exchange of prisoners and the ransom of a certain number of sicilian slaves  the ransom of these slaves varied much according to their position but a very common price demanded and paid was from 200 pounds to 400 pounds sterling  of course noblemen bankers wealthy merchants etcetera were rated much higher than others but not too high to render their ransom impossible for the algerines were adepts at this species of traffic having been engaged in it more or less for several centuries  as the settlement of these ransoms and the ascertaining as to who were the fortunate ones whose friends had succeeded in raising the necessary funds required time the execution of the riminis and other sicilians was as we have said delayed  when paulina and her sister heard of the arrival of the priest they flew into each others arms never doubting that the husband of the former must have at last raised the required sum for their ransom but on being reminded that the priest was commissioned to redeem only captives of sicily they sat down and relieved themselves by giving way to floods of tears  paulina however soon comforted herself by kissing her baby and angela consoled herself with the reflection that at all events mariano and his father and brother would be ransomed which she naturally argued would enable the first to move heaven and earth in order to effect the ransom of herself and sister also  she did not know poor girl of the dreadful fate to which her lover was already doomed for the consul although aware of it could not prevent it and had not the heart to tell her  previous to this event the british consul had endeavoured to use his influence to bring about peace between the algerines and sicilians but the former having no desire for peace made the terms such as could not be agreed to namely that the sicilians should pay them 450 pounds before any negotiations for peace should be entered on  the rejection of this proposal did not of course facilitate the arrangements that were now being made and when omar demanded that in cases of exchange of prisoners two algerines should be returned for each sicilian slave set free it was seen that the prospect of a speedy termination of hostilities was not bright  after some days spent in useless discussion the worthy priest was obliged to return home without accomplishing his mission  one good result however followed  those captives who had been condemned to death and for whom ransoms had been offered were reprieved nevertheless they were treated with cruel severity  of course the unfortunates for whom no ransom had been offered were treated with the utmost rigour and the sentences of such as had been condemned to die were ordered to be carried out  in the case of poor mariano the sentence was altered for that headstrong youth had in his despair made such a fierce assault on his jailers that despite his chains he had wellnigh strangled three of them before he was effectually secured  he was therefore condemned to be buried alive in one of the huge square blocks of concrete with which the walls of a part of the fortifications were being strengthened  see note 1  while these things were pending very different scenes were taking place at the french consulate for great preparations were going on for a maskball which was about to take place there  it may perhaps appear strange to some readers that any one could have the heart to engage in gaieties in the midst of such horrible scenes of injustice cruelty and death but it must be remembered that human beings have a wonderful capacity for becoming used and indifferent to circumstances the most peculiaras all history assures usand it must also be borne in remembrance that the unfortunate sicilian captives whose sorrows and sufferings we have tried to depict were a mere fraction of the community in the midst of which they suffered  it is probable that the great body of the people in algiers at that time knew little and cared less about the riminis and their brethren  since the reconciliation of the english and french consuls at the time when the representative of denmark was rescued the frenchman had displayed great cordiality to the britonnot only accepting the invitations which before he had refused but drinking with apparent enthusiasm to the health of the english king on the occasion of a dinner given in celebration of that monarchs birthday at the british consulate  the maskball was a very great affair indeed when it came offwhich it did at the country residence of the french consul  the mansion which was mauresque in style was splendidly decorated with flags of various nations and the skiffa with its sparkling fountain and graceful palmettas was a perfect blaze of variegated lamps  these hung amid the foliage of the creepers that twined round the curved marble pillars and their red garish light contrasted powerfully with the clear purity of the starlit sky which formed the natural roof of the skiffa  the grounds around the consulate were also decorated and lighted up with the taste for which the french are peculiarly noted  of course all the consuls were invited with their respective families and were present with the exception of mrs langley who happened to be indisposed and agnes who stayed at home to nurse her mother  as an affair of the kind involved a good deal of laxity of what may be styled domestic discipline many of the superior servants were also permitted to stroll about the grounds in fancy costumes  the consuls themselves appeared in their proper uniforms but some of the members of their households displayed themselves in forms and aspects which we find it difficult to describe while others of the guests habited themselves in the skins and gave themselves the airs of wild beasts of the forest  there were wildboars from the jurjura hills overgrown monkeys from the gorge of la chiffa lions from mount atlas and panthers from the zahara besides other nondescript creatures from nowhere  but these were a mere sprinkling in the gay scene of richly dressed ladies and gentlemen among whom strange to say were not a few christian slaves these last were italian and portuguese officers who had been captured by the algerines at various times  had they been taken by civilised peoples they would have been deemed prisoners of war and treated as such but the pirates styled them slaves and would certainly have treated them as beasts of burdenas they treated hundreds of their countrymenbut for the fact that they had friends at home who paid an annual sum to purchase for them exemption from such drudgery  having nothing to do and no means of escaping these unfortunate men did what they could to mitigate the woes of their brethrenthough they were not allowed to do muchand entered more or less into the society and amusements of the city  hence though liable at any moment to be put in chains or sent to the quarries or even slain by their savage captors they were to be found waltzing at the fancy ball of the french consul  among those who cut a very conspicuouswe may venture to say a beastlyfigure that night was our friend ted flaggan  the eccentric tar desiring to enjoy the ball under the shelter of a mask which would preserve his incognito had with the aid of rais ali provided himself with the complete skin of a wildboar including the head with its enormous tusks and having fitted it to his person and practised a variety of appropriate antics to the delight of agnes who was the only person besides rais admitted to his secret he felt himself to be quite up in his partalmost fitted to hold converse with the veritable denizens of the forest  flaggan had arranged that he was to put on the boardress in the town residence of rais ali  being unwilling to attract the attention of the populace by passing through the streets in broad daylight he determined to postpone his advent to an advanced part of the evening  it was a clear calm night when he left the country residence of the british consul with a crescent moon to light him on his way  he had just issued from the garden gate when an old man clad in a halfmonkish robe advanced towards him with strides that would have done credit to a dragoon  ive me doubts that yer not so ancient as ye look owld feller he said eyeing the man keenly as he drew near and moving the head of the thick stick which as usual rested in his pocket as if to hold it in readiness for instant action  be the breetish consul at home said the old man in broken english and in breathless haste  not at present answered the seaman quickly for he now saw that the man was really old and that anxiety had given him strength to exert himself beyond his ordinary powers but im goin to meet himbein if i may so spake his edgedukong  av youve anything in the world to say to his excellency im your man to carry the message  you are breetish sailor i zee returned the old man sitting down and heaving a deep sigh as if unable to recover breath  you will onderstan when i say your lord exmouth do come quickly for bombard de city  onderstand youis it exclaimed ted with sudden excitement  faix do i but i dont belave ye  man said the other with an earnest look doos you tink i come here like dis for tell do breetish consul a lie  shure yer right an im a goose exclaimed the tar becoming still more excited but are ee sure yer not mistaken owld man  quite sure  listen  go tell consul dat one boat come shore at pointe pescade find me dere capture mecarry me off  it was fishin boat in breetish pay  dey find out who i be  give leave to go shore again and warn breetish consul to look out for turk ver savage when him hear of dis  lord exmouth wid large fleet come straight to algiers for delivrin all slaves an blow up de city  hurrah shouted flaggan in a subdued voice while he unpocketed the cudgel and twirled it over his head  good luck to ee owld man  im off to tell the consul  go in here an theyll give ee some grub  say i sent eebut hallo he added when on the point of starting whats yer name  the padre giovanni replied the old man  och its mesilf has heard of ee cried the seaman as he turned and dashed down the road leading to the city  so energetic was he in his motions and so quick was his pace on reaching babeloued gate that the guarda young soldier lately arrived from turkeybecame suspicious and ventured to intercept him  flaggan was in no humour to be stopped or even spoken with  he made an attempt to force past which caused the soldier to present his piece at him  hereupon ted drew forth his cudgel hit the turk a donnybrookian whack over the skull that laid him flat on the ground and took to his heels  the rest of the guard who saw this little incident and recognised the now wellknown seaman instantly gave chase but ted was too active for them  he doubled down a narrow street on his left and in five minutes was beyond their reach  he knew now that nothing but prompt action could save him from immediate arrest and probable castigation  he therefore went straight to rais alis house and was admitted by an old negress  arraying himself in the skin of the wild boar he attempted to cover himself with an arab burnous but do what he could he found it impossible to draw the hood over him in such a way as to conceal the head of the boar and after his recent escapade with the guard he felt that it was not safe to venture forth again uncovered  he therefore resolved to keep the boars head exposed and to venture boldly forth despite the attention it was sure to attract  to his great relief rais himself came in just as he was about to start and after relating his adventure that worthy suggested that he should join half a dozen of the french consuls own servants who were about to set out for the scene of festivities  agreeing to this plan he passed through the streets without attracting much more attention than did his somewhat wildlyhabited companions and soon reached the french consuls residence which was not more than half a mile beyond the southern gate of the city  the blaze of light and buzz of musical noise that reigned here immediately swallowed them up so that ted felt himself for the time at least to be safe  his grotesque figure did indeed attract some attention at first for he was an exceeding tall and sturdy boar but there were so many other notabilities from the forest and desert around him that he quickly sank into comparative insignificance  some of the other creatures referred to gave him a little uneasiness by their curiosity and desire to claim acquaintance if not kindred with him but by humouring some frightening others running away from several and tumbling a few into the bushes he managed to push through the crowd of domestics unrecognised and made his way into the outer lobby of the mansion  here seated under the shadow of a moorish arch way drinking lemonade in default as he said of better tipple ted resolved to bide his time but his time seemed rather long of coming  he therefore boldly entered the magnificent skiffa in search of colonel langley  his appearance was greeted with a shout of delight by several children who were present and the french consul willing to amuse them went up and shaking hands with the boar begged of him to join in the dance  poor ted would have given anything to have known what was said to him but being utterly ignorant of french shook his head and bowed with an air of profound respect which piece of politeness caused his short and rather illfitting tail to stick straight up in the air for a moment and drew roars of laughter from the company  dansez dansezvous said the frenchman with more emphasis  och its that ye want is it said ted much relieved sure ill do it with all the pleasure in lifeclear the deck boys  and without more ado the lively tar began to whistle a sailors hornpipe and to dance the same with an amount of vigorous dexterity that had in former years made him the favourite of the forecastle  the surprise soon merged into admiration for our hero danced exceedingly well and all eyes were attracted to him  among others the british consul came forward to look on with much interest and curiosity for his ear was perhaps the only one present to which the tune whistled was familiar  dancing close up to him ted flaggan suddenly slipped and staggering as if about to fall flung his arm over the consuls shoulder  take care said the latter catching him  och gasped ted sinking down and almost dragging the other after him spake to me av ye love me  amazed by this tender appeal and suddenly suspecting the personality of the boar the consul bent down while the rest of the onlookers crowded roundand said in a low voice  why flag  whist whist blood an thunder itll rain scimitars an grapeshot av ye say a word  mate me in the gardin dear under the palm  this was said in the midst of a writhing and growling which would have done credit to a lunatic boar if such there were  not hurt i hope said the french consul coming forward  not at all replied colonel langley rising with a smile the fellow is one of my domestics and has almost overacted his part  he will be all right in a minute if some one will be kind enough to fetch him a glass of water  an brandy ochone exclaimed the boar with another tremendous growl that again sent the children into shouts of delight  the brandy and water was brought and ted making a polite bow to the company passed down the room with a slight tremor of the hornpipe in his legs and a faint trill of the tune on his lips both of which melted gradually into a boarish grunt and roll as he reached the lobby and passed out into the garden  hastening to a stately datepalm of which there happened to be only one specimen in the garden of the french residence the heated seaman pushed off his head wiped his brow drank the brandy and water and threw away the tumbler after which he sat down on a root mechanically pulled out his pipe and was in the act of filling it when colonel langley came hurriedly forwards  why flaggan he asked whats wrong for something must be to induce your strange conduct  lord exmouth sir replied ted rising up with an air of dignified importance which the elevated snout of the boar tended sadly to impair is in the offing with fifty sail o the line more or less comin to blow this precious city into the middle of next week  come flaggan let us have it without jesting said the consul gravely  thereupon ted related in as serious a tone as it was possible for him to assume all that had been told by the padre giovanni  our position will indeed be critical if this be true muttered the consul with a look of anxiety  omar is a man who fears nothing and has unbounded faith in his men and fortifications  moreover he is utterly regardless of consequences and has no mercy when once roused my poor defenceless wife and childrenif  you may depend upon me sir said ted seeing that he hesitated ill stick to em i will through  i have no doubt of that my man interrupted the consul with a sad smile but your aid in this case will be useless  the fact is that the preservation of your life will be a more difficult matter for me to accomplish than my own  if lord exmouth really arrives and proceeds to extremities i and my family will be in the greatest peril from these irate corsairs but you my poor fellow are doomed whatever happens seeing that you have laid violent hands on the turkish guard of the gates  sure an small blame to me said ted  i do not blame you but the turks will and they will do morethey will strangle you for a certainty the moment they get hold of you and no power that i possess can save you so that your only chance lies in making your escape from the city either by land or sea  an that wont be aisy sur said the seaman with a perplexed look  indeed it will not  you may be sure that the turks are even now searching for you and as they know that i am here and that you belong to my household  by your lave said ted suddenly it sames to me that its time for ted flaggan to look after his owld bones  im grateful to ee sur goodnight  he pulled his boarhead down without awaiting a reply and went hastily off in the direction of a small outhouse where rais ali was enjoying himself amid a circle of the french consuls domestics  dashing forward he seized his friend by the arm and dragged him out by main force to the amusement of the domestics who thought it was a practical jest  arrah dont stare like that but come along wid ye said ted hasting to a neighbouring thicket into the very heart of which he penetrated before halting  what be go wrong exclaimed rais  theyre after me lad  dont waste time spaikin  youve got your burnous here havent ye  yis  go fetch it an sharps the word  flaggans tone and actions were such as to instil a spirit of prompt unquestioning obedience into his friend who instantly went off and in a few seconds which seemed years to ted returned with his burnous  while the seaman quickly but quietly divested himself of the boarskin and put on the burnous with the hood well drawn over his face he related to his friend the incident at the gate without however mentioning the true cause of his behaviour  an wat for you go be do now asked rais ali anxiously  to make me escape sure said ted holding the head of his cudgel close up to his friends nose across the mountains or over the say by hook or crook or through the air escape i will somehow even though i should have to jump out at me mouth an lave me body behind me for depind upon it that all the turks an moors an boors an naigers in the pirates nest aint able to take ted flaggan alive  unpossble exclaimed rais decidedly  i manes to try anyhow returned ted so give us your flipper owld boy ive a sort o sneakin regard for ee tho ye havent much to boast of in the way o pluck  unpossble again ejaculated rais ali with greater decision than before  well

unceremoniously  dont palaver so much but take the helm an wotiver ye do clap on all sailivery stitch you can carryfor the case is desprit  rais ali did clap on all sail steered his friend through the brightlylighted grounds and laughing throng of revellers through numerous lanes between hedges of aloes and prickly pear over the sahel hills and away to the northward until they reached the neighbourhood of pointe pescade which lay about three and a half miles on the other side of the town  its a purty big raigion hereaway said flaggan during a brief halt to recover breath why shouldnt i steer for the great zahairy an live wi the bedooin arabs  i spose its becase theyll always be doin somethin or other that theyve got the name  cause theyd robb an kill you replied rais  umph ejaculated ted as they descended to the bold rocky coast where the celebrated pirate of old was wont to mount guard over the mediterranean  betterer for you trust to de sea said rais  true for ye boyseein that im a sayfarin man returned ted  proceeding cautiously down a wild and almost invisible pathway among the cliffs rais ali reached the base at a part where the sea ran under the overhanging rocks  stepping into a pool which looked black and deep but which was only a few inches at the edge he waded slowly into the interior of a cavern the extremity of which was quite dry  it was dark as erebus but flint and steel soon produced a light  there vas vonce a torch here said rais looking about hastily while the vault above was lighted for a few seconds by the bunch of dry grass which he had brought with him but it long since me beah here it is dis am de torch  he lighted it and showed his friend the form and size of the cave reiterated that it was known to no one but himselfat least so he thoughtadvised him to remain close all day and keep a good lookout seaward at night promised to return with food the following evening and finally left him to his meditations    note 1  a very remarkable and authentic instance of this style of punishment is recorded in the annals of algiers  a moor named geronimo was about the beginning of the seventeenth century converted to christianity by a captive  the reigning pasha ordered him to recant and gave him twentyfour hours to make up his mind  on his refusal the pasha caused geronimo to be buried alive in the mud which was being poured into moulds and dried into blocks for the purpose of building fort babeloued  in this block the poor martyr was built into the wall of the fort which was thereafter named the fort of the twentyfour hours  the incident was soon nearly forgotten  two and a half centuries afterwards in december 1853 the french while carrying out their improvements in the town destroyed the ancient fort of the twentyfour hours but were warned by one who was well read in the history of the place to be careful on razing a certain part of the walls to examine them well  they did so and found the body of geronimoor rather the mould formed by his body which latter of course had crumbled to dust  a plaster cast was taken from this mould and this castwhich gives an almost perfect representation of the martyr lying on his face with his hands tied behind his backis now in the museum of the library of algiers    chapter twenty four  the dark clouds begin to thickena rescue attemptedmaster jim plays a conspicuous part  in the course of a few days the rumour reached algiers that england was in right earnest about sending a fleet to bombard the city and at the same time colonel langley learned through information privately conveyed to him that the report of padre giovanni was to some extent incorrect  the old man had misunderstood the message given to him and represented the fleet as being in the offing whereas it had not at that time left england  the caution however was useful inasmuch as it put the british consul on his guard  it was at the end of one of the mohammedan festivals when the news reached the deys ears  he was engaged at the time in celebrating the festival surrounded by his courtiers and those of the consuls who chanced to be in favour  the tribute due by denmark and spain not having been paid their respective representatives were not present and the dey was debating in his mind the propriety of sending them to work in irons with the slaves  among other entertainments there was a wrestling match about to take place in the skiffa of the palace  before proceeding to the skiffa omar had shown his guests his menagerie which contained some remarkably fine specimens of the blackmaned lion with a variety of panthers jackals monkeys and other animals  this was rather a trying ordeal for the nerves of the timid because the animals were not in cages being merely fastened by ropes to rings in the wallsall save one called the spaniard who was exhibited as the roarer of the tribe and had to be stirred up to partial madness occasionally to show his powers of lung he was therefore prudently kept in a wooden cage  entering the skiffa the dey took his seat on a throne and ordered the wrestlers to begin  in the centre of the court was a pile of sawdust surmounted by a flag at a given signal two naked and welloiled moors of magnificent proportions rushed into the court and scattered the sawdust on the floor after which they seized each other round their waists and began an exciting struggle which ended after a few minutes in oneof them being thrown  another champion then came forward and the scene was repeated several times until one came off the conqueror and obtained from the dey a purse of gold as his reward  the unsuccessful athletes were consoled by having a handful of silver thrown into the arena to be scrambled for  it seemed as if more enjoyment was got by the spectators from the scramble than from the previous combats  after this a quantity of food was thrown to the athletes for which another scramble ensued  in the midst of this scene an officer of the palace was observed to whisper in the ear of the dey who rose immediately and left the skiffa bringing the amusements to an abrupt close  thus was sounded the first clap of the thunder storm which was about to descend on the city  the effect of it was great and to some of the actors in our tale most important  all the executions of slaves which had been ordered to take place were countermanded except in the cases of one or two who had rendered themselves particularly obnoxious and a few others who were unfit for labour  this was done because omar determined to put forth all his available power to render the fortifications of the place as strong as possible  all the slaves were therefore set to work on them but those who had been under sentence of death were kept from too great a rebound of spirits at the reprieve by being told that the moment the work was finished their respective punishments should be inflicted  our poor friend mariano was thus assailed by the horrible thought while working at the blocks of concrete which he mixed from morning till night that in one such block he should ere long find a living tomb  we need scarcely add that the thought drove him to desperation but poor fellow he had by that time learned that the violence of despair could achieve nothing in the case of one on whose limbs heavy irons were riveted and whose frame was beginning to break down under the protracted and repeated tortures to which it had been exposed  ah how many wretched men had learned the same bitter lesson in the same accursed city in days gone bywhose groans and cries though unrecorded by the pen of man have certainly been inscribed in the book of gods remembrance and shall yet be brought into a brighter light than that of terrestrial day  omar dey was a man of energy and decision  the instant it became known to him that england was at last stirred up to resent the insults which had been heaped upon her and other nations by the algerines he set about making preparations for defence on the vastest possible scale  it was a sight worth seeingthough we cannot afford space to describe it in detailthe hundreds of camels horses mules and donkeys that trooped daily into the city with provisions and materiel of every kind the thousands of arabs who by command flocked in from the surrounding country to defend the city and the hundreds of christian captives who collected from the quarries as well as from the fields gardens and stables of their respective owners were made to swarm like bees upon the already formidable walls  some of the slaves were fettered most of them having been tamed were free  some were strong others were weak not a few were dying but all were made to work and toil day and night with just sufficient rest to enable them to resume labour each morning  it was a woeful sight  a sight which for centuries had been before the eyes of european statesmen but european statesmen had preferred that european peoples should go on cutting each others throats and increasing their national debts rather than use their power and wealth to set their captive brethren free and it was not until the nineteenth century that england the great redresser of wrongs put forth her strong hand to crush the pirate city  while these busy preparations were going on a terrible gale arose which did a good deal of damage to the harbour and shipping of algiers and among other peculiar sideinfluences inscribed the name of the french consul in the deys black book  indeed nearly all the consuls had their place in that book now for omar had been chafed by the cloud of little worries that surrounded him not having been long enough on the throne to regard such with statesmanlike equanimity  the gale referred to had the effect of driving several moorish vessels close under the walls of the town just in front of the mosque djama djedid  during its progress a french privateer in other words a licensed pirate which chanced to be in port at the time unintentionally fouled a moorish vessel and sank it  next day a divan was held at which omar demanded payment of the french consul  not feeling himself bound to pay for the misdeeds of a privateer the consul refused whereupon the privateer was seized and all her crew sent in chains to work at the fortifications  it chanced about the same time that news came of an english frigate having seized an algerine vessel and carried her off to gibraltar this sent colonel langley still deeper into omars black book so that he felt himself and family to be in great danger of being also put in chains and sent to the marina if not worse  he therefore hastened the secret packing of his valuables intending to avail himself of the first opportunity that should offer of leaving the city  such an opportunity soon occurred at least so thought the consul in the arrival of the prometheus a british warvessel of 18 guns but colonel langley found as many have discovered before him that there is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip for the dey suddenly took a high position and absolutely refused to allow the british consul to depart  captain dashwood the commander of the prometheus on his first interview with the dey saw that there was no chance whatever of getting off the consul by fair means for omar treated him with studied hauteur and insolence  i know perfectly well said he at the conclusion of the conference that your fleet which report tells me has already left england is destined for algiers  is it not so  i have no official information your highness replied captain dashwood  if you have received such news you know as much as i do and probably from the same sourcethe public prints  from whence i have it is a matter of no moment returned the dey as he abruptly closed the conference  immediately after captain dashwood informed the consul of his intention of sending a boat ashore next morning with the ostensible motive of making final proposals to the dey but really for the purpose of carrying out his plans which he related in detail  accordingly next morning the captain proceeded to the palace and kept the dey in complimentary converse as long as was possible with a man of such brusque and impatient temperament  while thus engaged several of the men and midshipmen of the prometheus proceeded to the consuls house  they did so in separate detachments and some of them returned once or twice to the boat as if for some small things that had been forgotten thus confusing the guards as to the numbers of those who had landed  when captain dashwood again returned to his boat there were two more midshipmen in it than the number that had left his shipone being the consuls wife the other his daughter agnes  master jim however had been left behind owing to the arrangements not having been sufficient to meet his requirements  poor mrs langley had left him with agonised selfreproach on being assured that he should be fetched off on the morrow  colonel langley was of course obliged to remain with him  when the morrow came another boat was sent ashore with baskets for provisions  one of these baskets was taken to the consuls house  it was in charge of the surgeon of the ship as master jim required the services of a professional gentleman on the occasion  all went well at first  the boat was manned by several men and midshipmen who went innocently to market to purchase provisions  the surgeon a remarkably cool and selfpossessed individual went to the consuls house with a jacktarequally cool and selfpossessed carrying the basket  now then lets see how smartly we can do it said the surgeon on entering colonel langleys nursery  is your child tractable  very much the reverse replied the colonel with a smile  umph cant be helpedset down the basket my man and come and hold him  now the zaharian zubby not having been let into the secret of the mysterious proceedings that followed became a source of unexpected danger and annoyance to the surgeon and his friends  she watched the former with some interest while he mixed a small powder in the family medicineglass and when he advanced with it to master jim her large eyes dilated so that the amount of white formed an absolutely appalling contrast with her ebony visage  but when she saw master jim decline the draught with his wonted decision of character thereby rendering it necessary for the nautical man to put powerful restraint on his struggling limbs and to hold his nose while the surgeon forced open his mouth and poured the contents of the family glass down his throat and when in addition to all this she beheld colonel langley standing calmly by with an air of comparative indifference while this hideous cruelty was being practised on his son and heir her warm heart could stand no more  uttering a series of wild shrieks she ran at the nautical man scored his face down with her ten fingers seized the choking jim in her arms and thrust her forefinger down his little throat with the humane view of enabling him to part with the nauseous draught which he had been compelled to swallow  master jim had convulsed himself twice and had actually got rid of a little of the draught before the surgeon could recover him from the irate negress  i hope he hasnt lost much of it remarked the surgeon looking anxiously at the howling boy as he held him fast  i brought only one dose of the drug but we shall see in a few minutesdo stop the noise of that screeching imp of blackness he added turning a look of anger on zubby whose grief was like her mirth obstreperous  i wish as some un had pared her nails afore i comed here growled the nautical man  hush zubby said colonel langley taking the girl kindly by the arm we are doing jim no harm youll bring the janissaries in to see who is being murdered if you go on sohush  but zubby would not hush the colonel therefore called his black cook and handed her over to himwho being a fellowcountryman and knowing what a zaharian frame could endure carried her into an adjoining room and quietly choked her  hes goingall right said the surgeon with a look and nod of satisfaction as the child lying in the nautical mans arms dropt suddenly into a profound slumber  now we will pack himstay has he a cloak or shawl of any kind said the surgeon looking round  zubby alone knows where his mysterious wardrobe is to be found replied the colonel  then let the creature find it cried the surgeon impatiently we have no time to lose  zubby was brought back and told to wrap her treasure in something warm which she willingly did under the impression that she was about to be ordered to take him out for a walk but the tears which still bedimmed her eyes coupled with agitation caused her to perform her wonted duty clumsily and to stick a variety of pins in various unnecessary places she was then sent to the kitchen with some trivial message to the cook  while she was away master jim was packed in the bottom of the vegetable basket and a quantity of cabbages cauliflowers etcetera were placed above him  the basket was given to the nautical man to carry  then the surgeon and the consul went out arminarm followed by two midshipmen who were in attendance in the hall  robinsonso the nautical man was namedbrought up the rear  they proceeded along the street babeloued for some distance and then passing the mosque near the slavemarket descended the street that led to the marina and the place where the boat of the prometheus lay in waiting  the consul and surgeon affected to talk and laugh lightly as they approached the gate and were permitted to pass the guard supposing no doubt that the british consul was exercising his wonted civility in conducting his friends down to their boat  but fate in the form of zubby was unfavourable to them  either that loving damsels finger had been more effective than was at first supposed or the pins were operating with unwonted pungency but certain it is that just as mr robinson was passing under the gateway master jim awoke from his profound slumber  feeling although not naturally dyspeptic that the cabbages weighed heavy on his stomach he set up such a howl and struck out so violently that the lid of the basket was forced up and sundry vegetables rolled before the eyes of the astonished turks  of course master jim and his bearer were taken prisoners but the evil did not stop here for the officer of the guard at once ordered the arrest of the consul himself as well as the surgeon the midshipmen and the boats crew of the prometheus and the whole were thrust into the dungeons of the common prisonthe consul by special order of the dey being loaded with iron fetters  the dismay of poor mrs langley and agnes when they heard of the fate of the consul and his child may be imagined  it was however mitigated in some degree when next morning a boat came off to the prometheus containing master jim himself in charge of the faithful zubby  whether it was that omar deemed the child a useless encumbrance or a valueless article or was visited by one of those touches of compunction which are wellknown to assail at times the breasts of even the worst of pirates we cannot tell but no such clemency was extended to jims father  the dey positively refused either to give him up or to promise his personal safety nor would he listen to a word respecting the officers and men whom he had seized  this was the news with which captain dashwood left algiers and which some days later he delivered to lord exmouth when he met the british fleet on its way to the city with the view of bringing the pirates to their senses    chapter twenty five  the coming struggle looms on the horizon  the barbarians of barbary had roused the wrath of england to an extreme pitch in consequence of a deed which did not indeed much excel their wonted atrocities but which being on a large scale and very public had attracted unusual attentionall the more that about the same time the european nations having killed as many of each other as they thought advisable for that time were comparatively set free to attend to socalled minor affairs  the deed referred to was to the effect that on the 23rd of may 1816 the crews of the coral fishingboats at bonaabout 200 miles eastward of algierslanded to attend mass on ascension day  they were attacked without a shadow of reason or provocation by turkish troops and massacred in cold blood  previous to this lord exmouth had been on the barbary coast making treaties with these corsairs in which he had been to some extent successful  he had obtained the liberation of all ionian slaves these having become by political arrangement british subjects and having been allowed to make peace for any of the mediterranean states that would authorise him to do soit being wellknown that they could do nothing for themselveshe arranged terms of peace with the algerines for sardinia and naples though part of the treaty was that naples should pay a ransom of 100 pounds head for each slave freed by the pirates and sardinia 60 pounds  thinking it highly probable that he should ere long have to fight the algerines lord exmouth had sent captain warde of the banterer to algiers to take mental plans of the town and its defences which that gallant officer did most creditably thereby greatly contributing to the success of future operations  by a curious mistake of the interpreter at tunis instead of the desire being expressed that slavery should be abolished england was made to demand that this should be done and the alarmed tunisians agreed to it taking the hint lord exmouth made the same demand at tripoli with similar result  at algiers however his demands were refused and himself insulted  returning to england in some uncertainty as to how his conduct would be regardedfor in thus demanding instead of desiring the liberation of slaves he had acted on his own responsibilityhe found the country agitated by the news of the bona massacre of which at that time he had not heard  the demands therefore which he had made with some misgiving were now highly approved and it was resolved that they should be repeated to the barbarians in the thunder of artillery  a member of the house of commons stirred to indignation by the news from bona got up and moved for copies of lord exmouths treaties with algiers for naples and sardinia and all correspondence connected therewith  he strongly condemned the principle of treating at all with states which presumed to hold their captives up to ransom as by so doing virtual acknowledgment was made that these pirates had a right to commit their outrages  he was given to understand he said that the dey pressed by dissatisfied algerines for limiting their sphere of plunder had pacified them by assuring them that a wide field of plunder was still left  treaties of peace made with them by some states had only the effect of turning their piracies into other channels as was already beginning to be felt by the roman states  he then described the wretched condition of the slaves  he cited one instance namely that out of three hundred slaves fifty had died from bad treatment on the day of their arrival and seventy more during the first fortnight  the rest were allowed only one pound of black bread per day and were at all times subject to the lash of their brutal captorsneither age nor sex being respected  one neapolitan lady of distinction he said had been carried off by these corsairs with eight children two of whom had died and she had been seen but a short time ago by a british officer in the thirteenth year of her captivity  these things were not exaggerations they were sober truths and he held that the toleration of such a state of things was a discredit to humanity and a foul blot upon the fame of civilised nations  it is refreshing to hear men speak the truth and call things by their right names in plain language like this  the house and the country were ripe for action  an animated debate followed  it was unanimously agreed that the barbarians should be compelled to cease their evil practices and lord exmouths conduct was not only approved but himself was appointed to accomplish the duty of taming the turks  a better or bolder sealion could not have been found to take charge of old englands wooden walls on this occasionironclads being then unknown  he was a disciple of the great nelson and a welltried seawarrior of forty years standing  he went to work with the energy and promptitude of a trueblue british tar and knowing well what to do resolved to do it in his own way  many naval officers considered the fortifications of algiers impregnable  having seen and studied them lord exmouth thought otherwise  lord nelson founding probably on erroneous information and not having seen the place had said that twentyfive lineofbattle ships would be necessary to subdue it  our admiral with captain wardes correct plan in his pocket knew that there was not room for even half that number of ships to be laid alongside the town  the admiralty strongly urged him to take a powerful fleet  lord exmouth agreed to that but decided that it should be a small one  to the surprise of their lordships he fixed on five liners with a few smaller craft as a sufficient number for the work he had to do  he said  if they open fire when the ships are coming up and cripple our masts we shall have some difficulty perhaps and the loss will no doubt be greater but if they allow us to take our stations i am sure of them for i know that nothing can resist a lineofbattle ships fire  it was usually thought by naval men that a ship could not be thoroughly effective until she had been a considerable time in commission doubtless the thought was correct and founded on experience nevertheless lord exmouth proved himself an exception to ordinary naval rulers  he commissioned fitted and manned a fleet and fought and won a great battle within the incredibly brief space of two months  but more of that hereafter  meanwhile the pirates prepared briskly for the coming struggle and wrought hard at the batteries while christian slaves swarmed and toiled night and day on the ramparts of algiers    chapter twenty six  in which rais ali and ted flaggan play a vigorous part  when colonel langleys star descended as has been described his household was of course scattered to the winds  those who were slaves meeklyor otherwiseawaited their orders which were various according to their condition  some of them were sent to toil at the fortifications others to carry material into the town  those who were free betook themselves to their kindred and their favourite employments  a few members of the household joined the army of defence  among these latter was our friend rais ali who being a moor and having been a pirate and still being young and strong was deemed a fit subject to defend his hearth and home  his hearth by the way was defended pretty well by the moorish lady whom we introduced at the beginning of this volume with the able assistance of a small negro whom rais had purchased for a few shillings in the slavemarket  it must not be supposed that rais ali was a willing defender of his home  if he could have delegated that duty to others he would have preferred it  had it been possible for him to have retired into a distant part of the zahara and there dwelt at ease while daily telegrams were forwarded to him of the progress of events he would have considered himself supremely happy but such was not his fortune and being of a philosophical turn of mind he wisely succumbed to the inevitable  it was so fated that rais ali was ordered to serve as a gunner at the fish market battery just in front of the mosque djama djedid  bravely did our interpreter proceed daily to his duties and intensely did he hope that there might never be any occasion for his services  but whatever fate might decree for him rais ali had a peculiar knack of decreeing a few things for himself which neither fate nor anything else appeared to be able to deprive him of  one of these decrees was that come what might he should have his morning cup of coffee another that he should have a daily shave a third that he should have a bath at least once a week  as one of the occasions on which he fulfilled his destiny and carried out his own fatal decrees bears on our tale we will follow him  having begun the day at a very early hour with his cup of coffee he proceeded in a leisurely way to a certain street in the town where was kept a turkish bath  this was not an anglified turkish bath good reader but a real one not an imitation but the actual thing itself fresh from turkey managed by turks or moors who were at least half turks and conducted in accordance with the strictest rules of turkish etiquette  approaching the door of the bath he observed a tall dignified and very powerful arab sauntering in front of it  rais ali seemed troubled by the sight of him paused advanced halted and again advanced until the tall arab catching sight of him stalked forward with solemn dignity and held out his hand  what for yoo comes here demanded rais rather testily  the tall moor slowly bent his hooded head and whispered in his earfaix its more than i rightly know mesilf  yoos mad said rais drawing the tall arab into the porch of the bath where they could avoid the observation of passersby  did not i tell yoo for to keep close  so ye did rais ally said ted flaggan for it was he and its close i kep as long as i cud which was aisy enough seeing that ye brought me purvisions so riglarlike a good feller as ye are but body o me man i cudnt live in a cave all me lone for iver an i got tired o lookin out for that british fleet that niver comes so i says to mesilf wan fine evenin go out ted me boy an have a swim in the sayitll do ee good and theres not much chance of any wan troublin ye here no sooner said than done  out i wint round beyont the pint pescade an off wid me close an into the say  och but it was plisint  well just as i was coming out who should i see on the rocks above me but a big thief of an arab  i knew at wance that if i was to putt on close hed guess maybe who i was so i came out o the wather an ran straight at him nakedmeanin to frighten him away like  an sure enough he tuk to his heels like a munster pig  i dont know how it is but i have always had a strong turn for huntin  from the time whin i was a small gosoon runnin after the pigs an cats ive bin apt to give chase to anything that runned away from me an to forgit myself  so it was now  after the arab i wint neck an crop an away he wint like the wind flingin off his burnous as he ran but i was light bein naked dye see an soon overhauled him  for a starnchase it was the shortest i remember  when i came up wid him i made a grab at his head an his hakeis that what ye calls itcomed away in me hand leaving his shaved head open to view wid the tuft o hair on the top of it  i laughed to that extint at this that he got away from me so i gave him a finishin irish howl by way o making him kape the pace goin an thin stopped and putt on the hake  by and by i comes to where the burnous was and putts it on too an faix ye couldnt have towld me from an arab for the bare legs an feet and arms was all right only just a taste over light in colour dee see  thinks i to mesilf ted me boy ye cudnt do better than remain as ye are  wid a little brown dirt on yer face an limbs yer own mother wouldnt know ye  an troth rais i did it an whin i lucked at mesilf in a smooth pool on the baich it was for all the world as if somebody else was luckin at me to be short wid ye ive bin wanderin about the country for the last three or four days quite free an aisy  nobody see yoo asked rais in great surprise  och lots o people but few of em tuk a fancy to spake to me an whin they did i shuck me head an touched me lips so they thought i was dumb  but why you comes to town asked rais ali in a remonstrative tone  just bekaise im hungry replied the seaman with a smile  ye see ally babby the gale of day before yesterday sint a breaker into the cave that washed away all the purvisions ye brought me last so it was aither come here and look for ee or starvefor the british fleet has apparently changed its mind and aint goin to come here after all  i meant to go drec to yer house but knowin yer fondness for baths and rememberin that this was yer day i thought it betther to cruise about here till you hove in sight  while ted flaggan was relating all this his friends countenance expressed alternately doubt disapproval anxiety amusement and perplexity  when he had finished rais informed him that instead of the fleet having changed its mind there was great probability of its sudden appearance at any moment  he also mentioned the arrest of the british consul and the boats crew of the prometheus and explained that the most energetic measures were being taken to place the city in a state of defence  oho exclaimed flaggan in a low tone that clears up wan or two things thats been puzzlin me  ive bin thinkin that the ship i saw lave the port was british but the weather bein thick i cudnt quite make out her colours  then ive been sore perplexed to account for the flocks of armed arabs that have bin steerin into the town of late an whin i passed the gates this mornin i was troubled too to make out what was all the bustle about  its all clare as ditchwather nowbut whats to be done with me rais for if the cownsl an the british ginrally are in limbo its a bad lookout for ted flaggan seein that im on the black list already  rais ali appeared to ponder the case for a few seconds  come an have one bath he said with sudden animation after that we go brikfast togidder  av we cud brikfust fust ally babby it would be plisinter returned the hungry seaman but i say i dursnt go into the bath cause what would they think of a man wid darkbrown arms legs an face an a pink body  sure theyd take me for a spy or a madman an hand me over to the pleece  wash here fust said rais leading his friend to a small fountain in a retired angle of the court  ebbery body here too bizzy joyin theirselfs to look to yoo  an des corner dark  me stan tween you an dem  but who ever heard of a white moor objected ted  oh lots of emalfcastes almost white as you said rais  but i aint got a shaved skull with a top knot returned the seaman still objecting  nebber mind sailors of france

into the street naked or clothed no matter whichfor ive said it wance an i means to stick to it theyll niver take ted flaggan alive  all right returned rais ali yoo wash yours faces an holds your tongue  after removing as much as possible of the brown earth from his visage and limbs the seaman drew the hood of his burnous well over his face andhaving assiduously studied the gait of moorsstrode with oriental dignity into the outer court or apartment of the bath followed his friend into an unoccupied corner and proceeded to undress  musha its like a housefull of turkish corpses whispered ted as he surveyed the recumbent figures in white around him  there were some differences between this genuine turkish bath and our british imitation of it which merit notice  the court or hall in which the friends unrobed served the purpose of a dryingchamber as well as a dressingroom  hence those bathers who entered to commence the operation of undressing had to pass between rows of the men who had gone through the bath and were being gradually cooled down  they were all swathed from head to foot in white sheets with large towels or pieces of linen tied turbanfashion round their heads and as they lay perfectly straight and still their resemblance to turkish corpses was disagreeably strong  this idea was still further carried out in consequence of the abominable smell which pervaded the place for algerines were at that time utterly indifferent to cleanliness in their baths  indeed we may add from personal experience that they are no better at the present time than they were then  a few of the corpses however possessed sufficient life to enable them to smoke and sip tea or coffee  this outer court was the immediate vestibule to the bath or stewingroomif we may be allowed the name  there was no passing as with us from a private undressingbox through a mild cooling room and thence into the hot and the hottest rooms  the moors were bold hardy fellows  the step was at once made from the cooling into the hot room or bath and in taking the step it was necessary to pass over one of the open sewers of the townto judge from the smell thereof  but this last was a mere accidental circumstance connected with the bath not an essential part of it  thus it will be seen there were but two apartments in the establishment with an outer lobby  when the two friends had unrobed and wrapped a piece of striped calico round their loins they were led by a young moor in similar costume towards the stewingroom  don be frighted whispered rais ali its pretty hottish  ill try to be aisy replied the seaman with a quiet smile an av i cant be aisy ill be as aisy as i can  although he treated the idea of being frightened with something of contempt he was constrained to admit to himself that he was powerfully surprised when he stepped suddenly into a chamber heated to an extent that seemed equal to a bakers oven  the apartment was octagonal and very high with a domeshaped roof from which it was dimly lighted by four small and very dirty windows water trickled down the dirty darkbrown walls water and soapsuds floated over the dirty marble floor  in the centre of the floor was a mass of masonry about three feet high and seven feet square  this was the core of the room as it werepart of the heating apparatus  it was covered with smooth slabs of stone on which there was no covering of any kind  there is no knowing how much lurid smoke and fire rolled beneath this giant stone ottoman  it chanced that only two men were in the place at the time  they had advanced to a certain stage of the process and were enjoying themselves apparently lifeless and in sprawling attitudes on the hot sloppy floor  the attendant of one had left him for a time  the attendant of the other was lying not far from his temporary owner sound asleep  one of the moors was very short and fat the other tail and unusually thin both had toptufts of hair on their shaven crowns and both would have looked supremely ridiculous if it had not been for the horrible resemblance they bore to men who had been roasted alive on the hot ottoman and flung carelessly aside to die by slow degrees  do as i doos said rais to flaggan as he stretched himself on his back on the ottoman  surely acquiesced ted with a gasp for he was beginning to feel the place rather suffocating  he would not have minded the heat so much he thought if there had only been a little fresh air  rais alis bathattendant lay down on the slab beside him  flaggans attendant looked at him with a smile and pointed to the ottoman  och surely said ted again as he sat down  instantly he leaped up with a subdued howl  wy what wrong asked rais looking up  its redhot replied flaggan rubbing himself  nonsense returned rais you lie down queek  soon git use to him always feel hottish at fust  resolved not to be beaten the unfortunate irishman sat down again and again started up but feeling ashamed suddenly flung himself flat on his back held his breath and ground his teeth together  he thought of gridirons he thought of the rack he thought of purgatory he thought of the propriety of starting up and of tearing limb from limb the attendant who with a quiet smile lay down beside him and shut his eyes he thought of the impossibility of bearing it an instant longer and then he suddenly thought that it felt a little easier  from this point he began to experience sensations that were slightly pleasurable and a profuse perspiration broke out over his whole body  evidently his attendant was accustomed to deal occasionally with white men for he watched his huge charge out of the corner of a wicked eye for some time  seeing however that he lay still the fellow went off into a peaceful slumber  tis an amazin place intirely observed ted who felt inclined to talk as he began to enjoy himself  if it wasnt so dirty that an irish pig of proper breedin would object to come into it id say it was raither agreeable  rais ali being in the height of enjoyment declined to answer but the seamans active mind was soon furnished with food for contemplation when one of the attendants entered and quietly began to all appearance to put the tall thin moor to the torture  have i to go through that thought flaggan well well niver say die owld boy its wan comfort that im biggish an uncommon tough  it would be tedious to prolong the description of the irishmans bathe that morning  suffice it to say that after he had lain on the ottoman long enough to feel as if the greater part of him had melted away he awoke his attendant who led him into a corner laid him on the sloppy floor and subjected him to a series of surprises  he first laid teds head on his naked thigh and rubbed his face and neck tenderly as though he had been an only son he then straightened his limbs and baked them as though he had been trained to knead men into loaves from infancy after that he turned him on his back and on his face punched and pinched and twisted him he drenched him with hot water and soused him with soapsuds from head to foot face and all until the stout mariner resembled a huge mass of his native seafoam he stuck his hair up on end and scratched his head with his ten nails and tweaked his nose and pulled his fingers and toes till they cracked again  all this ted flaggan being tough bore with passing fortitude frequently saying to the moor internally for soap forbade the opening of his lips  go ahead me lad an do yer worst  but although his tormentor utterly failed to move him by fair means he knew of a foul method which proved successful  he crossed teds arms over his breast and attempted to draw them as far over as possible with the view apparently of tying them into a knot  pull away me hearty thought flaggan purposely making himself as limp as possible  the moor did pull and while his victims arms were stretched across each other to the uttermost he suddenly fell upon them thereby almost forcing the shoulderjoints out of their sockets  och ye spalpeen shouted ted flinging him off as if he had been a feather  then sinking back he added come on youll not ketch me slaipin again me honey  the amused moor accepted the invitation and returned to the charge  he punched him baked him boxed him and battered him and finally drenching him with icecold water swathed him in a sheet twisted a white turban on his head and turned him out like a piece of brandnew furniture highly polished into the dryingroom  how yoos like it asked rais ali as they lay in the turkishcorpse stage of the process calmly sipping tea  its plisnt replied ted uncommon plisnt but raither surprisin  ha responded rais  at this point their attention was turned to the little fat moor who had been their fellowbather and to whom ted in his undivided attention to the thin moor had paid little regard  musha whispered ted its the capting of the port  the captain of the port it was and if that individual had known who it was that lay cooling within a few yards of him he would probably have brought our nautical heros days to a speedy termination  but although he had seen ted flaggan frequently under the aspect of a british seaman he had never before seen him in the character of a halfboiled moor besides having been thoroughly engrossed and lost in the enjoyment of his own bath he had paid no attention to those around him  turn yoos face well to de wall whispered rais ali  he great hass hims no see yoo  great hass indade hes not half such a hass as i am for comin in here muttered the sailor as he huddled on his arab garments keeping his face carefully turned away from the captain of the port who lay with his eyes shut in a state of dreamy enjoyment  in a few minutes the two friends paid for their bath and went out  i feels for all the world like a bird or a balloon said ted as his companion hurried him along if i dont git some ballast soon in the shape o grub ill float away intirely  rais ali made no reply but turned into a bakers shop where he purchased two rolls  then hurrying on down several narrow streets the houses of which met overhead and excluded much of the light of day he turned into a small moorish coffeehouse which at first seemed to the sailor to be absolutely dark but in a few minutes his eyes became accustomed to it and he saw that there were several other customers present  they were nearly all in arab costume and sat crosslegged on two benches which ran down either side of the narrow room  each smoked a long pipe and sipped black coffee out of a very diminutive cup while the host a half negro stood beside a charcoal fire in the darkness of the far interior attending to an array of miniature tin coffeepots which exactly matched the cups in size  a young moor with a red fez sat twanging a little guitar the body of which was half a cocoanut covered with parchment  this musician produced very dismal tones from its two strings but the arabs seemed content and sat in silent not to say dignified enjoyment of it  eat away now whispered rais to flaggan as they enteredcross yoo legs look solemn an hold yoos tongue  me goes git shave  obedient to instructionsas british seamen always areted took his place on one of the narrow benches and crossing his legs a la turk began with real zest to eat the rolls which his friend had provided for him and to sip the cup or thimbleful of coffee which mine host silently by order of the same friend placed at his side  meanwhile rais ali submitted himself to the hands of the host who was also a barber and had his head and face shaved without soapthough a little cold water was used  during this operation a boy ran hastily into the cafe and made an announcement in arabic which had the surprising effect of startling the arabs into undignified haste and induced rais ali to overturn his coffee on the barbers naked feet while he seized a towel and dried himself violently  whats to do old feller demanded flaggan with a huge bite of bread almost stopping up his mouth  de british fleet am in sight shrieked rais ali  ye dont mean that cried ted in his turn becoming excited  then its time that i was out o the city  yis away go to yous cave  only death for breetish in algiersoff away  the moor dashed out and hastened to his post on the ramparts while ted flaggan drawing his burnous well round him made straight for the northern gate of the town casting an uneasy glance at his now white legs of which at least the ankles and beginning of the brawny calves were visible  we use the term white out of courtesy and in reference to the distinct difference between the bold seamans limbs and those of the brownskinned arabs  in reality they were of a very questionable neutral tint and covered with a large quantity of hair  their appearance however signified little for by that time the whole town was in an uproar of active preparation and excitement  men of various coloursblack brown and yellow with every intermediate shade and in many different garbswere hastening to the ramparts while anxious women of the lower orders and frightened children were rushing to and fro either engaged in some duties connected with the defence or simply relieving their feelings by violent action while bodies of janissaries were hastening to their various stations or came trooping in from all the outposts of the surrounding country  in the midst of such confusion our tall arab attracted no notice  he passed through the streets unmolested and out at the babeloued gate unchallenged  it was little more than daybreak at the time for arabs are early risers at all times and on the present occasion they had reason to be earlier than usual  the moment our tar caught sight of the sea his heart gave a wild bound of exultation for on the horizon appeared a few white specks like seamews which he now knew to be the british fleet  without any definite intention as to what he meant to do flaggan sped along the road leading to his cave at point pescade his chief feeling being a strong desire to get out of the sight of natives that he might meditate alone on his future movements which he felt must be prompt and decisive  before quite reaching his destination fortune favoured him  coming round a rocky point of the coast he observed a boat with one man in it rowing close inshore  thatll do whispered ted to himself as he went behind a rock and hastily smeared his face and limbs with earth  when the boat approached he went to the edge of the sea and made signs to the fisherman for such he was to approach at the same time pretending to take something out of a wallet at his side to which he pointed with eager interest as though he had something important to say about it  the man lay on his oars a moment and then pulled in but cautiously for he suspected the stranger  when within about four or five yards of the rocks the man again stopped  arrah come on wont ee exclaimed the impatient irishman gesticulating wildly  the fisherman had evidently seen and heard enough for he at once dipped his oars with the intention of rowing off when ted made a sudden spring and went with a heavy plunge into the water within a yard of the boat which was a very small one  unfortunately for the fisherman instead of pulling away he raised an oar with the intention of striking flaggan when he should rise  it was a fatal mistake  he did indeed strike him and on the head too but that was the most invulnerable part of the irishmans body  ted grasped the oar caught the gunwale of the boat and in a moment overturned it and its occupant on his shoulders  diving clear he rose and watched for his adversary  the man also rose a moment later and ted who was a splendid swimmer went at him like a small steamboat caught him by the neck and half throttled him then dragging him ashore untwisted his turban and therewith tied his arms and legs fast after which he carried him into a small cave near at hand and left him to his meditations  this accomplished he returned to the little boat swam off and righted her baled her out shipped the oars and rowed straight out to sea    chapter twenty seven  describes the bombardment of algiers  when the british fleet bore down on algiers on the morning of the 27th of august 1816 there was barely sufficient wind to carry it within sight of the town  while lying becalmed in the queen charlotte lord exmouth sent in a boat and a flag of truce with the terms dictated by england and a demand for the immediate release of the consul and the officers and men belonging to the prometheus  about the same time a small boat was observed by those on board the fleet to put off from the shore to the northward which pulling right across the town made straight for the flagship  it was manned by a solitary rower who as he drew near was recognised by his costume to be an arab  a fouroared boat shot out from the molehead as if to intercept this solitary rower and a short but inspiriting chase ensued  it was seen that at first the arab paid no attention whatever to the boat in pursuit but kept up the slow regular stroke of one who felt quite unconcerned and at his ease  the boat in chase overhauled it fast and when within shout a gunshot the turk in the stern stood up and hailed the arab in stern angry tones but no reply was vouchsafed exasperated beyond measure the turk levelled a pistol at the arab and fired but missed his aim and was driven almost frantic with rage on observing that the insolent arab dropped his oar for an instant and kissed his hand to the ball as it skipped past  immediately after the turk was heard to shout an order to his men who thereupon redoubled their efforts to overtake the chase  at the same instant the arab was observed to bend well forward and almost double the length of his stroke so that the little craft which had hitherto skimmed over the calm sea now began to leap as it were in successive bounds  i say bill dont he pull well exclaimed one of the tars on board the queen charlotte  splendiferous replied bill in great admiration an i do believe that hes creepin away from the turk  this was true the arab was steadily increasing the distance between himself and his pursuers until at last the latter gave up the chase a consummation which was greeted by some of the excitable spirits in the queen charlotte with an irresistible though subdued cheer  in a short time the arab rowed alongside the flagship  och  ally ma boo hookum foldimaronky bang said the arab looking up  well now exclaimed a surprised irish tar on board to those near him its often  ive heard that the arabs had the brogue of owld ireland though the lingo dont square exactly  ah then brother thats cause ye dont onderstand it  sure ye might heave us a rope replied the arab with a grin  a roar of laughter greeted this speech and in another minute ted flaggan stood bowing modestly on the quarterdeck of the flagship  while the admiral was closeted with this unexpected visitorwhose name and deeds owing to some strange oversight have been omitted from historya light breeze sprang up which enabled the fleet to stand into the bay and layto about a mile from the town  meanwhile ted flaggan having given the admiral all the information he possessed as to the condition of the city and its defences was sent forward to take part in the expected fight or go below out of harms way as suited him best  he immediately attached himself as a supernumerary to one of the upperdeck guns and while giving his amused comrades graphic accounts of life in the pirate city obtained from them in return a full account of the fleet and the intentions of the admiral as far as these were known  he found his comrades very intelligent and full of enthusiasm about their leader whom one of the tars styled one of the wery best admirals that england ever owned arter lord nelson  their admiration was well deserved  we have already said that the admiral had commissioned his fleet and got it into excellent working condition in what was deemed a miraculously short space of time  this however was accomplished by no miraculous means but by the simple force of indomitable energy rightly and perseveringly applied  knowing that the time was short and that a fleet newly manned could not work well without a great deal of training he made up for the shortness of time by not allowing a single moment of it to be lost frittered away or misapplied  besides giving the men the usual and proper training while in port preparing to sail he made several arrangements whereby he continued the training most effectively on the voyage out of course it was carried on daily  on tuesdays and fridays the ships were cleared for action and six broadsides were fired but this was only what may be styled parade practice  feeling that actual work could only be done well by men of actual experience he had a twelvepounder gun placed on the after part of the queen charlottes quarterdeck and hung a small target with a very small bullseye at the end of the foretopmast studdingsail boom at which all the captains of guns practised every day so that they acquired not only the habit of laying and working their guns according to rule but also the art of laying them to good purpose and many of them became crack shots before they came within sight of the enemy  the crews were thus kept active and elated in good health and filled with respect for the wisdom and knowledge of those in command as well as with confidence in their own capacity to obey orders with promptitude unity of action and vigorous effect  half the battles of life moral as well as physical are gained by such confidence founded on experiencethe other half are lost for want of it  the fleet comprised five lineofbattle ships two of which were threedeckers three heavy and two smaller frigates besides small craft  at gibraltar they fell in with a dutch squadron consisting of five small frigates and a corvette under viceadmiral the baron van de capellen who asked and obtained leave to cooperate  there were the queen charlotte110 gunsthe flagship of admiral lord exmouth gcb under captain james brisbane cb impregnable 98under rearadmiral milne who was second in command and captain edward brace cb superb 74captain charles elkins minden 74 captain william paterson albion 74captain john coode  of frigates there were the leander 50 guns severn 40 glasgow 40 granicus 36 and hebrus 36  these with five gunbrigs and four bombvessels named respectively and not inappropriately beelzebub fury hecla and infernal constituted the british fleet  the dutch admiral hoisted his flag in the melampus frigate of 44 guns the frederica of same size was commanded by captain van der straten  the other four vessels were smaller  there were besides a flotilla of fiftyfive small craft including mortar and gunboats rocket flats yawls etcetera  opposed to this which the reader will bear in remembrance was deemed a small fleet there were on the walls and batteries of algiers about 500 guns of all sizes and sorts behind which were inexhaustible supplies of ammunition and many thousands of as thoroughgoing rascals as ever defied the strength and tried the patience of the civilised world  being thoroughly acquainted with the position and strength of the batteries of the city lord exmouth had arranged the plan of attack and assigned to each ship and boat its particular station some days before arriving  the addition of the dutch fleet modified but did not materially alter that plan  each individual therefore from lord exmouth to the smallest powdermonkey was as well primed for action as were the guns of the fleet when the flag of truce returned  it had been met outside the mole about eleven am by the captain of the port and an answer was promised in two hours  but these pirates had never been celebrated for keeping their word  one oclock passed but no answer was forthcoming  patient and longsuffering as usualand as he always isthe british lion delayed a full hour  ah boys if we wait till we git a peaceful answer from them villains well wait till doomsday so we will said ted flaggan to the men of the gun to which he had attached himself  ted had thrown off his burnous and washed himself by this time and now clad in a borrowed pair of ducks and striped shirt he stood by the gun commenting pleasantly on his experiences of algerine life and pointing out the various buildings and objects of interest in the city to his mates  that big white house there said he right fornint ye with the round top an the staple all to wan sidethats wan o the chief mosques its somewhere about two hunderd year ould more or less an was built by a slavea poor feller of a genoesean would you belave it they kilt him for the shape he gave it  ah theyre a bad lot intirely like a dacent christian he made it in the shape o a cross an whin the dey found that out he chopped the poor mans head offso he did worse luck but its that theyre always doin or stranglin ye wid a bowstring or makin calfsfutt jelly o yer soleswhat  ye dont belave it  faix if ye go ashore yell larn to belave it  ive seed poor owld women git the bastinadothats what they calls itfor nothin at all amost  ah theyre awful hard on the women  they kape em

wid an cotched they ties her in a sack and drowns her goodlookin is it  faix thats more than i can tell ee for all the time ive been in the place ive never wance seed a moorish womans face barrin the brow an eyes and top o the nose for they cover em up wid white veils so as to make em look like ghosts or walkin corpses  but the jewesses show their purty faces an so do the naigressesare the naigresses purty  troth they may be to their own kith an kin but of all the uglywell well as you say its not fair to be hard on em poor critters for arter all they didnt make theirselves no more than the monkeys did  ted flaggan was interrupted here by the sudden exclamation of there she is and the next moment the boat with the flag of truce was seen returning with the signal flyingno answer  instantly lord exmouth signalled to the fleet are you ready to which an affirmative reply was at once returned and then each ship and boat bore down on its appointed station  we have already said that the harbour of algiers was formed by the running out of an artificial pier from the mainland to the small island of penon which lies close to the town  on this island stood and still stands a lighthouse at the base of which was a powerful threetier battery of fifty guns  the island itself was defended all round by ramparts and batteries of heavy guns  this was the strong point of the fortifications and within the small harbour thus formed was collected the whole algerine fleet consisting of four frigates five large corvettes and thirtyseven gunboats  but besides these harbour defences the seawall of the town extended nearly a mile to the southward and a considerable distance to the northward of the harbour being everywhere strengthened by powerful batteries  the arrangement of the british admiral was that each battery should be engaged by a special ship or ships of heavy metal and that the smaller vessels should take up position where they could find room or cruise about and do as much damage to the enemy as possible  while the liners and frigates were to batter down the walls the small craft bomb and rocket boats etceterawere to pour shells and rockets into the arsenal  it was terrible work that had to be done but the curse which it was intended to do away with was more terrible by far because of being an old standing evil and immeasurably more prolific of death and misery than is even a hardfought battle  the signal to go into action being given lord exmouth led the van in the queen charlotte and the whole fleet bore up in succession the dutch admiral closing in with the rearmost ship of the english line  truly it was a grand as well as a solemn sight to see these majestic ships of war sail quietly down on the devoted city in the midst of dead silence for as yet not a shot had been fired on either side  and the eyes of many already wide with eagerness must have opened wider still with surprise for lord exmouth pursued a course of action that was bold even for a british admiral  he ran the queen charlotte before the wind close up to the walls and with the sails still standing let go three anchors from the stern so as to keep her exactly in the required position just before the opening of the mole and with her vast broadside within pistolrange of the walls flanking all the batteries from the molehead to the lighthouse  still no shot was fired  the boldness of the act seemed to have confounded and paralysed the enemy insomuch that a second ship of the line had almost taken her position close to the stern of her predecessor before the battle began  the effect on the minds of the combatants on both sides was so great that they seemed to have forgotten for an instant the dread work they were about to perform  the mole was crowded with troops many of whom with irresistible feelings of curiosity leaped on the parapet to see the vessel pass while lord exmouth with a strange touch of humanity waved to them earnestly to get out of the way of the coming fire  having coolly lashed the ship by a hawser to the mainmast of an algerine brig which was attached to the shore and stoppered the cables the crew of the flagship cheered  immediately a gun was fired by the algerines  at the first flash lord exmouth gave the order to stand by  at the second gun of the enemy he gave the word fire  the third was drowned in the thunder of the queen charlottes broadside  the effect of such heavy metal at so short a range was terrific  the walls absolutely crumbled before it and it is said that five hundred men fell at the first discharge  all the batteries of the city at once opened fire the ships did likewise as they successively got into position and for some hours after that the roar of artillery was incessant for despite the irresistible fire of the fleet the pirates stood to their guns like men  thus although the leading vessels succeeded in anchoring quietly all the rest of the ships went into action under a very heavy fire particularly that of the dutch admiral who displayed great wisdom and gallantry in the part which he played the lineofbattle ships formed in a sort of crescent round the outside of the island  the superb anchored two hundred and fifty yards astern of the flagship the minden anchored about her own length from the superb and passing her streamcable out of the larboard gunroom port to the albion brought the two ships together  next came the impregnable  these sufficiently engaged the batteries on the island or mole  the heavy frigates passed ahead and anchoredthe leander on the port bow of the queen charlotte the severn ahead of her with her starboard broadside bearing on the fishmarket battery  the melampus and diana dutch vessels passed beyond and engaged the southern batteries of the town  the smaller vessels cruised about directing their fire where it seemed to be most needed and the flotilla of mortar and rocket boats were distributed at the openings between the lineofbattle ships and the mole  this admirable disposition of the force seemed to inspire the men with additional confidence if such were possible but ere long the dense smoke rendered everything invisible beyond a few yards distance from the actors in the tremendous fight  in a few minutes after opening fire the queen charlotte had reduced the fortifications on the molehead to ruins  she then brought her broadside to bear on the batteries over the gate leading to the mole and on the upper works of the lighthouse  her shot told on it with fatal accuracy crumbling the tower and bringing down gun after gun thus proving that the ballpractice on the voyage out had not been undertaken in vain  indeed so expert did some of the gunners find themselves that they actually amused themselves at one part of the day in attempting to hit the algerine flagstaff  it chanced that owing to some alteration in the arrangements our friend rais ali was transferred from the battery on the walls where he had originally been stationed to that on the lighthouse and when he beheld gun after gun tumbling helplessly over the crumbling parapets his spirit fired and he amazed his comrades by displaying a disregard of personal danger for which he had never before got credit  whether it was that ted flaggan had underrated him or that there is truth in the proverb about extremes meeting we cannot tell but certain it is that when rais ali saw every gun of the battery dismounted but one he rushed at that one like an enraged lion seized the rammer from the man who wielded it and began to load  he might have spared himself the trouble for before he got the charge rammed home a shot from the terrible queen charlotte struck the parapet just underneath burst it up and toppled the gun over  rais leaped on the ramparts waved his scimitar with a yell of defiance and tumbling after the gun was lost amid a cloud of limedust and debris  strange to say he rose from out the ruin almost unhurt and quite undismayed  hasting along the quay without any definite end in view he found the captain of the port getting the flotilla of gunboats ready for action there were thirtyseven of them and up to that time they had lain as snugly in the harbour as was compatible with a constant shower of shells and rockets tumbling into them  with great daring the pirates had resolved to make a dash with these under cover of the smoke and attempt to board the british flagship  where go you demanded the infuriated rais  the captain of the port hurriedly explained  i go with you cried rais jumping into one of the boats it is fateno man can resist the decree of fate  all the boats pushed swiftly off together and did it so silently that they were close under the bow of the flagship before being observed the leander also saw them and a few guns from her as well as from the flagship were instantly turned on them  musha look there cried ted flaggan who chanced to be on the part of the ship nearest them  a tremendous crash followed and thirtythree out of the thirtyseven boats were in one moment sent to the bottom  of the four that escaped and put about to retreat one came within the range of the gun at which flaggan served  it was trained to bear  fire said the captain  howld on cried ted suddenly clapping his hand on the touchhole and receiving the redhot poker on the back of it  whats that for mate demanded the man who held the poker as he quickly raised it  all right me hearty fire away said ted as he quietly removed his hand  next moment the gun leaped back as if affrighted at its own vomit of shot smoke and fire and a column of white foam rose from the sea astern of the boat  the momentary check had delivered it from destruction and ted flaggan had the satisfaction of knowing that he had saved his friend rais ali as he tenderly patted his injured hand  more than an hour of this heavy firing failing to produce submission lord exmouth resolved to destroy the algerine fleet  the leander was ordered to cease firing and the flagship barge under lieutenant richards was ordered to board the nearest frigate of the enemy with laboratory torches and carcass shells  this duty was gallantly performed and so effectually that the men of the barge had barely time to tumble over the side when the frigate was a mass of flames  the barge was received with three hearty cheers on its return  next the launch of the queen charlotte opened on the largest frigate in the port with carcass shells and despite the frantic efforts of the algerines to save her she was soon completely on fire  from this frigate the fire spread to all the other boats and vessels in the harbour and from these to the storehouses and arsenal until the whole place was wrapped in smoke and flames  meanwhile the other ships had done terrible execution on the walls and houses immediately opposite to them while the bombvessels threw their deadly missiles right over their own ships and into the town and arsenal with tremendous effect  thus the work of destruction went on all the afternoon while men of course fell fast on both sidesfor the deadly game of war cannot be carried on except at fearful cost  even in the secondary matter of materiel the cost is not small  as night approached the guns of the enemy were completely silenced and the ships began to husband their ammunition for they had by that time fired an immense quantity of gunpowder and 50000 shot weighing more than 500 tons of iron besides 960 shells of large size as well as a considerable quantity of shot shell and rockets from the flotilla  the result was that the entire fleet of the pirates was destroyed and the seadefences of algiers with a great part of the town itself were shattered and crumbled in ruins  then the fleet hauled off with considerable difficulty owing to the absence of wind but the pirates had not given in for they kept spitting at their foes from the upper batteries of the town until halfpast eleven at night when the ships got out of range and firing ceased  strange to say the powers of nature which had hitherto slumbered quietly now came into play  the breeze freshened and a tremendous storm of thunder lightning and rain came on as if to mock the fury of man and humble him under a sense of his relative littleness  but man is not easily humbled  next morning the pirates still showed a disinclination to give in and the british fleet resumed the offensive in order to compel them to do so  the gunboats were again placed in position and lieutenant burgess was sent ashore with a flag of truce to demand unconditional surrender    chapter twenty eight  the last  in a dimlylighted cell of a massive stone building not far from the palace of the dey sat colonel langley francisco rimini and his two sons bacri the jew and the officers and men belonging to the prometheusall heavily ironed  the padre giovanni was also there but not like the others a prisoner  he was attending to his selfimposed duty of comforting the sick and dying  among the other prisoners was an italian slave a nobleman who had broken down on the ramparts and rebelled and was sent to prison as being the most convenient hospital where he might be kept until the pirates should find leisure to flog him into submission or to death but death had a mind to do the work according to his own pleasure  the slave felt himself to be sinking and through the influence of bacri with the jailer he had been permitted to send for giovanni  other slaves were there too doomed to punishment or in other words to various degrees of torture  they lay or cowered around the cell awaiting the issue of the fight  it was a terrible sight to see the varied expressions of anxiety fear or dogged resolution depicted in the faces of these men  some of them knew well that death accompanied by excruciating torture was certain to be their portion when the bombardment should be over  others hoped that a severe bastinado might be the worst of it  none expected anything moreeven though the british should win the daythan that there would be some modification in treaties which would not extend to the slaves of foreign nations  they allwith the exception of the padremaintained an almost unbroken silence during the bombardment but their restless motions and glances showed how busy their thoughts were and a grim smile would ever and anon curl the lips of some when a chance shot struck the building and shook it to its foundation  and oh how anxiously one or two desperate spirits hoped that a shell would enter it and scatter sudden death among them all  it was solemn and strange too in the midst of the interminable thunder to hear the gentle voice of the man of god quoting from the peacespeaking word as he knelt beside the dying man and dwelling more especially on passages in which the loving jesus seeks to cheer his people with prospects of rest and peace such aspeace be unto you let not your hearts be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest  even the hardened among the wretched and demoralised sufferers there could not choose but hear and note the powerful contrast between the gentle voice of almighty god that thus murmured within the prison and the crashing voice of puny man that roared outside  in the darkness of that night bacri crept to the side of mariano and whispered hastily  i may not get another opportunity to speak to thee  just before i came hither angela and her sister were taken from my care by force  they are now in the palace under the care of zara  omar intends to keep them  mariano turned to reply but the jew had retired noiselessly as he came  early in the morning after the fight the prisondoor opened and a band of turkish soldiers entered  the garish light of day as it streamed over the dungeon floor revealed the fact that the shattered frame of the italian slave had found rest at last  the soldiers looked fagged and dishevelled  many of them wore bandages about their heads and limbs  they did not speak but drew up in a line while their leader advanced with a negro who proceeded to file the fetters from off the british consul and his countrymen  in a few minutes he led them out between the soldiers and conducted them towards the palace  although the turkish officer could not or would not converse with colonel langley the latter had little difficulty in making a pretty good guess as to how matters stood for on his way to the palace short though it was he saw devastation enough to convince him that the british had gained the day  arrived at the palace the party were locked up in an anteroom  meanwhile in the audiencehall which was considerably damaged by the artillery of the fleet omar dey held a divan  the building in which this court had been held in former times was now a ruin and many of the councillors who had been wont to assemble in it had gone to their last account  omar was very pale and moved with difficulty having been wounded slightly in various places  indeed all the statesmen who surrounded him bore marks more or less severe of having played a part in the late action  in the midst of an eager discussion an attendant entered and announced the arrival of a british officer with a flag of truce  admit him said the dey who although boiling over with rage and despair had sense enough to make up his mind to bow to the power which he could not overcome  immediately lieutenant burgess was ushered into the court accompanied by rais ali in the capacity of translator and two of his boats crew one of whom was by special permission ted flaggan  without wasting time in useless ceremony the lieutenant ordered rais to read aloud the paper which he had been commissioned by lord exmouth to deliver to the dey  poor rais ali appeared to have expended all his bravery on the ramparts for he trembled and grew paler as he took the paper in his hand  cheer up owld boy whispered flaggan as ali turned to advance towards the dey yeve got more pluck than i guv ee credit for  never say die  whether it was the result of these encouraging words or desperation we know not but rais immediately advanced and read the paper with considerable fluency  it ran as follows    to his highness the dey of algiers    sirfor your atrocities at bona on defenceless christians and your   unbecoming disregard of the demands i made yesterday in the name of   the prince regent of england the fleet under my orders has given you   a signal chastisement by the total destruction of your navy   storehouses and arsenal with half your batteries  as england does   not make war for the destruction of cities i am unwilling to visit   your personal cruelties upon the inoffensive inhabitants of the   country and i therefore offer you the same terms of peace which i   conveyed to you yesterday in my sovereigns name  without the   acceptance of these terms you can have no peace with england    if you receive this offer as you ought you will fire three guns and   i shall consider your not making this signal as a refusal and shall   renew my operations at my own convenience    i offer you the above terms provided neither the british consul nor   the officers and men so wickedly seized by you from the boats of a   british ship of war have met with any cruel treatment or any of the   christian slaves in your power and i repeat my demand that the consul   and officers and men may be sent off to me conformable to ancient   treatiesi have etcetera exmouth  the terms of peace referred to ran thus  i  the abolition for ever of christian slavery  ii  the delivery to my flag of all slaves in the dominions of the dey to whatever nation they may belong at noon tomorrow  iii  to deliver also to my flag all money received by the dey for the redemption of slaves since the commencement of this year at noon tomorrow  iv  reparation shall be made to the british consul for all losses he may have sustained in consequence of his confinement  v  the dey shall make a public apology in presence of his ministers and officers and beg pardon of the consul in terms dictated by the captain of the queen charlotte  the proud pirate chief did not move a muscle of his pale face or bend his head while these terms were read to him nevertheless he agreed to them all  the consul and others were called into the hall and delivered up the three guns were fired and thereafter lord exmouth directed that on the sunday following a public thanksgiving should be offered up to almighty god for the signal interposition of his providence during the conflict which took place on the 27th between his majestys fleet and the ferocious enemies of mankind  in accordance with these terms of peace all the christian slaves were collected next day and delivered up  sixteen hundred and fortytwo were freed on this occasion and sent on board the fleet  counting those freed but a short time before through lord exmouths influence along the barbary coasts the total number delivered amounted to above 3000  the assembling on the decks of the ships of war of these victims of barbaric cruelty ignorance and superstition was a sight that raised powerful and conflicting feelings in the breasts of those who witnessed it  the varied feelings of the slaves were to some extent expressed by their actions and in their faces  old and young were there of almost every nation gentle and simple robust and feeble men women and children  some on coming on board cheered with joy but these were few and consisted chiefly of men who had not been long enslaved and had not suffered much  others wept with delight fell on their knees and kissed the decks or returned thanks to god for deliverance some were carried on board being too ill or too broken down to walk many appeared to regard the whole affair as a dream too good to be true from which they must soon awakeas they had often awaked before after their uneasy slumbers in the dreadful bagnio  but the saddest sights of all were the men and women here and there among the crowd whose prolonged condition of slaveryin many cases ten twenty even thirty yearshad rendered them callous as well to joy as to sorrow taken in youth they were now old  what was freedom to them  it did indeed deliver them from the lash and from constant toil but it could not return to them the years that were gone it could not recall the beloved dead who had perchance found their graves sooner than might otherwise have been in consequence of the misery of hope long deferred or the toil beyond capacity induced by the desire to raise the needful ransom of the loved ones rent from them by these algerine corsairs the heart knoweth its own bitterness  none but themselves could know or tell the awful feelings or the still more dreadful want of feeling that caused these wretched ones to look with glazed eyes of total indifference on the wonderful scenes that were enacted around them that day  among the released captives of course were our friends of the rimini family  one of these was seen going about the decks glancing earnestly and quickly into faces as if in search of some one  it was mariano seeking for angela  he was closely followed by ted flaggan and lucien  depind on it theyve kep her back said ted  i fear they have said lucien  mariano said nothing but went straight to the officer in charge of the deck and demanded a body of men to go ashore and recover the sicilian captives  the case was brought before the chief who at once granted marianos request and sent a party on shore  arrived at the palace they made a formal demand that the sisters and the child should be delivered up  at first omar pretended ignorance on the point  then he suddenly recollected two female slaves who had been forgotten and sent for them but they were not those for whom mariano sought  at last seeing that there was no help for it he gave orders that paulina ruffini and her child and sister should be given up  need we say that mariano kept pretty close to angela after that and that angela did not by any means object  we think not  besides these captives there were a few others whom the dey endeavoured to retain but lord exmouth was inexorable  he insisted on every individual being set free and spared no pains to ascertain that none were left behind  of course it is more than probable that some unfortunates were so carefully concealed as to escape detection still as far as it lay in the power of man to act this part of the admirals duty was thoroughly performed  thereafter having accomplished its object the british fleet left the stricken city and the freed captives were ultimately returned to their homes  thus at last in 1816 after the lapse of centuries of murder rapine and robbery on the high seas did the pirate city receive a fatal blow from which it never completely recovered  it revived a little indeed in after years and made a struggle to renew its old strength and resume its old practices but fortunately for mankind the reigning dey in 1827 struck the french consul on the face with his fan  the french thereupon declared war and blockaded the town but it was not till 1833 that they set themselves vigorously to effect a conquest  in that year they landed an army in algeria at sidi ferruch and swept everything before them  the history of this conquestand of the subsequent wars of france in algeriais full of the deepest interest and most romantic incidents  the barbarians did indeed show fight and fought bravely but they might as well have tried to drive back the sea as to check the disciplined battalions of france  in a brief but brilliant campaign they were utterly defeated the dey capitulated the gates were thrown open and the french marched in and took possession  from that day to this they have held it and the pirate city is now a charming townwith a french foreground a moorish middledistance and a bright green backgroundin which along with frenchmen turks kabyles negroes and moors and amid orangegroves datepalms cacti and prickly pears the invalids of europe may enjoy summer heat in winter days and sit outside in december dreaming peacefully it may be almost sceptically of other days when the bastinado and the bowstring flourished in the land  less than sixty years ago the algerine corsairs were the pest of the civilised world and the terror of the mediterranean  now their city is one of our summer retreats a sort of terrestrial paradise and those who resort to it find it difficult to believe that the immediate forefathers of the finelooking fellows who saunter about the french boulevards and moorish streets were the ruthless pirates which history too surely proclaims them to have been  but what of the various characters whom we have thus summoned from the vasty deep of memory to play their little part in this veracious tale  of some we know not the end  of others it would be almost well that we did not  a few terminated their career happily  poor bacri fell a victim to the avarice of omar who desired to possess himself of the jews wealth  being an autocrat he easily found means to accomplish his purpose  he invited bacri to the palace conversed affably for a time and then bowed him out with a smile  on the stair as he descended the jew was met by three chaouses who seized him and took him to the stranglingroom  bacri was as we have said a powerful man and struggled long and vigorously for life  but what could he do unarmed against three stalwart men  he ultimately gave in with the name of the god of abraham isaac and jacob on his lips and perished as many a former chief of the jews in algiers had perished before him  rais ali having given as we have seen incontestable proof of his courage and fidelity during the bombardment was raised to a position of easy affluence and for many years continued a respected and harmless inhabitant of the town  his kindly disposition induced him to forego his mohammedan prejudices against christiansperchance his intercourse with christians had something to do with thatand he became a firm friend of the padre giovanni during the course of that good old mans career which did not last long after slavery was abolished  the same feelings induced him to befriend blindi bobi who was also a friend of the padre  poor ashweesha and her father sidi cadua perished under the rod and the bowstring and hadji baba the storyteller continued to tell stories and to jest to the end of his days  how the deys tolerated him has ever remained a matter of surprise to the thoughtful  ziffa his naughty daughter became a wife and a mother in connexion with three other wives who were also mothers and belonged to the turk whom we have more than once mentioned as the captain of the port  colonel langley returned to england with his wife and children inexpressibly glad to exchange the atmosphere of the crescent for that of the cross  ted flaggan was installed as butler to the family and remained in that position for many years  it is supposed by some of his descendants that he would have continued in it to the present day if any of the family had remained alive  as to the various members of the rimini family it may suffice that we should dismiss them by drawing a slight sketch  in a sicilian cottage near the sea a little old ladysome would say a dear little old ladysits in a highbacked chair  she gazes pensively now on the blue mediterranean now on a family group which consists of the darkeyed juliet and the earnest lucien who are vainly striving to restrain the violence of their youngest son the eldest being engaged in a surreptitious attempt to pull down a map of algiers which hangs on the opposite wall  mariano with his wonted vivacity stands before the old lady tossing a small female specimen of humanity as near to the ceiling as is compatible with prolonged existence  angela looks on admiringly  she does not appear to care much for mariano now  why she takes so much interest in the female baby we leave to the reader to discover  old francisco is there too bluffer and bolder than ever and so is paulina with a beautiful darkhaired girl who is the very image of the tall handsome man engaged in conversation with francisco  it is no accidental coincidence this meeting  it is a family gathering planned and carried out from year to year in commemoration of the day when the family was delivered from slavery and sorrow  they have just finished dinner and there has been much earnest thankful converse about the days gone by  they have fought their battles oer again  they have retold the ofttold tales feeling as if they were almost new and have reiterated their gratitude to the god of love for his great and manifold mercies  we have not space to relate all that they said but we may give the concluding sentences  youre a wild boy mariano as you always were said the little old lady with the rippling mouth as the young man plunged his little daughter into her lap headforemost  and as i mean to be to the end of the chapter replied mariano  how often grandmother have you not tried to impress on me the importance of following good examples  have i not acted on your advice  doubtless no man is perfect and i am farvery farfrom claiming to have been thoroughly successful in my efforts but i have tried hard  did i not while in algiers follow the example of my dear father in exhibiting at all times a spirit of obstinacy that all but drove the pirates delirious with rage  did i not afterwards imitate lucien your petpattern in getting to me the very best wife that the wide world could produce and do i not now intend to follow your own example in remaining young in spirit until i am old in years  taunt me not then with being wild you cannot cure me  i fear not replied the little old lady with a sigh which did not accord in the slightest degree with the ripples that played round her lips  wildness runs in the family mother said francisco with a broad smile and a glance at luciens eldest hope who had at that moment succeeded in breaking the string of the map and pulling algiers down on his head the riminis have it in the blood and boneget up and dont whimper theres a brave fellow added the burly merchant as the astonished youth arose i only wish that one of the great powers would pull down the real city of pirates as effectually as you have settled the map  lord exmouth no doubt gave it a magnificent pounding but utter obliteration is the only thing that will do  thats true father cried lucien it must be conquered by a civilised nation and the turks be driven out or held in subjection if europe is to have peace  depend ont they will be at their old tricks ere long  i should like to be commanderinchief when the war of conquest begins said mariano  a poor job youd make of it my son said francisco  why so father  why because hot blood and a giddy head with a revengeful spirit are not the best elements wherewith to construct a commanderinchief  ah father with every wish to be respectful i cannot refrain from reminding you of a certain pot which was reported once to have called a kettle black  ha continued mariano turning towards the little old lady you should have seen him granny in the bagnio of algiers when the guards were inclined to be rather hard on some of the sick  no no interrupted the old lady shaking her head dont talk of that  well i wont except to say that im thankful we are well out of it  it seems all like a strange dream returned the old lady thoughtfully  so it does mother murmured francisco so it doesan almost incredible dream  and so it seems to us reader now that we have closed the record of it nevertheless it was no dream but a sad and stern reality to those who played their part in itto those who sorrowed and suffered sixty years ago in the pirate city  the end
