dave what are you going to do with that revolver  phil and roger and i are going to do some target shooting back of the barn answered dave porter if we are going to try ranch life we want to know how to shoot  oh well do be careful pleaded laura porter as she glanced affectionately at her brother a revolver is such a dangerous thing  we know how to handle one phil has been painting a big door to represent a black bear and we are going to see if we can do as well with a revolver as we did with the rifle  do you expect to shoot bears on the ranch i didnt see any when i was out there  we dont expect to see them around the house but there must be plenty of game in the mountains  oh i presume thats true but i shouldnt want to hunt bearsid be afraid and laura gave a little shiver  girls werent meant to be hunters answered dave laughing but i shouldnt consider the outing complete unless i went on at least one big huntand i know phil and roger feel the same way about it  hello dave cried a voice from an open doorway and a handsome lad with dark curly hair showed himself coming  yes roger where is phil  gone to the field with his wooden bear roger morr looked at his chums sister want to come along and try your luck he questioned a fine box of fudge to the one making the most bullseyesi mean bearseyes  no indeed id be afraid of my life even to touch a revolver answered the girl but ill hunt up jessie and maybe well come down after a while to look on  oh you want to learn to shoot cried roger then when we get to star ranch you can dress up in regular cowgirl fashion and ride a bronco and fire off your gun in true western style  and have a big bear eat me up eh answered laura no thank youi want to come back east alive but ill come down to the field as soon as i can find jessie answered laura and walked away  a long melodious whistle was floating through the outside air and dave and roger knew it came from phil lawrence they hurried from the broad porch to the garden path and around the corner of the carriage shed here they came upon their chum carrying on his shoulder an old door upon which he had painted the upright figure of what was supposed to be a bear  hurrah for the great animal painter cried dave as he ran up and took hold of one end of the door phil you ought to place this in the academy of design  its superb was rogers dry comment best picture of a kangaroo i ever saw or is it a sheep phil  humph its a good deal better than you could have painted grumbled the amateur artist  sure it isbest photo of a tiger i ever saw said dave adding to the fun why you can almost hear him growl  see here if youre going to poke fun at me ill throw the target away i put in two hours of hard work and three cans of paint and  we wont say another word phil interrupted roger here let me take hold youve carried it far enough and he relieved phil of his burden  i wonder where would be the best place to set it mused dave gazing across the field  up against the tree over there answered phil pointing i had that spot picked out when i painted it well set it so that it will look as if his bearship was trying to climb the tree  its rather close to the back road protested dave we might hit somebody  oh hardly anybody uses that roadso the stableman told me answered roger besides we can watch out one always wants to be careful when shooting at a target or otherwise  the three youths soon had the target placed to their satisfaction and then began a lively blazing away with the three revolvers that had been brought along they aimed for the eyes of the painted creature and for other vital spots and all did fairly well  youre the best shot dave announced roger during a lull in the practice when all had gone to inspect the damage done youve plugged him right in the eyes three times and once in the heart had he been a real bear hed be as dead as a salt mackerel now  provided he had consented to stand still answered dave shooting at a stationary object is one thing and at a moving living creature quite another  i have it cried phil let us get a rope and throw it over one of the tree limbs then we can tie the door to it and swing it to and fro well try to hit the bear while hes swinging  thats the talk returned dave enthusiastically ill get the rope and he ran off to the barn for it little did he dream of what trouble that swinging target was to make for himself and his chums  many of my old readers already know dave porter but for the benefit of others a brief outline of his past history will not be out of place when he was a wee boy he had been found one day wandering along the railroad tracks outside of the village of crumville nobody knew who he was or where he came from and consequently he was put in the local poorhouse there to remain until he was nine years old then a brokendown college professor named caspar potts who was doing farming for his health took the lad to live with him  caspar potts gave dave the rudiments of a good education but he could not make his farm pay and soon got into the grasp of aaron poole a miserly moneylender who threatened to sell him out  things looked exceedingly black for the old man and the boy when something very unexpected happened as has been related in detail in the first volume of this series called dave porter at oak hall in crumville lived a rich manufacturer named oliver wadsworth who had a beautiful daughter named jessie some years younger than dave through an accident to the gasoline tank of an automobile jessies clothing took fire and she might have been burned to death had not dave rushed in and extinguished the flames  mr wadsworth was profuse in his thanks and so was his wife and both made inquiries concerning dave and caspar potts it was found that the latter was one of the manufacturers former college professors and mr wadsworth insisted that professor potts give up farming and come and live with him and bring dave along then he sent dave to boarding school where the lad soon proved his worth and made close chums of roger morr the son of a united states senator phil lawrence the offspring of a wealthy shipowner and a number of others  the cloud concerning his parentage troubled dave a great deal and when he saw what he thought was a chance to clear up the mystery he took a long trip from home as related in dave porter in the south seas after many adventures he found his uncle dunston porter and learned much concerning his father david breslow porter and his sister laura then traveling in europe  dave was now no longer a poorhouse nobody as some of his enemies had called him but a welltodo youth with considerable money coming to him when he should be of age while waiting to hear from his parent he went back to oak hall as related in dave porters return to school here he added to his friends yet some boys were jealous of his prosperity and did all they could to injure him but their plots were exposed and in sheer fright one of the lads ran away to europe  much to daves disappointment he did not hear from either his father or his sister but he did receive word that the bully who had run away from oak hall had seen them and so he resolved to go on another hunt for his relatives as told in dave porter in the far north he crossed the atlantic with his chum roger and followed his father to the upper part of norway here at last the lonely lad met his parent face to face a meeting as thrilling as it was interesting he learned that his sister had returned to the united states and with some friends named endicott had gone to the latters ranch in the far west  mr oliver wadsworths mansion was a large one and by an arrangement with him it was settled that for the present the porters should make the place their home all in a flutter of excitement laura came back from the west and the meeting between brother and sister was as affecting as had been that between father and son the girl brought with her some news that interested dave deeply it was to the effect that the ranch next to that of the endicotts was owned by a mr felix merwell the father of link merwell one of daves bitterest enemies at oak hall link had met laura out there and gotten her to correspond with him  its too bad laura i wish you hadnt done it dave had said on learning the news it may make trouble for merwell is no gentleman and trouble it did make as the readers of dave porter and his classmates know the trouble went from bad to worse and not only were laura and dave involved but also pretty jessie wadsworth and several of daves school chums in the end dave took the law in his own hands by giving link merwell a sound thrashing then some of the bullys wrongdoings reached the ears of the master of the school and he was ordered to pack his trunk and leave and a telegram was sent to his father in the west stating that he had been expelled for violating the school rules he left in a great rage  this is the work of that miserable poorhouse rat dave porter link told some of his cohorts just waitill fix him for it some day see if i dont then he wrote a most abusive letter to dave but in his rage he forgot to address it properly and it never reached the youth  the term at oak hall came to an end in june and then arose the question of what to do during the vacation in the meantime letters had been flying forth between laura and her warm friend belle endicott who was still at star ranch as mr endicotts place was called it may be said in passing that mr endicott was a rich railroad president and the ranch while it paid well was merely a hobby with him and he and his family resided upon it only when it suited their fancy to do so  the endicotts want me to come out again said laura to dave they want me to bring you along with some of your chums and they want me to bring jessie too if her folks will let her come  oh that would be jolly dave answered when he thought of jessies going he blushed to himself for to him the girl whose life he had once saved was the nicest miss in the whole world dave was by no means sentimental but he had a warm manly regard for jessie that did him credit  more letters passed back and forth and it was finally arranged that laura and dave should visit star ranch during july and august taking with them jessie and phil and roger dunston porter was to accompany the young folk as far west as helena near which the endicotts were to meet the travelers and then daves uncle was to go on to spokane on business coming back to take the young folks home about six weeks later  the thoughts of spending their vacation on a real ranch filled the young folk with delight all anticipated a jimdandy time as phil expressed it  we can go out hunting and fishing and all that declared the shipowners son to his chums and maybe well bring down a bear or two and then he suggested that they get revolvers and perfect themselves in marksmanship  maybe well run into link merwell out there said roger my but he was mad when he left oak hall hed like to chew your head off dave  i dont want to see him answered dave soberly but this wish was not to be fulfilled he was to meet link merwell in the near future and that meeting was to be productive of some decidedly unpleasant results     chapter ii  a stray shot   dave soon returned to the field with a rope and the representation of a bear was swung from the lower limb of an old apple tree then another smaller line was fastened at one side so that the bear could be swung to and fro  you can do the first shooting said dave to his chums ill play bellman and he pulled on the side rope so that the door swung like the pendulum of a clock  hi dont swing too fast called out phil sixty seconds to the minute remember  he took his position and watching his chance fired  hows that he asked after the report had died away  hit his bearship in the left ear announced dave  humph i aimed for his right eye  the senators son now tried his luck and managed to hit the representation of a bear in the tail this made all the lads laugh and roger and phil called on dave to show his skill  i dont think this revolver works very well said the senators son handing the weapon to dave the trigger seems to catch in some way  oh dont blame the pistol for your poor shooting roger cried phil goodnaturedly  well examine the pistol for yourself phil  dave took the weapon and snapped the trigger there was no report and he tried again aiming at some brushwood not far from the apple tree the brushwood was close to the back road  its all right now i guess he said as the pistol went off with ease but that trigger ought to be looked after he added you wouldnt want it to miss fire at a critical moment  he stepped forward and while roger swung the representation of a bear he fired another shot  good for you exclaimed the senators son in admiration you took him right in the throat dave  hold up there stop that do you hear me you young rascals do you want to kill me  the call came from the back road and looking in that direction the three boys saw a welldressed man coming toward them on the run he was carrying a whip and his face was full of sudden passion  its aaron poole nats father said dave as he lowered the pistol in his hand  i say are you trying to kill me cried the miserly moneylender of crumville as he came closer and he shook his whip at dave  why no mr poole answered dave as calmly as he could what makes you think that  oh you neednt play innocent snarled aaron poole you just fired a shot at me it went through my buggy top and the moneylender pointed to the back road where stood his horse and carriage nice doings i must say  mr poole i didnt fire at you answered dave i didnt know anybody was out there on the roadand i didnt fire in that direction  you fired into the bushes when you tried the pistol said roger in a low voice  maybe the bullet went through the bushes suggested the shipowners son  you fired at mei heard the shot and saw you with the pistol stormed aaron poole ive a good mind to have you arrested  mr poole why should i fire at you asked dave i  oh you neednt try to smooth it over you young rascal i know you you are down on me because i made caspar potts pay me what was due and you are down on my son nat because he is more popular at oak hall than anybody else  well to hear that whispered phil he knew as well as did the others that overbearing nat poole had scarcely a friend left at the school the lads attended on several occasions nat had tried to harm dave but each time he had gotten the worst of it  i didnt fire at youdidnt know anybody was on the back road protested dave if a bullet went through your buggy top i am sorry for it but i am also glad it didnt go through your head and dave had to shudder as he thought of what might have happened after this ill be more careful when i shoot  oh dont you try to smooth it over snarled aaron poole i know you of old dave porter you are always up to some underhanded tricks nat knows you too maybe you didnt mean to kill me but you meant to scare me and you took a big chance for i might have been hit i think ill swear out a warrant for your arrest  oh mr poole dont do that cried phil in alarm dave didnt know anybody was back there it was purely an accident  humph who are you id like to know  i am phil lawrence i go to oak hall with dave i think we have met before  oh yes ive heard of youthrough my son nat you sided with porter against my son of course youll stick up for porter now i think ill go right down to town and get a warrant and have it served and the moneylender made as if to walk away  if you have dave arrested we can testify that it was nothing but an accident said roger  bah it was no accidenthe either meant to hit me or scare me ill have the law on him stormed aaron poole and then he hurried away dave followed wishing to argue the matter but the moneylender would not listen and leaping into his buggy he drove off at a rapid gait in the direction of crumville center  now i wonder what i had better do said dave soberly after the angry man had departed  do you really think hell have you arrested questioned the senators son  more than likely  but you didnt shoot at him it was nothing but an accident  you can trust mr poole to make out the blackest kind of a case against me answered dave bitterly he has been down on me for years and you know how nat is down on me too hell have me sent to prison if he can  well stand by you said phil we know you didnt shoot at himor at anybody  i think i had better tell my father about this went on dave all his interest in targetshooting had ended he will know what is best to do  well leave the target where it is said roger then we can explain just how the thing occurred  with downcast heart dave left the field and approached the mansion and his chums went with him just as they reached the piazza the door opened and laura came out accompanied by jessie wadsworth  oh are you coming back asked laura we were just going to join you  maybe youve killed the bear cried jessie with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes i heard that phil had manufactured one  no answered dave wethat is ihad some trouble with mr poole he turned to his sister where is father  gone out of town on business hell be back this evening  and uncle dunston  uncle went with him  oh thats too bad and daves face showed more concern than ever  what was the trouble about asked jessie who was quick to see that dave was ill at ease  oh mr poole thought i shot at himbut i didnt replied dave and then told the story  oh dave do you really think hell have you locked up burst out his sister while jessies face showed her deep concern  i dont know what hell do was the slow answer  oh maybe he wont do anythingafter he calms down said the shipowners son hell realize that dave wouldnt do anything like that on purpose  you dont know mr poole said jessie father says he is one of the most hardhearted men around here  well let us hope for the best said the senators son he wanted to cheer up laura and jessie quite as much as dave  the boys put the pistols away and then went out in a summerhouse to talk the affair over  if he has me arrested i suppose that will stop my going out to star ranch said dave gloomily too bad and just when i was counting on having the time of my life  oh dont take it so to heart dave cried phil maybe youll never hear of it again  hell hear of it if mr poole tells nat said the senators son nat will want his father to make all the trouble possible for dave  where is nat now at home  yes answered dave i saw him yesterday down at the postoffice  then hell surely hear about it  at first dave thought to tell caspar potts about the affair but then he realized that the professor was too old to aid him besides the aged man was not well and the boy hated to disturb him  the middle of the afternoon came and went and nothing was heard from aaron poole mrs wadsworth went out carriageriding taking the girls with her  let us take a walk proposed phil no use in hanging around the house for nothing  i dont want mr poole to think i ran away answered dave  nevertheless he agreed to go with his chums and they started off leaving word that they would be back in time for dinner which was served at the wadsworth mansion at halfpast six  id like to see that place where you used to live with professor potts said the senators son to dave is it far from here  quite a distance but we can easily walk it was the reply  they passed out on the country road and were soon tramping along in the direction of the old potts place as they went on they talked over the proposed trip to the west  we ought surely to have the time of our lives said the shipowners son just think of riding like the wind on some of those broncos  or getting flung heels over head from a broncos back added roger i rather think well have to be careful at first  one thing i dont like about this trip said dave  the fact that link merwells father owns the next ranch to the star  exactly  oh ranch homes out there are sometimes miles apart said roger you may not see the merwells at all  that will just suit meand i know it will suit laura too she is awfully sorry that she once corresponded with link  well she didnt know what he was answered the senators son ever since he had met laura he had been much interested in daves sister  the three chums had covered about half the distance to the old potts place when they saw a horse and buggy approaching as it came closer they saw that it contained two men  its mr poole cried dave and then as he caught sight of the other mans face he turned a trifle pale step behind here he called to phil and roger and pulled them back of some handy bushes  the horse and buggy soon came up to them and passed on the three boys keeping out of sight until the turnout was gone dave gave a deep sigh  i guess mr poole means business he said  what do you mean questioned the senators son  i mean he is going to have me locked up  why asked phil  that man in the buggy with him was mr mardell the police justice     chapter iii  an interview of interest   well i shouldnt go back home until your father and your uncle return said the senators son then if you are arrested theyll know exactly what to do  its too bad it happened murmured dave i wish i had gotten off to the west without seeing aaron poole but i suppose there is no use in crying over spilt milk ill have to face the music and take what comes  the three lads went on and presently came in sight of the farm where caspar potts and dave had once resided the ground was now being cultivated by the man who had the next farm and the house was tenantless  ive got the key of the house said dave if youd like to take a look inside ill unlock the door but its a very poor placea big contrast to the wadsworth residence  and so you used to work here dave said phil gazing around at the fields of corn and wheat  yes ive plowed and worked these fields more than once phil and in those days i didnt know what it was to have a nice suit of clothes and good food but professor potts was kind to me even if he was a bit eccentric  it was a grand thing that you found your folksand your fortune said roger  yes and i am thankful from the bottom of my heart  the three boys entered the deserted house and dave showed the way around there was the same little cot on which he had been wont to stretch his weary limbs after a hard days work in the fields and there were the same simple cooking utensils with which he had prepared many a meal for himself and the old professor conditions certainly had improved wonderfully and for the time being dave forgot his trouble with aaron poole no one could again call him a poorhouse nobody  from the cottage the boys walked to the barn as they entered this building they heard earnest talking in the rear  you are a mean lad to tease an old man like me they heard in caspar pottss quavering tones why cannot you go away and leave me alone  dont you call me mean came in nat pooles voice ill do what i please and you cant stop me  i want you to leave me alone reiterated the old professor  i willwhen i am done with you how do you like that old man and then nat poole gave a brutal laugh  oh oh dont smother me spluttered caspar potts please leave me alone you have ruined my clothes  i wonder whats up said dave to his chums and ran through the barn to the rear there he beheld caspar potts in a corner in front of him stood nat poole holding a big garden syringe in his hands the syringe had been filled with a preparation for spraying peach trees and the son of the moneylender had discharged the chalklike fluid all over the aged professor  nat poole what are you up to cried dave indignantly and leaping forward he caught the other youth by the shoulder and whirled him around you let professor potts alone  dave cried the professor and his voice showed his joy oh i am glad you came that young man has been teasing me for over a quarter of an hour and he just covered me with that spray for the peachtree scale  what do you mean by doing such a thing demanded dave give me that syringe and he wrenched the article from the other youths grasp he looked so determined that nat became alarmed and backed away several feet  dont youyouerhit me cried the moneylenders son  what a mean piece of business observed roger as he came up followed by phil nat you ought to be ashamed of yourself  oh you shut up grumbled nat not knowing what else to say  i always thought you were a firstclass coward put in phil now i am sure of it  this is none of your affair phil lawrence  i should think it was the affair of any person who wanted to see fair play answered the shipowners son  nat you take your handkerchief and wipe off mr pottss clothes said dave sternly  eh queried the moneylenders son in dismay  you heard what i said go and do it and be quick about it  ieri dont have to  yes you do if you dont dave ended by walking over to a barrel and filling the syringe with the spraying fluid  hi dont you douse me with that yelled the other youth in alarm then he started to run away but the senators son caught him by one arm and phil caught him by the other  youve got no right to hold me  well well take the right said roger calmly now nat do as dave told you  there was no help for it and with very bad grace the moneylenders son drew from his pocket a silk handkerchief and removed what he could of the fluid from caspar pottss clothing many spots remained  i am afraid the suit is ruined said the aged professor sorrowfully anyway it will need a thorough cleaning  if it is ruined nat can pay for it said dave firmly  ill pay for nothing grumbled the boy who had done the mischief he was short of spendingmoney and knew how hard it was to get an extra dollar from his parent  he certainly ought to pay for it said caspar potts some men would have him locked up for what he has done  humph dont talk foolish it was only a little fun grumbled nat i didnt mean any harm you can easily get those spots out of your clothes  did he do anything else to you asked dave of the professor  yes he plagued me a good deal and he shoved me down in the cowyard was the reply i was hoping some one would come to drive him away i said id have the law on him but he laughed at me and said nobody else was around and his word was as good as mine  if that isnt nat to a t murmured the senators son doing the sneak act every time  well we are witnesses against him put in phil he looked at dave and suddenly began to grin oh but this is great he cried  whats struck you queried dave  oh nothing only i reckon weve got a good hold on mr aaron poole nowin case he tries to make a complaint against you  to be sure we have burst out roger he wont dare to do itafter he knows what professor potts can do  what are you talking about demanded nat curiously is my father going to make a complaint against dave what is it for  maybe youll learn laterand maybe you wont answered the senators son but if you see your father you had better tell him to call it off as far as dave is concernedif he wants to save you  then youve had trouble eh  no worse than thisif as bad  humph in that case my father wont believe what you say about me cried nat cunningly and then of a sudden he leaped back turned and ran around a corner of the barn at top speed he made for the road and was soon hidden from view by trees and bushes phil and roger attempted to catch him but dave called them back  no use in doing that said dave let him go it will be time enough to say more when mr poole makes his complaint  the three youths assisted caspar potts in rearranging his toilet and in the meantime the aged professor told the lads the details of his trouble with nat the moneylenders son had certainly acted in a despicable manner and he deserved to be punished  i will leave the matter to mr wadsworth and to your father and your uncle said professor potts to dave they will know better what to do than i  on the way back to the wadsworth mansion the boys told of the pistol incident and the professor became much interested he agreed with phil and roger that nats doings were much worse  daves father and his uncle had returned and the youth went straight to them with his tale then mr wadsworth came in and was likewise told all the men were also informed of what had happened to caspar potts  i think i see a way of clearing this matter upif mr poole attempts to act against dave said mr wadsworth and then he had a long talk with professor potts  the folks at the mansion had just finished dinner when visitors were announced they proved to be aaron poole and an officer of the law brought along to arrest dave  i think you had better let me engineer this affair said mr wadsworth and so it was agreed he entered the reception room and shook hands formally with aaron poole  i came to get dave porter said the moneylender stiffly i am going to have him locked up  mr poole will you kindly step into the library with me answered mr wadsworth  what for  i wish to have a little conversation with you  it wont do any good im going to have that porter boy arrested and that is all there is to it  i wished to see you about your son nat do you know that he stands in danger of arrest  arrest nat queried the moneylender and the officer of the law looked at the rich manufacturer with interest  yes come into the library please  want me asked the officer  no returned mr wadsworth shortly and the man settled back in his chair his face showing his disappointment  once in the library the manufacturer shut the door with care he motioned his visitor to a chair but aaron poole was too impatient to sit down  now whats this about my son nat growled the moneylender  ill tell you was mr wadsworths reply and he related what had occurred at the old potts place  you expect me to believe this snarled aaron poole  believe it or not it is the truth and i have the three boys to prove it and likewise professor pottss ruined suit of clothing now continued the manufacturer i know all about your charge against dave ill not say that he wasnt careless because he was but he meant no harm and it is going too far to have him arrested it would be much fairer for professor potts to have your son locked up and make you pay for the suit of clothing in the bargain now the professor thinks a great deal of dave and he is willing to drop his complaint against nat if youll drop your complaint against dave  oh so thats the way the wind blows eh snarled aaron poole well i wont do it he snapped im going to have dave porter arrested  if you do professor potts will have nat arrested and well push our case just as hard as you push yours mr poole  humph i guess this is a plot to free dave porter  you can think what you please this is the way i look at it dave was careless and his father can give him a lecture on his carelessness nat was brutal and it is up to you to take him in hand if he were my son id give him a good talking toand maybe id thrash him added the rich manufacturer warmly  oh you are all down on my sonjust as you are down on me cried aaron poole ill look into this illill  dont do anything hasty advised mr wadsworth better talk the matter over with nat  ill do it but ill not drop this matter ill get after dave porter yet cried aaron poole and then he stalked out of the library and motioning for the officer of the law to follow him he left the mansion     chapter iv  caught in the act   i dont think hell do anythingthat is if he gets the truth out of nat said mr wadsworth as he rejoined the others of course if his son denies the attack on the professor it may be different  if nat does that well have the testimony of the professor phil and roger against him said mr porter  it must be admitted that the next day was an uncomfortable one for dave for he did not know at what moment an officer of the law might appear to arrest him in the afternoon he and his chums went fishing but he had little heart for the sport  early on the day following ben basswood called to see dave and the others as my old readers know ben had been a friend to dave for many years and had gone from crumville to oak hall with him  was coming before to meet you and roger and phil said ben but i had to go out of town on business for dad how are you all say i hear you are going out west on a ranch thats great going to shoot buffaloes i suppose  no hippopotamuses put in the senators son with a grin  and june bugs added phil  youll sure have the time of your lives wish i was going but i am booked for the great lakes which isnt bad going to take the trip from buffalo to duluth and back you know but say i came over to tell you something  what is it ben questioned dave  come on outside  the boys walked out into the garden and down to the summerhouse where they proceeded to make themselves comfortable  its about nat poole continued ben basswood i guess you had some kind of a runin with him didnt you  not exactly answered roger we caught him tormenting professor potts and we put a stop to it  well you had some trouble with nats dad didnt you  yes answered dave did nat tell you he added quickly  no i know of the whole thing by accident i had to go to the building where mr poole has his new office while i was waiting to see a man and deliver a message for my dad i overheard some talk between mr poole and nat it was mighty warm i can tell you  what was said demanded phil  mr poole accused nat of something and nat at first denied it then mr poole said something about arrest and professor potts and nat got scared and begged his father to save him then mr poole mentioned dave and a pistol and said he couldnt do anything if thats the way matters stood and nat began to beg for dear life asking his father to let dave alone this time at last mr poole said he would but the way he lectured nat was a caution he said he wouldnt give nat a cent more of spendingmoney this summer  hurrah that lets you out dave cried roger the case against you is squashed  the pooles will have to let it drop added the shipowners son and i am mighty glad of it  i hope you are right said dave and his face showed his relief  they had to tell ben all about what had happened then the latter wanted to see the bear target and the crowd ended by doing some more target practicing but this time dave was very careful how he shot and so were the others  it had been decided that the start for the west was to be made early the following week and for several days the boys and the girls were busy getting ready laura had traveled a great deal so the journey would not be a novelty to her but with jessie it was different  i know i shall like it once i am there said jessie but oh it seems such a distance to go  well take good care of you answered dunston porter  and i am sure youll like mrs endicott and belle added laura belle is as full of fun as aaoh i dont know what  shad is of bones suggested dave who stood by  oh what a comparison cried jessie and then giggled in the regulation girl fashion  they were to take a local train to buffalo and change at that city for chicago ben basswood decided to go with them as far as buffalo so there would be quite a party the boys gathered their things together and were ready to start a full day beforehand the buying of railroad tickets and berths in the pullmans was left entirely to dunston porter  a farewell gathering had been arranged for the young people by mrs wadsworth to take place on the afternoon previous to their departure for the west about a dozen boys and girls from crumville and vicinity were invited the party was held on the lawn of the wadsworth estate which was trimmed for the occasion with banners flags and lanterns a small orchestra located in the summerhouse furnished the music  of course dave and his chums donned their best for this occasion and laura and jessie appeared in white dresses that were as pretty as they could be jessies wavy hair was tied up in new ribbons and as dave looked at her he thought she looked as sweet as might a fairy from fairyland he could not help smiling at her and when she came and pinned on his coat a buttonhole bouquet he thought he was the happiest boy in the whole world  oh but wont we have the grand times when we get out west he said to her  i hope so dave she answered but  but what jessie he questioned as he saw her hesitate  ii cant get that link merwell out of my head i am so sorry his fathers ranch is next to that we are going to visit  oh dont worry well make link keep his distance he returned lightly yet it must be confessed that he was just a bit worried himself  among the first boys to arrive was ben basswood and he lost no time in calling phil and roger aside  i dont want to worry dave or the others said ben but i think somebody ought to be told  told what asked the senators son  about nat poole i got the word from a friend of mine joe devine joe was talking with nat poole and he said nat was very angry at all of us and angry because mrs wadsworth was giving us the party especially as he wasnt invited joe said nat intimated that he was going to make the affair turn out a fizzle  a fizzle queried phil how  joe didnt know but he told me on the quiet that i ought to watch out and ought to warn the others but i dont like to say anything to mrs wadsworth or the girls you see it may be only talk and if it is whats the use of getting the ladies excited  it would be just like nat to play some dirty trick said the shipowners son the question is what will it be  somebody ought to stand guard was rogers advice and i think we ought to tell dave  this was readily agreed upon and dave was told a few minutes later his face at once showed his concern  it mustnt be allowed he said earnestly i dont care so much on my own account but think of mrs wadsworth and the girls yes we must keep our eyes open and if anything goes wrong he finished with a grave shake of his head  what are you boys plotting about asked laura as she came up come it wont do to stick together like this with all the girls arriving dave go and make folks at homeand you do likewise she added with a smile at phil and roger  the boys dispersed and mingled with the arriving guests dave did all he could to make everybody feel at home but all the while he was doing it he kept his eyes wide open  presently chancing to look in the direction of the automobile house dave saw somebody skulking along a hedge the person was visible only a second so the youth could not make out who it was  maybe its all right but ill take a look and make sure he told himself and excused himself to a girl to whom he had been talking as he hurried across the lawn he passed phil  come with me will you he said in a low voice  see anything demanded the shipowners son  i saw somebody but i am not sure who it was  taking care not to make his departure noticeable dave walked toward the automobile house and phil followed him soon the pair were behind some rose bushes and then they gained the shelter of the heavy hedge  there he is said dave in a low voice its nat poole sure enough  whats he doing asked phil  nothing just now but i guess he is up to something  keeping well out of sight behind the hedge the two boys watched the son of the moneylender nat was sneaking past the automobile house and making for a washingshed adjoining the kitchen of the mansion  i think i know what he is up to murmured dave come on after him phil  as silently as shadows dave and phil followed the moneylenders son to the shed once nat looked around to see if the coast was clear and the followers promptly dropped down behind a lilac bush reassured nat entered the shed and dave and phil tiptoed their way up and got behind the open door  the hired help were in the kitchen so the shed was empty on the floor stood an icecream freezer full of homemade icecream and on a shelf rested several freshly baked cakes all covered with chocolate icing set out to harden  now ill fix things dave and phil heard the moneylenders son mutter salt in the cream and salt in the layer cakes will do the trick some of the boys and girls will think they are poisoned  nat took up a bag of salt that was handyused for making the creamand proceeded to open the can in the freezer dave watched him as a cat does a mouse  just as nat was on the point of dumping some of the salt into the icecream he felt himself jerked backwards the salt dropped to the floor and nat found himself confronting dave with phil but a few steps away  you contemptible rascal cried dave his eyes flashing  whyier stammered the moneylenders son he did not know what to say  going to spoil the cream eh came from phil it was a mighty dirty trick nat  on a level with what you did to professor potts added dave  ieri wasnt going to do nothing cried nat with little regard for grammar ieri was looking at the icecream thats all  a poor excuse is worse than none answered dave grimly you were going to put salt in the cream and spoil it you neednt deny it  see here dave porter i want you to understand  dont talk nat we know all about it broke in phil you planned to come here yesterday and we can prove it we were on the lookout for you  at this assertion the face of the moneylenders son changed he grew quite pale  i havent time to waste on youi want to enjoy this party said dave come along with me  where to demanded nat  ill show you answered dave and caught the moneylenders son by the arm catch hold of him phil and dont let him escape     chapter v  at niagara falls   see here i want you to let me alone stormed nat poole and he tried to jerk himself free  listen nat said dave sternly if you make a noise it will be the worse for you for it will bring the others here and then well tell about what you tried to do maybe mrs wadsworth will call an officer and anyway all the girls and the boys will be down on you now if you want phil and me to keep this a secret youve got to come along with us  where to grumbled nat doggedly  youll soon see returned dave briefly and with a wink at his chum  somewhat against his will nat walked toward the end of the garden he wished to escape from mrs wadsworth and the others but he was afraid dave and phil contemplated doing something disagreeable to him maybe they would give him a sound thrashing  dont you touch medont you dare he cried when the barn was readied remember my father can have you locked up dave porter  well dont forget what professor potts can do to you nat answered dave  what are you going to do asked phil in an aside to his chum  dave was trying to think he had been half of a mind to lock nat in the harness closet until the party was overthus preventing him from making more trouble now however as he heard a locomotive whistle a new thought struck him  come on down to the railroad tracks nat he said  what for  maybe you can take a journey for your healthif the freight train stops at the water tank  ieri dont understand  you willif the train stopsand i think it will  the three boys pushed off across the fields to where the railroad tracks were located here was the very spot where dave had been picked up years before not far off was a water tank where the locomotives usually stopped for their supply a long freight train was just slowing down many of the cars were empty and the doors stood wide open  up you go nat cried dave  me where  into one of the empty cars you are going to have a ride for your health  not much why that train dont stop short of jacks junction twelve miles from here  i know it you can walk backthe exercise will do you good  ieri dont want to go and nat made as if to run away but dave and phil held him  but you are going cried dave in you go  he and phil forced the moneylenders son toward one of the open cars still protesting nat was shoved up and through one of the open doors the door on the other side was closed he ran to it but found it locked from the outside  hi you let me off he cried as the train gave a jerk and commenced to move  dont jump you might hurt yourself cried dave and shoved the door shut  hope you have a pleasant journey called out phil merrily  and a nice walk back added dave  the freight train quickly gathered headway dave and phil ran down by the side of the tracks they saw nat shove back the door about a foot and peer out he did not dare to jump and seeing them shook his fist wildly  hes off cried the shipowners son and then commenced to laugh dave that was just all right hes booked for quite a journey  twelve miles or more and hell either have to wait for a train and pay his fare back or walk  exactly and if the train hands catch him maybe theyll give him the thrashing he deserves  theyll hustle him off pretty lively thats sure well one thing is certain he wont bother this party any more added dave let us get back  they hurried to the house and as they did so the freight train passed out of sight and hearing they thought they had seen the last of nat but they were mistaken  where have you boys been asked laura when they reappeared after having brushed off their clothing  ill tell you later answered her brother  anything serious  not very its all over now laura  the party was now in full swing and proved a big success the boys and girls played all sorts of games and also did a little dancing then refreshments were served when the ice cream and cake were passed around phil and dave could not help but look at each other and the shipowners son winked suggestively  why are you winking at dave demanded roger  did i wink questioned phil solemnly and then dave began to laugh and almost choked on a piece of cake in his mouth  after the refreshments came more games and some singing and it was nine oclock before the lawn party came to an end the girls and boys from the town went home mostly in pairs but ben remained behind for he knew dave and phil had something to tell all the lads congregated in the summerhouse and laura and jessie went with them  wanted to spoil the icecream and chocolate layercakes cried jessie oh how mean  it served him right to put him on the freight train was lauras comment i hope he was carried about fifty miles and has to walk back  hell be trying another trick before we leave said roger we must keep our eyes open  isnt it a shame he cant be nice came from jessie if he keeps on like this hell not have a friend in the world  well he hasnt many friends now answered dave at oak hall the majority of the fellows turned him down just as they turned down link merwell  oh that link merwell sighed laura i trust i never see or hear of him again  bright and early the next day the boys arose and packed the last of their baggage the girls were up too and joined the lads at the breakfast table daves father was there and also uncle dunston as well as mr and mrs wadsworth  well i certainly hope you all have a grand time said the rich manufacturer  and i hope the outing does jessie good said his wife jessie was not very strong and the doctor had said that a trip to the far west might do much towards building up her constitution  you must write often said mr porter to his daughter and make dave write too  ill not forget said the daughter and dave nodded  it was rather a sober meal although every one tried to be cheerful the big touringcar mr wadsworths latest purchase was at the door and the baggage had gone on ahead soon it was time to go  goodby everybody cried dave and shook hands with his father and mrs and mr wadsworth the lady of the house gave him a warm kiss and kissed all the others  wish you were going too daddy cried laura to her father  well ill go the next time was the answer with a smile  in another five minutes the boys and girls and dunston porter were off for the depot the others waving their hands as the travelers disappeared tears came to mrs wadsworths eyes at the parting with jessie yet she did her best to smile  well be back in six weeks called out dave and as brown as berries and as strong as oxen and this caused everybody to laugh little did any of them realize what adventures those six weeks were to contain  the train for buffalo was on time and when it rolled into the station they climbed on board and the boys found the right seats in the parlor car and settled the girls ben was there and had a seat with the crowd  ive got news said ben as the train went on its way nat poole isnt back yet  who told you  tom marvin he called this morning to see nat about something nat had sent a telegram home from a place called halock stating he had been carried off on a freight train  humph then he went further than we supposed he would mused phil where is halock  nobody knew and they consulted a timetable taken from a rack in the car  its a flagstation not far from buffalo announced roger say he certainly was carried some distance  what if he didnt have any money to get home with asked laura  maybe he telegraphed for some said phil  he could pawn his watchhe always wears one added ben but it is queer that he didnt get off at jacks junction  perhaps he liked to rideafter he once got used to it returned the senators son  on and on went the train stopping at several towns of more or less importance the girls and boys amused themselves studying the timetable and in gazing out of the window and dunston porter told them of some of his experiences while roving in various portions of the globe for as my old readers are aware he was a great traveler at noon they went into the diningcar for lunch and dave and roger sat at one table with laura and jessie opposite to them  say this puts me in mind of a story as shadow hamilton would say said the senators son as the train rushed along while they ate a little girl had a sandwich on a train like this once and then boasted afterwards that she had eaten a sandwich three miles long  well i think ill eat some roast beef ten miles long said dave and two miles of apple pie to boot and this caused the girls to giggle  they reached buffalo in the middle of the afternoon and there had to wait until halfpast ten for the night express to chicago here ben left them for the boat he was to take was waiting at the dock  send me a letter to duluth he said on parting and dave promised to do so  ill tell you what we might do said dunston porter we can take a trolley trip to niagara falls and come back on a train we have plenty of time  oh yes id like to see niagara cried jessie clapping her hands  the others all voted the suggestion a good one and soon having checked their baggage at the depot they boarded a trolley car bound for the falls  we can look at the falls for an hour get supper and still have time in which to return to buffalo said mr porter when we get there we can get a carriage to drive us around  the trolley car made good time and it was still daylight when niagara was reached hackmen were numerous and dunston porter soon engaged a turnout to take them around goat island and other points of interest they could hear the roaring of the falls plainly and the sight of the great cataracts impressed them deeply want to go down under the falls asked phil as they were riding along  no indeed answered laura  we havent time anyway answered roger weve got to get back or well miss that train for chicago and that wont do for our berths have been engaged ahead  at the bridge leading to the three sisters islands the whole party alighted so as to get a better view of the upper rapids of the river as they did so a youth seated on a rock near by looked at them in amazement then of a sudden he slipped off the rock and dodged out of sight  the youth was nat poole     chapter vi  nat pooles little game   it may not be out of place here to relate how nat poole happened to be at niagara falls and how he chanced to have with him a man who was willing to do almost anything for the sake of a little money  when nat was placed aboard of the freight train by dave and phil he was in a great rage yet powerless for the time being to help himself the train moved so swiftly that he did not dare to jump off and soon crumville was left far behind  as soon as he had cooled off for a little nat found out that he was very tired he had been out the night before with some of the fast young men of the town playing cards and pool and had had but two hours sleep in twentyfour he found a pile of old bagging in one end of the freight car and sat down to rest presently his eyes closed and before he knew it he was sound asleep he continued to sleep during the stop at jacks junction and he did not notice another party enter the freight car nor did he notice the door being closed and locked  when nat awoke it was with a sense of pain the other party in the car had stepped on his ankle he gave a cry and this was answered by an exclamation of astonishment  who are you asked nat sitting up and then leaping to his feet  i reckon i can ask the same question returned the stranger  are you a train hand  are you  no  neither am i  there was a moment of silence after this and then the unknown lit a match and held it close to nat both gave a cry of astonishment  hello you are nat poole the boy i met at rallys pool parlors said the stranger  yes and you are tom shocker the traveling salesman  right you arebut im not a traveling salesman any longer answered tom shocker and gave a short laugh  why asked nat  lost my job  i suppose your boss found out that you were spending your time playing cards and pool said nat how did you make out after i left you  lost all i had thats the reason i am stealing a ride on this freight answered the man but what are you doing here he continued in curiosity  in his own fashion nat related how he had been attacked by two of his former school enemies dragged to the car and thrown in he added that he had been next to unconscious and so was unable to fight off dave and phil then he asked how tom shocker happened to be on board  i got on at jacks junction said the man i havent got but fifty cents left and i thought id beat my way to buffalo where i think i can get some more cash but i didnt think theyd lock the door of the car  during the ride to halock tom shocker managed to learn a good deal about nat and his trouble with dave and the others and he also learned that the youth had considerable spendingmoney with him the car was opened at halock and run off on a siding and the pair got off  let us take a trolley to buffalo said shocker there we can get a room at a hotelthat is if youll put up the price  all right i might as well go to buffalo now i am so close answered nat but ill send word home first he added and this was done  after resting at a hotel in buffalo tom shocker proposed a trip to niagara falls nat of course to pay the way  ill pay you back some day said shocker offhandedly when i strike another situation ill have plenty of cash and in the meantime if you want me to do anything for you say the word i am open for any proposition that you may offer  on the way to the falls tom shocker told much about himself and nat learned that the fellow was one of those shiftless mortals who change from one situation to another he had been a salesman on the road for five different concerns had run a restaurant a poolroom and a movingpicture show and had even been connected with a prizefighting affair he did not care what he did so long a it paid and many of his transactions had been of the shady sort  nat did not enjoy the visit to the falls as much as he had anticipated he found tom shocker rather coarse and the man wanted to drink whenever the opportunity afforded from the rapids below the falls the pair walked to goat island and there nat was on the point of giving shocker the slip when he chanced to see dave and the others of the party  whats the matter demanded shocker who stood close by as he saw the moneylenders son dart out of sight behind the rocks  do you see that boy demanded nat pointing with his hand  yes  that is dave porter the fellow who put me on the freight car and over yonder is phil lawrence the other chap  you dont say what brings them here  they are on their way out west and i suppose they ran up here to see the sights ii wish i could do something to em added nat bitterly  maybe you can answered tom shocker always open for action ill tell you one thing he continued in a low tone if they had treated me as they treated you id not let them off so easily  will you help me if iertry to fix that dave porter asked nat he started it i dont care so much about lawrence  sure ill help you anything you say goes answered tom shocker readily he thought he saw a chance of getting another dollar or two out of nat  the two walked behind some bushes and there talked the matter over for several minutes  fargos is the place to go to said shocker presently i know we can trust him  of course i dont want to hurt porter said nat nervously i only want to scare him  sure i understand well scare the wits out of him returned tom shocker now let me see i have itwell catch him on the bridge his carriage is bound to come that way to get off goat island  dave and his friends spent the best part of a quarter of an hour around the three sisters islands and then returned to their carriage  now we can go to the hotel and have dinner said dunston porter and then we can take a local train back to buffalo  the carriage was just crossing the bridge that connects goat island with the city of niagara falls when a man stepped up and stopped the turnout it was tom shocker  excuse me but i reckon this is the number 176 he said is there a young man here named david porter  yes i am dave porter answered dave and looked at shocker curiously the fellow was a total stranger to him  got a note for you went on shocker and produced it it was sealed and marked private in plain letters  wondering what the note could contain dave opened and read it his face changed color and he gave a little gasp  excuse me ill have toto leave you for a little while he stammered to the others  whats the matter asked roger  ii cant tell you just now dave turned to his uncle where will you get dinner uncle dunston  at the international  all rightill be there before long answered dave and sprang to the ground  but whats up cried phil he could see that his chum was much disturbed  ii cant tell you phil but ill be back before you finish your dinner  dont you want some one along asked laura who did not like to see her brother depart in the company of such a looking stranger as tom shocker  no laura oh its all right ill be at the international on time said dave and then he hurried over the bridge and down a side street of the city in company with tom shocker  the note dave had received was written in a cramped hand and ran as follows       dear daveyou will be surprised to receive this but i saw you      in town today and noted the number of your carriage i am in deep      trouble and would like you to come and see me in private if only      for five or ten minutes you can aid me a great deal please dont      tell any of the others of your party the man who brings this to      you will take you to me please please dont disappoint me                                                             yours truly                                                           andrew dale  andrew dale was the first assistant teacher at oak hall and an instructor who had made himself very dear to dave and some of the other boys he had sided with dave when the latter was termed a poorhouse nobody and this had made teacher and pupil close friends  whats the matter with my friend asked dave as he and tom shocker hurried through several side streets of the city  i dont know exactly was the reply money matters i think and the gent is sick too he wanted it kept very quietsaid it might ruin his reputation if it got out  well i didnt say anything to anybody answered dave how much further have we to go  only a couple of blocks  but the couple of blocks proved to be five and they had to make another turn or two then they came to the side door of a building used as a lodging house and a pool and billiard parlor this resort was run by a man named bill fargo a sport who had once had dealings with shocker in a prizefighting enterprise  hes got a room hereup on the third floor said shocker as he saw dave hesitate come on ill show you  he went ahead up the somewhat dilapidated stairs and dave followed in the pool and billiard parlors below some men were laughing and talking and clicking the ivory balls together but upstairs it was silent and nobody seemed to be around  during the past few years of his life dave had had a number of stirring adventures and he was by no means as green as he had been when first he had set out for oak hall he did not like the looks of his surroundings and he resolved to keep his wits about him and be on his guard  why should mr dale come to a place like this he asked himself he knew the teacher to be a model man who did not drink or gamble  here we are said tom shocker as he stopped in front of a door at the back of the hallway on the third floor of the building i guess you can go right in hes on the bed with his broken ankle  his broken ankle repeated dave why didnt you tell me of that before  i thought i did returned shocker smoothly here you are its dark isnt it ill light the gas and he commenced to fumble in his pocket as if hunting for a match  it was dark and for several seconds dave could see little or nothing he heard a faint groan  is that you mr dale he asked kindly  a low reply was returnedso low that dave could not make out what was said he went into the room a few steps further as he did so tom shocker closed the door and locked it dave heard the click of the locks bolt and wheeled around  what did you do he demanded sharply  i guess ive got you now dave porter cried another voice and now dave recognized the tones of nat poole you played me a scurvy trick by putting me aboard the freight train i guess its about time i paid you back dont you think so     chapter vii  in which dave is robbed   dave found himself in a decidedly unpleasant situation the door of the room was locked and tom shocker stood against it the man lit the gas but allowed it to remain low dave saw nat poole standing close to a bed the moneylenders son had a small bottle and some cotton in his hand  i suppose this is a trick said dave as coolly as he could  rather good one too isnt it returned nat lightly  that depends on how you look at it nat did you forge mr dales name  whyerier  that isnt a nice business to be in  humph you neednt preach to me dave porter you played a dirty trick on me and i am going to pay you back  what are you going to do  youll see soon enough  i want you to open that door cried dave wheeling around and confronting tom shocker open it at once  this is none of my affair mr porter answered the man with a slight sneer you can settle it with mr poole  ill settle with you you rascal cried dave and leaping forward he caught tom shocker by the shoulder and forced him aside give me that key  dont you do it cried nat here wait ill fix him hold him  nat poured some of the stuff in the bottle on the cotton and advanced on dave at the same time tom shocker caught dave by both arms and essayed to hold him  dave was strong and a sudden fear gave him additional strength he might have been a match for his two assailants but for the stuff on the cotton this was chloroform and when nat clapped the saturated cotton to his mouth and nose he was speedily rendered all but unconscious  dont give him too much he heard tom shocker say  you watch him while i tie his hands answered nat and then dave was forced back and onto the bed he struggled weakly but could not free himself and before he realized it he was a close prisoner with his hands tied fast to the head of the bed and his feet fast to the lower end he was flat on his back  now you can stay there until somebody comes to release you said nat mockingly i reckon that will teach you a lesson not to send me off on freight trains  nat ive got to get back to buffalo to catch my train for chicago  humph not tonight youll stay here  the others will worry about me  let them worry ill be glad of it  better destroy that note suggested tom shocker then he noticed daves watch and chain and valuable stickpin and his eyes glistened he began to wonder how much money the lad had in his pocket  the note was taken by nat then the moneylenders son took a soft pillow and placed it over daves face  that will keep you from calling too loudly he said i guess it wont hurt your breathing though come he added to the man let us get out of here before somebody comes  all right answered tom shocker he gazed wistfully at daves watchchain and at the stickpin ierall right he added and followed nat to the door  the pair walked outside and the man locked the door then both hurried below and out of the side door to the street they went as far as the corner  let us make for the depot said nat who was plainly nervous now that the trick had been played he was becoming alarmed over the possible consequences you dont think hell smother he asked anxiously  smother not a bit of it answered tom shocker hell be out of that room inside of an hour he wasnt tied very hard and hes sure to make a racket sooner or later  tom shocker went with nat a distance of two blocks more and then came to a sudden halt  by jove i forgot he cried i must see my old friend dickson before i leave town it wont take me but a few minutes you go to the depot and wait for me and before the moneylenders son could reply he was off down another side street  tom shocker was well acquainted with the thoroughfares of niagara falls and it did not take him long to double on his tracks and return to fargos resort he mounted the stairs pulling his hat far down over his forehead as he did so then he tied his handkerchief over the lower portion of his face he had the key of the room still in his possession and with it he unlocked the door  the light was still burning and on the bed he could see dave struggling to free himself of his bonds and of the pillow which still rested lightly over his head holding the pillow in place with one hand shocker gained possession of the watch and chain and stickpin with the other then he took from daves pocket a small roll of bankbills he tried to appropriate the lads ring but could not get it off the finger  dave finding himself being robbed struggled harder than ever but the bonds held and he was helpless to protect himself in less than two minutes tom shocker accomplished his purpose and then he glided out of the room silently once more locking the door once on the street he set off on a brisk walk but he did not go in the direction of the depot  i reckon i can afford to part company with poole now the man told himself wont there be a row when that porter gets free but he cant blame me he added with a chuckle  left once more to himself dave continued to struggle and at last he managed to toss the pillow from his face then he breathed more freely for which he was thankful  what a mean trick he murmured as he saw that his watch was gone  presently he heard footsteps passing along the hallway and he uttered a call the footsteps came to a stop  come in here please he called i need help  whats up asked somebody outside and then the door was tried soon a key was inserted in the lock the door was opened and a chambermaid showed herself  untie me at once cried dave  the maid turned up the gas and then uttered a cry of astonishment without waiting to question the youth she flew out of the room and down the stairs to return a few minutes later with a burly man  whats this mean asked the man as he commenced to untie the ropes that held dave  its a trick that was played on me answered dave thinking rapidly he was on the point of stating that he had been robbed but he did not wish to create too much of a scene he felt sure that nat would sooner or later return his belongings to him  a trick eh said the hotel proprietor certainly a queer one where are the fellows who hired this room  i dont know they tied me fast and left  did you know them  i knew one of themhe goes to boarding school with me  oh i see a schoolboys trick eh you schoolboys are up to all sorts of pranks  you dont know where they went to do you questioned dave as he leaped up from the bed and stretched himself  no i havent the least idea they hired this room for tonight thats all  i think ill try to catch them said the youth much obliged for setting me free  you are welcome but say i dont want any more skylarking around here added the proprietor of the resort as dave hurried out of the room and down the stairs  he had found his hat on the floor and after brushing up a little he started on a brisk walk for the hotel where the others were to have dinner he did not of course know the way and so hired a newsboy for a dime to act as guide  dave you have been away a long time cried laura as he appeared we have almost finished eating  never mind i can get all i wish in a few minutes he answered  why your stickpin is gone cried jessie and your watchchain too  dave have you been robbed questioned his uncle quickly  yes and no he answered with a grim smile i suppose i might as well tell you what happened he continued and then gave a few of the details then he had to tell his uncle how nat had been put aboard the freight car  well its a case of tit for tat i suppose said dunston porter you can thank your stars that you got away so quickly a little later and you would have missed the trainand we would have missed it toofor i should not have gone on without you  i suppose nat thinks he has the laugh on you said roger but what of your watch and pin and money are you going west without them  i suppose ill have to but ill make him give them up in short order ill send him a telegram  tell him if he doesnt send them on by express at once that you will put the case in the hands of the law said phil that will scare him  dave was quickly served with a meal and he lost no time in eating what he wanted then the entire party walked toward the railroad station to catch the train for buffalo  i was a chump to follow that man up into that room said dave to his chums next time ill be more on my guard but i thought mr dale must be in some dire trouble  it was a nervy thing to doto forge his name was the comment of the senators son its a pity you didnt keep the note  i couldnt after i was tied up they had me at their mercy  who was the man  i dont know i never saw him before  he must have been some friend of nats  i suppose so  arriving at the station they found they had several minutes to wait when the train rolled in all got on board but roger who was buying a late newspaper from a boy on the platform  hurry up or youll get left cried dave  ill get on the car behind cried the senators son and did so he did not rejoin his companions until the train was on its way towards buffalo  what do you think he cried nat poole is on board  nat ejaculated dave is that man with him  no nat seems to be alone  did he see you  i dont think so he was crouched down in a seat as if in deep thought  ill interview him said dave and left the car followed by phil roger and his uncle  dont quarrel on the train cautioned dunston porter but insist upon it that nat return your belongings  roger readily led the way to where the son of the crumville moneylender sat crouched down and with his eyes partly closed when touched on the shoulder nat sat up and a look of fright came into his face  whyerwhy he stammered and was unable to proceed  didnt expect to see me quite so soon did you returned dave pleasantly and dropped into the seat beside him nat if its all the same to you ill take my watch my stickpin and my money he added coldly  your what exclaimed nat then he stared blankly at dave ieri dont understand you  yes you do i want my things and i want them at once  i havent got your things and you neednt say i have retorted the moneylenders son oh i see how it is he added struck by a sudden thought you want to play another joke on me dont you well it wont work this time i didnt touch your things and you know it     chapter viii  the youth in the balcony   for a moment dave stared at nat poole in perplexity he saw that the moneylenders son was in earnest like a flash he realized that something was wrong  see here i want no more fooling nat he said sharply my watch and chain my scarfpin and thirtythree dollars in bills were taken from me either by you or your companion i want them back and now  dave youeryou dont mean that youyou wererobbed nat could hardly utter the words his teeth were fairly chattering with sudden fright  i certainly was if you want to call it by such an ugly name  but i didnt touch the things you know i didnt  then your companion did  no he didnt he came away with me you know that all we did was to tie you fast and throw that pillow over your face then we came away and locked the door it was only a bit of fun to pay you back for putting me on the freight car  one of you came back and took the things i couldnt see who it was for the pillow was still over my head  i didnt come backi give you my word of honor shocker must have done it oh the rascal and now nats face showed his concern  who was that man asked the senators son  a fellow i met in crumville a few days ago he appeared to be straight enough and then nat told his story from beginning to end he said that he had hung around the depot waiting for tom shocker to come but that the fellow had failed to show himself  its as plain as day said phil if nats story is true this shocker went back and robbed dave  yes but if he did nat is partly responsible for he left me tied up said dave  of course he is responsible came from roger  i dont see how grumbled the moneylenders son but his uneasiness showed that he thought as did the others  youll see how if that shocker doesnt show up with my things said dave sternly ill hold you and your father responsible for every dollars worth  this threat almost caused nat to collapse and he felt even worse when dave added that the scarfpin and the watch and chain were worth about one hundred dollars  im going to hunt up shockers address as soon as i get home said nat ill run him down see if i dontand ill make him give the things up too  well ill give you a fair amount of time answered dave after that ill look to you and your father to make good  fortunately for dave he could easily get along without the watch and the scarfpin and his uncle let him have some money in place of that taken but mr porter told nat that his father would have to settle the matter if tom shocker was not brought to book  at buffalo the others separated from nat poole who said he was going to take the early morning train home nat felt very bad over the outcome of his joke and to a certain extent dave and his chums felt sorry for him  i was a big fool to take up with a stranger like shocker said the moneylenders son youll not catch me doing it again i only hope i can lay my hands on him then just as he was about to leave he turned back and beckoned dave to step to one side  what do you want now asked dave  i want to show you that ierthat is i am not the enemy you think dave was the low answer i am going to give you a warning i wasnt going to say anything at first its about a letter i got from link merwell  merwell and now dave was all attention  yes he sent it to me from chicago where he is stopping on his way to his fathers ranch he said he had heard that you were going to the endicott ranch and he added that if you came out west he would see to it that you got all that was coming to youthose are his very words  when did you get this letter  a couple of days ago take my advice and beware of him for he means business when he left oak hall he was the maddest boy i ever saw he will do something awful to you if he gets the chance  ill be on my guardand i am much obliged for telling me said dave and then he and nat separated not to meet again for many weeks  the train for chicago was already standing in the station and the porters and their friends were soon on board the two girls had a private compartment and the others several sections and all proceeded to make themselves at home  i never get into a sleeping car without thinking of old billy dill the sailor who went with me to the south seas said dave to laura and jessie he thought wed have to sleep in the seats and when the porter came and made up the berths he was the most surprised man you ever saw  and where is he now asked jessie  in a home for aged sailors father and uncle dunston have seen to it that he is comfortably cared for  i must visit him some day said laura just think if it hadnt been for him we might never have met dave and she gave her brother a tight hug  the train was a comfortable one and all of the party slept well when they arose they found themselves crossing the level stretches of indiana the boys and mr porter took a good washup and were presently joined on the observation end of the car by laura and jessie  what a beautiful morning cried jessie  i feel just as if id like to get out and walk added laura and this caused the others to laugh  they had an appetizing breakfast of fruit fish eggs and rolls with coffee and took their time over the repast then dunston porter pointed out to them various points of interest before long they reached a small town and then came to the suburbs of the great city by the lakes  here we are cried roger at last as they ran into the immense train shed here all was bustle and seeming confusion and they picked their way through the crowd with difficulty the boys rather enjoyed this but it made laura and jessie shrink back  why its as bad as new york said jessie  almost answered dunston porter come well soon find a couple of carriages to take us to the hotel  that the girls and the others might see something of chicago it had been arranged to remain in that city two days they were to stop at a new and elegant hotel on the lake shore and thither they were driven with their baggage  it certainly is as bustling as new york was rogers comment as they drove along just look at the carriages and autos and trucks  this afternoon well hire an automobile to take us around said dunston porter it is the only way to see a good deal in a little time  they were fortunate in getting good accommodations at the new hotel and the boys and girls were struck by the elegance of the rooms and later by the sumptuousness of the dininghall  why its fit for a palace declared jessie  beats the crumville hotel doesnt it said dave dryly and this caused the girls to giggle and the other boys to laugh  an automobile was engaged at the stand in the hotel and immediately after lunch the whole party went sightseeing visiting the lake front lincoln park and numerous other points of interest at the park they alighted to look at the animals and this pleased the girls especially  tomorrow morning ill have a little business to attend to said dunston porter and ill have to let you take care of yourselves for a few hours i propose that you boys take the girls around to some of the big department stores  oh yes cried laura who had a womans delight for finery jessie was also interested for her opportunities for visiting big stores were rare  mr porter had already purchased tickets for one of the theaters where they were playing a wellknown and highly successful comedy drama and this they attended that evening after dinner at the hotel their seats were on the right in the orchestra so they had more or less of a chance to view the opposite side of the auditorium  they certainly have a full house said roger who sat on one side of dave while jessie sat on the other i believe every seat is taken  that shows that a good drama pays answered dave this is clean as well as interesting his eyes were roving over the sea of faces upstairs and down i wonder how many a theater like this can hold  two thousand perhaps  it certainly looks it roger that gallerywell i declare  what is it asked the senators son  do you see that fellow in the front row in the balcony the one next to the aisle  yes what of him  looks to me like link merwell  oh dave you must be mistaken  i dont think so it looks like merwell and nat poole said he was in chicago  so he did now you speak of it he does look like merwell wish we had an opera glass we might make sure  ill see if we cant borrow a glass said dave  he looked around and saw that a lady directly in front of jessie had a pair of glasses in her lap he spoke to jessie and the girl asked the lady to lend her the glasses for a minute and the favor was readily granted for it was between the acts and there was nothing on the stage to look at dave adjusted the glasses and turned them on the balcony  its merwell right enough he announced  let me see said the senators son and took the glasses from dave as he pointed them at the youth in the balcony the latter looked down on roger and those with him he gave a start and then leaned forward  its merwell and he sees us cried roger  whats up asked phil who was some seats away  link merwellup in the balcony answered dave and pointed with his finger phil turned in the direction and as he did so link merwell doubled up his fist and raised it in the air for an instant  merwell sure as youre born said the shipowners son and full of fight  oh dave you mustnt quarrel here whispered laura who sat on the other side of roger  well not quarrel here answered her brother but i am glad i saw him he added to his chums now we can keep on our guard  the play went on and for the time being the boys and the girls paid no further attention to link merwell just as the final curtain was being lowered dave looked up toward the balcony  he has gone he announced  perhaps he was afraid wed come after him suggested phil  maybe he came downstairs to watch for us added roger keep your eyes open when we go out  they did as the senators son suggested they saw nothing of merwell in the foyer but came face to face with the former student of oak hall on the sidewalk he glared at them but then seeing dunston porter at daves side slunk behind some other people and disappeared from view  my what an ugly look said laura with a shiver  he looked as if he wanted to eat somebody up was jessies comment oh dave you must be careful  i wish his fathers ranch wasnt so close to mr endicotts continued daves sister i declare the more i think of it the more nervous it makes me  dont you worry laura or you either jessie answered dave well take care of link merwell if he tries any of his games hell get the worst of itjust as he got the worst of it at oak hall  but though dave spoke thus bravely he was much disturbed himself he could read human nature pretty closely and that look in merwells face had showed him that the fellow meant to do harm at the first opportunity that was afforded     chapter ix  only a street waif   in the morning dunston porter left the hotel early stating that he would not return until lunch time the boys and girls took their time over their breakfast and then started out for a tour of the big stores located on state street  two hours were spent in a way that pleased laura and jessie greatly the girls purchased several things to be mailed to the folks left behind then all walked around to the postoffice both to see the building and to send the things away  it was while the others were addressing their packages and also some picture postcards that dave saw a sight that interested him greatly near one of the doorways was a small and ragged newsboy with half a dozen papers under his arm an older youth had him by the shoulder and was shaking him viciously  i say it was a fivedollar gold piece i gave you yesterday by mistake the older boy was saying i want it back  no it wasnt mister the boy answered it was a cent nothing but a cent  i know better you little thief give me that gold piece or ill call a policeman and again the big youth shook the ragged newsboy causing the papers to fall to the sidewalk  why its link merwell murmured dave to himself and he stepped in the direction of the pair who were disputing merwell had his back to dave and did not see him  are you going to give me my gold piece or not demanded link merwell and now he gave the newsboy such a twist of the shoulder that the ragged lad cried out with pain  i dont know anything about your gold piece cried the boy for at least the tenth time let me go please mister i aint no thief  ill twist your little neck off for you muttered merwell and was on the point of hitting the boy in the face when dave stepped up behind him and caught his arm  dont you know better than to hit a little chap like this merwell he demanded  porter muttered the western youth and his face took on a sour look say this aint none of your affair he burst out you keep your hands off  please dont let him hurt me pleaded the ragged newsboy i didnt do wrong mister i aint seen no gold piece he gave me a cent yesterday for a newspaper thats all and the boy looked imploringly at dave  hes got a fivedollar gold piece of mine cried link merwell i want it and whats more dave porter i want you to keep your nose out of my business he added fiercely  merwell answered dave as calmly as he could i have no desire to interfere in your business but i am not going to stand by and see you abuse this boy or anybody else i know just the sort you area bully  bah just because you had me expelled from oak hall you think you can do anything dont you well just wait till you get out west thats all ill show you a thing or two you wont forget as long as you live  take care that you dont get the worst of it merwell now let that boy go and dave came a step closer and clenched his fists  going to help the rascal steal five dollars from me  he says he knows nothing of your gold piece and he looks honest to me why arent you more careful of your money  hes got my gold piece and i know it declared link merwell loudly if he dont pass it over im going to have him arrested  quite a war of words followed the loud talking attracting a crowd including phil and roger and the girls the ragged newsboy broke down completely and commenced to cry bitterly  this is a shame merwell said the senators son i think as dave does that the newsboy is honest if you are so hard up ill give you five dollars out of my own pocket and he produced a roll of bills  i dont want your money morr answered merwell in a rage i am going to make this boy give me back my gold piece  say you said a man who had listened to the talk for several minutes when did you lose that fivedollar gold piece  yesterday morning answered link merwell i bought a newspaper from this boy and after a while i found out i had given him a fivedollar piece in place of a cent  did you buy any postage stamps about the same time went on the man  whyeryes i did link merwell gave a start say did  you did answered the man with a sarcastic grin im the clerk at that window and im just going to lunch he explained to the crowd you bought five twocent stamps and threw down a nickel and what i supposed were five pennies when i looked at them i saw one was a fivedollar gold piece i tried to call you back but you got out in such a hurry i couldnt locate you if youll come back with me ill give you the gold piece in exchange for one cent  there you are merwell cried dave now you can see how you were mistaken in this boy  link merwells face was a study he felt his humiliation keenly and it is safe to say he would rather have lost his five dollars than have been shown up in the wrong  all right ill go back and get my gold piece he muttered  i think you owe the newsboy an apology said phil  oh you go to thunder snapped merwell and pushed out of the crowd as fast as he could several followed him and saw him get his gold piece and they passed all sorts of uncomplimentary remarks on his actions  the girls had become interested in the ragged newsboy and after he had picked up his newspapers they took him to an outoftheway corner and questioned him he said his name was charley gamp and that he was alone in the world  my mother died some years ago he said i dont know where my father is he left us when i was a baby  and do you make your living selling newspapers asked laura  mostly but sometimes i carry bundles and run on other errands answered charley gamp  and where do you live questioned jessie  oh i live with an old woman named poseythat is when i can pay for my bed when i havent the price i go down to the docks and find a bed among the boxes and things  you poor boy murmured jessie and something like tears came into her eyes she turned to laura cant we do something for him  perhaps answered laura at any rate we can give him some money  the boys came over and all had a talk with charley gamp who told much about his former life when his mother had been alive of his father he knew little or nothing excepting that he had not treated his mother fairly according to the story told by some former neighbors  i wish we could get him some sort of regular employment and give him a chance to go to school said dave let us ask uncle dunston about it he knows quite a number of people in chicago  if you want to do something for me ill tell you what said charley eagerly i need a new pair of shoes and he looked down at his foot coverings which were full of holes  and i should say that you needed a new suit of clothes too said laura  and a new cap added jessie ill get you the cap she went on a real nice one too  in spite of his rags and his dirty face and hands charley gamp had a winning way about him and the boys and girls easily induced him to follow them to the hotel here they waited for the return of dunston porter and then asked what might be done with the waif  youll have your hands full if you want to help every waif that comes along said daves uncle with a smile every big city has hundreds of them  well we cant aid every one but we do want to aid charley answered laura and then she and the others told of what had occurred at the postoffice  i dont know exactly how much we can do said dunston porter slowly i know a number of people here it is true but whether any of them will want to bother with this lad is a question however after lunch ill look into the matter  as the urchin was too dirty and ragged to eat in the hotel he was given a quarter of a dollar for his dinner and told to come back in half an hour this he did willingly and a little later mr porter dave and the two girls sallied forth to see what could be done for the homeless boy  the quest was more successful than they had anticipated mr porter knew a certain mr latham who was in the wholesale fruit business and this gentleman agreed to give charley gamp a job at two dollars a week and his board he was to live with a man who had charge of a warehouse where fruit was unloaded and was to be sent to night school  this settled the waif was fitted out with new clothing and other things and the boys and girls and mr porter made up a purse for him of twenty dollars  you had better put the money in a bank said dave then you can use it as you need itor put more to it  twenty dollars gasped charley gamp when he saw the money wow say ill be a millionaire before you know it wont i and this remark caused a laugh he promised to put the money in a savings bank where it would draw interest and said he would try his best to add to it from his weekly wages  and will you go to school regularly asked mr porter  yes sir ill give you my word replied the street boy promptly  and as soon as you learn to write you must send us letters put in jessie i shall wish to hear from you very much  ill write miss i can write a little alreadyprinting letters answered charley gamp  then here is my address and jessie handed over her card and laura did the same mr latham promised to let mr porter know how the boy got along and also promised to make some inquiries in the hope of locating the lads father charley gamp was extremely grateful for all that had been done for him and when he parted from his new friends there were tears in his eyes  my mother used to tell me there was angels he said to jessie and laura i didnt believe it much but i do now cause youre angels and he nodded his head earnestly to show that he meant what he said  and now ho for the boundless west cried dave when the party was on its way to the depot now for the plains and the mountains the canyons and the rivers the cattle and the broncos the campfires and the cowboys and the lasso and the rifle the  hello dave is wound up interrupted the senators son  must have some of that ranch air in his lungs already added phil i suppose the first thing youll want to do will be to break in a bronco ride a couple of hundred miles and lasso a couple of dozen buffaloes  sure thing answered dave then well build a roaring campfire cook a tenpound bear steak and eat it shoot half a dozen apache indians find a few fifteenpound nuggets of gold andwake up and find the mince pie you had for supper didnt agree with you and this unexpected ending brought forth a roar of laughter in which even mr porter joined  you wont find it so exciting as all that at star ranch said laura after the others had quieted down but i think youll be able to put in the time doing one thing or another  i reckon well hunt up some excitement said the senators son and they did as we shall speedily see     chapter x  off for the boundless west   this is certainly the boundless west  it was dave who spoke and he addressed the others who were on the rear of the observation car with him as far as the eye could reach were the prairies dotted here and there with hillocks and clumps of lowgrowing bushes behind were the glistening rails and the wooden ties stretching out until lost in the distance  a night and the larger part of the next day had been spent on the train they had crossed the mississippi and made several stops of more or less importance including those at st paul and minneapolis and now they were rushing westward through north dakota to montana  it was a warm sunshiny day and the young folk and mr porter enjoyed the trip to the utmost daves uncle had traveled through that section of the country several times and he pointed out various objects of interest  i havent seen any indians yet said jessie with a pout i thought wed see some by this time  well see them a little further west answered dunston porter theyll come down to the railroad stations to sell trinkets and his words proved true they saw a dozen or more redmen and their squaws the following morning at a station where they stopped for water but the indians were so dirty that neither jessie nor the others wanted to trade with them although one indian had a set of polished horns roger admired very much  never mind well get some horns at star ranch said laura the cowboys know how to polish them just as well as these indians and theyll sell their work just as cheaply too and this proved to be true  they passed livingston which as dunston porter told the young folks was the transfer point for yellowstone park and then continued on their way to helena here the young folks left the train to continue their journey on a side line running northward  sorry i am not going further with you said dunston porter as he kissed his niece and shook hands warmly with the others i hope you get to the ranch in safety and dont forget to send word to me at spokane as well as to send word home  and youll be sure to come to the ranch for us in about a month asked laura  yes unless some special business detains me and then ill wire when i can come was the reply and then the train rolled off dunston porter standing at the end waving the boys and girls adieu  now we have got to take care of ourselves remarked the shipowners son girls you dont feel afraid do you  oh we are not so very far from star ranch answered laura and youll remember i asked mr endicott by telegraph to have somebody meet us if hes at the ranch maybe hell come himself and bring belle i know belle will be just wild to see what sort of a brother i have found she added with a warm glance at dave  i hope she likes me laura i know i am going to like her shes a jollylooking girl by her picture  oh i know shell like you jessie you had better look out went on laura in a whisper and this made jessie turn very red dave heard the words and grew red too and commenced a lively conversation with phil and roger about nothing in particular  the train on the side line was a big contrast to the luxurious coaches they had just left the cars were of the oldfashioned variety and but two in number and drawn by an old mountain engine that had seen better days moreover the roadbed was very uneven and the cars rocked from side to side as they rolled between the hills towards bramley where the young folks were to get off the cars were about half filled with miners and cattlemen and a sprinkling of hunters and sightseers and the boys and girls overheard a good deal of talk about steers and horses mines and new discoveries and about the outlook for hunting and fishing  why mr todd is that you cried laura suddenly as a cowboy was passing through the car where she sat  it sure is me miss porter answered the cowboy coming to a halt with a broad grin on his weatherbeaten face must be you are on your way to the ranch he added  we are answered laura i am glad to see you she held out her hand which the cowboy took very gingerly removing his sombrero at the same time this is my friend miss wadsworth and this is my brother dave and his two school friends mr morr and mr lawrence this is mr sidney todd mr endicotts head man she explained  just sid todd miss thats good enough for me said the cowboy as the others shook hands with him one after the other i aint used to no handle i aint the boss thought you might be on this train but he wasnt sure when i left he told me to keep an eye open for you though i hope you had a nice trip  we have had a lovely trip mrtodd said jessie she could not quite bring herself to drop the mister  ive heard of you said dave to the cowboy my sister told me how you taught her to ride and do a lot of things i hope youll take me and my chums in hand too when we get settled at star ranch  ride dont you  oh yes but not in the fashion that cowboys can said dave and then he invited sid todd to sit down with them which the cowboy did he was a man of about forty tall and leathery his eyes were bubbling over with good humor but they could become very stern when the occasion demanded it laura had become well acquainted with him during her former visit to the ranch and knew that the endicotts trusted him implicitly while he had taught her how to ride cowgirl fashion she had taken a number of snapshot photographs for him to be sent to some relative in the south and for these he had been very grateful  we want to do a lot of riding and a lot of hunting and fishing too said the senators son do you think well have a chance for much sport  i dunno answered sid todd dryly might be the game will hear of your coming and move on to the next state and his eyes twinkled over his little joke  id like to see some kind of a roundup said phil will there be one while we are here  might be mri didnt quite catch your handle  phil lawrence just call me phil  i will if youll call me todd or sid i cant git used to this mister business nohow besides the boys would have the laugh on me if they heard you amistering me all the time  all right sid it is said dave and im dave  and i am roger added the senators son  about that roundup continued the cowboy might see something of the sort for mr endicott is goin to sell some cattle the end of the month and theyll be driven off to another range but youll see enough of cattle anyway before you go home if you are going to stay a month or six weeks  any fishing queried the shipowners son  yes plenty of fishing back in the mountains one place there you can catch a barrel or two of fish in ten minutesif youve got lines enough and once more sid todd chuckled at his joke  it was a three hours run to bramley for the train stopped at many little stations and at some crossings where there were no stations at all at one point they came to a halt where there was a large corral and the boys and girls watched the efforts of several cowboys to lasso a bronco that was untrained the bronco eluded the rope with apparent ease  some of em are mighty tricky explained sid todd i remember two years ago we had one bronco nobody at the star could touch i reckon he was sure mad for finally he bit hank snogger and hank had to treat him to a dose of lead  is hank snogger still with mr endicott questioned laura  no he aint answered sid todd shortly he left two months ago a good job done too added the cowboy  who was this hank snogger asked dave in a low voice of his sister for he saw that the subject was distasteful to todd  he was one of the cowboys working for mr endicott answered laura he was rather a queer kind of a man  bramleys just ahead announced sid todd presently maybe you can catch sight of somebody you know he added to laura as the train rounded the curve of a small hill  i see a young lady on horseback and a man cried daves sister a few minutes later its belle and her father they came to meet us oh i must signal to them and she waved her handkerchief from the car window soon belle endicott saw it and waved her big straw hat in return  welcome to the west she cried merrily as she dashed up on her pony beside the railroad tracks oh i was so afraid you wouldnt come  and i was so afraid youd miss our telegram and wouldnt meet us returned laura  as soon as the train came to a stop the boys hopped down and assisted the girls to alight sid todd followed with the hand baggage and the whole party gathered in a group while mr endicott and belle dismounted to greet them  very glad to know you said the railroad president with a genial smile overspreading his features i feel as if i knew morr already i have met his father and mother several times in washington  yes so dad wrote answered the senators son  and i feel as if i knew you and miss belle said dave ive heard so much about you from laura  and weve heard so much about you cried belle oh wasnt it simply wonderful how you found your folks why its almost like a page out of a fairy book  not quite put in phil fairy stories arent true while this really happened  some day dave has got to tell me the whole story from beginning to end said belle you see im going to call you dave and you must call me belle  well we cant stop for stories just now said mr endicott its a long ride to the ranch and theyll be more than hungry by the time we get there todd bring up the horses and tell jerry to dump all the baggage in the wagon do you all want to ride horseback or does somebody prefer a seat in the wagon  oh let us ride horseback if you have animals enough cried laura youre willing arent you jessie  ii guess so said jessie rather timidly that is if you dont ride too fast  well take it easy said belle and if you get tired you can wait for the wagon  a number of sturdylooking animals were brought up and the entire party proceeded to mount the boys assisting laura and jessie in the meantime sid todd went off to return with a ranch wagon driven by an old man smoking a corncob pipe  hello uncle jerry cried laura pleasantly and the others soon learned that the old man was known by that name and no other he had been attached to the ranch when mr endicott purchased the place and knew no other home he and todd placed the baggage in the wagon and then the cowboy swung himself into the saddle of his own steed that had been brought to the station for him  just as the party was about to leave a tall thin and welldressed man dashed up riding a coalblack steed as he came closer laura gave a start and motioned for dave to come closer  who is it asked dave in a low voice  that is mr merwell answered his sister     chapter xi  the arrival at star ranch   mr felix merwell bowed stiffly to mr endicott and on seeing laura raised his hat slightly both of the others bowed in return then the eyes of the newcomer swept the vicinity of the little railroad station  see anything of my son link he asked of sid todd  no sir was the short reply it was quite evident that the cowboy and the ranch owner were not on very friendly terms  humph i thought sure hed be on this train muttered mr merwell to no one in particular he looked at the boys you came in on the train that just left i suppose he said  we did answered dave  see anything of a boy about your own age in helena at the depot he was coming on the eastern train  your son wasnt on the train answered dave  ah you know him  yes  who are you may i ask i do not remember seeing you before  i am dave porter link and i went to oak hall together  ah i see mr merwell drew a long breath and nodded his head knowingly dave porter you said and who are these young men  my school chums roger morr and phil lawrence  indeed then you are the young men who caused my son so much troublecaused him to be sent away in fact continued mr merwell and he glared hatefully at the three lads  it was links own fault that he was sent away answered the senators son if he had behaved himself he would have had no trouble  oh of course it is natural that you should shield yourselves but i know my son and i know he is not the person he has been made out to be by doctor clay and others it was an outrage to allow the other boys at the school to get him into trouble as they did and i have written to doctor clay to that effect  your son was entirely to blame said phil bound to stand up for himself  he can be thankful that he was let off so easily added dave if it hadnt been for the honor of oak hall there might have been a public exposure  bah nonsense but it is useless to continue this discussion here in the presence of these young ladies perhaps ill see you again about the matterafter i have interviewed my son personally  mr merwell these young gentleman are my guests put in mr endicott bluntly while they are stopping at my ranch i trust they will not be annoyed by any one  mr endicott i shall respect your wishes so far as i can returned felix merwell with great stiffness but if these young men have done my son an injustice they will have to suffer for it i bid you goodday and having thus delivered himself the man wheeled around his coalblack steed and was off in a cloud of dust down the road  oh dave what do you think hell do asked jessie in alarm  i dont know was daves reply of course he is bound to stick up for link  i never liked him very much and now i despise him said laura  one can readily see where link gets his temper from was phils comment he is nothing but a chip of the old block  i am sorry that mr merwell is my neighbor came from mr endicott but it cant be helped so well have to make the best of it my advice is while you are out here keep off his lands and if he annoys you in any way let me know  well have to learn what his lands are said the senators son  todd and the others can readily tell you about that and about merwells cattle too but come we have wasted too much time already youll all be wanting supper long before we reach the ranch  old jerry had gone ahead with the wagon and now the others followed along the road taken by the turnout and by mr merwell it was a winding trail leading up and down over the hills and through a dense patch of timber two miles from the station they had to cross a fairsized stream by way of a bridge that was far from firm  weve got to have a new bridge here some day said mr endicott i am willing to bear my share of the expense but merwell wont put up a cent he doesnt go in for improvements  he seems to like good horseflesh remarked phil  that was one of his best mounts his horses arent half as good as those we have eh todd  no better bosses in these parts than those at the star answered the cowboy  i have been giving our horses my especial care for three years explained the railroad president it has become a hobby with me and some day i may turn the ranch into something of a stock farm for raising certain breeds of horses and ponies while you are here youll not suffer for the want of a mount  id like to see you break in some of the horses said roger  well youll have the chance  maybe youd like to break in a bronco yourself suggested belle with a twinkle in her eye  and get sent skyhigh returned the senators son no thank you not until ive learned the business  a bronco is all right if you understand him remarked sid todd but if you dont youd better monkey with the business end of a gunits just as healthy  the woods left behind they commenced to ascend a long hill far off to the westward loomed the mountains covered with pines and bordered below with cottonwoods  there is where youll get your hunting when you want it said mr endicott how is it can you shoot  we can answered phil and then told of some of their experiences in the south sea islands then roger told of the adventures which dave and he had in norway and dave ended by telling of the target practice with the swinging board  well ill tell you right now a big bear out in them mountains aint no swingin board said sid todd hes a whole lumber yard when hes cornered and at this remark there was a general laugh  it was getting dark when they came in sight of star ranch they made out a long low building on the southern slope of a small hill it was built in modern bungalow fashion having been erected by mr endicott after the original log dwelling had been destroyed by fire it was divided into a sittingroom fifteen feet by twentyfive an office a goodsized dininghall a kitchen and eight bedrooms and a bath water was pumped from a brook at the foot of the hill and the rooms were lighted by a new system of gasoline gas the ranch home was comfortably furnished and in the sittingroom were a bookcase filled with good reading and a new player piano with a combination cabinet of sheet music and music rolls  i play by hand said belle when the boys noticed the player piano but papa plays with his feet  thats the kind of playing i do too answered phil with a grin  but you sing dont you asked the young hostess of the ranch  oh yes we all sing  belle is a beautiful player said laura wait till you hear her play some operatic selections  supper was in readiness having been ordered in advance by mrs endicott a sweet woman who looked like laura and as soon as the girls and boys had had a chance to brush up and wash all sat down to partake of the good things provided jessie was much astonished by the things spread before her  why i thought we were going to live in regular camping style she declared this is as good as what we had at the hotel in chicago if not better  the wild west of today is not the wild west of years ago explained mrs endicott people from the east have a wrong impression of many things of course some things are still crude but others are as uptodate as any one could wish  what i like best of all is the general openheartedness of the people you meet declared dave they are not quite so frozenup as in some places in the east  that is true and it is readily explained answered the ranch owner in the pioneer days everybody had to depend upon everybody else and consequently all were more or less sociable the feeling has not yet worn off but i am afraid it will wear off as we become more and more what is called civilized added mr endicott with something of a sigh  everybody was hungry and all did full justice to the repast as they ate the boys and girls asked many questions concerning the ranch and the neighborhood generally and mr and mrs endicott and belle were kept busy answering first one and then another the railroad president told how he had come to purchase the placedoing it for the sake of his healthand mentioned the many improvements he had made  we used to simply corral the horses and cattle said he but now i have a fine stable for the horses and numerous sheds for the cattle we have also big barns for hay and grain and a henhouse with a run fifty feet by two hundred  the chickens are my pets said belle i have some of the cutest bantams you ever saw  ill help you feed them said jessie at crumville she had always taken an interest in the chickens  the trunks and dresssuit cases had been brought in by old jerry and one of the chinese servants and placed in the proper rooms and after supper the boys and girls spent an hour in getting settled laura and jessie had a nice room that connected with one occupied by belle and dave phil and roger were assigned to two rooms directly opposite  you boys can divide up the rooms to suit yourselves said mrs endicott  thank you we will they answered and later arranged that dave was to have one apartment and roger the other and phil was to sleep one week with one chum and the next with the other  say but this suits me down to the ground cried the senators son after the boys had said goodnight to the others its a complete surprise like jessie i had an idea wed have to rough it  i knew about what to expect for laura told me answered dave with a smile i didnt say too much because i wanted you to be surprised but its better even than i anticipated if we dont have the outing of our lives here it will be our own fault  the endicotts are certainly fine folks said the shipowners son as he sat on the edge of a bed to unlace his shoes and belle iswell as nice as they make em  hello phil must be smitten cried roger well i dont blame you old man  who said i was smitten returned phil his face growing red i said she was a dandy girl thats all  and she is said dave i dont wonder laura likes her  we ought to be able to make up some fine parties continued phil as he dropped a shoe on the floor dave can take out jessie and you can take out laura and ill  take out miss belle finished the senators son he caught phil by the foot say youre smitten all right come on dave let us wake him out of his dream and he commenced to pull on the foot  hi you let up cried the shipowners son clutching at the bed to keep himself from falling to the floor i havent said half as much about belle as youve said about laura so there  never said anything about laura answered roger but he too turned red dave commenced to laugh heartily and phil wrenched himself free and stood up  whats sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander cried dave better both quit your knocking and go to bed i suppose the girls are tired out and want to go to sleep  sounds like it doesnt it murmured roger as a shriek of laughter came from across the hallway  maybe they are knocking each other the same way suggested phil  never cried dave girls arent built that way  but dave was mistaken  a little later quietness reigned and one after another the newcomers to star ranch dropped asleep     chapter xii  a race on horseback   what a beautiful spot  it was dave who uttered the words as he stood out in front of the ranch house on the following morning he had gotten up early and laura and belle had joined him leaving the others still at rest  dave spoke with feeling for the grand and sublime things in nature had always appealed to him he was gazing toward the east where the rising sun was flooding the plains with a golden hue beyond the cottonwoods he caught a glimpse of the winding river then when he turned he saw the foothills and the mountains in the west with their great bowlders and cliffs and their sturdy growths of pine  arent you glad you came dave said his sister as she placed an affectionate hand on his shoulder  indeed i am laura he replied why it looks to me as if i was going to have the outing of my life in fact all of us ought to have the best time ever  does it put you in mind of your trip to norway questioned belle  hardly that was taken during cold weather and everything was covered with snow and ice besides the scenery was quite different dave paused to sweep the horizon in what direction is the merwell ranch he asked  over yonder answered belle pointing up the river the little brook flowing down between those rough rocks marks the boundary line  and whose cattle are those on yonder hills  i am not sure but i think they belong to papa when you ask about cattle you must go to sid todd he knows every animal for miles around  i suppose your cattle are all branded  oh yes with a star and the letter e on either side of it thats why this is called star ranch  what is the merwell brand asked laura  a triple cross  breakfast was soon announced and all the girls and boys assembled in the dininghall while they ate the meal mr endicott told the newcomers much about his ranch and also about the people working for him  i am sorry to hear that you have had trouble with mr merwells son said the railroad president i am afraid it will make matters worse out hereand they are bad enough as it is  but i am sure dave and his chums are not to blame mr endicott said laura hastily  oh i am sure of that myselffor i know something of link merwell and his headstrong tempera temper he gets largely from his father if it were not for that temper i think mr merwell and myself might be on better terms  we have had trouble over one of the hired men hank snogger explained belle snogger used to work for us but mr merwell hired him away  that wasnt a very nice thing to do was rogers comment  if it had been done openly it would not have been so bad said mr endicott but it was done secretly and snogger was gone almost before i knew it he was a valuable man and i felt his loss keenly  i suppose mr merwell offered him more wages said phil  probably although i paid snogger a good salary i dont know what game merwell played to get the fellow but he got him  its exactly like some of links underhanded work at oak hall was rogers comment father and son must be very much alike  while you are here i would advise you to steer clear of the merwells was mr endicotts advice id not even go on their land if you can help it there are plenty of other places to go to  ill not go near his ranch if i know it answered dave  it is queer that link did not come on the train with you if his father was expecting him  oh most likely he stopped off somewhere to have a good time answered the senators son a fellow like link would be apt to find life slow on a ranch  after breakfast mr endicott and belle took the boys and girls around the ranch buildings which were quite numerous the girls were interested in some fancy chickens and pigeons belle owned and the boys grew enthusiastic over the horses  i never saw better animals cried dave his eyes resting on a black horse that was truly a beauty whats his name he asked  hero answered mr endicott he can go let me tell you you can try him this afternoon if you wish  thank you perhaps i will  and if you like him you can use hero during your stay here went on the railroad president and then he pointed out various horses that the others might use  no busting broncos here i suppose said phil with a grin  no if you want to try a bronco youll have to see todd but i advise you to be careful some day ill have todd give you an exhibition of bronco busting as it is called  during their tour of the place they met several cowboys and other helpers and soon became well acquainted in the past visitors to star ranch had been numerous consequently the most of the men were not as shy as they might otherwise have been they gladly answered all the questions the boys and girls put to them and offered to do all sorts of things to render the visit of the newcomers pleasant  after lunch the girls felt like resting for it was rather warm but all the boys were anxious to get into the saddle they had heard that sid todd was going to a distant part of the range to see about two steers that had fallen into a ravine and asked to be taken along  all right my boys said the cowboy come ahead but youll have to do quite a bit of riding to get there and back by nightfall  well we may as well get used to it answered phil i expect to about live in the saddle while i am here  todd had several things to attend to before starting so they did not leave the stables until nearly three oclock dave was mounted on the steed he had so admired and the others had equally good horses  shall we take our guns asked roger  what for asked the cowboy  oh i thought we might get the chance to shoot something  well not have much time to look for game answered sid todd however if you want to take your shootin irons there aint no objections so each of the lads provided himself with a shotgun todd carried a pistol of the hoss variety and nearly two feet long the same being deposited in the holster of his saddle  the course was to the westward to the foothills of the distant mountains here the cowboy explained was a treacherous ravine the sides overgrown with a tangle of low bushes the cattle loved to get in the bushes finding something there particularly appetizing to eat and often the rocks and dirt would give way and a steer would go down in the hollow and be unable to get out  they dont seem to know how to climb the rocks said sid todd and youve got to fairly drive em the right way or theyd stay in the hollow till they died  dave felt like letting himself loose as he expressed it and with a level stretch of several miles before them he called on phil and roger for a race  done cried the shipowners son but i know youll beat he added youve had more practice on horseback than i have had  take care and keep to the trail sung out sid todd he had no desire to join in the sport for horseback riding was no novelty to him  over the soft ground thundered the three horses the boys at the start keeping in a bunch but gradually they spread out and then roger forged ahead  here is where i win sang out the senators son  not much answered phil just wait till my horse gets his muscles limbered up a bit and then he urged his animal to a better gait and slowly but surely crawled up closer to roger  dave said but little for he was paying all his attention to hero he had studied horses from childhood and he thought he saw in the steed he rode better staying qualities than in either of the other animals he kept on directly behind his chums but made no effort for the first half mile to pass them  how far do we race cried the senators son presently  to the patch of woods answered dave indicating a growth about a mile distant  all rightandgoodby to you returned roger merrily  dave you arent in it a little bit added phil and he sped after the senators son leaving dave a full fifty yards in the rear  dave saw that hero was gradually warming up to his task he clucked softly and the little black horse pricked up his ears and increased his gait then dave clucked againhe had heard todd do thisand hero went a little faster  on went the three boys the fresh air of the plains and the mountains filling their lungs and causing their eyes to snap with pure delight at that moment each of them felt as if he hadnt a care in the world  phil and roger were now neckandneck with not quite half a mile of the race still to cover sixty yards behind was dave still further to the rear was sid todd now urging his horse forward that he might see the finish of the contest  now then my little beauty go cried dave to his horse and he clucked several times to hero and dug his heels into the steeds ribs  he had not miscalculated and hero responded instantly up he went into the air and when he came down his ears were laid far back and forward he shot like an arrow from a bow dave kept him to it and gradually he ranged up between the others  hi get back there yelled roger who was now slightly in advance you can beat phil but you cant beat me  not much hes not going to beat me put in the shipowners son and he urged his horse to do better but this was impossible and inch by inch dave overtook him and went to the front  it now seemed to be a race between hero and the brown horse that the senators son rode rogers mount was still in fine condition but it must be confessed that the senators son did not know exactly how to race him to the best advantage he sawed a little on the reins thus worrying the animal and causing him to lose his gait then with a bound dave came up and the pair were neckandneck for the finish  go go yelled phil may the best horse win  whoopee came unexpectedly from sid todd and grabbing his pistol from the holster he sent three shots into the air just to add to the excitement  as the pistol went off both horses gave an extra bound forward the two young riders were almost unseated but each quickly recovered then they bent low over their steeds necks and went forward for the finish  it was a thrilling moment dave and roger side by side phil at their heels and sid todd further back firing another shot or two just for fun in true cowboy fashion  but roger had urged his horse to the limit and could do no better as dave clucked again hero shot ahead a foot a yard and soon several yards then phil came up abreast of the senators son and thus they kept until the edge of the woods was gained  dave wins cried sid todd an a good race boysa good race all around  yes dave wins answered phil my but your horse did go it at the finish he added admiringly  a fine animal said roger but mine is fine too even if he didnt come in first he added loyally  you all rode wellbetter nor i expected was sid todds comment it was a good race i wish the others on the ranch had seen itthey wouldnt call you tenderfeet no more     chapter xiii  the crazy steer   in the shade of the woods the boys rested their steeds for a few minutes and as they did this the cowboy told them of some of the races he had seen in the past on star ranch  one of the greatest races was between one o the cowboys and an indian named crowfoot joe said the cowboy the indian was sure he was going to win but he lost by a neck that race took place two years ago but the boys in these parts aint done tellin about it yet we had a full holiday the time it come off  i think your horse is just as good as mine said dave to roger but i fancy you pressed him a little too hard at the start  he is just as good an so is the hoss phil is ridin came from sid todd it was the ridin did it dave managed his mount just right and this open praise made the youth from crumville blush  just wait till jessie hears how he won said the shipowners son shell weave a laurel crown for his brow and  dont you say a word about it cried dave and blushed more than ever i didnt win by so very much anyway  forward the party went through the woods and then in the direction of the foothills beyond the race had not hurt the horses in the least for all of them were tough and used to hard usage they were following a welldefined trail but presently branched off to the southward and commenced to climb the first of the hills  that hollow is about quarter of a mile from here explained the cowboy be careful now or your horse will get into a hole an maybe break a leg and then they went forward with added caution into the midst of a growth of low bushes dotted here and there with sagebrush  presently the cowboy uttered a long loud whistle and this was answered by somebody near the edge of the ravine then another ranch hand named tom yates showed himself he was on foot but his horse was tethered not far away  well where are they asked todd of the other cowboy  where are they growled tom yates where they always are when they go over hang em say were going to have a fierce job this time he added  why asked todd  because that big steerthe spotted onewent over with two of the others he got hurt a few days ago in the woods and hes as ugly as sin because of it  well well have to drive em up same as we did before answered sid todd briefly  i dont think youll drive that steer answered tom yates blinky and i tried it and we couldnt do a thing with him blinky wouldnt stay here he thinks the steer is crazy  got a rope  sure was the answer and the cowboy who had been working to get the cattle out of the ravine swung a strong lasso into view but you aint goin to use that on that steer he continued leaswise not if you want to live to tell it  well see answered sid todd briefly as he dismounted and took the lasso  can we help asked dave  sure you can answered the cowboy who had accompanied the boys just you keep out of the way an that will be all the help we need  but perhaps we could do something grumbled roger i want to get into a regular roundup of cattle some day  this aint no roundup my boy if you go down into the hollow those cattle will be wuss frightened nor ever you just stay up here and watch things im going to get em outor know the reason why finished sid todd and he walked away with tom yates and presently the pair were joined by a third hand the fellow who had said he thought one of the steers was crazy  with nothing else to do the three boys dismounted tethered their steeds and walked slowly and cautiously to the edge of the ravine the ground was very uneven and treacherous holes were numerous  you would think there would be a lot of game around here was daves comment but so far i havent seen a thing  i think the cattle and the cowboys have scared the animals away answered roger for hunting well have to go where it is even wilder than thistodd said so  my but this air is the finest ever cried phil i declare it makes me feel young  as if he were old protested the senators son but the air is great he added  i know what it does to me declared dave makes me mighty hungry  same here answered the shipowners son i think i could eat about six square meals a day when we go out hunting for a full day or more we mustnt forget to take plenty of food along  oh well eat what we shoot phil said dave with a wink at roger they always do that out west you know  huh and if we dont shoot we can starve eh not much im going to take plenty of good things along when i go out  i wonder if well see much of link merwell said roger after a pause  i dont want to see him answered dave  but hell see you dave didnt he say hed square accounts out here hell keep his wordwhen it comes to doing anything mean and dirty  roger is right said phil i shouldnt want to alarm the girls or mr and mrs endicott but id surely keep my eyes open for link merwell hell try some kind of a gameits his nature  with caution the boys approached the edge of the ravine and looked over they saw a spot where the dirt rocks and bushes had torn loose and slid down to the bottom of the hollow carrying with the mass three of mr endicotts herd of cattle two of the herd had been driven up to safety by the cowboys but the thirdthe vicious steerwas still below unable to help himself and showing fight whenever approached by the ranch hands  i see him announced phil pointing with his hand to some rocks below he looks peaceful enough  so does a bombuntil it goes off answered dave the cowboys wouldnt be afraid of him unless he was a bad one maybe he is really crazy ive heard of a crazy horse  say that puts me in mind of a story shadow hamilton told came from the senators son a boy in school was a regular blockhead and one day the teacher asked him what made him so foolish i dunno he answered excepting that my mother makes me sleep under a crazy quilt  say thats like shadow cried phil after a laugh all around wish he was herewhat stories he would tell  for some little time the boys could not see the men who were hidden by the rocks and brushwood but presently they caught sight of sid todd he was flourishing a stick at the steer the animal paid no attention at first but presently commenced to shake his head from side to side  doesnt like it was rogers comment  he seems to be saying no quite forcibly added dave  now todd is after him cried the shipowners son a minute later see the steer is on the move at last  yes but he is going after todd answered roger  such was the fact and presently man and beast disappeared behind some brushwood then when they emerged again it was seen that the cowboy had lassoed the animal by one of the forelegs he was mounting the rocks and the steer was limping behind trying vainly to shake himself free he did not seem to know enough to hold back altogether  well i think that rather dangerous declared phil supposing the steer should run for him  i guess the cowboy knows what he is doing answered dave if he is pursued he can easily scramble up on some of the steep rocks and get out of the way  for fully ten minutes they watched the scene below them with interest at one time the cowboy would appear to have the best of the situation then it looked as if the steer would have his own way but gradually man and beast worked up toward the top of the ravine  hell worry the steer along if he doesnt get too tired said dave but it must be a fearful strain on him  the strain was heavier than the boys anticipated and several times sid todd was on the point of giving up the struggle perhaps had he been alone he might have done so but with the others looking on he felt that his reputation was at stake and so he worried along until he suddenly slipped on some rocks and fell flat  as he went down the steer appeared to realize the mans helplessness and with a weird snort he rushed forward the lasso becoming tangled up on the front leg as he advanced  look out sid yelled yates hes goin to hook yer  todd had been a little stunned by his fall and a bit of brushwood hid the animal from his view but at the cry of alarm from the other ranch hand he realized his peril and rolled over between two tall rocks  on came the steer and struck one of the rocks a blow that resounded loudly through the ravine then the beast gave a leap directly over todds body and landed on the rocks beyond  is he hurt asked roger anxiously  i dont know but i dont think so answered dave  see the steer is coming right up the side of the ravine cried phil he is dragging the lasso after him  yes and he is coming this way put in the senators son perhaps we had better get out of the way he added in alarm  oh i dont think hell tackle us answered phil  there is no telling what he will do said dave he is coming to the top that is sure maybe we had better get into the saddle well be safer on horseback  the horses of the three boys were tethered some distance away and as mentioned before the lads had to move slowly for fear of stepping into some hole as they advanced they heard loud cries coming up from the bottom of the ravine  what can be wrong down there now questioned the shipowners son  i dont know returned roger perhaps they are shouting to warn us  that is just what they are doing added dave quickly listen  look out up there came from the ravine look out the steer is coming  the boys quickened their pace but hardly had they covered half the distance to where the horses were tied when roger suddenly slipped and went down  hurry up called out phil who was near  oh moaned the senators son and his face took on a look of pain  whats wrong asked dave coming up  my foot it got twisted and now it is fast in the hole answered roger gracious how it hurts he went on making a wry face  come come urged dave that steer is coming there he is now and he pointed to the lower end of the ravine where the animal had just bobbed up among the bushes shaking his head from side to side in a queer uncanny way  roger tried to pull his foot from between the rocks but was unable to do so phil had run on thinking his chums would follow dave stopped short  cant you make it roger he asked anxiously and with another glance in the direction of the steer the animal was now in full view  iidont seem to bebe able to panted the senators son oh if only that steer doesnt come this way he went on in fresh alarm  he is coming this way exclaimed dave oh roger let me help you and now he bent over and tried with might and main to get his chums foot free as he did this the steer came forward slowly then the animal gave an unexpected snort of rage and charged full tilt at the helpless youth     chapter xiv  a face puzzles dave   it was a time of extreme peril for roger and no one realized it more fully than did dave the angry steer was still some distance away but coming forward at his best speed one prod from those horns and the senators son would be killed or badly hurt  as said before phil had gone on thinking his chums would follow he was already at the side of his horse and speedily untied the animal and vaulted into the saddle  why whats up he cried in dismay as he turned to behold roger in the hole and dave beside him  rogers foot is fast answered dave oh phil see if you cant scare the steer off  ill do what i can came from the shipowners son and rather timidly it must be confessed he advanced on the animal in question he gave a loud shout and swung his arm and the steer looked toward him and came to a halt  youve got your gunif he tries to horn roger shoot him went on dave  i will answered phil and riding still closer he swung his firearm around for action  dave made a hasty examination and saw that rogers foot was caught by the toe and the heel and would have to be turned in a sideway fashion to be loosened he caught his chum under the arms and turned him partly over  now try it he said quickly at the same time turning once more to look at the steer the beast had finished his inspection of phil and was coming forward as before with head and horns almost sweeping the ground behind him trailed the long lasso which was still fast to one of his forelegs  phil phil cried dave suddenly i have it catch the lasso if you can and hold him back  i willif i can was the ready response and making a semicircle the shipowners son came up behind the steer leaped to the ground caught hold of the lasso and sprang back into the saddle almost as quick as it takes to tell it then he made the rope fast to his pommel and turned his horse back  the steer was but two yards away from roger and dave when the rope on his foreleg suddenly tightened and he found himself brought to a halt he gave a wild snort and just as roger found himself at liberty he turned and gazed angrily at phil and his steed then he charged in that direction  ride for it phil called dave but this warning was unnecessary for the shipowners son was already galloping across the field as rapidly as the nature of the ground permitted the horse easily kept the lasso taut thus worrying the steer not a little  by daves aid roger managed to hobble to where the other horses were tethered and soon both boys were in the saddle and riding after phil and the steer  i guess the steer is getting winded said dave coming closer he doesnt seem to have as much fight in him as he did  around and around in a broad circle went phil and his horse and the steer but the steps of the latter were slower and slower and presently the beast dropped into a walk and then refused to take another step phil came to a halt also but kept the lasso tight then the steer lay down on his side  i guess he is conquered was rogers comment  the three boys kept at a safe distance and waited for the appearance of sid todd and the other cowboys presently todd came over the rim of the ravine and looked around anxiously  anybody hurt he questioned as he ran forward  roger got his ankle twisted running away from the steer answered dave  what did the critter do went on the cowboy and phil and the others told their story to which sid todd listened with interest the other cowboys also came up to look the fallen steer over  he sure is a crazy one said yates if i was the boss id shoot him  ill report about him as soon as i get back answered todd say you had a nerve to take hold of this lasso he went on to phil  dave told me to do it was the answer of the shipowners son it was easy enoughwhen i was on horseback i shouldnt have done it if i had been on foot  not muchunless youre a staving good runner said yates with a grin  the steer was too exhausted to make further resistance just then and the cowboys had but little trouble in taking the lasso from his foreleg  hell be all right after a bit said todd in answer to a question from dave but i think myself he isnt just o k in his head and the next time we want some fresh meat we might as well kill him off and be done with it  the cowboy insisted upon looking at rogers ankle the member was somewhat swollen but the senators son said it would not bother him to ride home in a little while they were off in a bunch when quite a distance from the ravine they gazed back and saw that the steer had gotten up and was grazing as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened  well we have put in a rather strenuous day for a starter remarked dave when they came in sight of the ranch home if this keeps up  but it wont interrupted phil i reckon some days will be dull enough  the girls were awaiting their return and they listened with keen attention to what the boys had to tell  you must bathe your ankle with liniment cried belle ill get some for you and soon she presented roger with the stuff he did as directed and soon the swollen member felt far more comfortable during the evening the senators son took it easy on the wide veranda and in the sittingroom  i wish i had seen the race cried jessie smiling at dave some day youll have to have another and let us girls look on  whats the matter with you girls having a race queried dave that would be dead loads of funfor us boys  belle would be sure to winshe can ride like the wind answered laura  as soon as it grew dark that evening the girls and boys went indoors and played and sang belle showed her skill on the piano and dave and phil tried the mechanical arrangement of the instrument with perforated music rolls almost before they realized it it was time to go to bed  the next morning roger still limped a little and it was agreed to take it easy all wanted to write letters and the entire day was spent in doing little else  how will the letters be posted asked dave  todd will take them over to the railroad station tomorrow answered mrs endicott  shortly after dinner the next day the cowboy announced that he was ready to take the mail to the station phil and roger had wandered off to the barns to look at some calves  if you dont mind ill go with you to the station said dave to the cowboy the ride would just suit me  glad to have you along answered sid todd he had taken a strong fancy to the boys and to dave in particular  they were soon on their way todd carrying the mail in a bag slung over his horses neck man and boy were in the best of spirits and both made rapid time over the dusty roads  maybe youll meet a friend of yours at the station when the train comes in said todd  a friend who asked dave  that merwell boy yates heard he was coming today one of the cowboys from merwells ranch said so  i dont know that i care to meet him answered dave he is no friend of mine  that boy ought to have his hide tanned good and proper growled the cowboy hes been a sore spot here for years  have you had trouble with him  yes and so has everybody else on this ranch and on his own ranch too for the matter of that not that he did anything very bad continued todd but its jest his mean measly ways he dont know how to treat a hand civilly  isnt his father the same way  sometimes but not always the old man knows that the boys wont stand for too much of that thing  who is at their ranch besides mr merwell  oh the regular hands thats all  no young folks  no  i should think it would be lonely for link  maybe it is but that aint no reason why he should act so mean added sid todd  i should think hed want to invite some of his friends to visit him  maybe mr merwell dont want it hes putty close you must remember and it costs money to entertain  well i pity link if he has got to stay there alone  he dont stay all the time he rides to town and smokes and gambles and gets into all sorts of trouble and then he gets scared to death for fear the old man will find it out concluded sid todd  they were soon at the station and there found they would have to wait half an hour for the train to come in several cowboys were present and also a gentleman with a white flowing beard  that is mr hooper said sid todd he owns a ranch up the riverthe bar x hes a fine man and a few minutes later he introduced dave to the ranch owner  glad to know you said mr hooper i heard that my friend endicott had a lot of boys and girls at his place tell belle she must bring all of you over to my place some day  thank you i will answered dave  we havent any boys and girls there but i reckon we can give you a good time went on mr hooper  among the cowboys at the station dave noticed one tall and particularly powerful fellow his face looked somewhat familiar and the crumville youth wondered if he had met the man before  that is hank snogger the fellow who left our place to work for mr merwell said sid todd in a low voice  his face looks familiar to me but i cant place him returned dave did he come from the east  i think he did years ago think you know him  it seems to me ive met him beforeor met somebody that looked like him answered dave slowly he was trying in vain to place those features  dont you remember the name  no  we aint on very good terms any more otherwise id give you a knockdown to him went on the cowboy  i dont know that i care for an introduction answered dave he doesnt look like a person id want for a friendhe looks rather dissipated  he was a good man when he worked for mr endicott but hes not so good since he went over to merwell  there the talk about hank snogger ended once or twice the man looked curiously at dave  each time something in his face struck the youth as decidedly familiar yet try his best the boy could not place the fellow  its no use he told himself at last perhaps i dont know him after all but ive seen a face like that somewherei am sure of it     chapter xv  among the cowboys   here she comes  it was an enthusiastic cowboy who uttered the words and by way of emphasis he fired his revolver in the air as he rode up beside the incoming train it was the one moment of excitement at the station  the cars came to a halt and sid todd went forward to give his letters to the railway mail clerk dave watched the cars and saw two men and a boy alight the boy was link merwell  the former bully of oak hall looked haggard as if his dissipation in chicago and elsewhere had done him much harm his eyes were heavy as he stood and stared about him hank snogger had gone forward to care for the mail from the merwell ranch  hello you here cried link stepping forward and confronting dave  i am was the cool answer  got here ahead of me eh  so it would seem  going to make a spread out here i suppose went on link with a sneer paint the plains red and all that  i came for a good time but i dont intend to paint anything red  bah i know you dave porter you want to crow over everybody no matter where you go but youll find things are different out here from what they were at oak hall added the bully significantly you cant pull the wool over peoples eyes here like you did there  i have no more intention of pulling wool than i have of painting anything red answered dave as calmly as before he could see that link was in a bad humor and spoiling for a fight  i said i was going to get square with you and i am continued the bully loudly  you keep your distance link merwell answered dave and now his tone was sharper dont forget what i did at oak hall if you want another thrashing like that i can give it to you  get out dont you talk to me howled link you attacked me when i was sick he spoke in a loud voice for the benefit of the cowboys and others who were gathering around the train had started away and was soon out of sight among the hills  you were as well as you ever were answered dave  whats the row link asked hank snogger as he pushed his way to the front  heres a fellow used to go to school with me ive got it in for him and ive a good mind to give him a thrashing  you put your hand on me and youll take the consequences said dave i didnt come here to fight but i can defend myself  you dont want to fight do you dave asked sid todd in a low voice to him it looked as if the crumville lad might be no match for merwell who was larger and heavier  i am not afraid todd i thrashed him once and i can do it againif i have to  you licked him  yes  with your fists  yes  where  at school he played a dirty trick on me and some others and i wouldnt stand for it  you shut your mouth roared link merwell and without warning he rushed forward and struck dave a blow in the chest that sent the crumville youth staggering against mr hooper  wait wait this wont do said the ranchman  if you are going to fight fight fair put in sid todd  now dont you butt in here sid growled hank snogger with an ugly look at the other cowboy  ill see fair play answered todd sharply and he elbowed his way between snogger and dave  having delivered his unexpected blow link merwell sprang back and stood on the defensive dave was not wearing any coat or vest and he merely threw his hat to his friend then as quick as lightning he sprang forward knocked aside merwells guard and planted a telling blow on the bullys left eye  as you are so anxious to fight take that cried dave and before the other could recover he landed a second blow on merwells chin this caused the bully to stagger against hank snogger who kept him from falling completely  well well well sang out one of the cowboys in the crowd just look at that merwell keep your eyes open or youll git knocked into a jelly  the former bully of oak hall was staggered but only for a moment then with a hoarse cry of rage he leaped at dave and for fully a minute the blows came thick and fast from each side then the pair clinched swung around and around and finally went down with dave on top  break away there sang out hank snogger and caught dave by the ear git up off him  leave porter alone yelled sid todd and caught snogger by the hair this is the boys fight taint yours  thats right thats right came from several leave the kids alone  he aint goin to hit link when hes down growled snogger  i dont intend to answered dave and got up he turned to hank snogger you keep your hands off of me he added sharply this is not your quarrel  ah dont talk to me growled the cowboy  i will talk to you went on dave you keep out of this  dave stood back while link slowly arose to his feet the bully was somewhat dazed but there was still a good deal of fight left in him and suddenly he charged on the crumville lad making a heavy swing for daves jaw dave ducked and as merwell swung around caught the bully in the right ear then he followed the blow by one on the neck and another directly in the mouth the latter loosened two teeth and sent the bully into the arms of hank snogger  well have you had enough asked dave he was panting for breath and his eyes were blazing with determination  a look full of the bitterest kind of hatred filled the face of link merwell but he was too staggered to attack dave again he leaned on hank snogger and then turned his face away  i say have you had enoughor do you want another dose demanded dave  illfight this out some other time answered merwell weakly he realized that the eyes of the crowd were on him and this made him furious but he did not dare to risk another attack from the crumville youth fearing what fighters call a knockout  then you have had enough eh went on dave very well and now merwell i advise you to keep your distance if you dontwell youll catch it worse thats all  link is tired out from his long train ride remarked hank snogger he aint in no fit condition fer a scrap wait till he has rested up a week or twothen hell show thet tenderfoot whats what and with these words he led link away to where a couple of horses were tied he leaped on one and the bully leaped on the other and in a moment more both were off for the merwell ranch  well youngster i reckon you can hold your own remarked mr hooper he had led a roughandtumble life himself and did not look on a fight as a dreadful matter you had him going  so you did dave added sid todd while several other cowboys nodded in assent  he forced the fight answered dave i suppose hell try it again some day  merwell always was scrappy said one of the cowboys  takes after his dad added another and then there was a general laugh several came up to shake hands with dave and congratulate him on the outcome of the little bout some of the cowboys were not very refined and to them such a fistfight seemed a great thing  there were a number of letters for those at star ranch including two for davefrom his father and from ben basswood with the epistles in their pockets dave and sid todd started on the return to the endicott place they had to follow for some distance the trail taken by link and snogger their road branching off after the bridge over the river was crossed  considerable time had been lost waiting for the train and because of the setto with merwell and the sun was now going down over the mountains in the west casting long shadows over the plains  youll have a late supper tonight said todd as they moved on at a brisk pace and i reckon youll have an appetite for it the way you polished off that cub was great and he shook his head enthusiastically  i wish youd do me a favor todd returned dave  sure thing son what do you want  please dont say too much at the ranch about the fight i dont want to scare my sister and the other girls  cant i tell the boys how you polished off young merwell most of em will be glad to hear it  well dont say too much thats all if they learn that link is on the watch to do harm the girls will be almost too afraid to go out  do you think that cub would be mean enough to harm the gals  hed be mean enough to scare them half to death  if he does thatwell i reckon ill take a hand in lickin him myself  we came out here to have a good time and i want to forget link merwell if possible but ill keep my eyes open for himand ill tell phil and roger to watch out too added dave soberly  sid todd was anxious to know more of links doings at oak hall and dave told how link had tried to get gus plum and himself into trouble he did not mention the trouble laura and jessie had had for he did not wish to drag the names of the girls into the affair  he sure is a bad egg said the cowboy at the end of the recital keep an eye on him by all means  by the time they reached the vicinity of the bridge it was quite dark remembering the bad condition of the structure spanning the stream sid todd cautioned dave to let his horse walk  look cried the youth a second later and pointed around a rise of rocks to the bridge he had seen two figures leaving the structure they disappeared behind a high clump of brushwood  what did you see questioned todd who had been gazing off to one side of the trail  two persons on the bridge they just ran away into the bushes  on foot  yes  humph didnt know anybody was out on foot around here mused the cowboy sure it wasnt a bear or some other animal and he felt for his horsepistol  no they were men or boys answered dave they ran off the bridge the minute we came in sight  huh i wonder if its possible them hossthieves is around again  have you horsethieves in this territory  we sure have lost two hosses last spring and two last summer ill have to tell the boss about seeing them fellows but maybesay hold on dave  what now  i may be mistaken butdont go on the bridge on hossback  why not  ill tell youafter ive examined the bridge answered sid todd and in a manner that mystified dave very much     chapter xvi  a meeting on the trail   arriving at the bridge sid todd told dave to halt and the pair dismounted as they did so they heard a sound in the bushes beside the stream they looked in the direction but saw nobody  the cowboy had drawn his pistol and with this in hand he walked closer to the bridge his eyes were on the planking and presently he uttered an exclamation  the rascals  he pointed to two of the planks and dave saw that they were loose and so placed that the slightest jar would send them down into the stream  do you think those men i just saw did this questioned dave  certainly they did they ought to be hung for it too answered the cowboy wrathfully  but what forto cripple our horses  either that or to cripple us dave weve got to be on our guard if those hossthieves are watching us  i dont think they were horsethieves todd  you dont then the cowboy broke off into a low whistle do you mean to say link merwell would play such a dirty trick  yes i do you havent any idea how that fellow hates me  hum mused sid todd well maybe but i thought it must be the hossthieves  why would horsethieves want to hurt our horses  they wouldnt want to do that but they might be thinking our horses would fall and throw us but i see that reasoning is weak maybe it was young merwelland hank snogger if it was they ought to be punished good an proper hear me went on the cowboy with emphasis  i am going to look around the bushes went on dave determinedly  look out that you dont get into trouble son anybody who would do this would do worse  dave had seen a heavy stick lying beside the road and arming himself with this he walked to the bushes and around them in the soft soil he made out a number of hoofprints and he called todds attention to these  on hossback both of em said the cowboy after an examination dave you was right he announced a little later it must have been merwell and snogger fer see they have taken the old trail along the river that leads to another trail that runs to the merwell ranch  well they are gone thats certain answered the youth after another look around we may as well be on our way but we ought to mend the bridge  well do thatan post a warning too said the cowboy  not without difficulty they managed to fasten the planks into place once more then at either end of the rickety structure they set up a stick in the road  thats the usual warning in this country explained todd it means go slow and look out  when the pair arrived at star ranch they found the boys and girls waiting for them  you must have walked back said belle we have been waiting for you ever since we heard the locomotive whistle  oh we had to stop to fix the bridge answered dave and then handed around the letters which instantly claimed attention so no more questions were asked then the crumville youth had supper and by that time it was late enough to go to bed  youve got a cut on your cheek dave said phil when the three boys were undressing did you scratch yourself  thereby hangs a tale phil quoted dave and then in a low voice told of the encounter at the railroad station and gave the true particulars of the trouble at the river  its the same old link murmured roger well have to watch out for him  i really think the girls ought to be warned said phil there is no telling what mean thing link might doif he met them alone  well we dont want to frighten them answered dave  better frighten them than give link the chance to annoy them answered the senators son  say i wish i had seen you polish off link cried phil it would have done my heart good ill wager he was as mad as he could be  oh he was mad enough replied dave with a grim smile but say when you get the chance i want you to look at that hank snogger he looks like somebody ive met somewhere but for the life of me i cant place him  is he handsome quizzed the shipowners son  no he looks melancholyas if he had something on his mind its a peculiar face and for the life of me i cant get it out of my mind  several days passed and nothing of importance happened the boys and girls enjoyed themselves thoroughly and the endicotts did all in their power to make the visitors feel at home at first jessie was inclined to be a little shy but soon this wore away and she felt as happy as anybody  it certainly is a splendid spot said she to dave i dont wonder laura was anxious to get back and to have you see it  it suits mei wouldnt ask for a better vacation especiallydave dropped his voice a littlewith you along jessie  oh dave she cried and blushed  it wouldnt be half so much fun if you hadnt come along jessie he went on i am very very glad that we are heretogether  well soso am i answered the girl and then still blushing she ran off to join belle and laura but the look she gave dave warmed his heart as it had never been warmed before  sunday passed with a little home service in which all those in the house and also a few of the cowboys joined the boys and girls sang some of the familiar church songs and this the cowboys greatly enjoyed  we dont git much in the way of entertainment here explained sid todd and that singin sounds mighty good to us it touches a fellow here too he added with his finger over his heart  if mr endicott will permit it well give you boys an entertainment before we go home answered dave we give them at oak hall you knowand the girls can help  say that sure would be fine answered the cowboy enthusiastically  the boys had found out from mr endicott where good fishing could be had and early of the second week at star ranch they went out taking the girls with them all were on horseback and carried lunch along for they were to remain out all day  now keep out of trouble said mrs endicott as they rode away and be sure to come back before dark  well be back by six mamma answered belle and you neednt worry about us for well be perfectly safe  they were bound for a spot among the foothills about six miles away here was located a mountain torrent said to be filled with the gamiest kind of specimens of the finny tribe sid todd had told them of a particularly good bend in the stream where fishing was bound to be excellent and belle said she knew the trail having gone to the locality several times with her father she was a true young sportswoman and could fish almost as well as her parent she carried the same kind of an outfit as did the boys jessie and laura did not expect to fish but said they would watch the others and pick wild flowers and also prepare the lunch when it came time to eat  all were in the best of health and spirits when they departed it promised to be an ideal day with the sun shining clearly and a gentle breeze blowing from the northwest they passed along at a smart gait for the boys and belle were anxious to try their luck with their lines and poles  if we catch enough right from the start we can fry some fish for lunch said dave i love fish just from the water  oh so do i cried belle they seem so much sweeter  in the city one gets them all packed in ice and then half the flavor is gone added laura  they started in a bunch but gradually drifted into pairs dave riding beside jessie roger escorting laura and phil taking the lead with belle the senators son and daves sister had become very chummy and it can be said that phil and belle were fully as attentive to one another as the occasion warranted all told stories and sang and the boys whistled  half an hour of riding brought them to the edge of a woods and here they had to proceed in single file or indian fashion as belle expressed it  by the way are there any indians around here asked jessie timidly  a few and they are very peaceable answered the ranch owners daughter our only enemies are the cattle and horsethieves  they were passing through some dense underbrush when belle suddenly called a halt the trail was very narrow and on either side grew dense clumps of trees  somebody is coming announced the girl  on this trail asked laura  yes  well have some fun passing each other especially if its a fat man remarked roger dryly and this caused a laugh  they waited and presently saw a boy approaching on horseback followed by a leanlooking man who wore a tattered cowboy dress and a muchbattered sombrero  its link merwell exclaimed phil  he was right and the bully did not stop until his horse stood directly in front of that ridden by belle then he came to a halt and his companion halted directly behind him  i want to pass growled link without so much as raising his hat or bidding the time of day  all right pass answered phil stiffly we are not keeping you  you are blocking the trail  cant you pass around the ladies questioned roger  ive got as much right on this trail as you returned the bully shooting a dark look at the others you neednt think you own everything  oh let us ride to one side and let him pass whispered jessie he may want to fight if we dont  he wont fight with so many against him answered dave  you are very considerate of the ladies i must say said roger well give you half the trail and no more and he urged his horse a little to one side and dave and phil did the same the girls moved still further over so that link merwell might not touch them as he passed  where are you going demanded the bully as he moved slowly forward  that is our affair not yours answered dave sharply  you keep off my fathers land  we dont intend to go near your land said belle coldly  oh i didnt mean you belle i meant dave porter and his cronies  mr porter and his friends are my guests mr merwell when you insult them you insult me and belle held her head high in the air  all right have your own way if you want to i havent got anything against you and your folks but i dont intend these outsiders shall ride over me growled link he faced dave im not done with you yet remember that he added bitterly then he rode on and the leanlooking man behind him followed belle looked at the man curiously but the fellow kept his face averted as he slipped by soon boy and man had disappeared from view  talk about a lemon cried phil say isnt link the sourest ever  he certainly is answered roger  lets forget him said dave we are out for fun today not for trouble and then they moved forward as before little did any of them dream of what that unexpected meeting in the woods was to bring forth     chapter xvii  in which some horses are stolen   a half hour more of riding brought the little party to the bank of the stream at a point where belle said they would be sure to find good fishing here there was something of a pool the river tumbling from some rocks above the pool was lined with rocks and brushwood and behind these was a glade backed up by the woods  what a lovely spot cried jessie enthusiastically as dave assisted her to dismount and took charge of her horse just look at the wild flowers among the rocks one would not believe that they could grow in such a place  i am glad i brought my camera with me said laura i am sure i shall get some fine pictures  belle showed the boys where the animals might be tethered and they took particular care to fasten the steeds properly as sid todd had instructed them then they got out their fishingrods and also that of belle and baited up with the artificial flies they had brought along  well fish for an hour announced dave and then ill knock off and start up a campfire  when you do that be careful and not set fire to the woods said belle papa is very much afraid of fire  i dont blame him put in roger a fire out here would do a terrible amount of damage  the boys and belle were soon busy fishing in the pool and along the lower part of the river the stream was about thirty feet in width and from a foot to four foot deep with great rocks sticking up here and there trout and some other fish were plentiful and all had but little difficulty in getting bites and it was great sport to play their catches and land them  this is the best fishing i ever saw cried phil as he succeeded in landing an extra fine mountain trout i dont wonder that fishermen come many miles to gratify their taste for such sport  heres another exclaimed belle merrily and brought in a fish that was a beauty roger and dave both leaped to help her and soon the catch was dropped into a side pool with the others  while the boys and belle were fishing laura and jessie wandered up and down the rocks and the grassy glade beyond gathering wild flowers and also some blackberries that grew in that vicinity daves sister also succeeded in getting several photographs including two of the others with their fishing outfits  now i want you all to stand in a group with your fish on strings said laura a little later when the fishing seemed to slow up a little and then she arranged them to suit herself and took two snapshots  now let me take a snapshot of you and jessie with your bunches of wild flowers said dave and this was soon added to the other films  they had great fun building a campfire and preparing lunch the boys cut the wood and started the blaze and even made coffee while the girls spread a tablecloth that had been brought along and put out tin plates and tin cups and the various good things to eat then some of the fish were cleaned by the boys and fried by the girls and all sat down to enjoy what every one declared was better than a feast at a hotel in the meantime the horses were tethered in a new place so that they could crop the luxurious grass  i can tell you one thing life in the open air gives one a great appetite remarked the senators son as he smacked his lips over a particularly dainty portion of trout  as if there was ever anything the matter with rogers appetite cried phil  how about yourself phil questioned dave with a grin  oh i reckon i can get away with my share answered the shipowners son calmly as he reached for another portion of the fish  as there was no hurry the boys and girls took their time over the meal and many were the stories told and the jokes cracked while the food was disappearing  if only some of the oak hall boys could see us now cried dave wouldnt they envy us  they certainly would answered roger  and what of the girls at home asked jessie i rather think theyd like to be in our place  crumville seems a long way off doesnt it said laura  besides the fish they had chicken sandwiches cake pie and half a dozen other things to eat and coffee and water from a sparkling spring to drink when they had finished they took it easy for a while and then fished some more and went strolling  i think we had better be thinking of returning said belle at length it is a long ride back remember and unless i am mistaken there is a storm coming up  a storm cried jessie oh i hope not  we dont want to get wet added laura  i dont think the storm will come right away but i dont like the looks of the clouds yonder  they certainly do look bad remarked dave casting his eyes in the direction to which belle pointed it didnt look like rain this morning  it may be more wind than rain dave sometimes we have great windstorms around star ranch  they were quite a distance up the river shore when belle called attention to the clouds they had gone up to get a view of a small but picturesque waterfall and laura had taken several snapshots with the boys and girls in the foreground seated on a fallen tree trunk now all started back in the direction of the temporary camp  say roger you help the girls pack up said dave phil and i can get the horses ready be sure to see that the fire is out too he called back  all right answered the senators son the fire is outi saw to that before he added  the horses had been tethered at some distance from the campingout spot behind some heavy brushwood where the grass was extra thick and nutritious dave hurried in that direction with phil at his heels  when the two youths reached the spot both stared around in perplexity  why dave stammered the shipowners son i thought  we left the horses here cried dave im sure of it  then where are they now  maybe they broke loose and wandered away  or else they have been stolen  stolen  yesit couldnt be otherwise they wandered away or they have been stolen  well take a look around  both boys hurried first in one direction and then another they could see hoofprints in the grass leading towards the rocks back of the bushes but that was all the horses had been tethered to some saplings  the halters didnt break thats certain said phil soberly for if they did wed find the broken ends  i cant understand it returned dave and his face grew thoughtful  hello came in rogers voice why dont you bring those horses we are all ready to go  come here called back dave something is wrong  the senators son answered the summons on a run and the three girls trailed behind him the newcomers to star ranch did not know what to say but belle uttered a cry of dismay  horsethieves  oh belle do you really think somebody has stolen the horses queried laura while jessie turned very pale  yes i do was the blunt response that is if they were tied properly  yes they were well tiedi saw to that myself said dave  i know mine was tied fast and so was lauras added the senators son  and i put a double knot in the rope to belles and mine came from phil  one thing is sure said laura they couldnt very well all break away at once  i am sure it is the work of horsethieves responded belle papa has been afraid they might come back  but how did they know about our horses being here asked phil  they must have watched us and seen us ride away from the ranch and then they followed and took the horses while we were up the river  if only we could follow them and get the horses back said the senators son with a sigh  they must be worth a lot of money murmured jessie oh supposing they had shot us she added tremblingly  horsethieves are usually cowards answered belle they wont shoot unless they are cornered id like to follow them myself but we cant do it on foot  what are we to do asked laura and looked at her brother  i dont know answered dave one or two of us boys might walk back to the ranch and tell the folks of what has happened  but it is such a distance dave cried jessie and see how black the sky is getting she added  it is quite a number of miles to the ranch house said belle you would not be able to reach there until long after nightfall  i shouldnt mind that answered dave but what will the rest of you do in the meantime you cant stay out here in the open very well with that storm coming on  dave youre not going to the house alone cried laura ill not allow it supposing those horsethieves should be watching you they might attack you and rob you  yes please dont think of going alone pleaded jessie and her eyes began to fill with tears  dave is not going alone i am going with him declared roger  no ill go volunteered phil you can stay with the girls  well both of you cant go answered dave with a grim smile somebody has got to stay herein fact i think it would be better that both of you stay with the girlsin case i dont get back with help by morning  of course if it wasnt for the loss of the horses we could all stay here said belle papa will be sure to send somebody out to look us up when it gets late and we are not back but i think he ought to know about the horses just as soon as possible  is there any sort of a shelter around here questioned roger  yes there is a shack about a quarter of a mile up the river answered the ranch owners daughter papa stayed there several nights once upon a time it isnt much of a place but it will shelter us from the storm  are you sure you can find it  oh yes ive been there twice  then you and the others had best put up there for the night and ill start at once for the ranch house went on dave i am not afraid and ill keep my eyes wide open for those horsethieves he continued  but to this plan the girls would not listen and at last it was arranged that roger should remain with the girls while dave and phil walked to the house for aid the crowd left behind were to hurry to the shack up the river and there make themselves as comfortable as possible until help arrived  do be careful now dave said his sister as he was on the point of departing  yes yes added jessie i shall worry every minute until you get back  dont be alarmed answered dave well get through all right and have help here before you know it  are you sure of the trail asked belle  oh yes thats easy answered phil  without another word the two chums started off in the direction of the ranch house so many miles distant the others watched them out of sight and then turned and walked up the river bank toward the shack belle had mentioned     chapter xviii  out in the wind and rain   dave what do you suppose those six horses were worth questioned phil as the two youths hurried along the back trail on a dogtrotthe same dogtrot they used when on a crosscountry run at oak hall  at least two thousand dollars phil was the reply the horse i used was a dandy and so was that belle hadand yours was a good one too  what do you suppose those horsethieves will do with them  drive them a long distance hide them for a while and then when they get the chance sell them of course they dont expect to get full value for them but theyll get a neat sum  you dont suppose this can be a trick of link merwells  i thought of that but i dont think so taking a horse in this section of the country is a serious business why they used to hang horsethieves and even now a ranchman wouldnt hesitate to shoot at a fellow who had his horse and was making off with it no i dont think link would quite dare to play such a trick but of course we can investigateafter we have reported to mr endicott  you are not going to try to keep up this dogtrot all the way to the house are you questioned the shipowners son after about a mile had been covered and when they were passing over a rather rough portion of the trail  winded  not exactly but i shall be if i keep this up panted phil besides i dont want to tumble over these tree roots  i wanted to get as far as possible on the way before that storm broke went on dave glancing anxiously upward between the branches of the trees when it comes i rather think it will be a corker i hope the others reach that shack before it rains  oh they ought to be there by this time  the boys kept on sometimes running and sometimes dropping into a walk as they advanced the sky kept growing steadily darker both on account of the storm and because the day was drawing to a close  heres the spot where we passed link and that man with him said dave presently wonder who that fellow was  oh some hand from the merwell ranch i suppose he didnt seem to be very sociable he kept his head turned away all the time link was talking to us  if hes from the merwell place they cant have very nice fellows up there  well who would want to work for a man like mr merwell he and link are just alike dictatorial and mean  the two boys kept on for a short distance further then phil caught his foot in a tree root and went sprawling  wow he spluttered as he arose hi dave wait for me he added for his chum had continued on the run  whats wrong  i tripped and felljust as i was afraid id do better go slowunless you want to break an ankle or skin your nose  the storm is coming said dave as he came to a stop much hurt  not veryscratched my hand thats all phew listen to the wind  the sky overhead was black with clouds but to the north and the south were great patches of light the wind was increasing steadily  maybe it will be more wind than rain said dave i hope so too for i have no fancy for getting drenched to the skin  i dont like a wind stormwhen i am in a big woods like this answered the shipowners son i am always afraid a tree will come down on me  well we have got to look out for thatif we can answered dave gravely i dont like it myself but it cant be helped  they continued on their way the wind increased rapidly and soon it grew so dark they could see little or nothing under the thickest of the trees they came to an open space and there the wind struck them with great force almost hurling them flat  say i thinkwe hadhad better wait aa bit panted phil as he clutched dave by the arm  let us get over to yonder rocks answered dave well be a little safer there than between the trees  hand in hand the chums crossed the glade and made for a series of rocks looming between the trees beyond the wind was now blowing with almost tornado force and with it came a few scattering drops of rain just as they gained the rocks something whizzed past their heads  what was that gasped phil ducking after the object had passed  it was a small tree limb answered dave weve got to watch out hark  they listened and above the whistling of the wind heard a great crash  its a tree being blown down cried phil come on let us get between the rocks before something hits us on the head  much alarmed both boys leaped for the shelter of the rocks and in the darkness felt their way until they reached a split that was seven or eight feet deep and a foot wide at the bottom and twice that at the top  i guess this is as good a place as any phil remarked dave when he had regained his breath sufficiently to speak  it wont be much protection if it rains hard grumbled the shipowners son  well i dont see that we can do better  neither do i  further conversation was cut off by the wind and the rain the former shrieked and whistled through the woods sending down branch after branch with tremendous crashes that awed the boys completely the rain was light but the drops were large and hit them with stinging force  for fully half an hour the blow continued and then it appeared to let up and the rain stopped entirely  shall we go on questioned phil standing up and trying to pierce the darkness around them  better hold up a while phil answered dave this is as safe a spot as any with the wind blowing down the trees all around us  they waited and it was well that they did so for presently the wind started to whistle once more growing louder and louder a small tree branch came down on them and then came a crash that made them both jump  its coming this way yelled phil the tree behind the rocks  get down cried dave and threw himself flat  both boys crouched as low as possible they heard the tree bend and crack then came a tremendous crash and they felt one of the rocks moving  maybe well be crushed to a jelly groaned the shipowners son  there was no time to say more for an instant later the tree came down directly over the top of the opening several small branches thrust themselves down upon the lads pinning them to the bottom of the crevice the rocks trembled and for the moment the boys were afraid they would be crushed to death as phil had intimated  safe phil asked dave as the rocking of the stones and the big tree ceased and the wind seemed to die down once more  ii guess so a tree limb is on my back though  ive got one across my legs  with caution both boys crawled from beneath the branches and out of the split in the rocks they could see where the big tree had been uprooted leaving a hole in the soil fifteen feet in diameter the top of the tree was all of a hundred feet away from this hole  we were lucky to be between the rocks phil said dave with a grave shake of his head otherwise if that tree had come down on us  we wouldnt be here to tell the tale finished the shipowners son ugh it makes me shiver to look at it  now it is down we may as well get between the rocks until we are sure this blow is over went on dave after standing several minutes in the rain  this appeared the best thing to do and they crawled back into the crevice and partly under the tree here the thick branches protected the lads so that but little rain reached them  a dismal hour went by and then the storm came to an end the wind died down into a gentle breeze and the rain was reduced to a few scattering drops to which they paid no attention  if only that wind didnt blow the shack down on the other folks heads said dave he was thinking of how frightened the girls and especially jessie must have been  ill wager the trail is now a mass of mud and water said phil and he was right and as they progressed they frequently got into the mud up to their ankles  it was eleven oclock when they gained the edge of the woods and came out on the plains the sky was still overcast only a few stars being faintly visible  are you sure of the right direction dave asked the shipowners son as both paused to look around  i think this is the trail phil dont you and dave pointed with his finger to a deep rut in the soil  yes but that doesnt make it right and phil gazed around in some perplexity  what do you mean this is the only trail around here  so i see but somehow this edge of the woods doesnt look familiar to me i thought we entered at a point where i saw a clump of four trees on the left  hum i rather think i saw those trees myself mused dave but i dont see them now  neither do i and that makes me think that perhaps we came out of the woods at the wrong spot  much perplexed the two lads walked around the edge of the woods for a considerable distance but they saw nothing of any other trail and so came back to the point from which they had started  this must be right after all was phils comment anyway its the only trail here so we may as well follow it  they hurried on the halt under the rocks having rested them a good deal out on the prairie the trail grew a bit drier for which they were thankful they got into their dogtrot once more and thus covered all of two miles in a short space of time then of a sudden both came to a halt in dismay  which one asked phil laconically  dont know was daves equally laconic answer  before them the trail branched out in three different directions like three spokes within the right angle of a wheel  this is a regular chinese puzzle said dave after an inspection of the trails the one to the right looks to be the most traveled  the two boys made every possible effort to pierce the darkness ahead of them and presently phil fancied he saw a light in the distance dave was not sure if it was a light or a star just showing above the clearing horizon  well we may as well go ahead said the shipowners son no use in staying here trying to figure it out  they went on taking the center one of the three trails they had covered less than quarter of a mile when phil gave a shout  it is a light i am sure of itthe light of a lamp or lantern hurrah we must be on the right trail after all  go slow phil cried dave a sudden thought striking him that may not be a ranch light  yes but  it may be something much worsefor us  what do you mean  it may be the light from the camp of the horsethieves     chapter xix  a fruitless search   phil stared at dave in consternation  do you really think that he cried  i dont say i think so i only say it may be returned the youth from crumville  if they are the horsethieves and we watch our chances we may get the animals back  not unless it is a single thief phil we dont want to run the risk of getting shot in the dark  thats true  with great caution the two lads advanced along the muddy trail as they got closer to the light they saw that it came from a log house low and rambling not far away were several other buildings and also a corral  we are on the right trail after all sang out the shipowners son joyfully and commenced to run at the best speed he could command  hold on called dave but phil was so eager to get to the house first that he paid no attention to the words not until he had reached the very piazza of the building did he pause to stare around him  why its not mr endicotts place at all he exclaimed  he had made considerable noise ascending the piazza and now a door was flung open letting a stream of light flood his face momentarily blinding him  hello what do you want demanded a man phil had never seen before  whyerwhat place is this stammered the youth and as he asked the question dave came up behind him  this is the triple x ranch was the mans answer  what mr merwells place stammered phil  thats it want to see him why say youre all out of windanything wrong  ii didnt know this was the merwell place murmured phil he knew not what else to say he was so taken back  who is that jerry asked another voice and a moment later felix merwell stepped into view as he saw dave he scowled slightly  why mr merwell weer commenced phil and then he looked at dave  we were out and we lost our way in the darkness and got on the wrong trail said dave quickly will you be kind enough to direct us to the trail to mr endicotts ranch  endicotts ranch is a good bit from here growled felix merwell  but dave interrupted phil when a meaning look from his chum silenced him  havent you got no hosses asked the man who had first come to the door  no but we dont mind that said dave we can walk  jerry show them the trail said mr merwell shortly and turned his back on the boys  the ranch hand came out without waiting to get his hat or coat and walked to a point back of the corral  its a long lonely way he said kindly you ought to have horses  how many miles asked dave  about one and a half  oh that is not so far  got caught in the storm eh  yes  link is out too and the old man is kind of worried about him he sent hank snogger out to look for him  then link didnt come back this afternoon said dave quickly  no hes been out since early morning you met him eh  yes but that was about the middle of the forenoon he was over in the woods  it was such a blow the old man is worried thinking link might have got caught under a tree in the woods or something like that theres your trail keep to that and it will take you right to the endicott corral  thank you said both boys and a moment later they and the man had separated the ranch hand watched them out of sight then returned to the house  dave why didnt you tell them about the horsethieves asked phil as soon as he deemed it safe to ask the question  i didnt want to ask any favors of mr merwell thats why was the reply i dont believe hed want to go after them and i didnt want to borrow any horses from him  well i dont blame you for looking at it that way but we may be losing valuable time  we ought to be able to reach mr endicotts place inside of twenty minutes come on and dave increased his speed  did you note the fact that link has not yet returned said the shipowners son  yes but that doesnt prove anything he may have crept into some place for shelter from the storm just as we did  the two youths kept on steadily and before long saw another light in the distance then they heard hoofbeats and soon several forms on horseback loomed out of the darkness  hello sang out the voice of sid todd who are you  todd called dave and a moment later the cowboy rode up followed by another ranch hand and mr endicott  what is wrong demanded the railroad president quickly where are the others and his face showed his extreme anxiety  the others are safe so far as we know answered dave but we have had quite an adventure and then he and phil told of how the horses had been stolen and of how they themselves had been caught in the woods during the great blow  the horsethieves again exclaimed mr endicott wrathfully we must get after them this time and run them down todd tell the other men at once we must lose no time in getting after them and send word around to the other ranches  the railroad president smiled grimly when the boys told him of the brief stop at the merwell place  i dont blame you for not wanting aid from mr merwell said he i want to leave him alone myself i am only sorry i have him for a neighbor id help him to sell out if he wished to do so  the boys went to the house and were speedily given something to eatfor they had had nothing since noon they also donned some dry clothing  it wont do any good for you to go out again said mr endicott ill go out and so will most of the hands you can remain here with mrs endicott who is very nervous because of the storm and the absence of belle  as you think best sir answered dave and so it was arranged truth to tell both dave and phil were glad to rest for the long walk and the experience in the woods during the storm had tired them greatly each threw himself on a couch and almost before he knew it was sound asleep  when the two boys awoke it was morning they found that mrs endicott had covered them up with light blankets a sound outside had aroused them  it was the other young people returning on horses sid todd had taken to them dave and phil sprang up to meet them  oh i am so glad to get back cried belle as she ran to embrace her mother such a time as we have had  oh yes we were safe enough after we got to the shack said laura in answer to a question from her brother but oh how it did blow  we were afraid the shack would be carried right up into the air said jessie and we were so worried about youthinking a tree in the woods would come down on you  well one did pretty nearly answered dave and gave the particulars  the men have all gone off after the horsethieves said roger but todd hasnt much hope of tracing them for the rain washed out all the hoofmarks  the newcomers were tremendously hungry and a hearty meal was gotten ready with all the speed of which the chinese cook was capable as they ate the boys and girls told the details of their experience at the shack up the river  did you see anything more of link or that man with him asked dave  no answered the senators son weve been wondering if they had anything to do with the disappearance of the horses  we have been wondering the same thing said phil  i spoke to papa about it and he says he will interview mr merwellif they get no trace of the thieves said the ranch owners daughter  those who had been at the shack all night were so tired that they went to bed directly after eating and dave and phil were glad enough to rest some more so that the balance of the day passed quietly it was not until after sundown that mr endicott showed himself followed by about half of the ranch hands  we thought we found the trail but we lost it again said the ranch owner todd and some of the others are still at it but i am afraid the thieves are out of our reach i have sent word to the sheriff and i suppose hell put some men on the trail tomorrow  did you stop at the merwell ranch asked belle  yes i stopped there less than an hour ago mr merwell had just come in from a hunt for link  what then link isnt back yet cried dave  no and his father was a good deal worried about his absence when i told about the loss of the horses mr merwell was worried more yet he said we neednt think that his son touched them  it is queer where link is keeping himself mused roger  thats trueunless he was hurt by the storm answered phil  have you any idea who these horsethieves are asked dave  we have a general idea yes answered mr endicott the gang who took the other animals was led by a bold cowboy named andy andrews andrews is a thoroughly bad egg and there had been a reward offered for his capture for several years more than likely this raid was made by him or under his directions  then i sincerely hope they round up this andy andrews remarked dave  so do iand that we get our horses back  the night and the next day passed quietly when it grew dark sid todd came in followed by several of the ranch hands the look on the foremans face showed that he had had no success in his hunt  we got the trail once but lost it agin said the cowboy the sheriff has got a posse of six men working on the trail nowbut i dont think theyll make anything out of it and then he told the story of how the woods had been scoured and of a hunt along the river and over the plains the men had ridden many miles and were all but exhausted  did you see anybody from the merwell ranch asked dave  saw link and his father just as we were coming home answered sid todd merwell said he had seen nothing of the thieves  did link say anything  no he was dead tired and he looked scared  scared queried roger  yes when he saw me i thought he was going to run away i asked him if he had seen anything and when he answered me his face went almost white i reckon he was scaredthinking of the way he treated you folks on the trail maybe he thought i was goin to pitch into him for it  maybe said dave slowly he hadnt seen anything of the thieves  no he said he didnt know the hosses was gone until his father told him he said he got lost in the woods and stayed in a certain spot till the blow was over  humph murmured dave and there the talk came to an end but dave was not satisfied he still wondered if link merwell knew anything about the taking of the horses     chapter xx  fishing and hunting   the remainder of the week went by and the boys and girls amused themselves as best they could during that time mr endicott received a visit from the sheriff of the county and dave and his chums were called upon to tell all they could about the missing horses then after some whispered talk between the county official and the ranch owner the lads were requested to describe the man who had been seen on the trail in company with link merwell  i really think the fellow was andy andrews said the sheriff but if so he had a big nerve to show himself in these parts  didnt you ask link about the man asked dave  yes he says the fellow was a stranger to him and they were just riding together for company he says they were together about half an hour before he met you on the trail and that the fellow left him about a quarter of an hour later and headed in the direction of the railroad station he said the fellow didnt give any name but said he was looking up some ranch properties for some chicago capitalists  this was all the sheriff could tell and on that the matter for the time being rested fortunately star ranch possessed a good number of horses so none of the young folks were deprived of mounts but belle mourned the loss of her favorite steed to which she had become greatly attached  i dont care so much for the others but i do hope papa gets back lady alice she said dolefully  a spell of bad weather kept the young folks indoors for the time being and one day they were reminded by a cowboy of the entertainment they had promised  as soon as it clears well give you an exhibition of fancy ridin said the cowboy but jest now the boys are dyin fer some good singin an music and such  dave and the others got their heads together and the upshot of the matter was that an entertainment was arranged to be given in the big dininghall of the ranch house one end of this room was elevated to form a stage with big portières for curtains and roger phil and dave rehearsed several of the turns they had done at various times at oak hall the girls practiced a number of songs and laura and the senators son decided to give a dialogue which they called which mr brown lives here  word was passed around about the coming entertainment and it was announced that it would be for the benefit of an old lady the mother of a cowboy who had been killed in a cattle stampede the season before the tickets were placed at one dollar each the entire proceeds to go to the old lady this charity appealed to the cowboys and every one on the place took a ticket and then got the cowboys from neighboring ranches to do likewise  well have to let some of them sit on the veranda and look in through the windows said mrs endicott when she heard how many tickets had been sold the room wont hold half of them  if we have to well give a double performance said dave we want everybody to get his moneys worth and then it was arranged that tickets should be good for either the matinée or the night performance  the first performance was given in the afternoon and lasted from three to halfpast five oclock every number on the programme went off without a hitch and the cowboys applauded uproariously during the intermission one cowboy got up very gravely and marched to the stage where he deposited a round indian basket  fer extra contributions boys he sang out loudly dont be tight when thars an old lady to help and he dropped two silver dollars in the basket at once the other cowboys sprang up and marched to the front and a steady stream of silver poured into the basket much to the delight of everybody  financially this is going to be a great success said dave his face beaming i only hope they really like the show  they do or they would soon let you know answered belle a cowboy isnt so polite as to make believe he likes a thing when he doesnt  the evening crowd was even larger than that which had gathered in the afternoon and the seating capacity of the diningroom and the veranda near the windows was taxed to its utmost the boys and girls started in to give exactly the same show as during the afternoon and the first part went off very well the indian basket was again brought into play and once more a shower of silver was poured into it  mrs chambers will be more than delighted said belle  how much money do you think we will have for her asked jessie  oh ticket money and extra contributions at least two hundred dollars it will be a splendid aid to the old lady  during the first part of the evenings entertainment dave had been much surprised to note the entrance of hank snogger accompanied by two other cowboys from the merwell ranch snogger looked a bit sheepish as if realizing that he was out of his element the other two cowboys were rough and hardlooking men and had evidently been drinking  i didnt think wed have anybody here from the merwell place whispered phil  well i suppose some of our cowboys sold them the tickets answered dave i certainly didnt think that fellow snogger would show himself  the men with him are pretty loud said roger i hope they dont try to break up the show  the second half of the entertainment was in full swing when one of the men with snogger commenced to laugh uproariously his companion joined in and both made such a noise that not a word spoken on the stage could be heard by the rest of the audience  say keep quiet there called out sid todd who was acting as a sort of usher  the two cowboys paid no attention to this request but continued to laugh and presently one of them joined in the chorus of one of the songs the girls and boys were rendering he sang badly out of tune and made such a discord that the song had to come to a stop  go on go on he yelled loudly  whoop her up everybody called his companion all join in the glad refrain and he started to sing in a heavy liquorladen voice  you shut up or git out cried sid todd striding forward  they dont mean no harm put in hank snogger but he did not speak in positive tones  you keep out of this snogger answered todd coldly those men have got to behave themselves or git out i said it an i mean it  thats rightput em out shouted several  aint we got a right to laff demanded one of the cowboys who were making the disturbance  yes but not so as to drown everything else answered sid todd an you cant sing  we come here fer some fun said the other cowboy from the merwell ranch an we are going to have it whoop her up everybody and he commenced to sing once more  there were cries from all sides and for a minute it looked as if the entertainment would end in a general row but then sid todd gave a signal to some of the other endicott hands and in a twinkling the two boisterous cowboys were grabbed and hustled from the house one tried to draw his pistol but was given a blow in the face that all but sent him flat  you brought those fellows over hereyou take em awayan mighty quick too said sid todd to hank snogger and he gave the other cowboy such a black look that snogger sneaked out of the house in a hurry outside the three men were surrounded by a dozen of the endicott hands and they were forced to mount their horses and ride away and that was the last seen of them for the time being  the interruption made laura and jessie so nervous that they could not sing any more so the programme had to be changed dave thought of a funny monologue shadow hamilton had once given at oak hall and he gave this as far as he could remember it and put in a few stories that were new the youth worked hard and the cowboys applauded him vigorously when he had finished and soon the unpleasant incident was practically forgotten when the show was over the cowboys all said it was the finest thing they had ever seen outside of a city theater  worth the money said one old cowboy an id go agin tomorrow night ef i could entertainments in that locality were rare and the show was a grand treat to all  oh but those men who laughed and sang were horrid said laura and i was so afraid they would start to shoot i didnt know how to control myself  i believe they came over here on purpose to spoil the entertainment said phil  but why should they do that asked jessie innocently  more than likely link merwell got them to do it answered roger it would be of a piece with his meanness  i believe they were brought over by that hank snogger said the shipowners son  yes but i think snogger is in some way under links thumb put in dave anyway the two seem to have a good deal in common  well it was a mean piece of business said belle oh i do wish the merwells would sell out to some nice people it would be splendid to have real good neighbors  on the following monday the boys went fishing on their own hook as phil expressed it although jessie said he had better say hooks since they proposed to use several of them the boys rode over to the river and took with them their shotguns while fishing they kept their horses in sight and their firearms ready for use and had any horsethieves shown themselves they would have met with a hot reception fishing proved good and inside of three hours they had all the fish on their strings that they cared to carry  let us ride up the river a bit suggested phil after they had eaten their lunch id like to look at the country and it is possible we may be able to stir up some game  as it was a clear day the others agreed and soon they were riding slowly along a trail which wound in and out among the rocks bordering the stream they passed the shack which roger and the girls had used as a shelter from the storm and then reached an open spot beyond was a high hill covered with a primeval forest  there ought to be some game in that woods said dave as they continued to move forward  if the cowboys havent shot everything worth shooting answered the senators son there used to be good hunting in maine and in upper new york state but you have got to tramp a good many miles these days before you catch sight of anything worth while  after a ride in the sun it was cool and pleasing in the forest and they took their time riding under the great trees some of which must have been fifty to a hundred years old they saw a number of birds flitting about but did not attempt to bring any down  if we want any big game we must keep quiet said dave and after that they moved along without speaking and with their eyes and ears on the alert for the first sign of something worth shooting  presently dave held up his hand and all came to a halt not far away could be heard a curious drumming sound  whats that whispered phil  sounds like grouse answered dave they drum like that sometimes they must be over in the trees yonder let us dismount and see  the others were willing and leaving their horses tied to the trees the three boys crept forward to the spot from which the drumming proceeded they came up abreast and soon all caught sight of a number of grouse of the sharptailed variety huddled in a little opening among the bushes  get ready and fire when i give the word whispered dave and a few seconds later all three of the chums blazed away simultaneously there was a fluttering and more drumming and several grouse thrashed the ground  hurrah weve got four cried roger rushing forward  and this one makes five said phil and dispatched one that was fluttering around then dave killed a sixth and by that time the rest of the game was out of sight     chapter xxi  a wildcat among the horses   the bringing down of the grouse filled the boys with satisfaction and they inspected the game with much interest  theyll make fine eating declared roger  let us see if we cant get some more pleaded phil the fever of hunting had taken possession of him  well not find much in this neighborhood said dave but i am willing to go a little further he added seeing how disappointed the shipowners son looked  placing the game over their shoulders they reloaded their weapons and continued on through the forest taking a trail that seemed to have been made by wild animals twice they had to cross a winding brook and at the second fordingplace dave who was in the rear called a halt  what do you want questioned roger as he and phil turned back  i want you to look at these hoofmarks answered dave and he pointed up the stream a short distance  all passed to the locality indicated and each youth looked at the hoofmarks with interest they were made by a number of horses probably six or eight and though the marks were washed a little as if by rain they could still be plainly seen  do you think they were made by the horses that were stolen dave questioned phil  i dont know what to think  the horsethieves might easily have come this way said the senators son they would be more apt to go away from the ranch than towards it  maybe they stopped here during the big blow said phil  i think you are right for here are marks where the animals were tied to trees went on dave i wonderwell i declare  dave stopped short and picked up a bit of a leather halter lying on the ground it was of curious mexican design having a light leather thong entwined in a dark one  i dont know that i have ever seen a halter like that before mused roger as he took the bit of halter from dave and then passed it to phil  i have answered dave  so have i cried the shipowners son link merwells horse had one on the day we met on the trail  just what i was going to say added dave i noticed it particularly  then this must belong to link came from the senators son  perhaps not answered dave slowly there may be other such halters around well have to give link the benefit of the doubt you know  see here burst out phil you may think as you please but i have always thought that link had something to do with the taking of our horses  do you think he would deliberately steal six horses phil  well maybe not deliberately steal them butbuti think he took them anyhow  he may have taken them intending to drive them to our ranch and perhaps the horses got away from him in the storm suggested roger  that may be trueit would be just like one of links mean tricks answered dave  i think we ought to tax him with it said phil  hed deny it pointblank if you did returned the senators son this bit of halter is no proof against him no youd only get into hot water if you accused him without proofs  what roger says is true declared dave well not say a word against link or accuse him until we have some good proof that he is guilty  taking the bit of halter with them the three chums continued on their way along the trail they covered another quarter of a mile but saw no game excepting some birds on which they did not care to waste powder and shot  well have to go back i suppose said phil with a sigh gracious i wish wed see a bear or something  how would an elephant and a few lions do quizzed roger with a grin  or a couple of maneating tigers suggested dave  i dont care you can make fun if you want to but i came out to this ranch to have some hunting said phil stubbornly im going to the mountains and get something worth while some day  so are we all going phil answered dave quickly i want to bring down some big game just as much as you do  sid todd said hed take us said roger well make him keep his word  they took a look around the locality where they were standing and then turned back to where they had left their horses they were still some distance from the animals when they heard one of the steeds give a sudden snort of alarm looking through the trees they saw phils horse leap and plunge and then the others did likewise as if trying to break from their halters  something is wrong cried dave come on before the horses break away  something has scared them put in roger keep your guns ready for a shot it may be a bear  no such luck declared phil nevertheless he swung his shotgun into position for firing and his chums did likewise  as the boys entered the opening where the horses were tied dave caught sight of what was causing the disturbance out on the branch of a tree directly over the animals was a chunky and powerful looking wildcat commonly called in that section of the country a bobcat its eyes were gleaming wickedly its teeth were exposed and it acted as if ready to leap at the throat of one of the horses  look cried dave and then as quickly as he could he leveled his shotgun took aim and fired the report of the firearm was followed by a bloodcurdling cry from the wildcat and down from the tree limb it tumbled to roll over and over on the ground between the horses  oh what a savage beast gasped phil and for the instant he was so taken aback that he did not know what to do  hell drive the horses crazy shouted roger oh if i could only get a shot at him  what the senators son said about the horses was true the wildcat had been badly but not mortally wounded and now it was rolling and twisting on the ground sending the dirt and leaves flying in all directions the steeds were in a panic and leaped and plunged hither and thither doing their best to break away  i should have waited until we all had the chance to shoot said dave if i can catch my horse  he got no further for just then roger seeing a chance rushed in between two of the steeds and pulled both triggers of his shotgun in quick succession his aim was true and hit in the side the wildcat rolled over and then started to crawl back into some bushes  he is going shouted dave  i must have a shot put in phil recovering somewhat and now he blazed away when the smoke rolled off the boys saw that the wildcat had disappeared  where is he  he went into yonder bushes  is he dead do you think  i dont know be careful or he may leap out at us  such were some of the remarks made as the three boys reloaded in the meantime keeping their eyes on the spot where the wildcat had last been seen the horses were still plunging but gradually they quieted down  i am going to see if the wildcat is really dead said dave boldly even if hes alive i dont think there is much fight left in him  you be careful warned phil a wounded beast is always extra savage he may fly at your throat and then it will be all up with you  i guess we plugged him pretty well said roger  with great caution dave approached the bushes into which the wildcat had disappeared and rather gingerly his chums followed him they could see a trail of blood which led to the bottom of a hollow between some rocks here they beheld the wildcat stretched out on its side  dead as a stone announced dave after a brief examination  are you sure questioned phil he may be shammingsome wild beasts do you know  no hes deadyou can see for yourself  what shall we do with him questioned roger after all were convinced that the wildcat was really dead he isnt good for much  we could keep the skinor have him stuffed suggested phil  let us take him back to the ranchso that the folks can see we really killed him said dave then we might have him stuffed and sent to oak hall to put in the museum  just the thing cried the senators son that will please doctor clay i am sure  they dragged the wildcat out into the open and laid it where the horses might see that it was dead as soon as they were aware of this the steeds quieted down completely and the boys had no more trouble with them dave and phil carried the grouse and the fish and roger slung the wildcat up behind his saddle and then off they set for star ranch at a gallop  here come the fishermen cried laura who was out in front of the ranch house i hope you had luck  we did answered dave gayly how is that and he held up a string of fish  splendid dave  and how is that he went on holding up two of the grouse  i declare some game too why youve had good luck havent you  let me see said belle as she appeared followed by jessie  and how is this asked phil showing his fish and the rest of the game  oh how grand murmured belle  what is that roger has questioned jessie  a wildcat cried the senators son and leaping down he brought the dead beast into full view all the girls shrieked and jessie started to run back into the house hearing the commotion mrs endicott appeared and then her husband  a bobcat cried the railroad president i didnt know there were any near this place a big fellow too he added as he inspected the animal  did you shoot him roger asked laura  we all had a hand in it answered the senators son dave gave him the first dose of shot and then phil and i got in our work it was a hard job to kill him i can tell you and then roger told of how the wounded beast had fallen down among the horses  you can be thankful your horses didnt get away said mr endicott i knew of a horse once that was scared by a bear and he ran several miles and wasnt caught until the next day  oh dave werent you scared when you saw him on the tree whispered jessie she felt proud to think her hero had been the first to shoot at the beast  i didnt give myself time to get scared he answered i just fired as quickly as i could  but supposing the wildcat had jumped on you and the girl shivered and caught him by the arm  i should have defended myself as best i could jessie  youyou mustnt take such risks the pretty girl whispered and looked wistfully into daves eyes ii cant stand it dave and then she blushed and turned her face away  ill be very careful after this jessiefor your sake he answered softly and tenderly     chapter xxii  cowboy tricks and broncobusting   you boys sure did have a day of sport said sid todd after he had inspected the fish the grouse and the wildcat and youve proved that you can shoot he added nodding toward the slain beast ive known many a putty good hunter to get the shakes when he see a bobcat aglarin at him from a tree it aint no tender sight is it now  not much answered phil warmly he had been as close to getting the shakes as any one of the three i was glad when i knew he was dead  something about a bobcat i dont like went on the cowboy we used to hunt emwhen they got after the sheep some years ago once one of em jest about got me by the throat an i aint forgitting it id rather face a bear i think  you mustnt forget that you are to take us to the mountains on a hunting expedition came from roger we want to get some deer or an elk before we go back east  ill take youdont worry answered the cowboy  the news soon spread around the ranch that the tenderfeet had killed a big bobcat and all the hands came to get a look at the beast they praised the boys and said they must be nervy hunters or they could not have done it of course the lads were correspondingly proud and who can blame them the animal was prepared for stuffing and then sent off by express to a taxidermist in the city  after talking the matter over among themselves the boys decided to tell mr endicott about the piece of mexican halter they had picked up he listened gravely to what they had to say and looked at the bit of leather curiously  i am afraid it is not much in the way of evidence said he but ill remember it and well have to watch link merwellthat is as well as we can there would be no gain in speaking to mr merwell it would only stir up the bad feeling that already exists i understand that he has had an offer for his ranch from somebody in the east and i trust he sells out and moves somewhere else  so do i echoed dave heartily some place where none of us will ever hear of him or his son again  two days after the shooting of the wildcat sid todd announced that the cowboys of star ranch and hooper ranch up the river were going to hold a contest in broncobusting and in fancy riding all the young folks were invited to be present and a little stand was to be erected from which they might view what was going on in comfort  hurrah that suits me cried dave ive been wanting to see them break in a real bronco  and i want to see some of their fancy riding added the senators son it will be a real wild west show  and no fifty cents admission either said phil with a grin  i hope nobody gets hurt said jessie timidly  oh they are generally more careful than you think answered mr endicott  but broncobusting is dangerous isnt it questioned laura  yesfor anybody who has had no experience but todd and some of the others can saddle and ride any pony in these parts  all went out to the stretch of plain where the contest was to take place the little stand was there true enough and to the four corners were nailed four flagstwo of the stars and stripes and one each of the two ranches that of the endicotts having a blue field with the words star ranch in white  the word had been passed around for a good many miles and consequently a crowd numbering over a hundred had assembled on the field including half a dozen ladies and several children the cowboys were out on parade as mr endicott expressed it and each wore his best riding outfit and had his horse and trappings slicked up to the last degree all wore their largest mexican sombreros and taken together they formed a truly picturesque assemblage  puts me in mind of gypsies said laura only they havent their wives and children with them  and they arent telling fortunes added jessie  the sport began with some fancy riding in which eight of the cowboys four from each ranch participated the cowboys would ride like the wind and leap off and on their steeds turn from frontwards to backwards slide from the saddle under their horses necks and up into the saddle again and lean low to catch up handkerchiefs and hats left on the grass for that purpose then they did some fancy vaulting over bars and brushwood and while riding two and even four horses  good good shouted dave isnt that fine  best i ever saw answered roger and everybody in the crowd applauded vigorously  after the fancy riding came some shooting while in the saddle both at stationary objects and at things sprung into the air from a trap the repeated crack crack crack of the pistols and rifles scared some of the girls a little but the boys enjoyed the spectacle thoroughly and marveled at some of the shots made  game wouldnt stand much chance with those chaps remarked dave they could hit a running deer or a flying bird without half trying  the shooting at an end the cowboys brought out their best lassoes and showed what could be done in landing the circlets over running steers and horses here sid todd was in his element and the way he managed his lasso one of extra length at that brought out tremendous applause  he is the best lassothrower in these parts said mr endicott no one can compare with him  well he is a good shot too said dave and he rides well also  yes he is a good allaround fellow answered the ranch owner i am mighty glad i have himand i am glad i got rid of that hank snogger he added  are any of the men from the merwell ranch here  no i warned them to keep awayafter that trouble we had at your entertainmentand mr hooper the owner of the other ranchtold them to keep away too some of those fellows drink and if they got to quarreling there might be some shooting and then there would be no telling where the thing would end i made up my mind id take no chances  the broncobusting as it is called was reserved for after lunch several wildlooking ponies were tethered at a distance and it was the task of those who proposed to do the busting to take a saddle fasten it on a pony and then get up and ride around the field at least twice the ponies were unbroken and of the sort usually designated as vicious and unreliable  it was truly a thrilling exhibition and one the boys and the girls too for the matter of that never forgot as soon as a bronco was approached he would begin to plunge and kick and to get a saddle on him was all but impossible then if at last he was saddled and the cowboy who had been successful got in the seat the pony would leap and plunge some more sometimes going straight up into the air and coming down with legs as stiff as posts then if this did not throw the cowboy off the pony would start to run only to stop short suddenly in the hope of sending the rider over his head  oh somebody will be killed screamed jessie and often turned her face away to shut out the sight oh why do they do such dreadful things she added  theyve got to break the ponies somehow answered dave those broncos will be all right after they get used to it  say do you know id like to try that remarked roger i think i could sit on one of those ponies if he had the saddle on  i think i could do it too added dave  oh dave exclaimed his sister while jessie gave a little shriek of horror  its not as bad as it looksafter the pony is saddled answered dave  well try it tomorrowon the quiet whispered roger  after the busting of the broncos had come to an end there was a twomile race for a first and a second prize put up by the two ranch owners in this race nine of the cowboys started amid a wild yelling and the cracking of numerous pistolsfor the average cowboy is not enjoying himself unless he can make a noise  they are off yelled phil  yes and see them go added dave  ill bet our ranch wins came from roger  what will you bet asked belle mischievously  a box of candy against a cream pie  thats fairbut i cant bet against our ranch answered belle gayly  on and on thundered the horses across the plains to a spot a mile distant at first three of the cowboys from the other ranch were in the lead and their followers cheered them loudly  oh we are going to lose said belle with a pout as the leaders in the race started on the return  no no answered dave see sid todd is coming to the front  yes and yates is crawling up too added phil  nearer and nearer to the finish line swept the cowboys those in the rear doing their best to forge ahead now sid todd yates and two cowboys from the hooper ranch were neckandneck  it will be a tie murmured laura  no todd is gaining cried mr endicott who was as much excited as anybody see he and hoopers man are now ahead  here they come on the homestretch was the general cry  on and on thundered the horses nearer and nearer to the finishing line when the leaders were less than fifty yards off sid todd made a spurt  here comes todd  todd wins todd wins  galpey is second  yes and yates is third  say thats riding for you and so the cries rang out sid todd had indeed won and all of his friends from star ranch congratulated him the second prize went to the cowboy from the hooper ranch yates got nothing but was content to know that he had come in third and only five yards behind the leader  well that certainly was an entertainment worth looking at said dave when it was over and they were returning to the ranch house  ive never been so stirred up answered roger but say i am going to try one of those broncos tomorrow he added  not for me said phil i value my neck too much  what about you dave and the senators son looked anxiously at the crumville lad  well ill see answered dave he was not afraid to try riding a bronco but he did not wish to worry jessie and his sister  you are not afraid are you  no  well i am not afraid either came quickly from phil and his face grew red you neednt think  oh dont get mad phil i didnt mean anything interposed roger if you dont care to try it you dont have to  but you neednt insinuate that i  i am not insinuating anything phil i merely wanted to know if dave will try riding with me thats all  well ieri know what you think and if you try this broncobusting business whyill try it too so there answered phil defiantly  at the house the talk was entirely of the things they had seen jessie was rather glad it was over for rough things made her somewhat afraid belle was enthusiastic and said she had once tried broncobusting herself  but i didnt do much she said the pony started to run and then stopped suddenly and i went over his head into a stack of hay i was glad the hay was there otherwise i might have broken some of my bones  it is dangerous sport at the best said mrs endicott but the cowboys feel that the ponies must be broken in and there is no other way to do it     chapter xxiii  dave on a bronco   dave had his doubts about doing any broncobusting on his own account but he did not say anything to roger and phil about it he was not afraid but he knew jessie would be greatly worried if he attempted anything dangerous  however his chums got him up early the following morning and directly after breakfast roger led the way down to the corral  i am going to try it even if you are not said the senators son and insisted upon it that one of the unbroken ponies be brought forward the saddle was adjusted by sid todd who held the animal while roger leaped into the saddle  the experience was not as exciting as had been anticipated for the reason that the animal chosen by todd was somewhat tame the cowboy was attached to the boys and did not wish to see any of them run the risk of breaking his neck  after roger came phil and he was timid enough to ask for a horse that didnt look as if he wanted to eat somebody up phil had more of a time of it than roger but managed to keep in the saddle and ride around the corral several times  its not so hard as i supposed said the shipowners son as he leaped to the ground and the pony freed of the saddle galloped off i thought id be halfkilled  those ponies were not so wild as those used yesterday answered dave not but that they were bad enough he continued with a smile  sid todd had remained to hold the pony ridden by phil and had then been called away to attend to some business at another part of the ranch he had told yates to help the boys  now as it happened yates was full of fun and always up to practical jokes it had disgusted him to see todd bring out such comparatively safe ponies as those ridden by roger and phil he had been told to bring out a certain animal for dave but instead led forth a bronco that was as wild and fiery as any used the day previous  if he rides that beast hes a good one yates murmured to himself and then he beckoned to some other cowboys to watch the fun half a dozen quit work to draw closer each with a broad grin on his sunburnt face they expected to see dave get the shakingup of his life and felt positive he would not be able to stay on the broncos back two minutes  he certainly is a wild one said dave as he advanced and eyed the pony  oh hes no worse than the others answered yates smoothly and then he rolled his eyes and winked at the other cowboys  dave looked critically at the saddle and saw to it that it was properly buckled then he flung his cap to roger  say dave that pony looks halfcrazy said phil you be careful  he certainly does look wild added roger  well im going to ride him anywayor know the reason why cried dave and a look of strong determination came into his face get around there he called sharply to the pony and then with a quick leap he gained the saddle and dug his knees into the ponys sides let him go  yates released his hold and everybody in the crowd backed away for a moment the bronco stood stockstill his eyes gazing straight ahead then he gave a vigorous shake and took a few steps forward  hurrah see him ride shouted yates and winked again at the other cowboys who grinned more than ever  five steps forward and the bronco halted then up in the air he went a distance of six or eight feet he came down on all fours good and hard and had dave been resting in the saddle he would have had the wind knocked out of him completely but the youth was standing in the stirrups and he allowed his body to spring with that of the animal he hoped to conquer  illustration then up in the air he wentpage 224  three times the bronco tried this trick and the third time dave came close to falling off then the bronco gave a dart forward like an arrow from a bow  there he goes yelled the senators son but the words were not yet out of his mouth when the bronco stopped short dave slid to the animals neck but there he clung his face pale and determined and his teeth set  hi hi whats this shouted a voice and turning the crowd saw sid todd approaching on the run yates what do you mean by letting him git up on that critter he demanded indignantly  aint that the bronco you wanted him to try asked the other cowboy innocently  noan you know it stormed todd do you want him to break his neck hi dave jump down you cant tame that beast nohow  iim allriright jerked out dave between his teeth kekeep away he added as todd came closer to lend his assistance  hes a bad one boyone o the worst on the ranch yates had no call to offer him to you  kekeep away was all dave replied he could not say more for the bronco claimed all his attention  yates if that boy is hurt youll have an account to settle with me said sid todd and shook his fist at the other cowboy  ieri was sure you wanted me to bring out that beast fer him murmured yates uneasily he was sorry now that he had played the trick on dave  the bronco had taken another run coming to as sudden a halt as before dave slid up almost to the animals ears but still clung on and quickly regained his seat in the saddle then without warning the pony dropped to the ground and started to roll over  look out youll have your leg broken yelled phil but dave was on his guard and as the pony dropped he leaped away to safety then as the animal arose once more the youth grabbed the saddle and vaulted into the seat  say thats goin some i tell you roared one of the cowboys in delight he aint givin in yet he aint  look out that he dont bang you into a fence or one of the buildings yelled sid todd he was alarmed yet delighted at the manner in which dave clung to his difficult and dangerous undertaking  with dave once more on his back the pony tried new tactics around and around he went in a circle sending the dust of the corral flying in all directions then like lightning he reversed nearly breaking his own neck and causing dave to slip far down on the outer side but the youth hung to the saddle and leaning forward slapped the bronco a smart crack on the neck this he followed up with a blow on the head  the effect was just what the boy desired the pony forgot all his tricks and leaping high into the air he shot off like a streak toward the corral gate once outside he headed for the open plains going with the speed of a racer on the track  theyre off cried roger  dont let him throw you yelled todd  cant we ride after em queried phil  sure we can ride after em responded todd an we better do it too fer there aint no tellin what that pony will do to dave he added anxiously and with a black look at yates which made the other cowboy cast his eyes to the ground  on and on sped the bronco with dave sitting firmly in the saddle so long as the pony kept going the lad felt he had nothing to fear but he was on the alert for he did not know but that the animal would play another trick at any instant  go on old boy he muttered weve got miles and miles of prairie ahead of us run till you are tired but remember youve got to carry me back he added grimly  soon the ranch house and the corral were mere specks in the distance and then even these faded from view the pony kept to the open country and not once did he slacken his speed  i guess hell drop into a walk when his wind is gone thought dave but the ponys breathing apparatus showed no sign of giving out dave allowed his eyes to turn back and calculated he had gone two or three miles maybe we had better turn back now he murmured and tried to guide the steed in a circle but this was a failure the pony kept straight ahead running due eastward as the youth could see by the sun  all right go as far as you please said dave grimly if you can stand it so can i and he settled in the saddle  another two miles were covered and then the bronco commenced to slacken his speed dave was on guard at this and it was well to be for a second later the pony once more tried the trick of flinging his rider over his head but the effort was a failure and in return dave dug his knees deeply into the steeds ribs then off went the pony on a run again  this time the bronco did not cover over a mile before dropping into a walk then dave tried again to turn the animal but without success  dont want to go back eh said the youth well youve got to and that is all there is to it and he hit the pony a sharp slap on the neck and dug his knees into the animals ribs as before  the bronco was now losing courage he commenced to run but did not keep it up for more than a hundred yards but when he dropped into a walk dave urged him up and again he ran but now only a dozen steps then the youth pulled on the left rein and the bronco came around with scarcely any trouble  you arent mastered yet but youre pretty close to it said the boy we are going home understand home  the bronco moved forward about a hundred feet then he deliberately dropped on the prairie and lay on his side as quiet as a lamb  want to rest eh said dave well not out here you brought me here and youve got to take me back get up  he gave the animal a prod in the side the bronco kicked out then dave gave a harder prod this the pony would not stand and up he came with surprising agility he tried to bolt but dave caught the saddle and clung there they headed again eastward away from the ranch  all right now run for it and keep it up as long as you please cried the boy and urged the steed forward over the prairie the pony sped as if he had just started in the race thus another mile was covered and now dave calculated he must be six or seven miles from star ranch the country about him looked strange and he wondered where he was nothing in the shape of a trail had come to view during the last run  when the bronco stopped his racing the youth turned him around again he now showed signs of fatigue but dave urged him on digging his knees into the animals ribs as tightly as ever dave was almost used up himself but he resolved to make the bronco take him back to the corral or die in the attempt  they shant have the laugh on me he argued its back to the ranch or nothing  dave steered the best course he could for the corral but with nothing to guide him he did not know if he was moving exactly in the right direction or not he kept on with his eyes trying to look beyond the widestretching prairies  presently he saw in the distance what looked to be a row of low buildings he headed in that direction and then saw that the objects were moving towards him  they cant be buildings for buildings dont move like that he mused must be cattle or horses cattle most likely  to avoid the cattle he turned slightly southward but the animals kept coming closer and now he saw that they were running in something of a semicircle  can anything be wrong with them he asked himself and watched the approaching herd with interest the bronco too pricked up his ears and gave a sudden snort of alarm  then to daves ears came the thunder of the herds hoofs and he saw that the cattle were on a mad run he drew rein and stood up in his stirrups  the sight that met his gaze was truly alarming at least a thousand head of steers were coming toward him running swiftly and with their horns bent low  they have stampeded he gasped and they are coming straight this way what shall i do to escape them     chapter xxiv  the cattle stampede   dave had often heard of cattle stampedes and he knew how truly dangerous such a mad rush can become sometimes from practically no cause whatever a herd of cattle will start on a wild run going they know not where and carrying all down before them  what had started the present stampede did not interest the youth but he was interested in the question of how he might get out of the herds way so that he would not be run down and trodden to a jelly to scare the leaders off might be easy but would not those in the rear push on until he was simply overwhelmed  ive got to get away somehow he reasoned and turned his pony at right angles to the approaching cattle for the moment the bronco seemed too frightened to budge but at a cry from dave he leaped forward and then went streaking across the prairies as if he knew his life and that of his rider depended on his speed  it was now a race for life for the cattle were still moving in something of a semicircle and dave did not know whether or not he would be able to clear the end of the line before it reached him he called to the pony but this was unnecessary for the bronco evidently understood the peril fully as well as his rider  suddenly when it looked as if pony and youth could not escape dave heard a whistle float across the prairie looking in the direction he made out the form of sid todd riding like the wind toward him behind him came roger and phil but the two boys were soon stopped and told to go back  ill head em off yelled todd coming closer and waving his big sombrero in one hand he commenced to fire his pistol with the other he shot rapidly aiming for the ground and sending streaks of dust into the air all the time he yelled at the top of his lungs and understanding the move dave yelled too and swung one arm wildly  soon the leaders of the herd took notice and came to a sudden halt the rest of the cattle shoved from behind and then the leaders broke some going to the right and the others to the left  look out roger phil they are coming your way screamed dave  he was right and for the minute it looked as if dave had been saved at the expense of his chums but only a few cattle were headed for the other boys and as soon as roger and phil commenced to yell and wave their arms these broke again and thus the herd was completely scattered they ran a short distance further then halted and a little later began to graze as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened  are you all right son asked sid todd anxiously as he ranged up beside dave  yes butii am a little wiwinded answered dave when he could speak  good enough then you mastered the bronco eh didnt he throw you at all  no  didnt he roll  oh yes and i got off and on pretty quick i can tell you  its wonderful i never would have thought it and sid todds face showed his great admiration why dont you know that that is one of the wickedest ponies on this ranch yates and some of the others have tried to ride him more than once  and they couldnt do it  not much they couldnt why that pony bit one of the men in the arm when he got too near  he snapped at me once  did eh  yes and i slapped his face  well thats the best wayshow em you aint afraid but its wonderful when i see you on this pony i was sure youd be killed and i made up my mind to give yates the wust lickin he ever had  hes as mild as a lamb now went on dave as he eyed the pony  dont you go for to trustin him too much yet were sid todds words of warning and dave took them to heart and it was well he did so for while returning to the ranch the bronco tried several tricks to get rid of his rider but without success  i never thought you would do it said roger earnestly are you sure he is safe now he added anxiously  i wouldnt try to ride that beast for a million dollars was phils comment when he went off with you i thought youd never get back to tell the story roger and i and todd were so worried we rode after you just as fast as we could  i hope the girls dont hear of this said dave if they do theyll worry themselves sick every time we go out  oh weve got to let folks know how you busted that bronco cried sid todd why son you dont understand but its the finest bit o bustin ever done on this ranch he added vehemently  well i am glad i won out for one thing answered dave dryly you wont have to give yates that licking and this remark made the cowboy laugh in spite of himself nevertheless later on he gave yates a lecture that the latter never forgot  the boy had one chanct in a hundred o winning out was what he said one chanct in a hundred an you knew it if he had broken his neck id a held you responsible an so would the boss  but hes a great rider pleaded yates  sure he is better nor youll be if you live to be a hundred yates but it was wrong to pile such a thing up his backan dont you go for to do it again  the news soon spread that dave had busted the wild bronco and this coupled with the fact that he had aided in bringing down the bobcat gave him an enviable reputation among the cowboys but the girls were quite alarmed jessie and laura especially  oh dave how could you cried jessie when they were alone  well jessie you wouldnt want me to appear like a coward would you he asked  no of course not dave butif you had beenkilled  i was watching out i can tell you that he answered and then changed the subject for he did not like to see the girl he admired so distressed  after the excitement of the bronco riding the boys were glad enough to take it easy for several days belle had a tennis court and a croquet ground and they played each game for hours at a time the girls were all good players and won the majority of the games  tennis and croquet are all well enough when you have nice girls to play with remarked roger but otherwise i fancy id find them dead slow  hed play twentyfour hours at a stretch with laura was phils comment  not to mention how long youd play with belle retorted the senators son  dave doesnt care to play at all when jessie is around went on phil slyly  neither of em cares to playif theres a hammock and a chair handy added roger  i noticed yesterday when jessie and i were playing tennis you fellows were so busy talking to the girls you forgot all about your games retorted dave and one of you was spouting poetry about eyes divine or something like that  not me cried roger  then it must have been phil  no it was roger protested the shipowners son i saw him writing poetry when he should have been sending a letter home  you go on you manufacturer of bombastic fairy tales cried the senators son and he commenced to chase phil around the piazza the other boy leaped the rail and roger followed and then both commenced to wrestle on the grass  mercy me whats going on cried laura coming from the sittingroom  greatest exhibition on the globe called out dave in showman style the two marvelous lightweights of the united states master hitem morr and lamem lawrence they will fight to a finish without gloves weather permitting walk up tumble up or crawl up admission ten cents one dime young ladies with grandfathers in arms halfprice  oh dave cried his sister and burst out laughing the noise brought jessie and belle to the scene and seeing what was going on all of the girls commenced to pelt the boys on the grass with tennis balls the attack lasted for several minutes and then the girls ran away and the boys went after them into the house and out again and across the yard and then through the kitchen much to the astonishment of the chinese cook here phil scooped up a ladleful of soup  halt base enemy he cried holding the soup aloft one step closer and thou shalt be and then he slipped and the soup slopped over his hand and his shoes he ran for the yard again dropped on a bench in mock exhaustion and there the others joined him and the fun for the time being came to an end  we are going to the railroad station this afternoon with papa said belle want to go along  will a duck drink icecream soda cried roger of course we will go along  then you had better get ready nowfor we are to start directly after lunch  anything special at the station questioned dave  papa is going to see a man about some horses he wants to buy a few more good ones if he can  its a pity we cant find out what became of the others went on dave  it took the girls some time to prepare for the journey to the railroad station so the start from star ranch was not made until after two oclock mr endicott rode in advance and the young folks paired off in couples after him  when they got to the bridge dave was much surprised to see a couple of men at work repairing the structure they were putting down some planking that was bound to last a long while  mr merwell must have opened his heart at last said dave to the railroad president  not at all dave i am having this work done was mr endicotts reply  but i thought you said it was up to mr merwell to keep this bridge in repair  so it is but as he wont do anything rather than have a quarrel i am repairing it myself  do you think he wants to sell out maybe that is his reason for not spending money in repairs  he will sell out but his price is very hightoo high to suit the man who wants to buy  leaving the vicinity of the bridge the party continued on the way to the railroad station the train was not yet in but it soon arrived and on it came the man mr endicott wished to see from the train also stepped hank snogger the ranch hand had evidently been to a barber in the city for he was shaven and his hair was closely trimmed  he looks like quite a different person remarked belle he always wore his hair long and straggly before  yes and he wasnt any too clean answered dave now he is well washed and brushed  hank snogger walked around the station on an errand and then came up to where a horse was waiting for him as he did this he passed quite close to the boys and girls and gave the former a cold stare  do you know i feel sure i have seen somebody that looks like him said dave in a whisper i said so before but i cant place the man  yes ive seen somebody that looked like him too added roger it was while we were coming out here now let me think and he rubbed his chin reflectively  heres a letter about that boy we helped charley gamp said phil who had just received the mail  charley gamp cried dave thats itthats the same face this hank snogger looks exactly like charley gamp     chapter xxv  the beginning of the grand hunt   daves announcement produced a little sensation and for the moment his chums stared at him in astonishment  come to think of it that man does look like the little newsboy said roger slowly do you suppose they can be related  id hate to think that charley gamp was related to such a fellow said phil snogger isnt a nice sort to have anything to do with  mr endicott said he didnt use to be so bad answered dave it is only latelysince he went to work for mr merwellthat he has grown dissolute  maybe he is sorry that he left the endicott place said the senators son ill wager he has no such nice times at the triple x ranch as he had at the star  not if all the cowboys are like those who came to our entertainment said phil but dave if you think hes related to charley gamp why not speak to him about it  you may get into trouble if you do interposed roger hastily some of these western characters dont like to have their past raked up  but charley gamp wants to find his relatives went on the shipowners son  ill bring it aroundwhen i get the chance said dave but i cant do it now he added hes gone and dave was right hank snogger had leaped on his horse and was off on a trail that led up the river instead of across it  what are you boys confabbing about cried belle coming up with a box of candy in her hand  we were just wondering where wed get some candy answered dave innocently he did not think it wise to mention snogger just then  indeed well i bought this from the candy man of the train he is waiting for the down train  where is he questioned roger  down the trackby the water tower  well raid him cried the senators son and then he and dave and phil set off on a footrace in the direction of the man who sold candy cigars and magazines they found that he had a pretty fair stock of candy and magazines and each boy purchased what he thought would suit the others and himself in the fun and good spirits that followed hank snogger was for the time being forgotten  two days later there was a roundingup of some of the cattle and the boys were allowed to participate they went out with sid todd who had charge of the roundup and were in the saddle from early morning until late at night the cattle were gathered in a valley up the river sorted out from some belonging to mr merwell and mr hooper and then driven off to a stockyard along the railroad line  not so exciting as i thought it would be said dave after the roundup was over  ive had all the riding i want for one day answered the shipowners son  thats right grumbled roger they had had only a quarter of an hours rest for lunch i reckon some of us will be stiff in the morning and he was right all felt somewhat sore  the roundup had been a careful one for mr endicott had heard that mr merwell was finding fault over the way some of his cattle were being chased by the cowboys the following afternoon the merwellsfather and sonmet mr endicott as he and belle were riding along the trail talking over the familys plans for the coming winter  see here i want to speak about my cattle cried mr merwell wrathfully as he drew rein  some time when i am alone mr merwell answered the railroad president he quickly saw that his neighbor was spoiling for a fight  your men took three or four of my steers went on mr merwell i wont stand for it  that cant be so mr merwell my man todd is a careful rounder and he told me he was sure of the brands  he aint careful at all broke in link he drinks and he dont know what he is doing  this is an affair between your father and myself said mr endicott stiffly you will kindly keep out of it  huh i guess i can have my say growled link  i shall hold you responsible for every head of cattle of mine that is missing continued mr merwell with a dark look  i am willing to pay for every head that todd drove off that did not belong to us answered mr endicott but he assured me that he took only our own i will look into the matter when i get back to the ranch and bowing stiffly the railroad president rode on with belle beside him as they passed link made a face at belle but the young lady refused to notice him  as soon as he returned to the ranch mr endicott called up sid todd and then some of the other cowboys and questioned them closely about the cattle sent off the head herder indignantly denied that he had included any outside cattle and his story was corroborated by the others  i can leave it to bill parker mr hoopers man said todd he was there if merwell didnt want to take our word why didnt he send a man down we notified him that we was going to make a shipment  have the steers been shipped yet  nonot till tomorrow  then ride down to the yard and have harrison go over them and write out a declaration that they are all ours added the ranch owner  its a good deal of work grumbled the cowboy  i know it but ill pay harrison with a declaration from harrison mr merwell will have no claim  the ranch owners orders were carried out and the next day a duplicate of the stockyard mans declarationthat the cattle were all of the star ranch brandwas delivered to mr merwell  huh neednt tell me he sniffed after reading the paper i guess harrison is playing into endicotts hands  you tell harrison thatif you dare answered the messenger who had delivered the paper harrison was known to be a fair and square but hightempered individual and one who could shoot and shoot straight  oh ieri didnt meaneranything against harrison answered felix merwell hastily i think endicott is deceiving him thats all but it is not his fault iersuppose though ill have to let the matter drop just the same i think some of my cattle slipped into that drove and there the matter rested mr merwell knew he was in the wrong but he was too mean a man to acknowledge it truly father and son were equally despicable  i wish he would sell out said belle to the other girls but i am afraid he wonthell stay here just so he and link can worry us  maybe he wants you to sell out said jessie  well well not do it answered belle with spirit  on the following day the boys and girls went out on a picnic taking a generous lunch with them they persuaded mr and mrs endicott to go along with them and after they returned home the ranch owner and his wife said they felt ten years younger they had joined in all the games played helped to build a campfire and make coffee and cut up just as if they were young themselves  oh if only papa and mamma were here sighed jessie i must write them a long letter telling them all about it and the letter was penned the next morning on that day came a letter from dunston porter stating he would stop at star ranch for them ten days from date  only ten days more cried dave my how the time flies  there was also a letter from nat poole in which nat stated that he had been looking for the fellow who called himself tom shocker and had at last located the rascal in a town not far from buffalo he had accused the man of the robbery at the hotel and caused the fellow to give up the stickpin and also a pawnticket for the watch the timepiece had been recovered and both articles were now at the wadsworth home waiting for dave  well i am glad nat got the things back said dave  maybe that will be a lesson to him not to trust strangers in the future was phils comment but how about the money  nat says shocker spent that  then nat will have to make it good said roger  yes he says he will answered dave  what about that grand hunt we were to have questioned roger only ten days more remember  ill see todd about it at once was daves answer  the matter was talked over not only with the cowboy but with the others and it was finally decided that the boys and todd should leave the ranch home two days later for a hunt that was to last three and possibly four days they were to go on horseback and carry with them a small tent and a fair supply of provisions as well as two rifles and their shotguns and the cowboys pistol  well strike out straight for the mountains said todd to be sure we may find some game in the hills close by but in the mountains well be certain to run down something worth while  well you look out that something doesnt run you downa bear for instance said laura  boys that can kill a bobcat can kill a bear if they try answered sid todd  the boys were in great delight and spent every minute of their time in getting ready for the trip guns were cleaned and oiled and they sorted and packed their ammunition with care mr endicott had a compact camping outfit consisting of dishes and cooking utensils and the little tent and these were made into convenient packs for the horses and the provisions were likewise strapped up properly todd aided in all and the lads had to admire how deftly he put things together so that they might be carried with comparative ease  he has been there before that is plain to see said the senators son  a fine man declared dave heartily i shall feel perfectly safe with him along  the girls were sorry to see the boys go yet every one of them wished the lads the best of luck  please dont run into any danger pleaded jessie  dont shoot at a bear unless you know you can get away from him if you miss him cautioned laura  and above all dont get lost in the mountains was belles advice  it had looked like rain the night before and the boys were worried not wishing to depart in the wet but the sun came out full in the morning and their spirits at once arose roger could not contain himself and whistled merrily while phil did a double shuffle while waiting for breakfast dave was also happy although sorry that the girls and especially jessie would not be along  all ready cried todd half an hour later when the horses had been brought around to the piazza  i am cried dave  so am i came from phil and roger  then goodby everybody shouted the cowboy swinging his sombrero and off he galloped the boys said farewell the girls waved their handkerchiefs one of the hands fired off his pistol and away the lads went after todd and the grand hunt was begun  it was still early and delightfully cool with a faint breeze blowing from the distant mountains for which they were headed todd had already told them that they were to keep on steadily until exactly noon crossing the river and following a brook that came from the upper hills  i know a fine spot to stop for dinner he said and we can make it if youll keep up with me he always took his dinner at noon having no use for lunch at any time  on and on over the smooth plains the party galloped and by the middle of the forenoon reached the river  no use in stopping for a mess of fish i suppose said the senators son wistfully  you can catch em up in the hills just as well answered the cowboy sweeter too maybe he added many fishermen think that the higher up a stream you go for fish the sweeter they are to the taste  the cowboy had certainly set a smart pace but none of the boys grumbled for they were as anxious as he to reach the mountains and look for game  of course you can keep your eyes open around here he said as they galloped along but you wont see much im afraid  i see some grouse cried the shipowners son a few minutes later we might bring some of those down and cook them for supper we wont want to wait to do it for dinner  he pointed to some grouse far away and all agreed that the fowls would make good eating they rode behind some bushes tied their horses and went forward with caution all fired together and when the smoke cleared away they saw that four of the game had been laid low the rest had flown away and to follow them would have been useless  well four are all right cried roger and was about to rush forward to pick up the grouse when of a sudden dave yelled to him to stop  whats the matter asked the senators son  a snake screamed phil and as he spoke all in the party saw what dave had first discovered a rattlesnake had appeared from a hole in a tree close to where the dead grouse lay     chapter xxvi  after deer   a rattlesnake  take care that he doesnt bite you  my what a big fellow  he is heading this way  such were some of the cries uttered by the young hunters and sid todd as all beheld a largesized snake crawling from a hole under the tree that it was a rattler there was no doubt  all leaped back for the sight momentarily stunned them but then dave recovered his presence of mind and blazed away with his shotgun hitting the reptile in the middle and inflicting several ugly but not mortal wounds the rattlesnake gave a hiss glided under some leafy bushes and there commenced to sound his rattles  hes going to strike cried phil and as he spoke the shotgun in sid todds hands was discharged he fired among the leaves and whether or not he hit the snake nobody could tell  dont go near him called out roger he hated snakes about as much as he hated anything  all waited and while doing so dave and todd took the opportunity to reload they were just finishing when phil chancing to look behind them uttered a yell that would have done credit to an apache indian  look out one of em is behind us  the others all took his word for it and leaped to one side true enough a second rattlesnake had appeared and now a third was coming to light from under a rock near by  its a den of rattlers screamed sid todd run for it boys no use of trying to kill em off they are too many for us  the boys were already running at top speed and the cowboy joined them in order to gain the horses they had to move in a semicircle when they reached the animals they found the steeds exceedingly nervous and inclined to bolt  reckon they smell the snakes was todds comment a hoss aint got no use for rattlersand i aint nuther he added and rode away with the boys beside him  what about the grouse asked phil mournfully  do you want to go back after them questioned dave with a grim smile  not for a thousand dollars  then i guess well have to let the snakes have them went on dave let us be thankful that we werent bitten  rattlesnakes is the one drawback to this country said the cowboy when they were a safe distance from the reptiles i dont mind wild beasts but i do draw the line on snakes but there aint near so many as there used to be an some day there wont be any at all  after this i am going to beware of holes that look snaky was rogers comment i think if a rattlesnake got close to me id be paralyzed with fright  as they went on they kept their eyes open for more game and just before resting for dinner dave saw some grouse high up in a tree in a hollow with caution they advanced this time on horseback and all fired together as before out of the tree fluttered seven grouse for they had been close together and the shot had created great havoc all but one were dead and the seventh was quickly dispatched by todd  well have some good eating tonight after all said roger with a grin he liked fowl of all kinds  the stop for dinner was made beside a mountain spring where the water was icy cold and as clear as crystal they took their time eating thus allowing the horses a chance to rest and to crop the nearby grass  we have covered about twenty miles said the cowboy in reply to a question from phil  then if we do as well this afternoon well be forty miles from the ranch by the time we camp tonight  well not make over ten or twelve miles this afternoon lad was the answer it will be hard climbing up the hills  but harder climbing tomorrow put in dave  yes tomorrow will test the horses and test you too said todd  it was very pleasant to rest in the shade after such a long ride in the sun but the cowboy was anxious to reach a certain camping spot for the night and so he allowed only threequarters of an hour for the midday halt  as soon as they left the spring the youths realized what was before them the trail now led constantly upward and was in parts stony and uncertain in several places they had to leap brooks of fair size  this isnt so nice remarked phil as they came to a halt to allow the horses to rest after a particularly difficult hill had been climbed  oh this is nothing to the traveling well do tomorrow answered sid todd we are only in the foothills nowtomorrow well be right in the mountains  about four oclock they gained the top of another hill as they came out in a cleared spot all gazed around with interest  look cried dave pointing with his hand am i mistaken or are those deer  he was pointing to the top of another hill about half a mile distant there outlined against the sky could be seen a number of animals grazing  deer my boy cried sid todd a fine lot of em too or im mistaken  oh let us go after them exclaimed roger impulsively  im willing answered the cowboy but i dont know if you can get any of em tonight it will be a hard climb to where they are i dont know as we can go all the way on hosses  then well go on foot cried dave he was as anxious as his chums to get a shot at the big game  the cowboy studied the situation for several minutes meanwhile withdrawing himself and the others to a spot where the distant deer might not see them then he led the party down the hill and in the direction of the game  if traveling had been hard before it was doubly so now and the chums realized that to get to where the deer were grazing would be no easy matter they had to slip and slide over the rocks and once or twice they reached places where further progress seemed impossible  if we get any of those deer well earn them panted phil as he half climbed half slid over some rocks if my horse goes down i dont know what will happen to me he added  well not go much further on hossback im thinking answered todd we cant afford to injure our animals  between the hills was a small valley and here the cowboy said they had better tether their steeds and leave them  even if we dont get back theyll likely be safe till morning he added  if we have to remain away all night we had better take some eating with us said phil  we sure will answered todd and he gave each of the party something to carry on his back and in his gamebag  now for a climb that is a climb cried dave roger this puts me in mind of some climbing i did in norway  were you in norway questioned sid todd curiously  oh yes i once went there to find my father answered dave  before them was a steep incline covered with stones and a stunted growth of cedars up this they went with care for some of the stones were loose and afforded only an uncertain footing once phil slipped and commenced to roll he bumped against dave and both went flat  grab a tree sang out roger but there was no need to offer this advance for dave had already done so he saved himself and phil from rolling further but a fryingpan the shipowners son carried broke loose from the pack on his back and went clattering down the rocks to the very foot of the hill  for the love of flapjacks stop that noise cried sid todd in a low voice time you get to the top of the hill them deer will be ten miles away  ii couldnt help it answered phil as he arose and gazed sorrowfully after the fryingpan shall i go back after it he asked  where is it  i see itsticking in the fork of a cedar tree answered roger and pointed out the pan  let it alonewe can get it when we come back said the cowboy now dont make any more noise or you wont get no chanct at them deer mark my words  all of the boys understood the importance of keeping quiet and as they neared the top of the hill where the deer had been discovered they moved with great caution and spoke only in whispers  the wind is blowing toward us and thats in our favor said sid todd  i know it answered dave deer can scent a fellow a long way off if the wind is towards them  the cowboy now took the lead and told the lads not to make a sound that was unnecessary thus they covered another hundred yards here was a ridge of rocks and beyond the top of the hill  they are gone murmured roger as his eyes discovered that the top of the hill was abandoned  ill crawl forward and take a look said todd keep quiet now or we wont git nuthin  the cowboy disappeared over the top of the hill crawling forward on his hands and knees he was gone fully ten minutesa time that to the boys just then seemed like an age they looked to their weapons to see that the firearms were ready for use  presently dave who was on the watch saw todd arise in a clump of bushes on the other side of the hilltop he was beckoning for the boys to advance one hand he held over his mouth to enjoin silence  with their hearts beating more rapidly than usual the three young hunters wormed their way over the top of the hill and joined the cowboy in silence todd pointed to a distance below them there on a sort of cliff on the hillside were the deer ten in number grazing peacefully  oh what a shot whispered dave and his eyes brightened as he swung his gun into position  wait said todd in a whisper ill take the one on the right you take the one on the left  ill take the one close to the tree whispered the senators son  and ill take the one by the big rock added phil  all right agreed the cowboy now remember if some are only wounded shoot at em again any one of you and be quick for theyll streak it like greased lightning as soon as the guns go off  all took aim with care resting their gunbarrels on the bushes before them then the cowboy gave the order to fire  as if by instinct the deer looked up just as the order to fire was given they were fairly close to hand and afforded good targets for the hunters the firearms rang out almost simultaneously and two of the deer leaped into the air to fall back dead the others started to run some jumping from the top of the cliff to the rocks far below again the weapons were discharged and this time a third deer fell the fourth was badly wounded and toppled down in a split of the cliff  hurrah weve got em weve got em cried phil and commenced to leap about in pure joy  weve got emto get answered sid todd but you did wellall of you he added admiringly  how are we to get down to the cliff questioned roger anxiously  the deer got downwe had better follow their trail answered dave  they made an examination and presently found a run leading to one end of the cliff the walking was dangerous and they had to be careful for fear of going further than intended but inside of a quarter of an hour all were standing where the deer had stood they found three of the game dead and quickly put the fourth out of its misery  this is worth coming for declared dave with pride  it is indeedeven if we dont get anything else added phil  but we are going to get more cried roger the fever of the hunter taking possession of him just wait till we strike an elk or a bear  no more hunting this day sang out todd time we take care of these animals and make a camp it will be dark     chapter xxvii  the mountain lion   what are we to do with so much venison questioned the senators son we cant eat it and it seems a shame to allow it to go to waste  i wish we could send some to the ranch said dave id like the girls to know how lucky we have been the first day out  if you wanted to stay here and camp for a day i could take some of the game to the ranch said sid todd  but it is such a ride argued phil we dont want to impose on good nature  i wont mind the ride but can you boys take care of yourselves while i am gone  to be sure we can answered dave  then ill take three of the deer with me and come back as soon as i can one deer will be all you will need answered sid todd  to get the deer from the cliff they had to use a long lariat the cowboy had brought with him by this means the game was hoisted to the hilltop then they toted their loads down to where they had left their horses  ill take two of the hosses if you dont mind said the cowboy and it was agreed that he should take daves animal along with his own he decided to start for the ranch that night stating he would camp at the spot where they had had dinner  the boys found a locality that pleased them and there erected the tent and started a campfire the fryingpan had been recovered from where it had landed and restored to the outfit before leaving them todd showed the boys how to skin the deer and cut up the meat  for a little while after they were left alone the chums felt somewhat lonely they piled the wood on the fire thereby creating a lively blaze and fixed themselves a substantial meal of venison steak flapjacks and coffee and took their time over the repast by the time they had finished night had fallen over the hills and mountains and one by one the stars showed themselves in the heavens  this certainly is lonesomehurst was the comment of the shipowners son as he gazed around the camp when you really get to think of it it gives one the shivers  then dont think about it answered dave let us be cheerful and tell ghost stories i know a dandy storyabout four travelers who were murdered in some lonely mountains by brigands and  you shut up cried roger dont you want a fellow to sleep tonight  but i thought you wanted me to tell a story went on dave innocently  i dont want to listen to such a story as that  nor do i added phil lets talk about schooldays and the last game of football or baseball or something like that  if only the other fellows were here murmured dave shadow hamilton and buster beggs and polly vane and luke watson and  luke could give us a tune on his banjo put in the senators son  yes and shadow would tell funny stories not ghost stories added phil  well have a story or two to tell when we get back to oak hall continued dave i wish we could have had one of the deer stuffed for the museum  too late now but maybe well get another answered phil  all of the boys were tired yet it was nearly ten oclock before any of them felt like turning in as the night wore on the place seemed to become more lonely  might as well go to bed said dave at last we need a good rest  anybody going to stay on guard asked the senators son  do you think it necessary roger  i dont know  what do you say phil  i am too sleepy now to remain on guard answered phil you can do so if you wish  oh what cheek murmured roger all right well all turn in and chance it  lets fix the fire first said dave a blaze usually helps to keep away wild beasts  oh if any come i reckon the horses will give us warning said phil we can tie them close by and this plan was carried out  some cedar boughs had been strewn on the floor of the tent and on these the chums laid down and did their best to go to sleep dave dropped off first and was presently followed by roger but phil was restless and turned from one side to the other  oh pshaw why cant i sleep murmured the shipowners son to himself in disgust and then out of curiosity he looked at his watch by the glare from the campfire he saw that it was nearly one oclock  he was just straightening out again when a peculiar rustling among the horses caught his ears he listened for a moment then sat up straight  something doesnt suit them he reasoned wonder what it can be  he hesitated then turned over on his hands and knees and crawled to the opening of the tent and peered around outside the campfire had burned rather low so that objects a short distance away were indistinct he saw that the horses were huddled together and had their heads turned toward a clump of bushes at one side of the shelter  something must be over yonder reasoned the youth wonder if i had better arouse the others  he looked at dave and roger both were sleeping so peacefully phil hated to disturb them he reached for his gun and looked out again  there was a brushing aside of the clump of bushes and a pair of eyes glared forth glistening brightly in the firelight the eyes were those of some wild beast but what phil could not tell  the animal was not looking at phil but at the carcass of the deer which had been hung up in a low tree not far from the clump of bushes stealthily the animal came into the opening and with the ease of a cat leaped into the tree  its a wildcator something like it thought phil and raised his gun to fire then of a sudden he commenced to shake from head to foot so that to aim was entirely out of the question he had what is commonly called among hunters buck fever a sudden fear that often overtakes amateur hunters when trying to shoot at big game  oh what a fool i am the boy told himself and tried vainly to steady his nerves he hit the front tent pole with his foot making considerable noise  whats the matter cried dave waking and leaping to his feet what are you doing phil  nothnothing stammered the shipowners son iithere is something in the tree and then raising his gun phil banged away blindly  the echo of the shot was followed by an unearthly scream from the tree and phil and dave saw the wild animal slip down from a branch and then try to regain its footing then dave caught up one of the rifles and blazed away and the beast dropped to the ground where it twisted and snarled and yelped in a fashion that served to drive the horses frantic  whats going on cried roger sitting up and rubbing his eyes who is shooting and he got up and felt around in a haphazard manner for a gun  wild animal outsidei dont know what it is answered dave  roger joined the others and blazed away at the beast and more snapping and snarling followed the animal rolled clear over the fire scattering the burning brands in all directions then it rolled among the horses one steed after another kicked at it and a flying hoof sent it against the tree with a thud then it lay quiet  must be dead said dave after a pause  dont go near it screamed phil  i wontnot yet answered dave well fix up the fire first and he kicked the dying embers together and put more wood on the blaze while he did this phil and roger watched the huddledup form at the foot of the tree the horses still snorted and did their best to get away  i guess it is dead after all said phil after he had poked the beast with a stick wonder what it can be  looks a little like a big wildcat said roger  i know what it is answered dave after all were certain the beast was dead and they had dragged it over to the fire its a cougar or mountain lionone of the worst wild beasts to be found in the west  then its no wonder i got scared when first i saw it said phil my what a powerful animal and it must weigh fifty or sixty pounds  all of that phil  is this the beast some call a panther or painter asked roger  yes roger i was reading about them in a natural history and the cougar mountain lion puma panther and painter are all the same beast years ago they were common all over the united states but now they are to be found only in the far west and in the south i think we can count it a big feather in our cap that we killed a cougar  do you think he was going to attack us asked the senators son with a shiver  he was after the deer but there is no telling what he might have done i am glad he is dead phil it was lucky you heard the beast  talk about excitement cried the shipowners son i rather think we are getting it rattlesnakes deer and a panther all in one day and night  that is certainly piling it on some admitted dave but tomorrow may pass without a thing doing  more than likely returned roger things always happen in bunches you know  the boys examined the cougar with interest it was about four and a half feet in length and not unlike a young lion in appearance it had been hit in the face and in the forelegs and had died hard evidently it had hoped to carry off the slain deer while the young hunters slept  a cougar has been known to carry off a little child said dave they are very crafty as well as brave and will attack both a horse and a man i think we can count ourselves lucky to come out of this fight without a scratch  no more sleeping for me without a guard said roger let us take turns at staying up and looking after the fire and the horses and to this the others readily agreed  morning found them still tired out and willing enough to rest they got a late breakfast and tethered the horses in a new spot and cut sufficient firewood to last for twentyfour hours nobody thought of doing anything until after lunch and then roger suggested they try their hand at fishing in a mountain brook which ran down between the two hills  all right answered dave but do you think we ought to leave the camp all alone  oh i dont think anybody will hurt it in the daylight answered the senators son  they had to tramp about a quarter of a mile to reach the stream and then an equal distance to gain a spot that looked suited to their purpose phil was the first to throw in and was rewarded almost immediately by a bite  this looks as if it was worth while said dave and baited up fish were there in plenty and for an hour the boys amused themselves to their hearts content by that time each had a string of fifteen to twenty mountain brook trout of fair size  well have a dandy fish supper cried roger smacking his lips  it will be a change from the venison and ill be glad of it returned dave  i am going to try my luck for a short while up the stream called out phil who was some distance away from the others  dont go too far said dave i am going to rest here and he threw himself on the grass and roger followed his example  the two boys left behind rested for the best part of half an hour then thinking it was time for phil to rejoin them they called their chums name  no answer came back and walking up the stream a short distance dave repeated the call still there was no reply  thats queer he told roger i wonder why he doesnt reply  i am sure i dont know said the senators son let us look for him and both started after phil wondering what could be wrong     chapter xxviii  up to the mountain top   dave and roger walked up the stream a distance of several hundred yards they continued to call phils name but as before no answer came back  i must confess roger i dont like the looks of things said dave gravely if phil was all right hed surely answer us  i think so myself daveunless he was only fooling us  i dont think hed do that under the circumstances hed know we would be greatly worried  on walked the two chums until they reached a point where the mountain stream came tumbling over some great rocks here they found phils fishing rod and also the string of fish he had caught  gracious dave supposing some wild animal has carried him off ejaculated the senators son  dave did not reply for he knew not what to say he advanced to the top of the rocks and peered over on the other side  there he is he shouted phil phil are you hurt he called  only a faint moan came back and scrambling up the rocks beside dave roger saw the trouble phil had slipped from the rocks into the mountain torrent in going down his legs had caught in an opening below and there he was held in water up to his knees while the water from some rocks above was pouring in a steady stream over his left shoulder  cant you get up phil asked dave  helhelp was the only answer delivered in such a low tone that the boys on the rocks could scarcely hear it  he cant aid himself that is sure murmured dave roger we have got to get him out of thatbefore that water pouring over his shoulder carries him down  both boys looked around anxiously phil was all of fifteen feet below them and there seemed to be no way of reaching the locality short of jumping and neither wanted to risk doing that  if we only had a rope said roger  we might double up a fishing line mused dave then his face brightened i have itthe pole  he ran back and speedily brought up phils pole and around it he wound the line to strengthen it and hold the joints together then he leaned down  phil can you take hold he questioned  the youth below raised his hands feebly but his strength was apparently gone and he could do little to save himself  hold the pole dave ill go down cried roger but dont let me slip  while dave braced himself on the rocks as best he could and gripped the pole and line the senators son went over the rocks and down hand over hand this was easy and in a minute he stood beside phil in the water the torrent from above poured over his back but to this he paid no attention he saw that phil was on the point of fainting and if he sank down he would surely be drowned  letting go his hold on the fishing pole roger felt down in the water and then discovered that phils feet were crossed and held by a rock that was balanced on another rock in coming down phils weight had caused the space between the two rocks to widen then the opening had partly closed holding the feet as if in the jaws of some big animal  it was no easy matter for roger to shift the upper rock and once he slipped and went flat on his back in the water with a loud splash  be careful warned dave from above maybe i had better come down and help you he added  no iim all riright spluttered the senators son freeing his mouth of water  at last one of the rocks was moved and phil staggered forward in the water but he was too weak to help himself and had to lean on roger  you cant pull us up shouted the senators son well wade down the stream a bit  supporting the shipowners son roger commenced to move down the mountain torrent he had to pick his way with care for the bottom was rocky and treacherous dave followed along the rocks above until a spot was gained where he could leap down then he and the senators son picked up phil between them and carried him out and up to a patch of grass where they set the sufferer down in the sunlight  well take off his shoes and see how his feet and ankles look said dave and this was done they found the feet and ankles slightly swollen and discolored but not seriously injured  phil supposing roger and i carry you back to camp suggested dave we can make an armchair and do it easily enough  if it isnt too much trouble id be glad to have you do it answered the boy who had slipped over the rocks i cant walk yet  the chums had often carried each other armchair fashion while at school and soon dave and roger started off with phil between them and carrying the fishing pole and fish on the way they rested several times and also gathered up their own outfits and catches  arriving at the camp the fire was stirred up and the lads hung up the most of their clothing to dry while they took a good rubbingdown phils feet and ankles were bathed in hot water and then soaked in some liniment mrs endicott had made them bring along in case of accident the injured lad was content to rest on a bed of cedar boughs but declared that he would be as well as ever in the morning  but i am mighty glad you came when you did he said with deep feeling i could not have held up much longerwith that stream of water rushing down over my shoulder i yelled and yelled until i couldnt yell any longer  that must have been before we started to look for you returned dave after this you want to be careful how you climb around some of the rocks are loose and very treacherous  dave and roger prepared a fine supper of broiled fish and to this meal even phil did full justice as there was nothing else to do the boys took their time eating they had almost finished when they heard a shout from a distance  whats that cried roger and instinctively he leaped up and moved for his gun  its todd answered dave hello todd he yelled this way  the others joined in the cry which was answered from a distance and presently the cowboy appeared on his horse and leading daves animal  i reckon im just in time for a fish supper he cried with a broad smile on his face well im hungry enough with such a stiff ride whats the matter with your feet he questioned gazing at phils bandages  the boys told the story of the trouble up the stream and then related how they had shot the cougar and exhibited the body of the slain beast in the meantime they broiled some more fish and made an extra pot of coffee and some flapjacks for the newcomer  well well well cried sid todd after a look at the dead cougar i reckon you youngsters know how to take care of yourselves a mountain lion why dont you know most o the cowboys would run a mile if they see that beast alookin at em such shootin is great  well we dont want to meet any more of them answered dave  no the rest of them can keep their distance added phil  did you get the deer home all right questioned roger  oh yes and the folks were a good deal surprised and pleased the girls are going to have one of the deer stuffed and mounted for the wadsworth home they said it would please mr wadsworth and professorlet me seei reckon its professor pans  no professor potts said dave  well i knew it had something to do with cookinthings answered the cowboy mr endicott told me to be careful and tell you not to shoot everything there was in the mountains as he wanted to come out later for a shot or two  i guess there will be enough left after we get through said dave with a smile  the cowboy had had a hard ride and he was willing enough to eat his supper in peace then he smoked a pipe of tobacco and turned in he said the boys could keep a guard if they wished but he scarcely deemed it necessary  wont another mountain lion or anything else come around in a year said he that jest happened that way thats all and after some talk among themselves the chums concluded to turn in all hands and let the camp and the horses take care of themselves  the night passed quietly and all slept until the sun was well up in the heavens then while the boys prepared breakfast and phil attended to his bruised feetwhich felt much bettersid todd told of some happenings at the ranch  the girls went out for a horseback ride along with mrs endicott said he and coming back they met link merwell they said he acted so disagreeable that they were afraid of him mrs endicott was very angry and i think the boss will speak to mr merwell about it  link ought to be hammered good and hard cried roger  the boss wishes the merwells would sell out but mr merwell doesnt seem to want to budge the girls were so afraid of link they said they wouldnt go out again unless mr endicott was along continued the cowboy  if he molests the girls hell have another account to settle with me cried dave  and me came promptly from his chums  he wanted to know where you fellows were and said he was going out hunting himself  he neednt come near us cried the senators son we dont want him  oh he wont come near usunless to make trouble you may be sure of that answered dave  the cowboy had left word at star ranch that the young hunters might remain out longer than originally intended so the chums did not worry about getting back all rested during the morning and after dinner started on the trail up into the mountains  how is it phil asked dave on the way  oh i can ride very well was the reply but i am rather glad i havent much walking to do but i think ill be ok by tomorrow  sid todd had been right about the climbing to be done during the last stage of the journey and often the boys as they looked ahead at the rocks before them wondered how they were going to make progress but the cowboy knew the trail and up they went the scenery every moment growing wilder and more impressive  this is an ideal spot for wild animals said dave i should think hunting would be very good  once they stopped to let the horses rest they were out on a cliff and at a distance sid todd pointed out two nests perched up on the top of rocky crags the nests were several feet in diameter  what are they questioned dave  eagles nests was the answer there are two of the eagles now and the cowboy pointed out the big birds floating lazily around between two distant mountain tops  a fellow would have difficulty in getting to those nests was phils comment  eagles usually build where nobody can git at em returned todd  i shouldnt care to shoot an eagle said dave somehow id feel a good deal as if i had shot at our flag  i think id feel that way too answered the senators son  the eagle and old glory seem to be linked together added phil but i wouldnt mind catching a young eagle and taming him  youd have your hands full doing it said sid todd i know a cowboy who once caught an eagle but the bird scratched him terribly and nearly took off one of his ears  on they went again until an hour later they gained the top of the mountain here they found a stiff breeze blowing and it was much cooler than below  i see some game cried dave and pointed to a slope on the other side of the mountain two deer were in view  scarcely had dave spoken when a shot rang out and one of the deer jumped as if hit the other ran off and disappeared in the bushes then slowly and painfully the second deer limped away a second shot rent the air but the wounded animal was not touched and a second later it followed its mate to cover     chapter xxix  two elk and a bear   i guess that hunter whoever he is will lose that deer was daves comment  he wont if he knows how to follow the game up answered sid todd that deer was badly wounded and game cant run far over these rough rocks  wonder who it was mused phil  cant tell thatso many folks come out here to hunt answered the cowboy it might be some ranchman or cowboy and it might be some city sportsman trying his luck  we may fall in with him later said dave if we do i hope he proves a nice sort  folks out here usually hunt on their own hook said todd  the cowboy had in mind to pass to the north of the mountain top and this they did soon leaving behind the locality where the two deer had been seen they saw nothing of the party who had fired the two shots  i hope he doesnt take us for game and shoot this way said roger who had heard of just such accidents more than once  well we dont want to mistake him for game either said dave whenever you shoot be sure of what you are shooting at  right you are cried sid todd if hunters werent too hasty there wouldnt be any accidents  a little over half a mile was covered and by that time the sun was sinking over the hills to the westward a suitable spot was selected and the tent was pitched and they prepared a supper of fish and venison meat and crackers washing it down with some chocolate that roger made  early in the morning sid todd left the camp to be gone the best part of two hours he came back showing his excitement  a chance for elk boys he cried but you must hurry and do a good bit of tramping  can you walk phil asked dave anxiously  just as well as ever was the answer and phil took a turn around the camp to prove his words  no time was lost in preparing for the hunt and in less than ten minutes all were off having tethered the horses in a spot they deemed safe their provisions they tied in skins and hung in the trees so they might be safe from wild marauders  it was a hard climb over the rocks and among the bushes and once the boys had to call a halt to catch their breath but todd was afraid the elk would take themselves off so he urged them on as much as possible  there were two elk big fellows too he said if we dont bag at least one of em we may not get another such chance all the time we are out here  presently they came to something of a hollow on the mountain side here was a fine spring of sparkling water and all stopped long enough to get a refreshing drink it was hot in the sun and all were beginning to perspire freely  if we get those elk well earn em was rogers comment  right you are panted phil  how much further have we to go questioned dave  not over a quarter of a mile answered the cowboy he was still in the lead and he had his eyes on the alert for the first glimpse at the big game  the boys were pretty well winded when sid todd called a halt they had reached a clump of cedar trees and beyond was an open spot among a number of loose rocks with patches of rich mountain grass between  gone said the cowboy with a deep sigh  gone echoed the three boys in dismay  yes gone they were right out yonder grazing as peacefully as could be now i dont see em anywhere continued the cowboy mournfully  its too bad murmured dave maybe you would have done better if you had fired on them  i wanted you lads to have a chance  perhaps they are still in this vicinity suggested roger let us take a look around  the others were willing and slowly and cautiously they made their way among the cedars and the big rocks exposing themselves as little as possible and speaking only in a whisper they had the rifles and shotguns ready for action  half an hours search took them to another dent in the mountain side here the grass was extra thick and inviting and a spring of water flowed quietly over the rocks  thats an ideal spot for a camp said phil to dave as they halted to view the scene  dave did not answer for he had seen something moving in the bushes close to the water he pointed in silence and all gazed in the direction slowly a magnificent pair of antlers arose behind the bushes  one of the elk whispered sid todd  and there is the other came from roger and pointed to a rock twenty yards beyond the bushes  now boys be careful directed the cowboy this is the chance of your lives divide up the game to suit yourselves i wont shoot unless i see the elk getting away from you  the chums consulted among themselves and roger and phil decided to aim at the elk nearest to them  then ill aim at the elk near the rock said dave i think ive got the best rifle anyway he added  all crawled forward followed by todd and thus covered half the distance toward the game the nearest elk was now less than a hundred yards away  they see us cried phil and hastily raised his firearm and the others did the same then as the elk bounded away all three of the young hunters fired  both the animals were hit but neither mortally and as soon as possible the boys fired a second time the elk were now together and a bullet and some shot meant for one hit the other one of the animals staggered and fell got up and staggered again coming down on the rocks with a loud thud  youve got this one cried sid todd in triumph go after the other  the boys were not loath to do this and away they went pellmell over the grass and around the rocks and bushes the second elk was limping along occasionally holding his left hind leg in the air he did not seem to be going fast but he dodged in and out among the rocks so quickly that to get another shot at him seemed impossible  if we can only get him into the open well have him cried dave  the trail now led down the mountain side and then into a thicket of cedars as they entered the thicket dave gave a yell  look out  he leaped to one side and the other lads did the same a second later the wounded elk rushed almost on them his antlers lowered as if to crush all in his path the boys fired as quickly as they could and hit in the side the animal swerved and dashed off at a right angle to the course he had been pursuing  phew but that was a narrow escape gasped phil  its different when the game hunts you isnt it queried the senators son  we must keep our eyes open and our guns ready said dave come ahead that elk must be pretty hard hit by this time  again they went on they could hear the big game crashing among the cedars evidently the elk was in such pain he did not know where to go  i see him cried dave five minutes later and pointed to a rocky elevation ahead at the foot of the rocks stood the elk glaring in rage at them all of the young hunters elevated their firearms and as they did this the big game charged them full tilt  crack bang crack went the weapons and the elk was halted in his course he tried to come on but in vain and slowly swayed from side to side then he tried to retreat but it was too late with a snort he went over kicking up big clods of grass as he did so then he gave a shiver and breathed his last  weve got him weve got him cried roger exultantly and began to caper about in his joy just think of it dave two elk isnt that something to be proud of  i think so answered dave his face beaming  i suppose the other elk is dead said phil but wed better go back and make sure  we dont want to leave this here said roger wistfully that other hunter might come along and claim him  ill go back to where we left todd and you can watch this elk said dave ill ask todd what we had best do with both animals  can you find the way questioned phil  i think so  reloading his rifle dave set off for the spot where they had left the cowboy and the first elk for a few minutes he followed the back trail with ease then almost before he was aware he became mixed up and scarcely knew in what direction to turn  i suppose i might call out or fire my rifle he mused but if i do that the others may think i am in trouble  looking around carefully dave set off once more and presently reached a spot that looked familiar on the ground he could see footprints and these he commenced to follow but in a few minutes he found himself in a thicket he was sure he had never seen before  i am mixed up and no mistake he murmured his face falling i shouldnt have been so sure of myself at the start it isnt so easy as one thinks to find a trail among these rocks and bushes i guess i had better call to todd and to the others  he set up a shout and waited for a reply none came and he shouted a second time then from a distance came a call  well i didnt think todd was in that direction he said to himself i am twisted and no mistake  again he started off and this time found himself skirting a series of loose rocks of various sizes he was going down hill and occasionally loosened a round stone with his foot and sent it crashing to a thicket of cedars below  a hundred yards were covered when dave heard the cry again now it was plainer and it sounded a little like a call for help  maybe todd is in trouble he mused perhaps that elk got up and attacked him and with this thought in his mind he set off on a dogtrot in the direction of the voice he had heard  it was dangerous among the loose stones and once dave went down and rolled over and over coming pretty close to hitting his face and shooting off his rifle as he picked himself up he heard a call quite plainly  help help somebody help me  it must be todd burst from the youths lips and now in spite of the danger he bounded from rock to rock down the slope the call came from the left and thither he made his way halting in dismay as he came out on a little cliff  at the foot of the cliff he saw the man who had uttered the call for aid it was hank snogger he was having a fierce facetoface tussle with a big bear his gun was on the ground and so was his sombrero and in his hand he held his hunting knife as dave viewed the scene in horror the bear made a pass with one forepaw and sent the hunting knife whirling from the cowboys grasp then the bear closed in as if to hug snogger to death     chapter xxx  to the rescueconclusion   it was a time for quick action and nobody realized this more than did dave as he saw the shaggy brute close in on the cowboy one squeeze of those powerful forepaws and hank snoggers ribs would be crushed in and he would be killed  with hardly a second thought concerning what he was doing dave raised his rifle took quick aim and fired at the bear then he fired a second shot and followed this up with a third  at the first shot the bear dropped his hold and swung around uttering a loud snort of pain as he did so he had been struck in the back for the youth had not dared to aim too close to snogger then thinking that he had been hurt by the man before him the animal made a leap and sent the cowboy sprawling as he stood over his victim the second shot hit him in the hind quarters causing him to whirl around then the third shot landed in his side and made him double up like a ball and roll over and over  illustration dave seized a fairsized stone and hurled it at the bear page 293  kill him kill him came faintly from hank snogger dont let him git at me agin  dave tried to fire another shot but for some reason then unknown the rifle refused to work the bear was rolling over and over and threatened each instant to roll on the cowboy and crush him snogger was so weak he was unable to save himself or do anything in his own defense  dave glanced around and his eye fell on the loose stones some of which had caused him a fall he dropped his rifle seized a fairsized stone and hurled it at the bear the youths aim was good and the missile landed on bruins head all but stunning him  thats it gigive him anoanother gasped hank snogger he had raised himself up on one elbow and was looking at dave pleadingly he was too weak to get to his feet for his fight with the bear had lasted for some time before dave had put in an appearance  the boy from crumville was not slow to pick up and throw another stone and this took the bear in the side causing him to grunt and snort in pain and rage then dave got a stone of extra size and aimed again for the animals head the missile went true and with his skull crushed bruin stretched out and lay still  is heis he dead gasped hank snogger hoarsely  i think so answered dave he was trembling from the excitement and his breath came thick and fast  ii thought ii was done for added the cowboy and sank flat on his back and closed his eyes  not without difficulty dave got down to where the man lay he found the bear stone dead and that the cowboy had fainted he procured some water from a nearby brook and washed snoggers face and soon revived the man then came a shout from a distance and sid todd showed himself having been attracted to the spot by the rifle shots  the situation was explained and dave came in for a good deal of praise over the killing of the bear  you saved my life said hank snogger i shant forget it never and he gave the youth a grateful look i fired on the bear but only hurt him enough to make him ugly i fell right over him while i was after a deer i had wounded some time before  oh then you were the hunter we heard shoot said todd the deer got away eh  yes i lost track of the deer when i hit the bear answered the cowboy from the merwell ranch im mighty glad you came up he added to dave  its all right i am glad i did too answered the youth i was wishing id get a chance at a bear he saw that snogger was deeply affected and was swallowing a lump that came up in his throat  and to think it was you boy went on the cowboy feelingly youand after what i did to you  let us forget that snogger  i aint going to forgit it i was a lowdown hound thats what i was said the man with energy i listened to what that link merwell had to say against you and i planned to do you all the harm i couldjest to please that fellow  hank you made a mistake to go over to merwell put in sid todd i dont like to hit at a fellow when hes hurted but ive got to speak my mind  well you are only telling the truth answered snogger shortly i know it as well as you do im going to quit merwell the first chance i git  dave and todd made snogger as comfortable as possible and the cowboy said he would be all right after he got his wind back then todd went off to locate roger and phil and apprise them of what had occurred  mr snogger id like to ask you a question said dave when the two were alone and the man was resting comfortably against a tree you look very much like a boy i and my friends met in chicago do you know the lad his name is charley gamp  charley gamp exclaimed the man and stared wildly at dave say what do you know about him  then you know him and now dave was deeply interested  do i know him he is my son  your son then where did the name gamp come from  gamp was his mothers name afore she married me tell me is he safe  yes and then dave related how he and the others had fallen in with charley at the postoffice  and link merwell was abusin himcallin him a thief cried hank snogger and his eyes commenced to blaze how did he dare why link merwell is a thief himself  a thief echoed dave  yes but let that pass nowill tell you later tell me of my boy my charley pleaded hank snogger  dave told all that he knew and the man listened eagerly then snogger told something of his lifes history how he and his wife had quarreled and how some neighbors had gotten them to separate he had drifted to the west and remained there for three years then he had gone back to look for his wife but had found out that she was dead he could get no trace of his little boy and finally had gone west again at first he had carried himself straight but presently he had gotten in with the wrong set and had drank and gambled and left mr endicott to go to work for mr merwell  but i am going to turn over a new leaf he said only let me find my boy ill show him what a good father i can be to him and his face took on a look of hope  and now i am going to tell you about link merwell went on hank snogger a little later i feel you ought to know for you are the one who has suffered most because of his doings you remember how your horses were stolen  yes  well link took em he says he didnt mean to steal em but that is what it amounted to he took em and while the storm was on some cattlethieves headed by andy andrews came along link says andrews and his gang took the horses away but i think link made a deal with the hossthieves for the next day i see link with a roll of bankbills and i know mr merwell didnt give him the money he had about two hundred dollars and i think he got the wad from andrewson his promise not to open his mouth  how did you learn this  i was out rounding up some stray steers and i saw him just before the storm with the hosses i wasnt near enough to talk to him but that night i spoke to him and he couldnt deny that he took em in the first place he was terribly afraid id give him away and he said if i did hed say i took em well you can believe me or not but he took em  i believe you answered dave and well have this matter sifted just as soon as we return to star ranch  it was some time ere todd roger and phil showed themselves in the meantime dave made snogger promise not to say anything about the stolen horses to the others  perhaps the matter can be fixed up between mr endicott and mr merwell he said it would be terrible to have link publicly branded as a horsethief  hank snogger had been out alone and he readily consented to join the others at their camp the two elk and the bear were brought in and it was decided to start back for the ranches the next morning  i must see mr endicott on important business said dave to sid todd and then in private he told his chums what he had heard concerning link merwell todd was told about charley gamp and said he hoped that the finding of the son would make a new man of snogger  the return to the ranches was begun at sunrise they carried with them the skin of the bear and also the pelts and heads of the elk they camped that night in the foothills and reached star ranch about noon the next day  i want you to come with me said dave to hank snogger after the boys had received a warm greeting from the girls and mrs endicott and he led the way to mr endicotts office a small affair located in the ranch home here the cowboy told his story once more just as he had related it to dave  i have suspected something of this sort all along said mr endicott one of our own men saw young merwell with some horses on that day but he was not sure if they were our animals andrews took the horses up into canada and sold them at several places so i dont think ill be able to get them back but if i can prove link guilty i shall most certainly hold his father responsible  hank snogger was anxious to go east to find his son but was persuaded to remain where he was until the young folks should bring their visit to an end in the meantime however a telegram was sent to charley and he sent one in return stating he would be glad to meet his parent  dave you can go with me to the merwell house said mr endicott the next day and you can go too snogger  the three set out and when within sight of the other ranch home they caught sight of link merwell riding slowly along on his pony he scowled as he recognized them  what do you want here he asked looking at dave  we came for our horses answered dave boldly  at these words link grew pale and shot a swift glance at hank snogger then in a sudden rage he shook his fist at the cowboy  what have you been saying about me he cried angrily  telling the truth answered snogger  its false i didnt touch the horses gasped link but he grew whiter than ever  you took them and you might as well confess said mr endicott sternly if you wont confess and get your father to square up ill call on the sheriff of this county to arrest you  iididnt meanthat isi commenced link and then he broke down completely he acknowledged that he had taken the horses but said he did it in fun then the cattlethieves had come along and taken the steeds from him  and you got paid for letting them go said mr endicott you got several hundred dollars from andrews  who saysays so faltered link  never mind well prove it answered the railroad president coldly  i only got seventyfive dollars shouted link ii didnt sell the horses andrews gave me that money becausebecause and then he stopped short not knowing how to go on  he gave you the money so you would keep silent said dave  we have heard enoughcome to the house said mr endicott and against his will link was made to accompany the others back to his home  mr merwell was met at the door and a bitter quarrel took place in his office lasting the best part of an hour at first the ranch owner would not believe his son was guilty but when he saw link break down he had to give in he said he would pay for the horses that had been stolen and also pay to have the whole matter hushed up  you cannot pay me for hushing the matter up said mr endicott i have no desire to ruin your sons future if you will pay for the horses that is all i askthat and one thing more i have no desire to live next door to a man who has a son who is a horsethief i understand that you have received a good offer for your ranch my advice is that you sell out  i will snapped mr merwell ill get out just as soon as the title can be passed i never liked to live here anyway and then in a rage he made out a check for the value of the horses handed it to mr endicott and showed his visitors to the door  phew but he was mad was daves comment as the three rode over to star ranch  if he sells out that is all i ask said mr endicott it may be added here that two weeks later mr merwell sold his place and moved to parts unknown taking his son with him the purchaser of the ranch proved to be an agreeable man and he and mr endicott got along very well together  well i hope that is the last of link merwell said roger when he heard about the affair but it was not the last of the fellow as dave later on found out link crossed his path again and what happened will be told in the next volume of this series to be called dave porter
